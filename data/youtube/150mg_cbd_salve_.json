{"QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and

joseph the realest and today i got a review uh well i got this free it's called the company's called tennessee i believe um it says patent pending so this is a 150 milligram um cbd hemp extract full spectrum salve um so this is a topical application five milligrams uh since five milligrams per use i guess 30 applications in a jar allows three minutes to longer before wiping hands so yeah this is i never really used any type of i use like a lotion that's supposed to help with the muscles and stuff like that so i didn't really know too much about this i asked the owner or whoever was the instagram uh about this product oh no actually before sorry let me tell you all the box real quick i didn't get to show you the box so this is the front oh actually now this is the front so yeah this is the product right here you don't want to pause and read that i can go ahead and do that and uh i guess this is the well they like it's a food or something um but yeah so it has this is uh one ounce so it says it's cbda and regular cbd and 100 yeah has 150 grams so this is the jar right here that it comes in so yeah i'm gonna open this up oh [ __ ] i forgot so yeah this is the the cream right here or topical uh i don't know what to call it really like i never use anything like this but you know what i just came back from vacation and i was working out and swimming and stuff like that and um i was having like a really bad pain on my leg i don't know if i pulled a muscle or something i'm not sure exactly like what it was like it was in pain where like every time i stretch i'm putting some on my leg right now um no it feels a little better from yesterday but it still has a little bit of you know a little bit of like every time i stretch out or you know stand up whatever he has a little pain um you know like i feel like i stretch the muscle or something i don't know too much about all that whatever but i really wanted to try out this i also want to give it to my mom because she has some like her muscles hurt i heard this like helps out with like pain um you put it straight on to whatever area that like you have um issues with kind of like you do with icy hot um but the cbd you know you have a back pain whatever like your muscles right here um but uh yeah i guess my first time actually using this type of a cream what do they want to call it a salve that's the main thing what it's called a salve never like i said i think i've heard some stuff about it never used it never really thought about buying it but um like i said it might be like icy hot don't quote me on that but um you know when you have like muscles and you put that on your skin this other company cbdology had something where you put you put like it's like a lotion and or cream and you put it on your area and it has like a little bit of menthol kind of like i guess it mimics like icy hot so it was my first time trying this i put on some and you do feel like a not like i see how but it feels like like a like a cool you know your my leg feels like cooler like it has like like a cool sensation like almost not like a man but like feels just i don't even know how to explain it whatever it just feels like a cooler feeling on my leg um yeah i'm definitely gonna like give this to my mom because she has back issues she got into an injury with her back and i gave that other criminal how much said it worked all right so this one seems like it's more um it has a little more cbd and um hopefully it works for her um on my leg right here i'm gonna let it sit in for a little bit so i can make it see if it does anything um let me see if it has a smell doesn't really have a smell it just smells like uh like a very light sense of like lotion type of smell and i rub it into my muscle right here because i did have some issues with my left upper leg so i'm hoping that it helps out um i know it's not going to cure and cure anything you know cbd you can't really um say that it cures or you know because it's not fda approved yet but um hopefully they do some research on the cbd um all the different you know benefits that it has whatever like because i don't see why not whatever like it's legal now so might as well study it and you know get the best out of it but um so far my leg it feels a little bit better like honestly like it really my leg was bothering me a lot or like i i really didn't want to feel like doing these reviews because my my leg was in pain um like i said it was worse yesterday but um hopefully this cream will relax my muscle and hopefully it gets better or unless it feels better um but yeah um definitely i'll leave the links down below for their instagram and their website so you have to try them out guys because definitely um i got this for free so you know i'm not sure if how many they gave away for free or if you could try it out or what but make sure to go check out their website or their instagram and they'll give you some details on that um yeah i definitely i i would i would want to recommend this whatever it seems like it's a legit company the product seems like it's uh very well made i like i like the jar that it comes in it really feels like a little icy hot type of feeling to it um but it you don't get that hot but you definitely get that cool but it doesn't feel like a man it just feels like it's just cool like i don't know but it feels good though i like it um but anyways guys i hope you enjoyed the video um i just want to do a quick review on this item that i got and um i was excited and uh curious to see like what it does and if i could recommend it to people and at first i was just like how am i gonna review this because like i didn't the thing was wrong with me i was just like um i literally was fine nothing was hurting me i guess uh i wouldn't say i got lucky because like i i really wasn't trying to get injured or i wasn't going to fake an injury just to try out this you know give a review on this product

pretty much everything that Western medicine has to offer the main cause of my pain is enemy tree osis basically my vagina in abdomen area lower back all of that good stuff hurt all the time but to be honest no surgery amount of yoga prescription pill anything that I've tried has helped me as much as CBD has all the products that I'm going to show you today are very high in CBD and have low to no THC so that I can go about my day without being stoned out of my gourd these are the products that I use every day the first one are these premium gel caps it's just 25 milligrams of CBD they helped me so much with getting an appetite because one of my biggest symptoms with endometriosis is constantly feeling sick to my stomach nauseous never wanting to eat next up I have this paper pen from select CBD the reason I really like select is because they have peppermint flavor that for me helps me a lot like I said I'm nauseous a lot so getting this like quick ingestion with a little peppermint flare where I don't have to have the oil in my mouth is like all I can ask for this is called mad ritual it's just a little balm that I use specifically on my abdomen and lower back it doesn't feel as heavy as other bombs and some lotions that I've tried either like and you don't need to use very much of it which is great because some of these bombs can be pretty pricey these are called basic suppositories so it's a CBD suppository if you don't know what a suppository is it's like this little thing of CBD that I put directly into my vagina so it goes right to the problem area during my period or when I'm having a particularly bad in Demetrios this flare this is kind of specific to endometriosis but I had to include them because half the population has periods this is a lotion that I loved from sagely it's just it's called relief in recovery which is why I started trying it because anything that says relief I really like what I love about sagely products is that they smell very natural and they have pretty good ingredients in them and they also go on non greasy very white and they smell nice so it's kind of like you're just putting on like your daily lotion but you're getting pain relief or benefits from it this is another good option for anti-inflammatory lotion this is a really great option for just a day to day especially if you're like me and you're like typing or on your phone all the time I use this a lot on my wrist to kind of help relieve this is just a simple basic CBD tincture I don't really like tinctures because I don't like putting oil directly into my mouth I'm just it's a weird texture thing for me so this one I mix with a drink and do it that way this has taken me a couple of years to figure out what works for me and unfortunately with CBD it is a lot of trial and error but for me all of that trial and error has been a hundred percent worth it because now I use it every day I really look forward to the day when CBD is as commonly used as aspirin because I I truly believe in it and I truly believe in its effects and I think it could help a lot of people", "vBpEXUoB8GQ": "hey what's up tubers welcome back thank you guys so much for tuning into today's video I am so sorry about my voice I'm just now getting over being sick and I'm finally getting my voice back but it's still a little bit scratchy so please try to ignore it I'm so freaking excited for today's video because we are gonna be discussing and testing out the latest health trend CBD hemp is a type of cannabis plant that contains a chemical called CBD it doesn't make you high like marijuana but it is creating a national buzz CBD CBD CBD sprouting up everywhere and in everything to put a simply CBD is a component of the cannabis plant with enormous healing potential you can get the benefits of CBD in so many different forms like oils edibles coffee even skin care and so many more now I personally found out about CBD last year whenever I broke my wrist snowboarding I'm sure you guys already know the story with that but after my surgery the doctors prescribed me some really hard drugs to help me cope with the pain and even though the pain was so unbearable I could not stand the side effects of the drugs so I had to start doing some research into more natural ways of relieving my chronic pain and I came across CBD oils and I've been using them ever since it's really cool because it helps you with so many other things like relieving stress anxiety migraines and it even improves my sleep when I first thought I'm doing a video like this I was just gonna use CBD oil for a whole week and kind of see what it does but since I already have a really positive experience using CBD oils I wanted to dive in into a different way of using CBD without actually ingesting it so in this video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys my experience of using a CBD cream for a whole week now there are so many different CBD brands out there and it's kind of hard to find one that you can truly trust that is organically grown the most trusted brand I've tried so far is premium Jane they provide some of the most purest safest and most effective products in the industry they are sourced from a hundred percent or grown Oregon hemp which if you didn't know I live in Oregon and we're kind of known to grow some of the best hemp out there anyways I'll be using this CBD topical solve from premium Jane you can call it assault and pointman a cream whatever I think I was gonna go with the cream it's much easier for me to say but this contains 1500 milligrams of CBD and it has some other really incredible ingredients like eucalyptus essential oil Joba oil argan oil emu oil grapeseed oil Omega 3 and 6 oils soy protein hibiscus flower extract neem leaf extract lemongrass extract chamomile extract aloe vera extract and cocoa butter these are all-natural and very powerful ingredients and I'm kind of excited to see what it can do to my skin so I started applying this every single day on my face and on my wrist [Music] I have a metal plate and screws in there that's holding the bone together and since I live in Oregon this time of year it gets super cold and the aching pain in my wrist gets so bad this cream is pretty powerful as a high dose of CBD so as soon as I started rubbing this on my wrist I kid you not the aching pain went away almost immediately and I do use CBD oils for this kind of pain but that takes a little bit longer to kick in it was really insane to me that I got immediate relief whenever I applied this cream now I didn't really see much of a difference in my skin other than some of the redness and breakouts were definitely reduced and my skin did feel a lot more hydrated and supple but I did notice a huge improvement in my lips I have this terrible habit of biting my lips and I would get these little pieces of broken skin on the outer corners of my lips because you know I feel like this oh well all of that is completely healed from just using this for one week and then that whole eyelash extension thing happened I just got out of the shower and I'm so embarrassed to share this with you guys but I have to because I am convinced this is a miracle CBD cream last night I was washing my face my eyelash extensions were kind of in the way and I don't know where I just started like pulling them out and not just the lash extensions but my real lashes too because you know the extensions is stuck to the lashes whoo I literally pulled out so many of my lashes I barely have any on oh so my eyes swole up they were so red so inflamed they were burning so much pain so what do I do I take the CBD bomb and I started applying it all over my eyelids and almost immediately the inflammation started going down and it felt so soothing this especially it was so bad like you could still kind of see the redness and the puffiness but I was shocked at how quickly the CBD balm work the next morning I woke up my eyes were not swollen anymore they look good again except for this one damn I still feel really dumb for pulling out my eyelashes but it happened I'm so glad I had something like this on hand to help treat it oh another thing my daughter brought her fingers she was trying to help me cook and she accidentally touched the pan and had a little burn around her fingers what did I do I put this on in a couple seconds and the pain went away so good stuff overall I experienced many benefits using this cream I think this is something every household should have just in case of an emergency like I mentioned this helps treat my daughter's minor burn better than anything else I'm blown away with the benefits I've received just by using it for one week I love this little jar of magical healing cream and will continue to use it every single day I've already ordered a couple more jars to stock up just in case I run out if you're wanting to get your hands on this you know where to find it I will also leave the link down below I really enjoyed filming this video for you guys I hope you found it helpful if you're feeling generous today please subscribe I'd love to have you be a part of my channel and I cannot wait to see you in my next video bye [Music]", "xAW6oB6E4fQ": "hey everyone I'm Shireen kasam the founder of my pain center calm the number one CVD resource for you to try and buy CBD okay what I want to talk to you about today is I get a lot of questions Shireen there's so many different CBD balms and muscle relaxants or muscle lotions out there which one should I get and that is true there are so many different types of CD CBD bombs out there that you have to make sure you pick the right one because you could spend 30 50 60 dollars on something that's not gonna work for you so how do you know what's the right one well one do your research and you can research all the products at my pain center calm we kind of break down what to look for in a product and what are the top things that our products have to check how much CBD is in the bottle and what's the size of the bottle so let's we're gonna get into that in a minute and then third just make sure that the the product has a certificate of analysis make sure that it's the correct amount of CBD that they're selling to you make sure it's not fake you know like a lot of people can now just put CBD stickers on their products so make sure you're buying your product from a reliable source such as my pain center calm we've spent over ten thousand dollars trying CBD products to make sure that we sell products to you that we really believe in that we actually use so like my mom has arthritis I have sciatica my dad has a torn rotator cuff as well as herniated discs my boyfriend is a firefighter so he's always sore and in pain and so we've only used we are only suggesting products to you that we truly truly believe in one of our favorite products is this green rose product is a muscle and joint and relief cream now here's what I was talking about about size okay this is a 1 ounce jar this whole thing is 1 ounce and there's a hundred and 15 milligrams of CBD in it that means the whole thing has 150 milligrams of CBD not every time you use it is it 150 milligrams of CBD so when I say it's a hundred and fifty milligrams per 1 ounce that is the same thing as somebody saying this jar has 300 milligrams in it and it's 2 ounces or this jar has 450 milligrams in it but it's three ounces do you see how it's all the same so technically only the price should be going up somebody shouldn't say to you that the the jar with 300 milligrams that's 2 ounces is any stronger than this one because it's kind of it's the concentration like it's all about the concentration so this one is actually one of my favorite products my mom uses this one for her arthritis on her hands I will use this on my sciatica it's a really cool application it's just a pump so it's it's clean it's easy to use and just pump it on there another one of my favorite products is this one which is a green roach product as well it's a muscle and joint but it's got heat relief in it now this one is two hundred and fifty milligrams for three ounces so it's a little bit less CBD than this one but here are the pros about this one this one I love especially at night this is one of my go-to that night because usually like I've brushed my teeth like I've showered I'm in bed I'm ready to go to bed and then my leg starts to hurt right the flare-ups start to happen either because you're laying down on your herniated disc or now your brain is kind of it's not worried about the day-to-day things you're doing so now your brain has time to focus on the pain so what I love about this one is it's a roll-on like literally it's just a roll-on and the great thing about that is you don't have to rub it and you can if you want to but you don't have to rub it in and it's got the heat relief so if you live in if you like that that feeling of like it's working for you it's great but I love it because I can just roll it on me and go to sleep like I don't have to get back out of bed to wash my hands so I love this product this one is my favorite personally because again I don't have to dirty my hands a new product that we recently started carrying is this active fit recovery and massage gel and this is great if you work out a lot if you're an athlete if you're in the gym a lot if you're if you're just putting a lot of stress on your body and your muscles tend to hurt or you've got shin splints or just sore muscles I tend to put it on before I work out if I'm gonna have a really hard workout and then after I work out after I shower but I've started using it at night too before bed because I have been working a lot out a lot and so my muscles tend to be really tight and really sore and this is a great one because this is just a this is a tub you kind of just put your fingers in it and you take what you want and apply it and then that's it and it's got its got like a menthol cooling effect to it so I really like this product too especially if you are a gym before you're starting for me I'm starting to get back into exercising so I'm I'm really aggravating my body and all the muscles as that are already in pain and all the herniated discs that I shouldn't be aggravating so this has been really useful and then my final product that I really love is Khoi healing balm and why do I love this product cuz one it's so small and compact I keep this in my backpack so it's with me at all times it's always it's always within hands reach it's kind of like having chapstick in your pocket keep this on me it's just a little balm love it like if you're just if you just get a flare-up at work sometimes I get tension headaches at work or my neck starts to hurt because I'm on the computer a lot or I start to get carpal tunnel right in my hand right here in my arm right here I can just pull it out and rub it on there it's got like a it's got like a eucalyptus smell to it so it's not overpoweringly menthol but it's got all these essential oils in it instead so I love this one just to keep in my back pocket so those are the four products that we carry and drop your questions down below and we'll get to them thank you so much for paying take that thank you so much for watching oh I need to see video me", "b04qWvyoyxo": "[Music] hi guys it's Brandi from green wellness life again today today in fact we would chat a little bit about topicals I've got two brand-new topicals coming out from ab annoyed botanicals that I'm pretty excited about and I do get a lot of questions on the skincare products so I thought we could just talk through a couple of them today and I'll let you know what I think so first up let's talk about face serums with the new topical from AB annoyed I have two different options for facial serums the first one is from made by hand and it's been my go-to for well over a year now it is a nice thick serum there's 100 milligrams of CBD in this bottle so we know that CBD is awesome for neutralizing our insides this is going to help us neutralize our outsides as well have oil and CBD are considered to be skin normalizer so that should if you're more dry or more oily this should help you get back to that middle range which is what most of us are going for I know I am especially so this one is nice and thick when you shake it up and pull it out it kind of looks like honey there is actually honey that is in the formula and I usually apply it by putting it on the back of my hand I always put it on my left hand which means that my left hand is significantly softer than the back of my right hand but this you can just take it and rub right into your skin I do actually already have makeup on so I'm going all over makeup which is weird but hey it's effective this one is super super thick I am in Michigan so Michigan in the winter especially right now not super awesome so this is perfect for wintertime skin a nice thick serum I do also put it sometimes in the cuticles and my fingers and then the ends of my hair cuz I get that crazy dry staticky yuck and I found that the oil tones those down as well um so let's compare that to the new guy from Avenue D I have been lucky enough to be a beta tester on this product for the past couple months I've been using it for a little bit this still has 100 milligrams of CBD so same see me content this one is in a spray pump top versus that dropper top matter of personal preference the dropper top since I've been using that for a while like I'm telling you I've definitely knocked it over and spilled it especially if I'm hasty in it don't screw the top on as well as I should so dropper talks a little nicer that way haven't yet gotten down to the bottom of my bottle but it looks like it winds around so I should be able to get everything out if by some chance there's a little bit left in here that the dropper top can't pull out I would always just unscrew the top and use it that way so this guy sprayed top still shake it up a little bit squirt it into your hand you're going to find I can't really get a good angle on that can I you're gonna find that it's not quite as thick so this I think is awesome for me personally for fall and for for summertime because it is a little bit lighter for your skin and again I'm the goofy one who puts it in my hair and let my fingernails as well right now I'm actually using both of these as part of my routine I'm using the thicker one at night and the a monoid later serum in the morning so I am using it twice a day that's working really well for me personally so same amount of CBD different top and then there are different additional herbs this guy has orange oil he's got honey and rose hip in there this one has a really more herbs and different ones as well we've got blue chamomile we've got mango butter patchouli jasmine cinnamon mark vanilla bean so all kinds of fun herbs in here really good stuff both of them both of them are going to be that oil base that 100 milligrams of CBD so really good stuff for your skin the other item that I wanted to chat about a little bit is the me buddy haven't muscle in joint South this one's almost gone because it is my husband's absolute favorite thing he puts on every morning on his feet and on his knees it does last him a good long time it's a really thick salve when you open it up it's sort of a green color from that hump and it's easy to get out just a little bit right on the end so if you've got sore knees feet anything like that this maid might have staff has been my go-to for quite a while Abbe annoyed has launched a salve as well I'm still gonna be in a little tin that you can open up and just get to work on these this guy is a hundred milligrams of CVD in the tin two M's tin the new AB annoyed version is 150 and it's got some different herbs in there as well I have actually not tried that out yeah so I'm looking forward to giving it a shot and seeing what I think again 50% more CBD and the retail price on it is actually the same so there's there's a benefit they're made by hump does have peppermint and lavender which for me personally work really nicely with that CBD and I see a benefit there one thing to keep in mind is any time you're putting CBD on your skin it's this stuff is not getting down into your bloodstream so I have lots of customers that ask is it okay to use a topical level and use a CBD that I'm eating and taking internally and the Internet is yes absolutely personally I take a tincture every day and I use these products on my skin every day I do also vape that's something that I do as part of my personal routine just if I'm having a bad day or I'm stressed out in an in a little bit of a boost then all day pose well but a tincture is generally my go-to along with these skin products so I'm always here you can email call any questions that you've got I'm happy to help I hope that it was a little bit helpful to get an idea of these products thanks so much [Music] you", "cFkATLe5J3A": "so as you may or may not know CBD oil has gotten tons of positive reviews in the marketplace due to its ability to induce relaxation instead of the high filling however there is limited information about the appropriate dosage for once use and it has been challenging to settle on definite quantity of CBD CBD that a person can take since the substance that interacts with the anti endocannabinoid system receptors meaning that it plays a role in the secretion of the hormones that are related to our response to stress so this system it changes one's psychology changes so physiological changes sorry so the dosage it's gonna vary depending on the CBD concentration the weight of the user and just his or her own body chemistry so I did do a little digging and this is what I found the current measure that's recommended by many of the CBD experts is that we take one to six milligrams of CBD for every ten pounds so this measure it actually applies at a 220 pound individual can comfortably take twenty to thirty milligrams of CBD while a 165 pound person can completely do can-can comfortably do with ten to twenty milligrams these measurements are just what works for a majority of individuals it's not does it mean that that's the scale so you never know until you try and I remember the first time my friend introduced me to try CBD started at 50 milligrams a day and I had no problem with it I felt a little drowsy I had a little bit of dry mouth at the same quantity so you need to just experiment until you find what's comfortable for your body and the other requirement is that you take they say take CBD twice a day for better results so a 220-pound err will take 10 to 15 milligrams in the morning in the same quantity at bedtime so you should this quantity when you're first starting out on seat with CBD just to kind of have a consistency for the best results however after a month or two of usage you can actually double its insure and no strong with me endo cannabinoid receptors will have adapted to the effects of CBD and this was just some research that I that I found you can find it to the experts in the field actually recommend that daily dose should should not exceed two hundred milligrams but you know you might be having questions about whether there there's a difference between the percentage of the CBD and its measure in milligram and these dosage recommendations are actually measured in milligrams since many CBD oils they are naturally extracted so that means they're a hundred percent pure so to start with twenty milligrams CBD per day and see how that works for you also you know consult with your doctor if you feel better about it and see what he or she would recommend for you and and also I really think that it depends on why you're using CBD and this is just my opinion I think that if you're using it maybe for some sort of physical pain then I think that you would need to take maybe more but if you're you but if you're using it for some sort of anxiety take less I don't know I usually I take mine specifically for anxiety and my boyfriend takes it for sleep and to have an extra pep in his day and also I know a few people that have taken it for headaches for for elements for for pain of physical physical pain so like I said I'll do some other videos on different reasons that CBD oil is taken for what reasons like I did another video on the my anxiety that I have and the reason that I take CBD for it and then when I'm sleep and then I'm going to cover another one on migraines headaches because it works amazing for that and yeah so share comment like if you take CBD oil let me know in the comments below how much you take what you take it for how much you weigh what you would recommend and or if you have a doctor that recommended how much you should take then just let me know in the comments below and I will see you guys on the next video bye", "oi_av7KN0eE": "hey guys Rebecca from elements so I'm gonna do a demo of my cannibals here which are great for pain and muscle relaxation so in this recipe I put liquid my liquid THC CBD cannabis medicated oil in the bath bomb itself and then of course I have the dollop of solid south in the middle and you will see it you can actually see it on the top here that was the liquid oil in the bath bomb itself and then the dollar will be dispersing you can see the dollop right here you see that so it's gonna disperse you can see it dispersing and it will float on the top mm-hmm and what you do is you soak for 20 minutes and when you rinse off you just rinse off with clean water you don't want to wash it off with soap and these do come with epsom salts because that's part of the treatment it all works together to help open the pores so yeah you just soak for 20 minutes and as hot a water as you can stand it for two reasons one is to melt the butters and the oils and two is to open the pores for maximum benefits of absorptions for muscle and back pain and it's great for soothing eczema and whatnot so they're pretty potent as far as smelling like cannabis I do add some really nice smelling fragrances kind of earthy to try and mask the smell these are not what a lot of people are selling as cannibals where they just use a a hemp oil and pass it off as something special when the truth of the matter is hemp oil is not anything spectacular it does have amazing fatty acids and some proteins and whatnot it's great for cooking it doesn't last long as far as shelf-life but yeah a lot of people unfortunately are putting hemp oil which you can buy at any grocery store across the nation in the cooking section it's it's and claiming that it's something that it's not these have approximately 150 milligrams of THC with 11.7 CVD in them they are true medicated canna bombs but yeah it just saddens me because I know a lot of desperate people who have you know not knowing what they're buying bought something called a can of um or even oils and not understanding that hemp oil and cannabis oil are two completely entirely separate things so you just got to be careful when when you're searching for alternative cannabis medicines as such because a lot of people who are seeking help out of desperation being in severe pain or whatever lose faith in cannabis products because the stuff they bought did absolutely nothing because it's literally snake oil and it's just quite sad so anyways so that's it and it turns the bath water I'm a pretty green you can see all that oils and you just massage it all over your body maybe you have your partner come in and massage it into your shoulder in your back and whatnot and it does they all come with a garnished bud flower on the top with some Himalayan pink sea salt and no I mean yeah it is a bud flower but I wouldn't smoke it because it's been contaminated by the citric acid and baking soda it's just for decoration so I would just pull it off or it'll just you know go in the bath then you can just pull it out like this alright guys I showed talk to you later I just wanted to do a demo there is milk powder in them but they there's so much oil that it's not really going a bubble bath or say it does like such but it doesn't like bubble bubble because I'm not adding I didn't add cocoa B or anything it's it's just powder and as you can see the cannabis oil floats to the top so all right guys I love you and I will talk to you later bye", "hdXwuWTXpJI": "welcome back you're live with xpresso now if you've walked around your local health store or pharmacy recently you may have noticed CBD based products taking up space on many of the shelves out there and and it's happening quite quickly and whilst we've heard that the health properties are very beneficial there still remains a slight misconception of what exactly CBD is in fact and what its use is so you had to tell us everything that we need to know is Shawn Willard there was of course a pharmacist and National Training Manager for relief of pharmaceuticals Shawn welcome back you thanks Liz great and Peter you we have actually touched on this before but it's become such a hot topic at the moment CBD oil and cement based products definitely a crazy at the moment may be a good place to start is what CBD is yeah so so CBD stands for cannabidiol which is just a cannabinoid it's it's really a plant chemical a chemical compound found in cannabis plant so we call it a fighter cannabinoid coming from the plants but we also have endocannabinoids we our body will say has our own cannabinoids as well so the most well-known of those is probably the CBD right now and also THC tetrahydrocannabinol a lot of people know about the THC okay so you've mentioned you know the two variants that are there at the moment from hemp from marijuana how do we derive the CBD yes sir CBD and THC it's quite interesting for all that chemistry buffs out there the the CBD and the THC actually have the same chemical formula but a different chemical structure and so although the CBD is predominantly found in the hemp and the THC the Dom be found in the marijuana you they both come from the cannabis plant which is quite interested is different cannabis varieties but bringing up those the CBD and THC then what are the different effects or uses of the tooth yeah so you find that the THC as we know it content to form a little bit of a high whereas the CBD doesn't find you don't experience that high as much same beneficial effects as what you had over the THC but far more in terms of safe if you could call it out there per spec that we work on it over the concert yeah so are you then confirming now that CBD is not gonna get you high you take a product with CBD specifically in it absolutely said yeah because the THC it binds to certain receptors in the brain gram sir cb1 receptors which can cause that high the that's the THC the CBD does not do that it in fact it actually almost as a counter effect in the way which it interacts with those those receptors so all the people out there that are buying CBD and pure CBD products remember there's gonna be other products on the market that might have traces of THC we can't speak for that but pure CBD products will not get you high what are some of the health benefits of CBD so let's see a CBDs been around for such a long time and I suppose there's a lot of what anecdotal evidence out there everyone says this helped my thing that whatever you can't make any claims with regard to curing treaty number two getting a disease what we can say is that it helps for the benefits and relief symptoms related to things like pain and inflammation or sleeplessness anxiousness and restlessness so I would think a lot of people out there would just use CBD just for health maintenance I'm just for overall health maintenance we're gonna delve a little deeper into what are some of those that benefits that don't go anywhere we're going to continue the conversation with Sean we are speaking specifically about CBD and some of the misconceptions that have been going around social media at the moment we know it's such a hot talking topic but there are some major health benefits involved so if you're interested stick around", "PRlGwJI72UU": "[Music] so again pure hemp and this is arnica and rosemary self this is really good if you have any bruises I really love it if I'm like moving or just worked out how to cruise it feels really nice and it smells like rosemary which is amazing it feels nice it looks discreet it doesn't look crazy it looks like arnica I like this", "myoKSkNptVY": "hey it's Kiki today I'm gonna be reviewing mine right CBT South I've tried other CPD selves before CBD stop actually cured my eczema when conventional treatment could not the dermatologist kept giving me all these harsh steroid creams but my eczema kept coming back then I put a CBD stop on it and my eczema has never come back it was totally cured so if you have any sort of eczema or skin rash CBT Salvas always worth a try because you never know it could always help you - I really like my great CBD so because it also contains of different butters and oils that can also help with your skin I also like it because it's primarily used for muscle pain relief I love exercising and I love stretching and it's a good thing when your muscles hurt afterwards because that means you are making progress that pain is actually tiny tears in the muscle which then heals and builds it up stronger so steve80 cell can actually help relieve some of this muscle pain it doesn't make the workout less effective actually makes it more effective because it enables you to bear more of it but even if you don't have a skin rash or muscle pain I still recommend mine right CBD cell I know everyone's hands are all dried out now from all the hand washing and hand sanitizing but my hands have never been so soft because I've been using the CBD sob on my hands I've heard it said that you can tell a person's age by their hands so keeping your hands hydrated and soft is going to make you look a lot younger so get yourself some of the CBD sap you can use my coupon code kiki that's cake okay I for 15% off", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "sjITVewsEy4": "hi everyone its Meg Nordmann with household hemp your trusted source for all things CBD where I will be giving you reviews every week on a new product we've got about 30 products slated right now to start giving you reviews on and the first one I want to talk about is indica this is their wrong and boil it was the first oil that I tried and it's what started me down the rabbit hole of starting household him actually I loved it so much I had my first drop of CBD oil and my best sleep that it had in two and a half years and so I reached out to the company with my idea for household ham we made some great friends and they sent me some more products to try and first here's the robbing of oil and this is about just so that how much I personally take and I started off with even smaller amount than that and eventually increased and lock down my sweet spot and that's about how much I need four really great nicely it's my anxiety which we know all the moms need help with and then my second favorite thing which was probably tied as a first favorite if you have the money just getting both of them and you'll thank me is their South here and all of their ingredients are natural you can recognize them all it's the CBD coconut oil beeswax lemon oil citral vanilla and buy money nothing with red flags there you can see hopefully here you can see where I've just been dipping my finger into the same spot and I treat this thing like medicine for myself it is 750 milligrams and it is just an oily nough swen you rub it it's just an opening this on your finger my neck always has tension I don't wanna waste it and since it doesn't spread very far I mean the willingness just is like right where your finger rubs I just put it on the most acute spot and then what I like to do is pair it up there whipped body butter so this one has more it's very very faint lemon / vanilla ingredients and this one is a little bit more like cocoa and it spreads much easier as you can see I just got a whole dollop on mine and it's a little bit more firm if you keep it in the frigerator but it is literally 82 degrees in my house right now cuz i live in florida and i like to keep the windows open so anyway this I liked on top of whatever location I've put the South cuz it just spreads so much easier and so in about 20 minutes the tension in my neck is going to be gone I put this on joint pains muscle pains and it's been clinically proven CBD to be really great for skin and that's what they market face-forward is actually a foreskin and I have used it for my child's eczema my toddler had horrible eczema from four months old until two and a half years old but yeah so I put this out on the worst spots of her eczema and then rubbed body butter on top within 24 hours it was gone after spending probably hundreds of dollars on steroid creams and every kind of eczema cream you could imagine my friends made essential oil creams nothing really worked some things would like reduce the flare but not like what this DVD did it's completely gone so I have before and after pictures of that on my blog and household and the ingredients here very similar let's see shea butter palm oil cocoa seed butter the CBD coconut oil tapioca vanilla beeswax and find me again all very natural and trusted ingredients and then you've got the lip balm which is very similar ingredients to this almost identical and so it's really just that's in this convenient format you can drop it in your makeup bag oh here's a little fara she was tired of being alone in her Walker so yeah so talking about the lip balm here and with CBD being so amazing for your skin you can imagine you're just like it was just amazing how supple and soft your lips are after that the next thing is the chewing gum here let me open that up for you so let's see what that looks like paper and it's made with real gum like from the tree in the rainforest Chiclets gum from the rainforest xylitol from birch trees wild peppermint mint sunflower seeds and hemp oil so again all natural ingredients and everything is organic they they grow their own hemp on organic certified land their whole facility is organic certified I hope I'm saying that correctly and their third party lab tested and they have their certificates on their website call all the labs and actually talk to them about it and so I just this is one of the brands that I just trust the most and that's for the gum it is like what our grandparents probably chewed it's not like the kind of gum that you would pick up in fancy wild colors at the gas station or at the checkout line it is real gum so after about 20 to 30 minutes of chewing it it kind of starts to break down and just and spit that out if you try to take it out with your fingers it's gonna stick to your fingers again and that's not a bad thing I'm just setting up your expectations and because it is real gum and the reason for putting CBD and a gum is because of that bioavailability so you know I talked about putting this beneath your tongue because it's so thin on the sides of your cheeks and underneath your tongue the CBD can just soak right in and so this is just the gum while you're chewing I'm not gonna chew on one video that's gross but oh you're chewing that CBD is just in all of the right places and so it's just going to soak into you immediately and that would be a great way to get the effects that you're looking for the therapeutic effects as quick as possible so I've had a couple of very anxious days we're here I've never been very glad to have this sitting on my bookshelf yeah chewed my gum the last thing is the CBD crystals this is the one thing I have not actually tried yet I plan on doing a separate video I'm gonna try it because it's just pure CBD it's 99% CBD isolate a bit and show you this package here can't really reach with the baby in my arm looks like makeup it's very pretty packaging and if you could see in the bottom then it's like kind of like white salt anyway so anyway you can make anything with this and uni CBD thing that you want to make you make your own salad your own oil your own bombs you can just get really creative with that fine so excited about it I am planning on doing gummy bears I want to that makes me becoming bears at home so stay tuned for that video 5 stars Holocaust for this one everything has worked and exceeded my expectations truly I'm so glad that I was introduced to CVD through indica first I think it's set up quite a good bar to compare other brands to and if you want to see the floor of you head over to my blog about before and after pictures for everything I've used it for from scalp issues to eczema issues to stuff on my face on my dog diaper rash oops and so it's been pretty amazing and I have got a very lengthy detailed blog about it if you have any questions please let me know you can DM me on

next week and we'll talk soon", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also

it out ski bd", "BainCSykbQk": "good afternoon ladies and gentlemen my name is callum we're down here at the vaporvolt woodford branch and today i have a box of goodies from vaporesso i am trying to hide my address and i'm not quite sure what's actually in here today so instead of doing the usual vaporoso product review let me show you what's inside this box now i've got my trusty knife this doesn't leave me when i'm in the store and that is just in case we have thieves i will cut them so inside the box let's see what we've got okay okay we have got some gtx coils which i do use myself so that's nice but this is some kind of stand here wow and there's a device inside so this looks like a vaporesso presentation stand of kind which i'm going to put together later and probably put the vapor so devices that i've been reviewing up on these and you can test them if you bring your own mouthpiece or use the alcohol wipes you can get hands-on with the vape processor devices and this has been hugely helpful for you to work out whether or not you think it's comfortable so we've had a few customers quite enjoy being able to get hands-on with that and what's this this one right here is the vaporesso gt x1 kit so it's going to use these gt coils and i'm guessing they're going here this device i believe is rechargeable it's got a built-in 2000 mah battery but today we're not going to review this no we are not because i have to review this this this is the vaporesso x-ross it's been in store for about a week now and if that customer knocks on the door i will pause the video serve him and come back there's someone hanging around outside which is why i put this in my pocket it's extremely worrying when we have maybe three or four hooded up kids wearing tracksuits trainers tracks with bottoms around their waist and they're just standing outside looking in and there's one of me four of them yeah i'm dealing with that right now so let's carry on with the video today i'm going to use this device for cbd and that ties in very well with the new brand of cbd we've just got in so after i go over the device let's talk about the flavor i'm going to use today this is the vaporesso x-ross i have dimensions on the back would you like to hear them it's 112 by 23 by 13 millimeters i'm guessing it's 112 in height 23 wide and 13 the other way 23 wide and 13 in depth but we'll take a look in just a second because it's got a mesh coil that is 1.2 ohms let's check it out oh this is sealed very well and i am unable to break the packaging the heat shrink is very strong on this one but we're inside and i'm quite excited to use a new device for the cbd i've been using cbd products for about a month now to help me with my stress anxiety and i tell you something the new brand works wonders so keeping it about the product in hand which is the vaporesso x-ross it is a pod style that uses the gtx coils this is a pristine piece of packaging just here look at this what's this vaporesso limited warranty card remember folks your warranty is limited paper so xross user manual a couple of pages there's stuff falling out a couple pages here we have information on how to fill the pod i have anti-counterfeiting label instructions so they're really going all out now to make sure people are not forging uh not making clones of these devices and forging the paperwork inside the box there is a pod there is two pods these are proper pods these are pods that are pods not pods that take coils so this is a pod device this is how it works this is not really a pod device this has a removable coil this is a tank this is a not a pod device this is a pod that you refill and throw away this is a pod device this is what i want for cbd and i've been waiting a little while so i like big clouds so i'm going to use the higher ohm i'm going to use the lower ohm first because i know that's what you want to see so i will use the 1.2 ohm mesh pod and i will have spare the 0.8 ohm mesh pod this is the device i love vaporesso's braided charger cables it is also a usb c style these braided cables are just amazing very good quality underneath the packaging we have no hidden bits there's also not a silica gel pack in here it's the only thing it's missing oh this silver if you're worried of fingerprints this silver is not for you there is fingerprints all over it and i don't think they're mine but this is a nice square device it reminds me of something i've seen before for sure oh adjustable airflow on the back there so on the back of the device there is adjustable airflow it moves in a gradient style and it's quite stiff to turn it's a little bit of a fatter jewel and i'm impressed i'm always impressed when somebody rips off jaw so let's use the 0.8 ohm let's use the 1.2 ohm mesh coil and let's grab some cbd i'll be back in a sec for the life of me ladies and gentlemen i cannot end at this video i've made so many mistakes so many trip ups and i've side tracked about how good my sleeping pattern is so let's bring it back what have we got we have got a lovely silver x-ross from vaporesso it is usb's just pseudo it is usbc charging and on the back is the adjustable airflow it heavily reminds me of a dual device but it is a lot thicker and it has a button this device comes with two pods a 1.2 ohm pod and a 0.8 ohm pod let's check it out both of them have saturated and this is the 0.8 ohm pod let's start off with a quick inhale now that is with the airflow and wider open because i'm used to my direct lung inhales and i'm gonna try it so that was a long mouth delunging how can we direct lung inhale we can't that was stress on my lungs you would get clouds but it was painful this is a mouth to lung inhaled device do not try to cheat the system mouth to lung don't cheat so secondary on the agenda today we're going to talk about the cbd product that i've just put in this vape because i quickly realized it was a mouth to lung inhale i thought what better time than to try out the new sun state hemp cbd we've got in store now this is 150 milligrams which means no matter how much i vape it i can still drive because cbd is completely legal and there's a bit of a gray area with the buds but cbd itself is completely legal it doesn't contain any thc the only reason other stuff is illegal is because it contains thc they've taken this all out but left the cbd here it is gelato flavor now when i've read gelato flavour i was expecting mixed ice cream the strawberry chocolate and vanilla kind not quite sure where i went wrong because this tastes like terpenes so it should say and it does say i didn't read the box properly on there it says gelato terpene formula it's terpenes which is where the flavouring comes from so that was my bad completely i expected ice cream and i got terpenes if you don't know what terpenes are i'm going to describe them as a close flavor of the cannabis terpenes is a description of a flavor similar to cannabis to me anyway if i find that's different i'll do a huge video and tell you maybe i will do a huge video about cbd because cbd has helped me through one of the worst times in my life i was heavily suffering from stress and anxiety and i turned to the products of cbd now i eat the gummy bears and admittedly i eat about a pack a day they're not that high in strength but they just keep me on a level throughout the day i don't get stressed anymore i think it's brilliant i also sleep really good i get about 10 hours sleep a night and that solid uninterrupt that is solid uninterrupted sleep i mean i go to bed at 10 and then i wait no i don't i go to bed at 12 and i wake up at nine to get the shop open for 10. during lockdown i wasn't getting up until 10 and opening the shop at 12. i was getting 12 hours sleep like that was dangerous now i'm back trying to reduce it to eight hours sleep so i can get up at nine and then get in to the shop at 10. the cbd has helped with that greatly so much so so much so so today we're going to talk about the gelato 150 strength in this pod to use cbd i do recommend a mouth to lung pod this one works really well take a look because it's a mouth to lung pod i cannot direct lung inhale it which means i must mouth to lung inhale it and hold it for a couple seconds before exhaling and that is how to use cbd if you want more of a sleepy effect hold your breath for longer do not exceed holding your breath for more than six seconds five seconds is the limit that i can recommend you hold your breath that's it five seconds and this will put you to sleep within about five to ten minutes doesn't matter what strength is the breathing technique that is helping there but the higher strength you use the more sleepy and the quicker you will get cbd does make you drowsy please do not use it and then drive i want you to use this only in the evenings when you cannot sleep once you have got used to that and you want to reduce stress anxiety and back pain in the morning only after two weeks of practicing and seeing how you feel when you wake up can you use it in the morning especially before driving we have other products that you can use and then carry on driving so this vape from vaporesso the x-rocks is definitely a mouth to lung device it's 800 mile battery which will last you four hours the battery is not big the battery will last you about four hours please remember your charger if you're taking this to work nothing worse than your battery die in not being able to charge it stressing out and going to buy cigarettes that's why you feel the need for cigarettes because you panic and you stress don't do that just bring your charger you can use it while it's on charge as well to fill this pod it's a little bit different to other pods for a little while i was looking underneath now because it is top filling there will never be any leaking there which is brilliant how'd you do it i found it fell off one way so it goes on this way it pulls off that way did i turn it huh so the mouthpiece literally pulls off it feels like you're breaking it but you are not it's designed to be broken off like that i don't think you can break it doing that i mean i gave it a good test earlier also doesn't leak but there is a droplet there i don't know why maybe it does leak if you turn it upside down i thought that rubber there would stop it but there is definitely one droplet there could be condensation you will get possibly condensation under this mouthpiece but you shouldn't and that cbd is affecting me i didn't actually think a 150 strength would hit me but i'm definitely feeling something from it more relaxed i'm going to lose my words soon so guys thank you very much for watching the vapresso x-ross video i have one more

me to try their oil and since then I've stuck with it I my I've used a different brands it actually seems to help with headaches and anxiety and some other things however I was curious to try other products that contained CD so when I came across covering hemp I was kind of excited that they had a variety of products green hemp actually sent me their vanilla lip balm in 35 milligrams rapid relief infused freeze roll-on and 150 milligrams the balm said eucalyptus and lavender 500 milligrams and they also sent the I think they're sour gummy bears I don't know what the milligrams were and clearly they're not pictured because I already ate them the gummy bears were actually great even though I'm not really an astounding only three came in the package unfortunately but I ended up taking them at night before going to bed I did one each night and the reason for that was because I was told that a lot of the gummy bears that are infused with CBD kind of makes you tired so I didn't want to do it during the day I don't know how much truthers to that but I did actually kind of think it helped with sleeping but I'm also doing the oil at night too so I could have just been that the lip balm is just your typical vanilla flavored lip balm that is infused with CBD oil that's 35 milligrams of CBD in it the ingredients are very simple I've used the Go Green hemp rapid relief CBD infuse freeze roll-on on my legs due to muscle condition that I have and I've also used it on my shoulders since I do spend a lot of time on it and yes I know I shouldn't let me do that but I do um it does help but I haven't noticed it being much different than any other pain relief roll-on that I've tried um I do like that the ingredients are more on the natural side than the other rollers and it does have the typical menthol minty sometimes a little too strong smell but it is something that I'm personally used to since I have used them for years um it's just your typical roller a lot of part does seem to come in there last part I was sat is the GoGreen high CBD balm salve and it's eucalyptus and lavender scent it is 500 milligrams I haven't used it yet um as you can see I'm not crazy I'm lab endure but I probably will try it it's you just basically apply it on sore joints and name spots on your body the Apes and as you can see the ingredients are simple you know what they are it actually doesn't smell too bad I was kind of worried it would smell very heavy on the lavender which is where I have a hard time with different products because the scent is too strong for some odd reason I'm just not big and SAVs and bums that are like this where you have to stick your finger in and then the product gets under your nail and it's just not really for me I do use them but it's mostly and the tattoos that I have on my arms these products are made in the US they do not contain THC the hemp in them is organic and it is Colorado grown they are third-party tested for those who want to know what the oil is I'm taking it's from materia I actually bought it from a local vape shop that's in my area I started out with the 500 milligram and then moved to the thousand because the 500 wasn't necessarily strong enough for me I mean it worked all I had to do was take more but then it ran out of the product quicker um it's just your typical tincture I know a lot of people struggle to take CBD oil because the taste is not always the greatest and a lot of the flavored ones I still think tastes really gross and there's no other way to describe it other than it tastes like you're drinking olive oil which I don't know about you but that's gross and I'm Italian so I use a lot of olive oil and everything but even I don't want to do it taking half in the morning and half at night seems to work better for me because I feel like it lasts longer when I would do just the full dropper in the morning right ninety it it helped but I felt like it wore off quicker than I wanted it to um they said it's just it's my dear I bought it from local vape shop zero THC made in the u.s. simple ingredients um you can buy it online it's pricey but all CBD oil is pricey and it works for me I'll continue using it I do hope to try some other products would like to try things like the soap bars and body lotions and I've seen a lot of shampoos and conditioners and hair styling products and all that so hopefully I will try them in the future you'll see post on them but right now these are the products that I'm taking using whatever you want to say I'm happy with them you know I know a lot of people think CBD oil is a bad thing or they just don't understand it but you're not gonna get high from it it's not gonna like make you feel weird it's just you know if you have pain I would highly recommend it I will have more detailed posts of the Go Green hemp products the three products plus the gummy is which aren't here because I already eat them I'll have that post-op very soon",

owner of chic Beauty here in New Braunfels Texas we specialize in corrective skincare treatments along with CVD skincare treatments and CVD skincare products so I wanted to go over today to talk about how to start a healthy skincare routine and also self-love the importance of taking care of yourself to get a lot of clients we do a lot of non-invasive no downtime treatments no pain for our clients but still getting the results that they want we do a lot of acne clients or aging clients rosacea really helping others understand the importance of their skincare routine and getting monthly treatments we also see a lot of clients a lot of our aging clients wish that they would have started taking better care of their skin a long time ago and here we are kind of re remapping and rerouting to get their skin at a place that they are happy with a place to start is your skin care regimen so I'm gonna go over what my personal skin care regimen is what I use on my skin and some new and upcoming products that we have for 2019 so first off as you know all of our products contain 50 to 150 milligrams of CBD the professional side we do sell to a lot of estheticians worldwide so our aesthetician line is a little bit stronger for the back bar but home care products will as of 2019 have 50 to 150 milligrams of CBD in your full skincare regimen so that's very very exciting we are very excited to kind of be the first full professional back bar cvd skin care clinics and wellness centers here New Braunfels and here in the surrounding areas so I don't know I am huge into CBD and not only not every CBD create equal so I want to clarify that you are seeing CVD pop up more and more everywhere on the market people selling it your neighbor down the street selling it smoke shop selling it so I want to clarify the one thing really quick not all CVD is created equal it takes a lot of science a lot of what actually goes into the CVD how it is manufactured how it is incorporated into the lab how it is bottled how it is extracted from the plant so a lot goes into it not just all CVD is the exact same why I pride myself and our CVD is yes it is THC free non-gmo organic source co2 extracted but also these specific plant terpenes this is our sublingual oil so this is what I personally take every single day morning and night a good place to kind of start is 500 milligram to a thousand depending on you not every dose is going to be the same for every one maybe one day I can do like a full CBD video that'll be that'll be in the in the future but I take the thousand milligram in our sublingual oil meaning it goes under your tongue I take it once in the morning once at night and it does not make you feel high it does not make you feel weird out of our body experience anything weird you are just gonna really put your body back in a homeostasis state balance your mood balance everything throughout your body or endocannabinoids system inside so along with skincare products I pretty much every single client if you are a client of mine or the other estheticians you know that this is a part of your regimen also and the reason being is we can only get healthy on the outside if we address what's going on on the inside so we're calming whatever is causing that inflammation and you're acting whatever is that inflammation and your rosacea flare-ups I'm really calming everything in the skin so these starts of getting healthy overall well-being starts with the insight so that is why I pride myself on carrying a pure blend and what also makes ours different if these specific plant terpenes in here so in order to make ours THC free you have to extract everything out and the more that you are extracting it the more that you're making it pure the less plant terpenes that are in the oil so if we are extracting extracting and extracting everything out to make the oil THC free the plant terpenes is then of course diluted so what's great about art oil is we can actually pick and choose which plant terpenes we want to add in here so the same thing that goes for our skincare line our sheep medium fusion for professional estheticians same thing goes for the sublingual oils so not only can we specifically choose what we want to add in here to help pass through the blood-brain barrier and also help balance the skin balance the body so it's really interesting that we can really choose what we actually want to add in there so again a lot of science goes into it a lot goes into what we are actually formulating in the lab and what we are infusing into our oils to make it the purest form but also make it more effective that much more effective and a lot of companies will honestly just break down the CBD and then not infuse the plant terpenes back into it so then they're just bottling up the CBD and sending it on their way which yes it will still be effective but in the end we really want those plant terpenes to pass through the blood-brain barrier to really help maximize the inflammation in the body so I take this every single day if you are a client of mine you know that I recommend this your skincare self-love routine I want to talk about our cleansers I love our products line I love being able to have control of what we are formulating in the lab how we are formulating our products all of our products are chiral e correct meaning your body is able to absorb the product your skin cells replicate in the lab so we replicate the skin cells in the lab taking the left side of the molecule out replicating in the lab making sure it's a mirrored image so your body is able to absorb these products make it more effective into the body make it more effective as far as corrective skincare treatments not a lot of products on the market are chiral E correct so it's really important to really go with a pure again all of our product line is organic vegan gluten-free vegetarian so y'all know huge on not putting harmful products or ingredients into my body or on to my clients so first these are the two cleansers I use so I do have acne skin if I am breaking out I will use more of the herbal acne cleanser so this does have alpha hydroxy acid beta hydroxy acid in here 50 milligrams of CBD in here so that's gonna really help control the acne the oil production on your skin balance your skin but also it's gonna really help break down the dead skin cells to not leave that film over your skin and really clear the acne so if I'm breaking out I will use this I am dry in some other areas so I personally cannot use this every single day and again products are a trial-and-error so if we try a regimen for you and it does not work specifically come back in and we can always switch out products we can figure out a specific regimen for you because not everything is going to work the same which is why I have two cleansers next this is what I use every single day this is a freshen up apple cleanser so what's huge for cleansers if you are just wanting to get started if you I've been using Dial soap for the longest time and you don't even know where to get started a cleanser and a moisturizer is a basic everyone if you have a face everyone needs to have some sort of cleanser some sort of moisturizer on your skin every day if you are acne prone you still need moisturizer brush enough Apple clips are a lot of times we will get clients coming in saying how they have been using dial soap and or apricot scrub something that our friends sell down the street and they don't know why their skin is oily they don't know why they're dry in some places they have combination skin their skin is sensitive the list goes on and on well I am here to tell you that your skin usually 910 is not sensitive it is sensitized by using the incorrect products so the incorrect products meaning that it is stripping your skin's barrier your body then realizes that it needs to over produce oil so then it starts overcompensating for that your I'm gonna do a whole other video on your skin barrier which I could go on and on on about this but yeah let me just stop there before I keep rambling on this cleanser will not strip your oil barrier it is safe for all skin types even acne prone skin types to really help regulate again it does have 50 milligrams of CBD in here and it's going to really help hydrate moisturize but not strip your skin so these are the two must-have cleansers that I love coffee more coffee if you are trying to correct some sort of skincare problem a serum is a great place to start as far as correcting that skincare problem I can have so for me I as you all know I do have acne prone skin but I have completely cleared up my acne but now I have leftover pigmentation so this is our illuminating lightening serum hydroquinone free which is huge you guys know I do not put harsh ingredients on my body or and my skin hydroquinone is very very harmful for you very harsh on your skin I lactic acid which is a vitamin C brightening but again the left side of the molecule is in here also and also the 50 milligrams of CBD is in here too so not only are you going to moisturize your skin you're still going to help brighten those pigment spots and any sort of acne scarring that you might have left over so I use this every single day morning and night it's medicate okay [Music] has 150 milligrams of CBD in here Moringa seed oil and the plant proteins that we specifically add in here to really help with the skin go in and bind with the cell receptors in your skin riser it's good for all skin types acne prone aging dry skin all skin types good for this one this is my moisturizer that I use every single day this is our bioactive lotion this is for acne prone skin so a lot of times if I'm breaking out a lot I will use this every single night but most of the time I will just use this as my moisturizer well anti inflammatory moisturizer so if you have acne prone skin you still need to moisturize your skin this does have new bioactive peptides in here to really help with any acne that you currently have clear up acne scarring and also balance the skin as far as the 50 milligrams of CBD that are in here is my full product regimen that I use every single day and what I have a lot of my clients on if you want to schedule an appointment with any of my aesthetician or me you can go to chic boutique tours and I will put the link below or if you want to order any of the products we now have products available online so you just go to our website click shop and it will show you all of our products even the sublingual oils we don't have available for purchase online so until next video I want to end this on how grateful I am for 2019 and how we have such amazing

because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "Knfl49kyAOQ": "hi it's Matt at Ruth's house studios and welcome to counter basics today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with

pharmacist who does all their compounding and I don't really know a whole lot about the science side of this but all of their products are made in an ISO six cleanroom which nobody else in the industry has or just at least not yet but I know that pharmacies are big pharma companies actually use the same type of rooms to ensure that their quality is is up to standards as well and there's no pesticides or metals in this product as well I actually got this stuff because muscle and joint my girlfriend has arthritis I don't know if this is going to help at all obviously they're not going to make any claim saying that it helps with that kind of stuff I'm also in joint relief creams CBD I figured why not give it a try being that everybody's ranting and raving about this stuff now so let's

[Music]", "B3dOpLT0xMw": "everyone Brennan here of cop box mind so I did the organifi series showed you the gold the gold chocolate the green the pure and those are the ones that are gonna be on sale at cop box mancom but I also told you guys that I was gonna do a monthly CBD review on Green Road products so as you know I only carried Green Road products because I believe they are the best they I'm not gonna say they're the longest in the business but they were one of the frontiers in the CBD business they you know there's there's a couple there's about four companies that really started it but CBD is my way to go because of the transparency they give the purity of their product and the potency so those are extremely important with CBD some companies don't even offer a lab sheet that's crazy because you don't know what you're taking you don't know exactly how much CBD they can tell you that there's this much CBD but they can't really prove it unless they have third-party testing so this is the new product of the month it is the muscle and joint relief cream 150 milligrams they do offer a 300 milligram but I wanted to see how this how popular it would be so this has more ingredients than the regular CBD but it's because it's a pain cream you know it's it has this menthol it has lavender oil it still has your glycerin it has purified water you know obviously it has 150 milligrams of CBD in it how's Kim Miele extract it has just it has vitamin E it has some other ingredients in it but if you want to check out cup box mind I have all the ingredients on there if you don't want to check that check out green roads calm they should have all the ingredients as well because I got the ingredients off their site I could have manually typed all this but I didn't want to so I just took the ingredients that they have there on their site and put it on to my site so this is 150 milligram cream not going to say I really don't have any pains but I will open it I will take it out and I'll show you the bottle this is the size of the bottle it's one ounce you know you might think oh that's that's not tons of if you're curious from here to here is six inches just because you know electrical when I was an electrical you had to have six inches of wire outside of the box you know that's random fact but anyways so this is it obviously it has its security right there I'm taking this off because I'm gonna give it to my mother so that's a little pump pretty much what you do just yeah I was let's put on my it's gonna take a couple pumps I think this stardate I'm just waiting for it to like just go all over the keyboard or whatever okay so that looks like it is a serving you can smell the lavender smell the menthol and what you do is just you know rub it on I mean it it goes pretty far one pump can get a whole area in this that's what this is force for targeted area so you could technically do your whole wrist I went all the way down here all the way up to here so and from side to side so that's that's a pretty large area you can do your whole wrist you could probably do your whole knee depend on your ankle size probably one or two doses I I believe you can get up to 90 doses with this I believe so each pump is supposed to be one point four milligrams of CBD that's 107 so I'm gonna say I'm gonna say you're probably gonna get about 75 uses you're supposed to use this four to six hours or as needed so if it doesn't hurt don't use it but if it hurts let's say you're you're about to go on a run you have ankle issues put this on I can already feel the menthol that's for sure and it's it's probably gonna take about two or three minutes for it to dry doesn't exactly say so I'm gonna say it probably dries in about two to three minutes and then like I said smells like the lavender is really strong but it's not like oh my god strong so it's a pleasant smell anyways guys so here it is this is 37 dollars for the 150 milligram the 300 milligram I can look really quick it won't be doubled so give me one second I will check really really quick to see how much the 300 milligrams will cost you if you're interested in it if not use the 150 I do suggest if you're using the pain cream also use an edible or an oil or a capsule so use the gummy use the oil use your capsules still because CBD gets a a really broad spectrum of benefits so is this good yeah it's good for targeted areas but it's not gonna help the entire body so you still want to get that relief from the entire body so okay so the 150 is $37 but I'm gonna make the 300 milligram 65 so you're gonna get a lot more value out of the 300 milligram don't hold me down that that could change it could be a little less but I queens 62 and 65 so probably closer to 65 so just kind of look at it that way so the 300 milligram you're probably gonna get it around 65 the 150 milligram is $37 it doesn't include shipping and taxes if that applies to you obviously website this weekend well I guess I should say tomorrow which is Sunday March 10th free shipping on all orders so I have three of these in stock so if you want to grab one go ahead and grab it I think they're gonna sell out pretty quick once I put this video up but again it's a pump bottle so you're not gonna waste it it is dry but I feel the effect I feel the cooling of the menthol and one ounce bottle 150 milligrams so anyways guys top box mind comm find the muscle and joint cream and if you really really like this product and one two three hundred milligram make sure you comment like and tell me that you want it because I'll order it for you that's no problem alright anyways guys see you next time I'm burnin and good bye", "IXyvJEHVfgU": "CBD for high-heeled and tired feet you don't have to suffer foot pain

CWM so a lot of you know already that some of the wonderful benefits of consuming our dietary supplement this beautiful hemp oil that we our company creates but today we're actually going to make something topical so as well as digesting it you can also apply it to a lot of your skin ailments in a topical fashion and so today we're actually going to make a really nice soothing skin South with our bottle of everyday or if you want an extra strength we can use every day plus so the recipe which it will be posted on our blog is relatively simple I am gonna incorporate a few other herbs just because why not they're fun and it'll help with the synergy as well as the efficaciousness and so this recipe is pretty loose you can use almost any of your favorite herbs of course if you're not certain contact an herbalist in your area and they can help you out with more of the choices specific to your own needs so the recipe that we're gonna make today is going to be using plantain leaf calendula flour lemon balm and lavender so the first step we're gonna do is we're gonna measure out our dried herbs so in South I like to use dried herbs just so that all of the water is already evaporated so that way we have a really nice good and strong oil extraction that will base our salad on so first we're gonna start with plantain leaf so plant a go major or plant a go major mmm wonderful ten take a major is pretty common to a lot of places in North America it's a really low growing weed and a lot of cases but it's really great at drawing toxins out of skin especially when used fresh and apply but of course today we're gonna use dried it's also antimicrobial anti-inflammatory it's really great for stings bites burns skalds it's really wonderful like healing the skin so we're gonna use an ounce and a quarter I'm just gonna measure out one cup in case you don't have a scale at home and collegial flour also called pot marigold calendula officinalis it really is good at helping heal and break up scar tissue when it becomes hard it really is good at penetrating that wound and making it soft again so it can really regenerate the tissue it's just wonderful for the skin I love it too so we're gonna use two cups of this and pour those into our ball and next we're going to use dried lemon balm leaf also wonderful and fantastic it's really great at healing eruptive conditions of the skin like shingles herpes things like that that really kind of erupt lemon balm is really wonderful and soothing it's great at just easing the stress emotionally physically as well as oxidatively it's also a really nice anti-inflammatory so we're going to add a half cup of that or half an ounce okay and the last thing I'd really like to add is just a bit of lavender flower I mean it smells wonderful it's gonna add such a nice fragrance to ourselves as well as it's also good at stimulating the circulation around healing tissue varicose vein scratches bumps bruises things like that so we're gonna add a 1/4 ounce of that or a quarter cup as it turns out of our beautiful flowers so now we just have this lovely blend of herbs that we're we're gonna use isn't that pretty our glass dish and you can use any baking dish that you like we're gonna put in our dried herbs okay into the nice glass pan and now we're gonna take our oil pardon my reach here okay so I'm using almond oil today but you can use a variety of of oils you can use olive oil sunflower oil I really like almond oil because it's really good for all skin types and today we're going to use about three to three and a half cups of oil just enough to cover all of the dry herbs beautiful all right now I've poured it into a glass dish because if you don't have a crock-pot at home you can just put it in the oven or if you're using a crock-pot just put your crock pot on low and then you put the herbs directly in the crock pot but since we're gonna I wanted to show you what it looked like in a pan we're gonna put it in the oven on the lowest setting possible so if your oven goes to 140 put it on 140 if your oven goes 170 put it on 170 whatever the lowest setting is possible go ahead and put it on that and we're gonna really lightly heat it for about four hours anywhere between three and five whatever your time allows or you can put it in the crock pot it's an easy way to do it so make sure you don't burn it for about four hours and then we're gonna come back and put our CW hip extract on it okay so it's been four hours and we have our beautiful oil infusion here we've taken some dried herbs poured in some oil and extract all this beautiful components of the herbs into the oil it smells wonderful all right so now we're gonna have to strain the dried plant material out of the oil at least I like to so you can let it cool down for a little bit just don't burn yourself so I have some cheesecloth here into a strainer we're just gonna pour that in there okay I have this beautiful rich golden green oil and this is the fun step we're gonna add our bottle of CW okay and I'm gonna add the whole bottle okay the next two ingredients are optional but I like to add them I like to add some drops of vitamin E oil also really wonderful for the skin and it also helps preserve the integrity of the staff so I'm just gonna add a little bit and eighth to a quarter teaspoon nice I'm also gonna add a few drops of essential oil I think it's just a really nice fragrance to add as well as all those beneficial properties of essential oils like antimicrobial antiviral I'm adding lavender today but mm you can add whatever your favorite is again contact your health care provider if you're unsure which ones to use okay so now we have our oils here with all their wonderful properties I'm gonna give that one last stir and what makes an herbal oil LaSalle's is just adding some beeswax so I find it's a little easier to mix the two and the beeswax is already melted which you can do over a double boiler but it's not necessary you can just add it straight to the oil but you might have to reheat the oil a bit so it melts I'm just gonna add that right in there okay so we have our beautiful oil and our beeswax and now we're ready to parse out so if you find that your beeswax is having trouble melting into your oil all you have to do is put your oil back on the stove at low heat for just a few minutes and it'll incorporate really nicely okay so we have our infusion with our herbs we have our CW every day or every day plus for extra strength we have our essential oils beeswax little vitamin E oil as far south so there we go and that's all there is to it and now we just have to let it cool down so it's liquid right now so we can pour it but as it cools down it'll Harden and we'll be able to use it for any of our skin ailments that we happen to have around thank you so much for joining me today and I hope you enjoy your new self you [Music] you", "TSgOkBoYzCw": "boy CBD healing bomb review what is up guys my name is Eden and I am the owner of Wella c-calm and welcome back to another installment of our review segment today I'm super excited to review a brand new CBD topical

also you will see an exclusive discount code that you can use to get 15% off your first purchase of the coy healing balm from Wella c.com so like I said guys the koi healing balm it's got the the koi prism true spectrum hemp oil so you know I kind of look at that as sort of like a broad spectrum kind of formulation because it doesn't have any trace it doesn't have any THC in it so you don't don't worry about that and also what's in it is it's got some essential oils you know it's phenomenal essentials you know let's take a look so it's got like some grapeseed oil yellow beeswax Granite coconut oil peppermint oil eucalyptus leaf oil rosemary leaf oil sweet basil oil spearmint oil lavender flower oil and that's just beginning there's many many more in there so I'm really excited to give this a try because with all of those essential oils in there you know you get some of that aromatherapy going once you apply it under your skin really relaxing then you also get the benefits of phyto cannabinoids from the hemp plant you know such as the CBD the the CBD v the cbn you know the varying cannabinoids without any THC of course guys it's I do want to keep pointing that out so koi a healing balm I'm going to use the big bad boy today because I just love the packaging guys like look at this right on the cap you know it's a wood engraved cap it has the koi logo right koi CBD logo right on it's just it's beautiful alright and you know just high-quality packaging a nice glass container with a nice wood lid you know it's it's solid all the way so you just open this up and ooh ooh so oh its shape so take it out the box so I actually had one out of the box already so you take that like so boom boom and what's really awesome you know it's got some the ingredients on there directions for use you know simply you just using a CBD topical or CBD salve this is what it's referred to as this is a salve does it's thicker consistency it's not like a lotion it's kind of like sort of like a Vaseline kind of consistency but it doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy for extended periods like Vaseline you know so it's really easy with SABS you simply just take take a glob on your finger I mean just rub it right on the plump the problematic area you know it's really effective for those large deep muscle groups that you've really got a massage deep so though you athletes if you experience an injury you know I was dealing with some shoulder pain a while back and reach for the coy healing balm and let me tell you it was really really effective for me so I'm excited to review this product with you guys so pop it out the box right here you know it's got the 500 milligrams of coy healing balm we're sort of sticker right there other than that you know down at the bottom it's got directions for use on it also the ingredients which is a win-win the only thing that I don't see on here that I would recommend for coy I mean I checked the COAS they're spot on there they're great but the only thing I would suggest for coy I'm not seeing it's just because they have it on all their other products is just adding a QR code right under the packaging just so you guys as the consumers can quickly scan it with your cameras on your phone and then you can just verify because it is important that you always verify but let's be honest guys when you're buying from a company like coy CBD quality is of the utmost importance when they're in their manufacturing process to see simply do not have to worry about it so let's go ahead and give the coy healing bummer ago ooh you know I could smell that eucalyptus the lat or the the peppermint oil in there ooh and then the lavender you know I feel like I could smell it is it like some lemon I feel like I could smell a little bit of a oh there is lemongrass oil I was getting a little hits hints of lemon in there ooh there's even some cinnamon leaf oil in there which you know I think would be great for you know kind of like a sort of warming kind of tingling sensation because let's go ahead let's let's actually stop smelling it and actually try it for ourselves so I boom so as you could see guys just a thick little ol glob like that I mean depending on your large muscle groups you can you can adjust it so just like with all SAVs and CBD topicals when you apply it to that local area it'll only provide the localized relief so I recommend pairing I call it the two prong approach I recommend pairing a topical for really outside your body in those localized areas and then also using a CBD t-shirt such as the Wella C full spectrum MCT oil tincture so then you get relief outside with the topical and then inside your body which is the whole body relief using leveraging a topical soul all right so let's go ahead and I'm actually just going to I'm gonna rub this right on my I'm gonna do it on my elbow and also my shoulder so you guys can see so as you can see I'm rubbing it on ooh right when you start putting it on that ooh those essential oils really start to go to work mmm it smells incredible I mean you know just those aromatherapy benefits just from those essential oils like I'm relaxed already guys um you know I could this should be phenomenal to put on you know right before bed you know I mean that's not to say you could use this all during the day because you're not going to smell nasty like bengay it's just gonna be really refreshing and actually so I rubbed it in um and yes so I mean my skin is a little greasy but it's nothing like Vaseline but I mean I just rub I rubbed it in a lot you know you really want to get it in there lather it in there but man it made my skin so incredibly soft and I always get this wow this is really noticeable with the koi CBD healing balm the koi naturals Wow so right when I start rubbing it on I always get sort of like a tingling sensation like I feel like that's the phyto cannabinoids you know the CBD and other cannabinoids that are present in this formulation are really going to work and stimulating my endocannabinoids receptors because we do have them on the skin and that's why CVD topicals are becoming so so popular is because you got a local you've got a specific area of pain that you want to really you to relieve you just rub a the koi CBD healing balm right on it and wow I feel the tingling and like even my hand like you know I can feel it like it's kind of low greasy but honestly like I just rub it in my hand so there's no waste and my hand like I can feel it but it's definitely absorbing rather quickly like I don't see this like I wouldn't have a difficult time grasping things you know writing on stuff so if you're at work and you have some pain that's like some inflammation that's quickly that's a you just pull this out of your your desk you know that keeping the full-size one of your desk or even the travel size in your purse or your a backpack and then you just pull it out whenever you need to relief and wow that that is really really good it smells very refreshing which I I'm a huge fan of this smell don't get wrong it's not you know a lot of topicals out there you know with the especially the lavender you know I feel like they smell a little more on the feminine side of things but you know this this the lavender the ooh the lemongrass you can get that absolutely phenomenal smell so the effects that I'm experiencing so what you know my elbows been kind of bothering me you know I don't have like tennis elbow or anything but you know I kind of fell on it and so but it's actually you know the level of you know I was just kind of kind of hurt a little bit when I was moving it it was just kind of stiff but you know it's really moving I mean it feels like it's loosing it loosening up a little bit um you know the CBD will really start to it takes a little bit P absorbed I mean it does go into work right away um but if you're experienced a high level of pain you know I would definitely give it about 20 to 30 minutes I'm once you put it on to just have really gauge the effects to see if that's right for you but scent I you know I got to give this smell a 10 out of 10 it's very refreshing you know so like I said you know that peppermint oil so it really so once you apply it on you know it immediately starts going to work you know it's kind of like it's sort of like a warming sensation but it's not like you know it's not as crazy as icy hot at all it's very it's very very mild but I do feel the relief taking place and you know I'm actually going to do is a little bit of shoulder pain and this is always my issue especially back pain the shoulder and back pain because I work on a computer all day on there for at least 18 hours a day so my muscles are really tight and stiff and oh my goodness like my neck especially that oh yeah I'm gonna put a little bit more on my neck and oh yeah see guys that I already feel it starting to really sort of alleviate some of the pain and stiffness in my neck up because guys if you can feel my neck you know there's a whole bunch of knots and everything so I would love nothing more than to get a full sort of massage leveraging this koi natural CBD healing balm ooh I keep saying that it smells really good but it's super refreshing relaxing guys like once I put it on I just feel relaxed and also those essential oils or leveraging that aromatherapy so when you're inhaling that you're getting that aromatherapy and then the CBD and the other phyto cannabinoids and the formulation are also going to work you know fighting off that inflammation and another thing you know even if you don't have specific pain you can also leverage this healing balm as a moisturizer because I didn't touch on that my skin is very very soft and you know I have an issue on my neck and my back or my neck and right behind my ears get really really dry I don't know if you can see the redness but I think oh wow that yeah that healing bump I would apply to every where I mean I it says I would not recommend putting it on your face necessarily David say that right on the packaging just to avoid your face and eyes you know because if you can get that there's essential oils and stuff that are in the formulation into your eyes I could you know kind of burn but you know it does it really that cooling sensation janeshia lee is really really good and it's kind of like a cooling warming sensation it's kind of like a little bit of both you know I really did notice that once I put it on my neck you know I it's yeah definite I feel it moisturizing because my neck was so dry incredible moisturizer you know I'm loving the effects that I'm feeling initially now I got it I got a wait a little bit you know to fully gages so I'll probably come back and let you guys know and about you know twenty to thirty minutes to see how I'm feeling and then yeah we can touch base on that because I do want to always touch on the effects you know granite they're all gonna be different from what you and I experience but I think it's important for the sake of this review that I give you sort of some insight on the effects that I'm experiencing leveraging the koi healing balm what's up guys so you know it's about been about 20 or so minutes since I first applied on the koi healing balm so I played it on my shoulder and also my arm and then also my neck because I had that muscle stiffness you know and also some stiffness in my elbow um and also what I wanted to test is um I experienced some some dry skin behind sort of like my ears or upper neck area and let me tell you it took away the dryness I mean my skin feels incredibly soft and also let me touch on that in regards to how it feels um the greasiness that you kind of felt initially that i discussed when i first put it on it's completely gone my skin is just looking healthy supple and just very very smooth looks very shiny smells good still on those essential oils that i listed off are still kicking and strong but yeah i was really kind of worried because i've experienced that way stabs where there's an overly greasy miss with it after an extended period of time and i simply don't like that because you know especially if you're at work and you got to play that on you got crap all over your hands and i hate you know wiping it on stuff because that's just a waste of the CBD so as you saw with the what I do with the koi CBD healing balm is rubbed on the elbow then rubbed it on my arms my neck and then also the any excess and just rub it into my hands and my hands don't feel greasy they're just incredibly soft and smooth so nicely done on that so I did what kind of want to um you know come back pause the video and come back and let you guys know sort of how the effects the effects that I was experiencing you know but about 20 minutes or so in so very very solid on that core I'm super impressed they definitely eliminated my concern with it being overly greasy but also like this stiffness in my neck you know it's still sword it's not like CBD isn't a miracle you know but it is in a sense but for me you know the pain is still there but the soreness and the overall like stiffness has really been subsided so I just feel like I have greater range of movement in my neck and it doesn't really hurt I don't feel like I just have like massive knots in my neck so nicely done and you know I'm definitely going to be reaching for this coin natural CBD healing balm the next time I have a migraine you know rub it right on my neck area and then about like my upper neck right at the bottom of my sort of head and then also leverage our tincture and I really think that would be a match made in heaven you know that's just one of the uses that you can use for the koi Naturals CBD healing balm flavor or scale of 1 to 10 that I would give it just based off the smell alone 10 out of 10 no doubt about it and then the effects that I'm experiencing you know my neck I feel like my neck is the one problematic area in my back that I feel the inflammation really kind of being subsided a little bit you know the pain still there but it's definitely it's providing me a level of relief that I would be happy with um especially if you're at work or something where any level of pain you know if you can mitigate that any even just a minut amount I think that's a win-win especially if you're in a work environment school environment where that can really kind of deter your focus so you know on the overall effects and I'm feeling you know sort of the well the skin sort of nourishing benefits that I got one just based off the softness my skin feel because it's been on my arm for you know about 20 minutes now to 2025 minutes my hands they just feel really soft smell great but they're not greasy at all you can pick something up and also my skin it's not greasy but I will say it's very very shiny and it's very very moisturized so that's great um you know being out here in Colorado it's a very dry climate so if you live out in a dry climate as well such as Colorado not in Arizona or something this would be very good just for the moisturizing benefits but the pain relief and the overall benefit and experience that I get rating it on a scale of one to ten I got to give that an eight out of ten this is by far one of my all-time favorite CBD topical as well and this in this instance a CBD salve it is my favorite one absolutely you know very solid score the packaging is beautiful I mean cool you guys knocked it out of the park on this one everything you need you know is right on the box the only thing that are the label two blocks beautiful packaging even more beautiful but you know the only thing I'd suggest is adding a QR code just to make it super easy for customers such as you guys to access those COAS because in this industry especially with things that are going around there's a lot of negativity so it's very important that you verify where you're getting your CBD and where that source from as well so guys like I said at the beginning of the video if you check the info information section below

everybody and welcome back to the channel today's video I'm going to be making a much requested video from our subscribers which is how to make CBD lotion that's right liquid pumpable lotion that you can use at home but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you are new here to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up so folks today we're going to be making our CBD hand lotion and first and foremost of one ingredient that we did make here on the farm is our hemp Keeffe you can find this on our website pricing and everything and you can make an order this lotion will be available on our website so go ahead and check out the pricing if you just don't want to bother making it you can purchase it from us so just visit our website and all the prices are there and I do appreciate all the support from from all you subscribers that are watching this video I appreciate a lot of support that we've gotten so thank you very much let's dive into what you're gonna need to make CBD hand lotion at home okay folks you are gonna need a lot of things for this so let's get started with you will need an immersion blender or a stick blender of some sort for this recipe you could use a real blender but I don't recommend it you're gonna need some sort of container to put the lotion in here we have a pumpable container you're gonna need some sort of spatula or just you know a mixing device you're gonna need distilled water shea butter emulsifying wax vegetable glycerin which you really can't see in the bowl here and avocado oil along with a preservative of your choice and you can just Google which preservative you think would work best for you this is what we have here and of course our hemp Keith the other thing you're gonna need is a large pan I'll bring it over here you're gonna fill the pan with water and you're gonna have to separate bowls inside the pan and we'll get to that shortly so these are all the ingredients that are required to make this CBD hand lotion it is a lot and like I said folks if you don't want to bother whether you can visit our website and purchase the CBD lotion so folks let's get this party started and let's get into making our CBD hand lotion okay folks now as you can see the big pan here is filled with water we have two separate pots we're gonna go ahead and turn this on to medium low temperature and first we're gonna start doing our oils so we're gonna go ahead and add the emulsifying wax our avocado will now this isn't measured by fluid ounce or anything this is measured by grams and I'll leave that exact recipe in the description below and we're gonna get our shea butter now that's going to have to get brought up to temperature now meanwhile there's two things I want to want you to consider now we're gonna put our water in in this other pot here now this is distilled water okay now the great thing about having vegetable glycerin in this recipe and why it's so important is because the hemp Kieff goes into the vegetable glycerin and this is how it dissolves again and gets into the lotion so I'm gonna bring you back over while this is heating up and we're gonna start dissolving our hemp teeth in the vegetable glycerin alright folks so now that we have all the hemp keith's dissolved in the vegetable glycerin I want to show you kind of what it looks like before we go ahead and put it in the water and it's really like a nice thick pasty no clumps or anything like that you really want it to be nice and thinned out and that is ideal for when we're making the lotion so now we're going to go over and add it to the water part of the lotion there Keefe is nice and dissolve we're just gonna add it to the water bowl here the one with all the water that don't add it to the oil add it to the water and you want to make sure you're getting all of that Keef in there because this stuff is expensive and it really brings up your CBD content for the actual ocean so get all that as much as we can and go ahead and start mixing that around a little bit now you can see it's separating from the glycerine a little bit don't worry about that that is perfectly normal and once we get the oil in it what you won't even notice it does like to separate once it's in the water but not by a lot I mean you can still see that it's fairly dissolved so now we're going to wait for everything to get up to temperature and then we're going to start mixing stuff around so I'll see you in proximately 20 minutes okay folks everything is melted down and at the same temperature and again this is important it has to be the same temperature so what you can do now is you can put the oil with the water or the water with the oil this is going to be the pot so to speak or the container that you're going to emulsify everything in so make sure that it's the larger of the two containers we're gonna go ahead and just add that now and as you can see it became a very white creamy type of lotion look to it and that is perfect for what we need now we want to make sure that that Keef gets in there so we'll be adding making sure sometimes it likes to stick to the side so make sure you get that key off the side that is important for your CBD content of this lotion all right so now we're going to wait about two to three minutes while this sits in the same temperature bath it isn't required but this is something I like to do and as you can see the key floating up here we're gonna mix it around so I'm gonna give it about five minutes and then we're gonna be right back all right folks it's time to take this off the heat bring it over here to cool down we're gonna get rid of this pan of hot water and then what we're gonna do is going to go over here and start reversing blendering everything getting it started to get mixed up as it starts to cool so this is key all right boys have been off the heat for about three to four minutes and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna emulsify and this takes a little bit of time so you're just gonna go ahead and mix it and you don't want to get a lot of air in it so don't don't bring it up and down like that too much just I do it in the very beginning because sometimes some of the oil try separating to the top so I like to bring it down but right now we're just gonna mix it and you're gonna do this on and off for approximately 10 minutes so it's gonna be a while but you don't have to do it continuously you can go ahead and take a break and jump back into it but you're gonna want to mix it for quite a while and get it nice and mixed up so I'll see you folks in probably about 10 minutes all right folks so we've been mixing for about 10 minutes and you can see it's nice and thickened up now I'm gonna turn it on for you real quick and you can see that it's getting nice and thick now it's starting to look like that yeah typical lotion look to it you don't see the the the hemp chief any longer it's all mixed in and so now you're gonna have to wait another 10 minutes while this cools off and while we're waiting I want you to go gather your preservative of your choice again folks you got to go out and research which preservative you're comfortable with there is a lot of them out there this is the one that we went with but you don't have to use that one but you have to use as preservative because of the amount of water that's in this you can also grab some vitamin E you can add that that is not required for the recipe and along with some essential oils if you like essential oils in your lotion so that's what I'm gonna do oh do me to get all that stuff together and I'll see you back in ten minutes it's been about ten minutes and we've measured out our preservative and now as you can see the lotion is exactly what you would think of as a lotion it's very nice it's cooled off and we'll get some of this lotion off of the emulsion blender here yeah it looks awesome and so now is the time you want to get everything going so this is what it looks like nice and fluffy just a typical lotion now there's a lot of ways you can get this back into a bottle for the most part we're going to just put it into that pumpable lotion but right now we're gonna add our essential oils and I'm gonna do about about 10 drops of vitamin E about seven drops of lavender I don't like a strong essential oil so it's not for me you can add as much as you want then we're going to do four grams of preservative and this is really to extend the shelf life of this because it's water-based you can't just get away with not having a preservative you've got to have one all right so now this is all out of their way and so now we're just gonna mix it all around and now you can see that lotion is getting that just nice liquids look to it and it smells absolutely wonderful and so now what you can do is get ready to put it in your container of choice now for us I like to put it in the pumpable bottle but you can put it in a mason jar but the reason I like the pumpable bottle is because it's contained and you're not constantly putting your hands in it because it requires a preservative and because it's water-based you don't want to be adding bacteria to it eventually that preservative won't be able to keep up so what we're going to do is we're going to add it to the bottle and the trick to that is you go ahead and you can get a plastic bag and you put the lotion in it cut the corner and you can fill it that way you can have like a pastry funnel you can do it that way there's a bunch of different ways one of the easiest ways of course is the mason jar but you know the mason jar again you're putting your hand in it constantly folks that's all I have for today I hope you enjoyed this I hope you liked this recipe I mean just look at how awesome this lotion is it smells absolutely wonderful you cannot smell the hemp in it at all because we use em Keefe you can't smell it it is absolutely awesome it's wonderful it smells like lavender and again you can add more lavender if you shoes or you can add any essential oil that you want i like lavender but i don't like a lot of it but it is awesome it smells like a lotion you buy at the store and again it's CBD so this is good for joint pain or anything that you think that CBD can work for you know I'm not going to give any recommendations of what it can cure or anything you can do your research online but yeah this will be available as requested on our website so go ahead and reach out to me again the hemp chief is also available and we'll be getting that out soon so go ahead and visit our website folks but that's all I have for you today I really hope you enjoyed this recipe I hope it works out for you and thanks for watching the video and I will catch you in another video", "surc7tlcLW0": "[Music] hey everyone and welcome back to another video in this video i'm going to be discussing the cura leaf nano drops my top two favorite flavors are the unflavored and the lime so i'm gonna be talking about those today and telling you about the taste of the product how it works what do we do with it etc so let's keep watching if you want to and let's get into it so the nano drops are meant to be mixed into a beverage so that you can drink your thc one milliliter and the dropper does show you on it how much one milliliter is you can see right there one milliliter contains five milligrams of thc the retail price for one 150 milliliter bottle is 30 so first off i want to tell you something interesting about the nano aspect of these drops i read the blog from kira leaf about these drops and it told me this about nanotechnology the way that this works is with nanomolecular technology which means the cannabinoids are so small that your body doesn't need to digest them in order for you to feel the effects they're water soluble because they're so tiny so you're able to mix this into a drink that's how you're supposed to use it and you can drink the cannabinoids and you can feel the effects much faster than with something like an edible or another type of oral consumption product i thought that was interesting about these products because i kind of just thought okay it's i didn't really know what nano meant i thought that was pretty cool so it's basically really tiny tiny molecules of cannabinoids and that's why they're able to be water-soluble and that's also why the nanotechnology makes them faster and more readily bioavailable now let's talk about the product a little bit more what does it taste like how do we use it and all of that good stuff so you want to use this in a drink i prefer sparkling water but basically you're just going to want to mix this into a drink it comes in a bottle like this so you've got your box then you've got your bottle the bottle is 150 milligrams of thc in the entire bottle and that is 30 milliliters of product in total i would say this is going to be a good product for somebody who likes to micro dose or use smaller amounts of cannabis in their daily life you probably don't want to add too much of this to your drink or you are going to start to taste more of this flavor than you might want to and what this flavor tastes like it depends on whether you get the unflavored or the flavored with a taste in it but all of them even the unflavored one are kind of sweet so when you put them into your drink they have a little bit of a sweetness kind of like the sweetness of like a diet coke it's more of like a sucralose so like a artificial sweetener type of taste all of them have that flavor all of them are even the unflavored is on the sweet side so just keep that in mind when you're mixing this the way that i usually like to use it is i will pour about an eight ounce cup of beverage so basically just a cup of my beverage and i usually use sparkling water so i'll usually add like half the can into a cup all right so we've got our cup of beverage and then i just take two droppers full or i actually do more like 2.75 droppers full so not all the way up to one milliliter but just up to that 0.75 mark and i just do two of those into my drink so that equals out to a little less than 10 milligrams of thc i just mix it together now let's try it yeah definitely tasting that sweetness from the drops i'm also tasting some of the flavor of the sparkling water and also the flavor of the lime that i just put in there and i'll just sip it until it's gone just like i would with like any other kind of drink i just sip this guy whenever i feel like it and that can be during the day it can be at night time and i do feel like the effects are pretty strong and pretty fast like i feel like once i finish drinking the drink i can already feel the effects that's how fast it kicks in for me and what i usually look for with my effects is just am i feeling an overall sense of calm am i feeling good and am i feeling overall positive and feeling good i usually just try to use as much cannabis as i need in that moment and then stop when i'm feeling like i got my my amount that i need like there's no need to add more on top of that but this is a great product i think for people who are going to use more like a 10 milligram dose in each drink um and you can always you know drink a couple of drinks back to back if you need to but i just wouldn't recommend putting a lot of the liquid in a drink and drinking it because it's just going to taste really sweet and not very good so i mean you could probably you can but just i would just advise against using like don't use like the whole bottle at once or something like i just don't think that's a good idea that's just my take though i don't know um so anyway have you tried these products what have you what do you think of them if you've tried them let me know in the comments i'm really curious to know i've been using these now for a few weeks and i just love them i love the effects i love how easy it is to use them i like the taste i don't think it's too bad um yeah i'm overall a big fan of this product so i could definitely see myself buying it again in the future i think i prefer these drops in a liquid form as opposed to like there's a powder out there from another dispensary that i tried and it was okay but it didn't dissolve as well as this does this dissolves really well in your drink and you just you don't feel like you're not getting it mixed in it's definitely getting mixed in pretty well when you use this product with a drink so anyway thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next video and i hope you liked this and i'll see you next time also i am going to be getting back to weekly videos um at least i'd like to do more than a weekly like i'd like to do more than one per week so we will see how that goes i don't want to get ahead of myself but keep on coming back because i'm going to be trying to make new videos every week all right i'll see you next time bye hey there just a quick editor's note i wanted to give a big

"8Yq86bip74U": "hi there my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today I'm going to talk to you about the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse bomb the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse bomb is the purse friendly portable topical CBD supplement that you can bring with you anywhere that comes in two sizes a half an ounce 150 milligram cats eyes and a ounce and a half 450 milligrams size Charlotte's Web recommends that these products be used to help to enhance your overall quality of life and wellness I love to use them to help me recover from exercise and normal aches and pains but before we go any further make sure you like and subscribe to this channel Charlotte's Web is a US company based out of Colorado and I like to think of them as kind of like the mama to CBD companies because they have been growing and manufacturing CBD supplements since 2011 they do have facilities that are C GMP certified which is basically telling you it's like the same thing as a pharmaceutical grade compounding facility and they are US hemp authorities certified they do use organic farming principles but they are not certified organic and this product is non-gmo and vegan friendly and also contains no preservatives and only uses natural products like essential oils and botanicals to help bring about a nice pleasantly scented topical ointment that contains a fair amount of CBD so now let's talk about what you get when you purchase the Charlotte's Web him infuse CBD bomb there is 300 milligrams of CBD per ounce in the bone and currently there are two sizes that you can get this half an ounce which I actually really prefer to carry fits easily inside the palm of your hand you can slide it into your back pocket or throw it into your purse and they also have the 450 milligrams which is a little bit bigger it still fits in your palm but it's a little bit harder to fit in to the back pocket it does come in a metal container and it is originally wrapped with cellophane you will find that it's a very durable product and it's not super easy to come off so that's why I love to have it like for the pocket and the purse but could do keep that in mind if you tend to have stiff fingers or you maybe have trouble with that dexterity I love it because my kids struggle to open it up just a little bit but for like my father-in-law he kind of struggles sometimes to get this off just a bit the hemp infused balm is lightly scented with essential oils I basically really only sell smell clove and maybe a little bit of a mint flavor it is very lightly scented and they only use essential oils but because it is scented I wanted to let you know in case you do have sensitivities to things like smells they do use a natural emulsifier like shea butter and sunflower oil as the carrier and it is in two different sizes this half an ounce in the 1.5 ounce currently you can get these products in Canada US Brazil and in select retailers over in the UK based on what their inventory levels are and they do have test results available but from this QR code located on the back of both containers now if you have watched a few of my reviews you may have noticed that I have had quite a bit of a beef with the Charlotte's Web how do I say this CoA or their disclosure of their analysis they don't necessarily make it the easiest thing in the world for you to find the test results you can you scan this QR code and then you have to find the batch number and that for these containers is actually stamped on the side so this is D 28 and this one is L 0 1 so once you scan the QR code you actually have to type that number into the search function and then you'll get to the COA results but here's where I'm eating a little bit of crow from the time that I did the review on the capsules and now the two different cos are completely different now the Charlotte's Web cos contain the full cannabinoid profile so these show that you have both CBD CBD a CB G and CBC unfortunately it did not test for CB n but you will also find that the test results showed that it passed for there are no traces or load limited to non detectable amounts of pesticides and microbials which means basically that these guys although they are not certified organic they're not using pesticides and I love that because I don't want to put anything else that could damage or injure me long-term and I love knowing that that I can find that with the co ace now let's talk about what it's like when you actually use the Charlotte's Web him infuse bomb so you have to kind of screw it off which we've talked about and you'll notice that it's a slightly yellow the kind of waxy look I kind of compare it to like my my husband's chapstick if you will as you rub your finger on it you'll notice that it starts to melt on your hands and you'll also notice that it kind of goes on a little bit almost like wet or waxy feeling that thickness does stay on top of the skin for a few minutes but I feel like it helps to give your skin the ability to have extra time to absorb it but keep in mind if you're putting this on you might want to wait a little bit before putting your clothes on it because I wouldn't want you to have like an oil residue stain on it it does have a very light scent which I absolutely love and you will find that you start to notice the benefits of the supplement within about a half an hour I would say 20 minutes to a half an hour is when I start to notice that the absence of the severity of any residual pain that I have so let's talk about the top three reasons why you should use the Charlotte's Web hemp infuse balm first of all I think it smells pretty lovely second of all it goes on very easily you can basically put it on anywhere that ails yeah I'm putting it on my net because I'm a little bit stiff today and within about a half an hour I'm gonna start to notice that the muscles on my neck are gonna start to relax and it's it feels like the inflammation is going down because of the CBD and other natural substances that they add into the product I also love the fact that this stuff comes in fairly affordably in terms of a topical CBD product this is a really great way to test out a CBD product especially if you're new because it's a very convenient size and it is very very affordable the things that you might want to keep in mind when you are purchasing a topical supplement is that although this is a very durable container it can be somewhat difficult if you have stiff hands or stiff fingers or a loss of dexterity of any sort it can be a little bit tricky the other thing to keep in mind is although I find the scent very pleasant if you are sensitive to essential oils or since in general this does have a smell to it so if you get triggered like with headaches or whatever definitely keep that in mind as well when you're looking for this looking at this supplement so let me summarize everything we've talked about and one little little present with a bow on it the value that you get with the Charlotte's Web hemp infused balm is a fairly concentrated topical product that contains no preservatives it is organic it is non-gmo and vegan friendly the Charlotte's Web company does certify cGMP and they are US hip Authority certified so you know you're getting a very good quality product it is lightly scented with essential oils and this one container the smaller 150 size does last quite a while this stuff has a little bit goes a long way but keep in mind it can be somewhat difficult to open if you have a little bit of loss of dexterity or stiffness and fingers and because it does contain essential oils there the the cent factor so if you're sensitive to that keep that in mind as well it does come in very affordably priced especially for this lower concentrated the 150 size the half and outside so it's very affordable but it could be somewhat difficult to open up I absolutely love it and I think you will too have you tried it let me know leave some comments down below and let me know if you've tried the hemp infused balm or if you've tried another Charlotte's Web product I would love to know what your results were like my name is Jennifer Dixon again I'm with green valley nation and make sure you like and subscribe to this channel so you can stay up to date on all of the latest CBD

than the traditional systems that hold you back from being as happy healthy and as peaceful as you can be so my company is you're worth more calm why oh you re worth more calm and today I want to do a little video on CBD for joint pain you know I've I don't have my focus is generally on mental stress that's a lot of what I've been through anxiety depression that kind of stuff but I have I am I have become very active I always haven't always been very active for a while when mental stress and all that stuff kind of took over my life I became kind of sedentary but I had become very active and you know I get injuries and I have pain and I have muscle and joint pain so I've tried a lot of different CBD things for physical pain lots of bombs sprays oils lots of different things and a lot of them are okay you know they make you a little bit tingly you know they have some mint in there I mixed in with some CBD and they feel okay but nothing that was really impactful for me and until I found a product that really you know really had a big impact on how I felt on you know where my injury was or you know whatever was chronically it was like just needling me at that point or you know if this was a joint or muscle or you know just a limb in general that I injured I've I've had a few I've strained and muscle in my back so I could barely get up off the gym floor my wife also she hurt her back she also smashed her thumb with a hammer so pretty some pretty painful things that's you know would need something that's pretty strong and pretty effective to to help it so what I wanted to do today since I actually found something that I think can have a big impact on you know your joint pain or your muscle pain or whatever kind of chronic physical pain and got going on I wanted to do a little video for that so I wanted to share this this this product is from enliven its essentials so you can see that there and live in essentials this is their full-spectrum phyto cannabinoid healing cream for aches and pains so this yeah this is the first product I've had that just it just really really helped it it took away you know my discomfort its was just uh was just want to help me sleep when I you know when I when pain was keeping me up it helped me sleep and help me move around when I really messed up my back it helped me be more mobile so it's cysts this is the only product I've really found that a topical product that I've really found that I think is is really impactful I always recommend that you take you know something you ingest something and put something topical I think that's obviously the most powerful way to go at you know the different aches and pains and things you have going on for more info on you know different CBDs you know hit me up I'll have some links below to my website if you you know you're someone who has lots of different stuff going on maybe some mental stress too I'll have a link to this product but I will also have you know a link to

you soon bye", "tEZ6k5phQhc": "what is going on everybody everyone's doing good bring out the tank top you know I like to primarily stay covered up but I'm like art it is just way too hot out here I need to yeah I'm dying so tank top but I'll be back full code when I hit the gym today but um let's get right to it what's going on with the CBD oil CBD muscle rubs you guys rocking rocking with it or whether I know for me I'm sure you guys have seen over the last like couple years it's just been like this whole influx of try and CBD and the benefits of things like that and I mean I knew about it early on like I knew about it years years ago you know CBD oils and they put it like a tea forms and things like that and I was a little skeptical at first because at the time there really at least least for me I wasn't able to really define a lot of like information on it as far as like okay show me some science like I hear you you know I know if we smoke or something like that smoke some weed or something yeah everybody will feel relaxed but on as far as like the CBD I didn't know I really didn't know about it but you know as years went by you know the signs started really come out and it was really saying like hey this can really help specifically for me I was like okay is there to help with like soreness inflammation just can it get me back in the gym sooner so I started to try it I got my hands on it it was just like some CBD oil where I was like putting it in water it's like alright I'm gonna give it a shot I'm gonna see what's going on and I'm kind of feeling little better I gave at the time I gave it like a month I'm like I'm gonna use it strictly for a month I forgot the dosages and how much I was taking all that it doesn't matter you know but I definitely was taking him and after me I was just like okay in comparison to when I was not using it I actually do feel a difference surprising you know I do feel different I mean I didn't continue to take it you know cuz whatever I had I just used it for until it basically ran out I just like a hurry to school you know wasn't something that was on my list to buy though it's like alright if I come across a pool I'll pick it up but if not I'm not gonna really worry about it so time went by blah blah blah but then I got my hands on some but anyway it's CBD muscle rub the showers it's like is it just gonna be like menthol and it's just gonna burn whatever spot I put it on so of course some would think it works cuz that's what I think about a lot of these muscle rubs I mean some do work I'm not gonna hate on all of them some definitely work and I know plenty you guys out there try them and some of you feel some of you don't listen at this point I've tried so many different the tiger balm bio freeze everything under the Sun because got a couple of injuries throughout the years and I'm just waking up sore a lot of days I'm not recovering so I'm like all right you know muscle rub pretty much every day I'm putting something on I'm smelling like bengay out here but I got my hands on the CBD muscle rope and even though I used CBD I still was very skeptical with the muscle work I was like this this isn't gonna this isn't it now we're just trying to make money now we're just trying to capitalize on the whole craze this is Fugazi whatever but I'll give it a shot I'll give it a shot and that's nothing with CBD oils right so I definitely believe it works CBD definitely works but it all depends a great getting fit because as with anything if it's a phrase people are gonna try to make money off of it so it's gonna be a ton of other companies just coming out that they're not releasing the product and they're just trying to slap it on the label you know put yeah you could put CBD on the label and put a little bit of CBD in it but that doesn't mean it's gonna work just like when you go to the store and you want to buy something organic it's not really the whole thing isn't organic it just has to be a above certain percentage be able to put the label to put it on the label that it is organic right same thing with CBD it just has to be above a certain percentage of CBD natural product for it to be considered a CBD relief or CBD you know joint soup or whatever the case may be so that's a little thing that's hot that's how do you like to get us you know that's why you know unfortunately now it's a different ballgame right like you can if you want you can eat healthy on a budget when they try to you order like your supermarket and it puts OH all organic and they're trying to hustle us you got to go to your Whole Foods Market you know or get a locally sourced that is the the the upside about me living out here in the south is where I can get a lot of things locally sourced I can straight up like I know where it's actually you know grown from you know I know where it's coming from I get damn there drive there if I wanted to you know and that's that's what we really gain fresh stuff if you can you know listen I get it I mean things is costly you don't have access to it but just try to do the best that we can could we know at the end of the day we can train as much as we want it's almost that's not what this video is about that's so I got the CBD muscle robe I was like all right love two weeks I'll give it two weeks and I'll see what happens I guess that was skeptical I was a shy and just be alone like I'll just give it an honest opinion so I use it on my lower back like on my elbow but particularly on my lower back I haven't used any other big muscle rubs or anything like that in a while so all right let's give it a shot give it to me cuz you balance to admit I don't know I do feel the difference and what was different about this one which really kind of sold me was like when you put other one muscle rubs on it just starts to burn and essentially because it's like so hot you forget that that area is really hurting you're just morning thinking about that is just burning there wasn't a burn to it that was the interesting part about it there was not any burning feeling like you felt I mean a small tingle but like not nothing like when you put on like tiger balm on for example and it's like okay my back's on fire right depend on how much you put on I didn't fit and I put a good amount of like I really like layered on this cream or this South what everyone would call it and there wasn't a burning sensation and I was just like and when I didn't feel the burn I was like oh this is just trash there right but thirty minutes you know into it it feels warm but it's not to the point where I'm like it was just a warm sensation like almost like I had it really felt like I had a heat paddle and that was just comfortable okay okay cool and like I said once the first week went by you know when I would wake up and just expect to feel a certain you know feeling you know cuz I was putting it on before training and I was putting on at night that's usually my little regimen and I'm kind of good right now and then over time I was it's like I'm feeling really good and honestly I don't feel any pain I gotta admit like I feel good you know so I'm gonna keep rocking with it for the you know another two weeks well base until this whole thing whatever yeah you guys just take my word for it let me see if I can ease these openings you can see the color of it but um I'm gonna keep rocking with it see so it's like [Music] so I'm gonna keep rocking with you guys like this was kind of crazy to me I'm gonna keep it up I'm gonna see what happens yeah a believer you believe her now and I mean look they're not sponsoring me so I'm not gonna drop one company and this and that and just figure it out just fine just find it there's some barbers ones out there but there are definitely some good ones out there so I'm a believer I'm gonna keep it up we're gonna see what happened they said it went from okay so we're back it's you know massage isn't working none of that I've been using this and yes I'm doing the trick so now I'm curious to see like okay if I do let's say a muscle rub in conjunction with ingesting it how would that you know play out so I'm I'm on it I'm on it guys like I have to admit I'm really a firm believer in the CBD movement and I think there's just more science resistance it's going to start coming out and more products are gonna come out and it's just gonna get better and better so you know this is someone from this is coming from someone who was 100% skeptical hippo eyes like I did not believe it but I'm a fan this stuff works well let me just correct myself I believed ingesting it works worked and I'm a firm believer like when I was ingesting it I definitely agree okay this stuff works but the topical stuff I did not believe it and now using it forever for two weeks and gonna continue to use it I'm curious to see what are like how much more of a benefit I can get from it because yeah so I believe believer so I want to just talk to you guys about that share that with you and I said I'm out of here guys I'll see you in a bit more videos on the way", "RybfqE03gmI": "Sometimes our digestive system can stand in\nour way. Now, what I mean by that is, when you take\nsome kind of oral supplement or an oral compound, you have a level of degradation that occurs\nsimply because your digestive system breaks things down. Now, does that mean that it's bad? No, absolutely not. Does it mean that oral compounds don't work? Absolutely not. That is not what I'm saying, but what I am\ntrying to allude to is the fact that if you have a specific area where you're trying to\nget some relief, let's say in the way of maybe some stiffness or anything like that, well,\nCBD can work in a transdermal topical form, and because it ends up skipping that oral\ndegradation and that gut biome degradation, you might have a better chance of relief at\nthat given area. You see, a lot of the pain in our body can\nbe indirectly or directly triggered by what is called inflammation. Now, one of the unique properties of CBD is\nthat it helps promote the healthy modulation of inflammation within the body. So, what that means is that it works upon\ninflammatory cytokines, things that would normally trigger inflammation, and a lot of\ntimes you'll have these inflammatory cytokines or have inflammation at a localized source. So, in essence, if you use some kind of topical,\nit makes it so you could potentially directly affect that inflammation at that very spot. You see, one of the major roles of CBD is\nthat it slows the cytokine production of immune cells. So, when you take it orally, you're working\nat a systemic level, but when you take it topically, you're working at the very topical\nlevel, although you do have some effect that still trickles down to the system overall. Now, additionally, CBD is unique because it\nactivates what is called the TRPV receptor. Okay. This TRPV1 receptor is also known as a vanilloid\nreceptor, and it controls a cell signaling protein, if you will. So, it controls this mechanism from the top\ndown, as far as inflammation is concerned, which is pretty neat. So, when you're looking, again, at the modulation\nof inflammation within the body, this could be a really cool way to target some of your\njoint pain, maybe some of your stiffness, things like that. Now, let's jump over really quick to a study. Okay, this interesting study was done on rats. Now, I know what you're thinking. Because it's done on rats, it's not applicable\nto humans. Well, no, it still is applicable. We could still take the common knowledge and\nthe common denominator from this study and apply it over to humans. So, this study took a look at rats that had\narthritis. So, they induced arthritis in their specific\nareas of their body, in their joints. Okay? Then they applied four days of 6.2 milligrams\nof CBD topical. Okay? It was really interesting what they found\nout, okay. They found that it significantly reduced the\njoint inflammation. So, what they found is that the joints, on\naverage, went from 72 millimeters all the way down to 65.6, in just a four-day span. Now, millimeters, we're talking small little\nrat joints here. So, that's a lot. So what they're finding is that the inflammation\nthat comes in from arthritis could be modulated by the CBD in this particular case. So, we translate that over to how it could\nwork for someone's given ailment as a human. You can see that there's a lot of potential\nbenefits. Pretty wild stuff. Now, the cool thing is, is that you don't\njust have CBD coming into the equation when you look at Octagon Biolabs. Okay, there's beeswax in the mix, okay, and\nbeeswax draws moisture into the skin, which is really interesting. So, it makes it so not only the skin is healthier,\nbut it makes it so that you're going to be able to hold in the compound a little bit\nbetter, as well. Additionally, MCT oil, which is going to make\nit so that there's a little bit more of a moisturizing effect, but also lavender oil,\nso there's a calming effect, and lastly, eucalyptus oil, which has a unique property when it comes\ndown to being antibacterial, but also being calming and potentially anti-inflammatory\nas well. So, when it comes down to utilizing CBD for\na specific thing within the body, a topical CBD might just be the solution for you. So, there are a lot of ways that CBD can affect\ndifferent things within the body from an anti-inflammatory standpoint, acting upon endocannabinoid receptors\nlike CB1 and CB2. But when it comes down to brass tacks, being\nable to directly impact where your pain points are, or directly impact where you're having\nsome bothersome issues, that might just be the quickest line from point A to point B.\nSo, as always, make sure you're keeping it locked in here with Octagon Biolabs. I'll see you soon.", "-7Jd5fiD4CA": "Green compass topicals are designed to target muscle aches joint discomfort skin irritations and more our soothes natural body cream is a non scented THC free

series on CBD which is the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant and the healing benefits that you can gain from that I want to start today with a showing you some products these are topical creams and these creams come in regular strength and extra strength and then I also have a CBD cooling stick so I want to show you some options for healing if you have joint or muscle pain particularly arthritis or if you have sore muscles from your workouts or any other thing you twisted your ankles or a carpal tunnel syndrome for example anything where your joints or your muscles have been affected and you're looking for a non-prescription and non-medicated type of cream or non-pharmaceutical I should say this is plant medicine and I'm going to just simply show you how this is used this is extra strength and the extra strength comes in a little container like this and and really speaking you just apply it like any other cream if I have a little bit of soreness around my joints so I'm gonna take this extra strength and rub it in and generally speaking I feel the relief in about 15 minutes or so and I like to do this in the morning first thing in the morning and then I also do this at the end of the day just before I'm getting into bed you could apply to three times a day in order to feel the soothing effect over the course of the entire day it depends on your schedule depends on how often you want to use the cream but this one works really well you can see that it's not very greasy it's not - it's easy to absorb into the skin and if goes on really nice and there's no scent on this at all so this is an option if you've got joint or muscle pain this is an extra strength CBD cream healing balm so that you can heal topically the other option if you're experiencing inflammation so let's say you have an injury and it's a it's a it's a pain that feels inflamed so there's a bruise it's feeling warm to the touch the other option is to take cooling stick and so this cooling stick you apply it it's in the shape of a deodorant and you take the stick cover off roll it up a little bit and then apply this to your skin and you'll feel a cooling relief almost immediately and then this one also includes a little bit of the smell of peppermint so using regular essential oils this has a cooling effect and also a great way to work through any topical pain so the option is here rather than to go for something from the pharmacy or from the drugstore is to take mother nature's course first is to apply a little bit of plant medicine notice how it feels this I've seen also my clients use if they've experienced some tenderness or soreness after they've done a yoga class and they come out and they have applied some of this cream and in to great effect so I wanted to share that option with you if you're looking to purchase some of these you can click the link below and you'll have access to all of the different products that are available and remember this is CBD so there's no psychoactive effect you won't feel hi this is on your skin and a great way to leverage what we know about plant medicine is that it works very intuitively with your everyone

start reviewing some products that I've been testing for the last few months I don't have my own line yet but I am working on that so in the meantime as a wholesaler I wanted to start reviewing some of the products I don't know if that many of you know this but I've been a cannabis user for 10 years not just the THC but CBD and him Boyle as well so a few of the ailments that I use cannabis for are from migraines anxiety back pain I have a disease that doesn't allow me to eat without my esophagus being relaxed so PTSD anxiety you know a lot of things that a lot of veterans have and other ailments such as anxiety that a lot of the United States has so I wanted to show you a product that could work three ways all right I love this so this is summit CBD pink cream and I first got this to help alleviate the pain in my back I have some slip discs and osteo arthritis so I wanted to see if it helped me in the mornings or at night whenever it hurts the most so that's the first thing I use this for and it worked really great it's very subtle you will see a difference if you apply it directly on the area that is hurting and you have to rub it in and it does penetrate into the skin and it's able to alleviate some of those symptoms in the back area another way I use this was for my eczema and dry skin my shins get um dry and especially here in Colorado the weather is very dry so I'm more susceptible to getting dry skin and uh you know I don't know if many of you know about eczema but it's it's so itchy in them by the time you scratch you're like oh my gosh you know then you have like all little scratches on your like because you just need relief so I use that the summit CBD cream for that as well and most recently I wanted to see if it helped my migraines so I usually get migraines one week they are in the right side of my forehead and then they go down and then I get a couple days of relief and then the following week it goes on my left side and sometimes it goes to the back of my head and most recently due to weather change and pressure it was right in here for me so that I did since you can't see my other areas I'm gonna put it on you just take the cream just like that and then I actually have a migraine today but I've been vaping which is another review but what I do is I put it right where it's hurting and it usually hurts in the upper right forehead like I said so I just put it on there just a little bit like you would face cream right and I could not believe my bank rains are excruciating and my it affects me so bad so I was super surprised that I had found a topical that actually helped with my migraines so this is a three-fold definitely worth the money I use it for my back pain my migraines and for my dry skin and eczema so if any of you are interested or have any questions about this I'd be happy to answer it this cream comes in 200 milligrams CBD infused topical cream and it has a really nice gentle smell it's not overwhelming and it's not intrusive to your senses so this is definitely a cream that I would recommend for you so if you have any questions please leave them and comments or you can reach out to me directly at the pure list at gmail.com the imperialist is spelled HTM pu r al is T and I look forward to seeing what you have to say and when I get to my next product I hope to see you here as well so I will see you

the body so the reason why I got this was my mother has a herniated disc and I'm using discs for her pain management so the symptoms that she has is sort of akin to the very numb feeling in your limbs and also the sort of electrical sort of tingly feeling that you get when you are very numb or that you've sat in one place at a time except it's a lot more painful so this will help in her pain management mainly for her spine in her herniated disc so she will rub this on her limbs or on areas that are very numb sometimes it's in her neck sometimes it's in her trapezoidal area so the main ingredients for this is CBD so what CBD is it is the main active ingredients in marijuana so I'm gonna open up this sort of a hemp bomb here and disappointment and straws show you how it looks so this here is the plus CD brand and the reason why I got this was mainly because it's distributed by CVS so it speaks to the quality and the thoroughness of which they vetted the company so this is destroyed by CV Sciences in so hopefully in in the CVS stores now other areas that people use this for is sort of for relaxation if they are stressed you know they they will use this I've read that they put it sort of on the under sole of their feet and it helps them sleep better and it relaxes them so this is a very natural homeopathic solution to you know some of the pain management and also the stress management so I'm going to open this up and show you exactly what's in it so this does cost $50 for the one point three ounces and this does last a long time some people say it lasts you know 30 days to 90 days so I'm just gonna remove this wrapper here and show you the ointment now the ointment doesn't smell you know it's it's not like tiger balm or any of the other sort of aunt mints that have a very strong smell and you can see here you know what what it sort of looks like so I'm gonna zoom in and give you a better look and give you a little you know so so the texture of it is more or less like Vaseline and it does not smell I mean it has a very very subtle mental smell but it's not strong where it's like tiger balm and it fills the room so just keep that in mind and just going around the bottle here just to give you a better look it is CBD oil and it is the extra-strength version and I will have these links in the description area it is a hundred milligrams of CBD and once again C D stands for cannabidiol which is the active ingredient in marijuana without the psychedelic or the sort of hallucinogenic aspects of marijuana and I mean just go around and you could see the consistency of the bomb here is sort of like Vaseline but it's not as liquidy or as thick if you look right on my finger but there you go that's what I wanted to show and I hope this helps and please subscribe and thank you for watching", "d3pNjEWEak4": "hi guys okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so CBD cream seemed to fit the bill and actually it worked really well and I'm really glad I tried it so I want to share with you my top 5 today so if after this review you want to try CBD creams as well just click on the link in the video description for the best CBD deals alright so in fifth place I put met Tara's CBD rapid cooling cream these guys are for the cream in two strengths we've got the 250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and want to take it one step further so this bundle includes the broad spectrum CBD soft gel capsules with curcumin these are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD which is perfect for daily and consistent consumption to make sure that you have a smooth start to your day they also have the broad-spectrum pure CBD drops which are also packed with 25 milligrams of CBD another way to consume CBD if you're out of capsules you can just take a few drops as is there ginger sytrus flavored or you can simply add to a protein shake or a post-workout snack and the third product is the broad spectrum muscle and joint stick that's loaded with 500 milligrams a full spectrum hemp oil that's great for on-the-go application if you're feeling some discomfort you know as you're working out outside and that's usually two hundred and fifty dollars but they're selling it for 195 but again if you want the best prices click the link in the video description it gets updated regularly with the best deals alright moving on to number two which is the ultra relief gel from just CBD just CBD is one of my favorite CBD brands they have a ton of product variety to choose from so the ultra relief gel comes at $59.99 for a thousand milligrams of CBD this one is great if you're looking for big CBD dosage at an affordable price the smell is not overpowering the pump makes it really easy to use and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in

description for tons of information on CBD and the best CBD store on the market today some people experience side effects when taking CBD and there are other factors to consider before using CBD oil for pain the biggest precaution is the interaction with any medications you may be taking CBD is one of more than 120 compounds called cannabinoids many plants contain cannabinoids but people most commonly linked them to cannabis both marijuana and hemp based products unlike other cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol THC CBD does not produce a euphoric high or psychoactive effect this is because CBD does not affect the same CBD receptors as THC the human body has an endocannabinoid system that receives and translate signals from cannabinoids it produces some cannabinoids of its own which are called endocannabinoids the ecs helps to regulate functions such as sleep immune system responses and pain when THC enters the body it produces a high feeling by affecting the brains endocannabinoid receptors this activates the brain's reward system producing pleasure chemicals such as dopamine CBD is an entirely different compound from THC and its effects are very complex it is not psychoactive meaning it does not produce a high or change a person's state of mind but it influences the body to use its own endocannabinoids more effectively CBD stops the body from absorbing in and imide a compound associated with regulating pain so increased levels of Ananda might in the bloodstream tense reduce the amount of pain of person feels this is a great find for people in chronic

the process normally used is cold pressing basically squeezing the oil from the cannabis plant studies on CBD oil and pain management have shown a great deal of promise CBD can offer an alternative for people who have chronic pain and rely on more dangerous habit-forming medications like opioids but there needs to be more research in order to verify the pain relieving benefits of CBD oil CBD

relieve chronic pain researchers concluded CBD is effective in overall pain management without adverse side effects they also noted that CBD was beneficial in treating insomnia related to chronic pain

wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks for watching see you next time", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "3P9Dz3G-nIo": "it's a great day to talk cbd creams and oils for topical pain relief i'm dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "ucw8dRNNCv4": "MAINTAIN A STRONG BOND EVEN\nTHROUGH THE TURBULENT YEARS.

I know this is a very very controversial subject Whether it's legal illegal. Whether it should be or shouldn't be whether it should be only used for medical purposes Recreational I know the gist and I just I I everyone has an opinion And I would love if you guys just kept your opinions to yourself I wanted to try something new and natural for me because I'm not the one to take pain pills when I was approached about trying some CBD oil I Jumped right on board I am so excited to be working with CBD bio natural CBD oil They sent me some CBD oil to try and see what I liked what I didn't like if it will work for me If I'm gonna continue using it and so I'm gonna be reviewing This little guy if you don't know what CBD oil it is the non THC It's the oil that doesn't give you a high. There's no THC in some of them some of them Do have low doses of THC this one on the other hand does not it is vegan gluten free all-natural No THC made in America. This is an oil that has no THC, which I didn't I don't care I don't I've never tried CBD oil before this this brand is 250 milligrams CBD drops hemp extract in MCT oil this brand recommends you take a dropper full or two Once or twice a day depending on how much you need it when I started using this I started at half a dropper Just because I didn't know how my body was gonna react, and I wanted to start out a smaller dose Just just to get the feel of it so I started with half a dropper it helped a little bit and so the next time I upped it to a dropper and I tried to keep it around there there were some days that I did do it two droppers at a time and When you only have a small bottle like this It roughly only lasts about a week, and this brand is about 38 dollars a bottle Which can be kind of spendy but for an all-natural product I can understand but If I continue using this brand I would have to probably buy a bottle a week which can get kind of hefty There are so many benefits to CBD oil And I will have them all in a blog post for you guys. You can click a link down in my description I have this all mapped out for you guys In my blog I don't have to just go into so much detail here in my video the taste of this brand Stuff they don't put any extra flavoring they keep it all natural so it does have a bitter taste Which for me I I couldn't handle it. I could not take it without a chaser It was I couldn't do it, No so if I do continue using this I don't I don't know that that's a big factor for me because If I'm like at a store, and I don't have a drink, but I want it or need it That could be an issue for me. Just because I couldn't it would make me gag It's just it's one of those things But it does it's natural, and it's just a hemp oil you can taste the bitterness of it I do recommend CBD oil I'm not a doctor I can't tell you that it's magical and it will work for everyone and da da da da da, but for me I will be continuing using it I did see many positive things From using it, and I didn't suffer any side effects which was awesome like I said this brand has no THC I did not feel high. This is just 100% for pain, and I absolutely love that I think that brand is 100% awesome I will have a link to their website down in the description section But the only downside is the taste and I couldn't do it also I do believe if I wanted to buy more I would find a company or See if they have like a higher dose because when you research CBD oil a lot of the companies are like Take 5 to 10 drops and Here I am taking one to two dropper filled things, and so it's not a very high dose which I think Personally I do need but if you have low pain I think this is 100% perfect. You can buy it online it's legal in all 50 states. There's no THC You will not get high None that jazz and I honestly think that every person should try it if they have chronic pain like I said, I'm not a doctor You don't have to try it. I don't care everyone has an opinion on this I know it's super controversial, but it works for me and I was pleasantly surprised, so I will be continuing to use CBD oil if I use this brand. I don't know We'll see. I don't know I know there are a bunch of other ways you can use CBD oil I know there is CBD flowers. I know you can vape CBD. I know that there's other oils There's other brands with flavored oils. I know that there are bath bombs and bath salts and bath scrubs and lotions and CBD infused Pretty much everything else And I'm really excited to try some of those products like the bath salts and the bath bombs and see if those maybe help with My aches and pains, but like I said Medical marijuana did work for me. I am excited to see what else I can learn from using it I would love to know if you use CBD oil if so what brand what's your favorite? Do you vape it do you use oils you smoke it? Thank you guys so much for watching and supporting me. If you haven't already please subscribe to my channel I make new videos every Tuesday and Friday, and I will see you guys in my next video, but until then stay positive bye guys  ", "iGcGS66Qk8A": "hey everybody I've just been having some problems - problems fun taking a thumbnail for this video I think I needed some twenty dollar bills to have in flash in one hand I've made lots of money on my CBD bomb I am known all over the county and people send people it's infectious and the CBD bomb is beating cheaper to produce a hundred and eighty-seven farmers Hey a hundred and eighty-seven farmers in Alabama have harvested this year for the first time and in Tennessee they have even more and they're even having a problem because they don't have enough producers to actually produce their hemp into oil within a time period that's reasonable from the point that they harvest and they're trying to figure out what to do how you know can we take it across state lines and then will it be legal because you're supposed to produce to grow it and produce it within your own agricultural department program and so then that means you take it to another state's agricultural program and so they're trying to work this thing out because they got more hemp than they know what to do with so hemp is fixing the bottom but that's a good thing because there's lots of people out there hurting and there's lots of people on fixed incomes that it should not cost them so much to be pain free right so anyway I have held off you know I put my recipe right out there on face on YouTube and YouTube called me a drug addict and a drug pusher and they they took my videos down and anything that had the word hemp even hemp oil soap they took them all down and so I just you know just quit doing it but everybody's like you know they want the recipe so then I said well I'll start doing online classes regarding CBD products and other things and so finally the day has came tomorrow we or the how to make Kimberly CBD famous famous midi bomb and I'm gonna be giving you the recipe tomorrow is the discussion class yes they attacked a lot of channels let me tell you they took down some of the biggest channels they had at everything but in any case now it's risky this video I'll probably have to delete it because I use the words CBD and I don't want to have any trouble with my channel it's just scary you know I have grandkids videos and whenever the haters was attacking my channel they were actually attacking my videos that had my grandchildren in it and calling them names it was horrible but onto the positive we have our tie-dye rays coming up with positive vibes and what we're talking about is if you want to tomorrow is the discussion class and that's where we're going to discuss the recipe hopefully and all the different options you know can I put this in it can I put this in it can I trade this essential oil can can I use this essential oil can I use this additive can I do can I make a cream instead can I do this can I do that how about this I'm gonna go over all of that including the different attitudes that I'm aware of that might be beneficial like arnica oil turmeric oil things of that sort and we're gonna just it's going to be all about getting you ready to make the bomb making sure you understand absolutely everything you need to understand to change the recipe to suit yourself in every possible way and or why everything that's in this recipe is in this recipe of what it does all right and and then how it works and then the next class is the actual make it day class where I will be making it definitely giving you the recipe detailed by detail showing you exactly how to make it so that you can make the big bucks yourself because there are so many people out there hurting and like I have vendors who buy my bomb and if they accidentally run out without ordering they go into hyperventilation mode because customers once a customer uses this you know this is life or death sometimes this is whether I can go to work or not this is whether I can maintain to clean my house or take care of my children I mean that's how severe it can be sometimes in our customers opinion when they come in and we are getting low and we're worried about running out or we haven't got our supply in and we're low and we're fixing to make more and the fear that we will be out and we try never to run out we only did that one time and we don't everyone do that again so so if by chance you would like to invest and get the absolutely how exactly I make it and let me teach you everything about how I put this recipe together why I put it together the way I did and teach you everything I know about this recipe we're doing that and you go to WWE so P kiss is calm if you're a club member you do get the class much cheaper you get all the classes cheaper but you don't have to do that you don't have to be a member you can just be paid the non-member price it is higher but and you'll get to come in and be a part of the class just like everybody else we've created a secret a secret page on Facebook that you can't even find you can even see that thing and unless you have been invited to join it and so whenever you whenever you pay for the class then I get a hold of you I start sending text messages start calling cuz after you pay you go fill out a form and and you just do all this stuff and then boom we get you on Paige and tomorrow at 6 o'clock we start preparing for the class usually it starts about 6:30 but we go ahead you know we try to go ahead and get the video open and put some music on and let people start coming in and then we do the class usually the classes last thing you want from an hour and a half to two hours sometimes longer and we're gonna do discussion class if you're a member that's only fifty bucks and then then on I think it's November 27th we've had a few people wanting us to push it a little bit closer so that they can go ahead and make it for Christmas for their Christmas shows so we're gonna ask folks if they want to finish the class a little sooner for those who were wanting to do that see if that's agreeable but in any case then we're gonna have make it day and if you're a member that's $125 for making day and that's when you absolutely get the recipe and and and I just wanted to make sure you know and then we're going to be doing how to make the cream as well coming up and and so I just you know I just wanted to get out here because my husband's sister passed away and we have just been a little bit incognito you feel notice I haven't been posted on Facebook my husband received like eight days off bereavement pay and so I let him just recoup at the house for a couple of days and then I took him out in the woods in our camper and we just tried to be with nature and and just tried to you know just let him recoup we both do better outside you know and so I haven't been able to really promote the class as I normally would and of course we've got plenty of people on the page so what happens is it's just like this you will go on Facebook and get on the page and then boom there I'll be going pay on a video on the page and and we'll all you sit down at home with your pencil and paper in a convenient spot I can't see you you can only see me but you can comment and ask questions and it's a go live video on Facebook and what's really wonderful about it is if you can't be there when it happens then you can come back and watch it later you get two weeks on the page and dear until the you'll actually be on the page and you won't be taken off until after the second class and then two weeks after it then you'll be taken off but then if you can't afford this right now because it's fixing me Christmas and you want to wait till next month I mean the month after Christmas well then you can come in and we'll have a special deal for a recorded price only it'll probably be just a touch cheaper but you can't ask questions you just have to put it what other people asked so anyway I just want to let everybody know about the class because that's what I get messages on all the time where's that burst the video can you give me the recipe and I've always said well I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class I'm gonna do that class well now I'm doing that class and and now CBD should become much easier to get a hold of and much cheaper to purchase so yes you won't be able to charge maybe just as much as you was for it but you'll be able to purchase it in such quantity that you'll be able to make more and have a better ample sale and be able to sell it you know instead of just being able to afford to make ten jars because of how expensive the isolates are now you'll be able to make 50 jars and and spend possibly the same amount of money on your eye slits and we sell isolates to members we have that for five grams for $90 including your shipping and you might find it cheaper somewhere else but that's we think it's really super cheap and it and our members have been enjoying that we also sell green Rhodes CBD in bulk all of their edibles in their drops and whatnot to members because they will not sell to someone who doesn't have a brick-and-mortar so you can put in an order for the things that you would like to resell at your booths or your places but if you've got a brick-and-mortar you can go get your own account but if you don't you can purchase it through me and I just try to be a blessing to you and so anyway and we're to have a how to make goat's milk soap with CBD in it and then I've promised everybody a more juice with cheaper classes we're gonna do a cheat class it's gonna be like twenty dollars how to make bar number seven how to make bar number nine you know and maybe fifteen dollars on the recorded version well you can't ask questions and so we're gonna have some classes that are only gonna be available to members but they're gonna be very reasonably priced and and everybody's always want to know exactly how to make some of my bars and I'll tell you exactly how to make that bar and then you can go and make that bar exactly like I told you and you can make wonderful money selling that bar and people can give you hugs and kisses and tell you that's the best soap you ever used I keep winning all these things you know people put my soaps in contests all the time and I always seem to win and I never even know about it till afterwards they'll call me you won you won and it's really great then it's some FDA FDA he was at a college and the FDA was doing a competition on a hot process soap and cold process soap and I won the hot process soap side-- plus-- I won overall and I didn't even know I didn't so so I'm telling you it's not me it's the soap it's just great recipes awesome soap recipes with good affordable recipes that you can make and make money and help people that's always fun so anyway if you would be interested you can go to www.hsn.com says w-w-w dot soapy SOA py kisses ki SS es comm and then if you're on your phone there's this little bitty box you with lines in it it's tiny so we decide you click on it and it'll tell you and you can pick classes available and you can see what's available and what we're fixing to do we also have some classes that what happened and they're down at the bottom and if you pay for one of those classes you just get to go right into that class and enjoy it for two weeks you can't ask questions like you can when it's a live class you know you can send me a message and ask for help but you know you can't ask questions like you normally could during the live class but you can still watch the class and learn from the class and I try to always make them nice and affordable and so I have several classes like that that's just waiting for you to take them and and all that good stuff now I have to answer questions hang up okay live chat there we go let me scroll down see if I've had my glasses on and I get some hellos and some I love yous hey April and Ramona Oh Pam hey Pam Elizabeth this stuff worked so well yes it does I had this one lady come in and she was a massage therapist and she said that when she woke up in the mornings that she couldn't even move her hands or her arms or her elbow she couldn't bend them and then in the mornings while she was waiting to try to you know limber up if she barely like thumped her hand on something the pain was so unbearable that she'd followed her knees it hurts so bad but she can rub my balm all the way up her arms and down her fingers and wake up the next morning completely and totally pain-free and go give people massages now that's some good stuff uh-oh I've lost me messages hang on I got to go back that's what I get for being such a talkative person here Denise hey measure oh there's Ramona it does it does so much food for so many people sherry hey Shadid there you go yeah they attacked a lot of channels I it was horrible yes she's making money off of it and I've augmented my recipe since then we've added things to it we've added essential oils to it to make it better and we've added we've changed it since it was originally went out and I think it works even better oh you love my shirt we sell these here at the store you know I'm just terrible pin spendthrift and I just couldn't seem to do it I just couldn't seem to take a shirt off the Shelf that I could sell to somebody gosh I love these shirts I just love these shirts and finally I just gave in and I got me one shirt and then I put in standard I had to have another one but there's this other one I've been eyeballing oh I gotta tell y'all guys a funny story hang on I got to tell you a funny story don't have nothing to do with CBD let me see but I got to make sure I get all of this yes I have augmented the pie the recipe Joanne and many people get that recipe and then they change it to suit them and sometimes they make devastating mistakes that really harms the way it works and it doesn't work as well and so what the discussion class is going to be about is making sure that you understand what each one of those products does for the recipe and why they're important and and also how they work and and then when you want to add something to it you know evaluating that item and of course you're going to be able to just throw things at me that you want to maybe add and then I'll be able to help you with whether it's a good idea or not because I've had people want to add stuff and oh you know they'll message me and stuff and I just think to myself I'm not gonna say a word but I'll tell them no no no don't do that well no no and this is why I don't do that so instead of telling thousands of people one day at a time I'm gonna tell everybody all at one time so that's what these classes are really about because my phone goes off 90 to nothing all the time you know and I don't mind my husband sometimes days but I don't mind because I love people and and everything but it is difficult to to teach a recipe one person at a time on the phone but when you can just have an online class that everybody can just sit down at home open up their device get on their facebook click on the page and sit back with pencil and paper and and and just suck me dry and then ask questions be able to get answers that's the way and do a whole bunch of people at one time and then from now on when somebody asks they want to say this class is above all go to soapy kisses comm class is available and go down to the bottoms and so that way I can hopefully help everybody from now on that way all right let's say oh hey Norway I know that name I'm you I'm not sure I'd say it right I just hate when I can't say names right but hey in Norway yes ok she says I love your soap recipes I have many soaps that I use your recipes and not only do I love them but my customers love them and that's what we need I have people all the time that tell me that ah there you go she had to see me do everything one of my favourite things at CBD coffee it's freaking expensive but I love it for Jennifer that says that CBD doesn't work for her the the main reason that Sydney doesn't D doesn't work for you is if you have been taking pharmaceutical pain medication for years you have built a tolerance up and so that means that you've got to have a large amount of CBD per dose than in your average person and that's usually why CBD doesn't work for someone but I have found that topical CBD is not affected by this resistance issue and so when someone hurts and they get a good quality product and they rub it where it hurts tada it works even when taking it by mouth you know it just seems like nothing works and for those people who have fibromyalgia you rub it from the tip of the hairline all the way to the tip of the spine and I have designed this bomb to go deep in pop that blood vessel and travel up the blood vessel which is feeding the nerves all the way up and that calms all those nerves down and all that fake pain just shuts up I have had people just go can I hug you and I'm like yeah we just have ourselves a great big ol bear hug and I've had people cry on me kiss me everything in the world with fibromyalgia but you just rub back stuff on the spine and then after it pops in you know then it goes up to the brain and it floods the brain with it and it calms all the nerves up their date on - I'm telling you it's wonderful stuff for fibromyalgia and the topical works sometimes when I've only had one person and all the years I've been selling it and all the customers that's walked in my door that's tried it which is absolutely almost everybody because we're constantly like would you like to put some of this you heard anywhere put some of this on put some of this on because it sells it say I've only had one man that said it didn't work for him on the topical out of all those people everybody's went like wow that gave me 80% pain relief or that oh it's completely gone friend of mine hurt himself and he had done quite a bit for me and so I just poked a thing in the mail to him and he sent me a message and he said oh my god complete and total frickin relief he said I just want to give you a hug and I said you're welcome and he said it's like a miracle and I think he had a hip damaged in Iraq and he was going through you know working with the doctors and I don't know what all they were doing with him but he was hurt and bad every step was super painful and then boom he could walk without pain and that's awesomeness and so anyway I know I get on it I love this stuff I know you'd never kept never picked out well you know I have a stronger version which you'll learn all the recipes when it comes to the bond and we find this for some people the stronger milligram lasts longer for them and it cuts their pain where the weaker one doesn't give them a hundred percent pain relief but that one does we call it the Terminator and and we but we do find that if this does a hundred percent of the job putting the extra strong went on there doesn't always do you any good so you commonly spent your money for nothing for the extra one so so anyway so it's a testing thing that's one of the reasons that we make these little one ounce jars we make these little one ounce jars just for that and now another thing I'm going to teach you is I'm going to teach you how to fill out your labels so that you won't have trouble with websites and with advertising your product and how to advertise it you know a lot of people give a lot of problem with CBD so I'm going to be teaching you how I label mine I worked with my wholesalers to find terminologies that was acceptable with the FDA and also would work with advertisers and I'll teach you how to advertise your product even advertise on Facebook how to advertise on different platforms that won't let you advertise we'll be going over that too and how to do your labels so that you'll be legal because that's important too and of course will be teaching sanitary so that you can make a healthy product that will not mold or have bacteria grow in it never think that we'll ever forget that part of it you've got to be sanitary sanitary sanitary and then when you get done with that you got to be extra sanitary so I'll teach you all of that we'll go through it's not just sitting down and saying put this in that and put here and heat this and poke it in there we're gonna start out with how to cleanse our surfaces all right and then how to cleanse everything we're gonna use and all that kind of stuff and the products that we use here we have a restaurant kitchen so we call it our FDA kitchen it's a three sink system with a hand washing on the side and then and we have certain chemical processes that goes in each one of them to make sure that everything's sanitary and then after they come out handling procedures of each item to make sure that we do it right because there is nothing worse than selling somebody something that moles especially if you've shipped it to them or if they don't live in the same city as you are and they expect for you not only to ship that product back to you and pay for it but also ship them a new one I went through it one time when Brambleberry sold me some preservative my opinion was already dead before they sent it to me and if it wasn't that it got killed in shipping because of the heat because they mailed it out right before the weekend and so therefore it's set in a transfer truck on Sunday and and but you know you can't prove anything like that but we just thought that's what we thought it was and we made hundreds of ounces of lotion and within two weeks or four weeks I think it was two weeks though at all well no it's sort of looking weird at two weeks and it started growing black stuff and green stuff no time after that and I had to pay for everything we took it to a show and sold it and we just had a little bit left and then the call started and we had to pay for every jar to come back and that is the only time I have ever had a product to mold ever I have never I've got test jars of batches I made eight years ago they've never been opened except for what I'm looking at him every once in a while and they've never fingers put in them and they're still just as pretty as the day I made them now if I sort of put my hand in there the preserve you probably couldn't hold up on that but for it to be contamination free you know in the jar it's still good after 8 years so so you know cuz preservative I supposed to live seen the ocean for eight years but anyway that's the only time we've ever had anything mold out of all those years and it was like I don't know four or six hundred ounces worth of product it'll in four ounce jars and we had to pay for every one of those jars to be mailed back and then make new find a preservative that was not dead and make new and ship it out and it was you know within the first few years of starting in this business and I'll tell you it was scary it was stressful and it was something I never want to go through again and so we teach people how to not let that happen to you even how to buy your preservative appropriately we're gonna be talking about all this kind of stuff so anyway I just want you to know we're fixing to have CBD bond class and it's interactive on Facebook and if you want to go to Sophie kisses dot-com and become a member then we'll get you on the member of a secret member page and then if you decide to pay for this class we're gonna go ahead and put you on the class it is a hundred and seventy five dollars and then we'll have the two classes and hopefully you will say wow I have learned so much and then you'll take your all of your knowledge and start selling CBD bomb and within a year people will be chasing you down on the side of the road for more because I know they chased me down let me tell you they do they they send people to left and right our business for CBD bomb just grows and grows and grows and grows and grows it's like a monster and we have a hard time keeping up with it sometimes and that's what can happen with you as well because this stuff is a miracle alright got a quick time now that look it's tight on the back alright so I gotta go home I gotta go take care of my husband and tomorrow I'm going to be doing this class you have I need you to pay by lunch if you can tomorrow if you can if you can't you're gonna have to get a hold of me on Facebook and send me a message or text me on my store number which is by the way anybody that pays text me on my store

get text messages I love you Pam I love all of you all right bye don't take any wooden nickels [Music]", "b5IMYHzYfd0": "disa no marijuana continue to unfold and for one little boy with a rare skin disorder it's been a near miracle well as 13 first reported last May his family was really in the dark they were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll

Scott Jacobson says cannabis taps into the nature of our own bodies the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed dr. Jacobson also says cannabis is known to reduce inflammation he's gonna do two for Carter and his family you get oh it's a giant leap forward relieved relieved and eager to find out more about what we

that's the 20 milligram dosage and for anybody who weighs more than 150 pounds you can adjust the dosage upward [Music] you", "Okpa6QMt51Q": "hi everyone welcome back today i'm going to talk about cbd products that i've been enjoying i've been a little bit more interested in cbd lately because it seems like you know it's this trendy ingredient that's now becoming a mainstay like i think we're going to just continue to see more and more of it so i'm gonna share the products i've been liking all right so let's talk about cbd in skincare products and in our beauty products and wellness products i first was not sold on this as an ingredient to look for just because it seemed a little too trendy the natural skeptic in me was kind of like are they just throwing it onto the label because it's cool to do it now it seems like it's an ingredient that's going to stick around and i think they're starting to find there are some real results that you can get from it it's a natural humectant so it does draw water but at the same time we tend to see it in oil form so we see it in moisturizers or we see it really truly like in an oil form so it can be a little bit confusing whether it's moisturizing or whether it is a humectant but it does draw water so i consider that to be a humectant the thing that stands out to me is that it's anti-inflammatory so that's why i think people really tend to like it when they feel achy is because it's anti-inflammatory so it just calms that inflammation in their bodies whether you have like eczema psoriasis if you have any type of sensitivity for your skin then it might be an ingredient that you can look into there have also been some early studies not conclusive studies but what they're also starting to find is that cbd could be good for oil production to control oil production so that's something that i'm also interested in i'm not 100 sold on that yet but it's something that people are starting to talk about and starting to use cbd for that reason but if you are using cbd truly just for its humectant and moisturizing properties then it definitely does that at the very least there are actually three reasons why i've been very interested in cbd just lately like very very recently in the past like month i've really been interested in it one is because i have scalp psoriasis so i get scabs on my scalp it's very dry it can get flaky it can just be very annoying to deal with like where my scalp just feels like it's almost on fire or it can be very itchy and stuff so because cbd can be hydrating and it can be anti-inflammatory i thought it might be an ingredient to look for in my scalp products another reason is because tada can you see this i'm like lifting up my ankle that's classy i hurt my ankle a month ago and i decided to buy a cream that had cbd in it and it really started to make me focus on cbd the cream has been amazing it's you know i don't know if it's because it has like the menthol type of ingredients in it or because it has the cbd or if it's the combination of both but i have loved it and so i you know i start to really put a little bit of a focus on oh like maybe i should be looking for cbd in some of my products and then the third reason honestly it's just been such a stressful year for everybody not just me i realized that it's been such a stressful year i've had so much anxiety i haven't slept well partially because it's been such a wild year but also because i'm coming out of that like first year of you know having a baby with isla and just starting to you know be able to get some sleep so cbd i'm really really late to it right now but i'm starting to become very interested in it for those reasons that said i'm i'm only just starting to get into it and starting to learn more about it so if you're interested in it or you do know a lot about cbd feel free to let me know more information about it because i'm very interested there are definitely products that i have tried in the past couple of months with cbd that have been so stupid and you know there is definitely a marketing aspect to the cbd products as well so that's also something to keep in mind just because it has cbd doesn't mean it's going to be a great product the other thing that's important to point out is that cbd oil and also hemp oil those are completely different types of ingredients than the thc that is in pot like in marijuana so if you are worried that you're going to get high from you know using like a cbd product you're not unless it says it has thc as well because i have seen those products too that have the combination most of them have some kind of a disclaimer that says it does not have thc it will not get you high and this is purely for the skin care benefits or like the wellness benefits of it all right so let's get into the product starting with this one this is the vita hemp cell energy ampoule and a big thank you to go selly for partnering with me on this video so in this serum they used one of my favorite skincare ingredients niacinamide and they paired it with cbd so that was really interesting to me and it's the reason why i start to give it a try i fully expected this to be kind of like a rich oil feel but it's not it feels like a light oil slash serum and it's kind of a fun application because it comes looking like it's almost in like in a vial and it comes with a little syringe there is no needle don't worry it comes with a little syringe that you you know pop into it and then you just pull out the amount that you're going to use and that keeps it all really fresh which i also think is very interesting because you know we're always talking about like keeping your ingredients fresh and making sure that they stay stable and everything and that's one way to ensure that so you pull out a little bit and then you apply it just like you would a serum it's very hydrating to the skin it immediately starts to plump your skin and give you those hydrating effects that you get from it so in that alone it is anti-aging but it's also very nice for controlling oil production and calming that redness in your skin i've seen a huge difference in the month that i've been using it this is one of those products that is really nice for everyone that's been wearing a mask if you're experiencing any kind of irritation and redness on your skin if you feel like your skin's getting really dry under the mask if you feel like you're getting flaky any of that even with the change of the seasons you're feeling like your skin's feeling a little bit more sensitive because it's colder now this is a wonderful serum to add in especially if you want to get those hydrating benefits it's also great for people with sensitive skin again it's anti-inflammatory you can also use it day and night in your skincare routine these are all ingredients that are really nice like they play well with others so if you are using your actives like your ahas and your bhas or if you're using some type of retinoid at night you can still apply this first to really soothe your skin and while this is for the face and this is how they market it is for your face for the skin for your skincare routine i have been using this on my scalp again they do not claim for this to be something that you use on your scalp it's just that i have really enjoyed using it also on my scalp it was one of those things where i started to feel the texture of it and i was like hmm i really like these ingredients for my face i think that this would be nice for the scalp because of the the feel of it it's very liquidy and i think that's why i like it for my scalp you know like serums and oils that are meant for your scalp like when you're losing your hair and when you are trying to treat something like psoriasis a lot of these serums or these oils haven't really caught up to what we've learned about skin care you know i think about my scalp as skin i feel like it's really important to find the right kind of skincare products for your scalp so while this isn't made for the scalp i have been putting this on my scalp at night and it has really made a huge difference the night before i'm gonna wash my hair i'll take actually like i'll fill the syringe and i will basically just kind of run this through my scalp area and i'll rub it in and then i have another product i'll show you that is more of an oil that also has cbd in it that i've been putting on my scalp and it's really helped to calm it really help to moisturize it again you know like i don't know if it's 100 the cbd in this but i know that this feels really nice on my scalp and it's made a huge difference since i talked about how i use that on my scalp i might as well get into the second product i use on my scalp and that is by briochio this is their be well 100 milligram cbd plus arnica flower soothing skin and scalp oil because the vita hemp really feels more like a serum it absorbs into my scalp really quickly so i've been locking that in again i'm trying to treat it like it's a skincare routine right so i've been locking it in with this oil and the combination really has made such a difference on my scalp if you're one of those people that has just kind of like an itchy scalp in general i'm not saying this is for psoriasis i'm just doing it because i have psoriasis neither of these products are claiming to be psoriasis products just i want to point that out this is just what i've been doing to soothe my scalp i really do think there is a lack of great products for your scalp out there i've got some hair oils for instance when i was experiencing a lot of hair loss after pregnancy where these oils were like full of just essential oils and you know when you turn and look at the ingredients list you're like this is so not caught up with the times like we know a lot more about skincare everybody and we want real skincare ingredients on our scalp the combination of the niacinamide and the cbd from both the serum and from this oil is really just nice for my scalp but also this has arnica in it and we know that arnica is also anti-inflammatory so i just really love this combination it's been working out really nicely for for my hair and my scalp all right so like i said at the beginning of the video i hurt my ankle and i really wanted to find some type of product to put on my ankle just to make it feel better so usually you know i'm like a tiger balm kind of person or like you know like the old school icy hot and stuff but when i was looking for these things on amazon this is the product that came up and it's just called natural hemp cream you know i decided i might as well buy it at the very least it has the menthol in it that i know will help my ankle feel a little bit better but i was again interested in the anti-inflammatory benefits of this hemp oil is the main ingredient of this cream which is which was one of the reasons why i was into it it also had really high ratings which i don't 100 take serious on amazon because it can be all over the place and it also has arnica in it so again we know that arnica is anti-inflammatory i know that the menthol is going to work well and then it has the hemp oil in it so i decided to purchase this and i have loved it the minute i started using it on my ankle it started to feel so much better could it be that it's just that i'm putting something that feels really nice on my skin and i'm also massaging it and everything sure but i do feel like i saw such a huge difference when i started using this on my ankle it's you know fairly inexpensive it's easy to get because it is on amazon it's not fancy at all but it feels really nice i have been using it every single day at least morning and night it's made my ankle feel a lot better i've even been using it on my other foot because since my right foot is not her it gets the brunt of my weight basically and i've been you know putting a lot more work into my right foot and my right ankle so i've been using it to massage both of my feet and my ankle areas it also just feels really moisturizing to the skin so that's been nice too i think one thing to point out is that this has hemp oil in it and not cbd so i had to do a little bit of research on the difference and it's just basically the part of the plant that is being utilized essentially in the cbd and the hemp oil but you're getting a lot of the same benefits from it all right next up is kind of like a treat yo self kind of product this is the prima bath gem i got this off of sephora i bought a couple of these because i don't really take baths as much as i used to anymore mostly because my children have taken over my bathtub so you know when i when i use this i have to essentially like clean out all the bath toys and everything and then you know actually take a bath for myself and it's got to be after the kids have fallen asleep it's a whole deal so i want to make my baths nice when i'm going to take a bath so i got a couple of these i've only used one so far and then i've got this one left but i really enjoyed the experience it's effervescent so you pop it in basically to the water once your tub is filled very similar to a bath bomb but it has cbd in it so again it's anti-inflammatory it's very hydrating and moisturizing for the skin so at the very least we know i'm getting those benefits from it but this also has magnesium in it and i think magnesium is one of those underrated ingredients that people don't focus on for skin and skin healing a lot the best way to get magnesium in our bodies as well which people don't realize is actually through our skin it's not actually taking it as a supplement and i think that's how most people try to get their magnesium but truly the best way to get it is through your skin magnesium is great for so many of our bodily functions it helps to calm us it helps us sleep it helps even our bowel movements and things like that it's just good for your body in general and it's very soothing for your muscles so again because i hurt my ankle i've been looking for products that will just help soothe my pain and like the issues i've been dealing with and this is one of those products that i got so it's not cheap considering that it's just a one-time use little tablet but it is really nice it makes your bath feel like an experience and i'm really excited to use the second one that i got next up i have two moisturizers and by the way i would consider the the hemp cream to be a pain relief cream and not a moisturizer because you don't want that menthol feeling all over your body maybe you do but i don't so i keep it only to my feet and my ankle but the next two products i have are the josie marin skin dope this is a cbd body butter and then i have this by lord jones it is the cbd body lotion so first let's talk about this this is just a nice rich moisturizer it feels good it reminds me of like a really fancy version of my old school favorite like when i was a teenager i was into the body shops mango body butter this feels like this amazing updated elevated adult version of that so i just started using this because it feels so luxurious and like i said i also got this laura jones cbd body lotion this you don't get a lot of product in i feel like i'm going through it so quickly but i really enjoy this lotion again you know i said at the beginning of the video that i have been a skeptic of cbd just because it does feel like so many brands throw cbd onto their products just to claim that they're using cbd because it's trendy and not necessarily to give you any real benefits you know lord jones has created their brand around cbd so it feels like it's a different approach in the sense of you know like they're focusing on cbd and building a whole line around cbd whereas brands that are you know established and then just like kind of including cbd in a couple of their products this one really focuses on cbd as their entire brand this is the signature fragrance by the way it's a very fragrant lotion which i personally enjoy i do feel like i'm going through this pretty quickly especially for the price of a body lotion but it has felt very nice it feels very refreshing to the skin the josie marin i've been using more on like my body after the shower and stuff and this has been a lotion that i've been just kind of like keeping at my desk and using like all my hands on my elbows on my arms like those types of areas when i'm not out of the shower it feels nice and refreshing it almost gives you kind of like a pick-me-up and because it smells pretty it's it takes a place of perfume for me too i can't really say that these products have done more than other lotions for my body but they have felt very nice i only have psoriasis on my scalp right now hopefully it doesn't go to my body but i haven't been dealing with any skin issues on my body so i'm not needing you know cbd for my body besides my ankle obviously because i'm looking for anti-inflammatory products there but they have been very nice body lotions and creams to use and like i said this feels very refreshing and it has this beautiful scent to it i'm just very interested in them i'm telling you i'm using these i like them do i recommend them as cbd products i'm not sure yet but i do like them as moisturizers next up i have these two products from milk makeup one of them is the kush fiber brow gel and then the other is the kush lip balm this is actually just their green dragon lip balm this is not the one that has color to it again we know that cbd is very hydrating moisturizing for the skin so i have enjoyed this lip balm a lot just as just a plain lip balm i've been wearing it before my lipstick you know i've seen people comment you know i was showing off like some really matte lipsticks on instagram the other day and somebody bought it and messaged me and was like this felt really dry and cracky on my lips but it looked really creamy on your lips are you using a lip gloss and stuff and i was trying to think like what is it that makes my lips different like why did that matte lipstick look different on me and i think the difference is that i tend to prep my lips with something like this i've been really enjoying this as a lip prep for my lipsticks because it's not one of those like lip balms that's super shiny and that makes it hard to you know like put a lipstick on top of this feels more like a mix of a lip balm with like a chapstick i know that doesn't sound very elegant but that's kind of what this is it's not shiny i guess is the whole point so it really helps to prep your lips it feels nice and moisturizing and i'm not sure if it's a cbd per se but i know that this is just a really nice lip balm and i've really enjoyed it and also it's got this green tone to it but it doesn't actually leave a color on your lips it just feels really nice but it's clear and then the other kush product that i've liked is the fiber brow gel one i just like fiber brow gel so i was interested in it just solely for that because on the weekends when i'm not really wearing much makeup i'll just swipe this into my brows so that i look a little bit more groomed and pulled together and i also just like that it has color to it because when i'm not actually using a brow pencil to fill in my brows this is usually what i find is all i need if it's just a day like at home or i'm going to be you know like running some errands or something and i'm not wearing a lot of makeup this is all that i need for my brows and the reason why i was interested in this having cbd in is because we know that cbd is conditioning at the very least so i assume that it does that for my brows it conditions them a little bit i've seen a difference in my brows in the sense of you know they feel like they're fuller i've also been using a lash and brow serum so it could be the combination of both or it could be just the serum or it could be this uh nikki uses this on me when she does my makeup just like today and we've really enjoyed this and then last of all my cbd products is this this brand is called recess it's a sparkling water that has hemp extract and adaptogens in it i'm not one that's into these types of drinks they usually taste terrible to me i'm one of those people that has like two to three drinks sitting on my desk almost at all times it's like i have my water a tea and some type of other drink so i thought that these would be nice because they don't have a lot of sugar in them i think like this one has four grams of sugar in it all together and it actually tastes really good there are lots of different flavors to it essentially it's like tea mixed with your sparkling water so it's kind of a nice refreshing drink at the very least it does have the help the hemp extract which i you know hope is helping to calm me down i don't know if it's working but i enjoy it it also has ginseng in it and i i've also been a fan of ginseng for a very long time i don't know if it's because it's like in my blood as an asian or something i've always liked seen my grandma and stuff use ginseng in a lot of products and in her you know like in the things that she would take for wellness so i'm a believer in ginseng and then it has l-theanine and it has lemon balm in it so both of those are just really good for like boosting your mood and stuff basically it's like a mood boosting sparkling water and whether i see a difference or not i've just enjoyed it i guess like that's the best way to explain it it's so hard to tell you guys if i've seen a huge difference in using any of these cbd products because of the cbd but what i can tell you is i've enjoyed the products that i'm talking about period right so that's like the biggest thing that i can tell you is that these are all products that have cbd in them that i really have enjoyed and this drink is one of those drinks it tastes delicious it's a very light refreshing drink i hope it's helping calm anxiety and help me sleep i did you know get like a sleep pillow that has cbd infused in it and it was the stupidest thing i've ever gotten i went back to my regular pillow and just put a silk pillowcase back on it it seemed like it did absolutely nothing for me so there are definitely still things out there that i think are just marketing gimmicks but these have all been products that i i've just thoroughly enjoyed and they happen to have cbd in them so i hope that the cbd is just doing more for me so those are cbd skincare products and wellness products that i have been enjoying tell me in the comments below if there are any products that you're going to try from my list or if you've been using any of these or if there are cbd products that you think i should take a look at i'm very interested in cbd i know that we're only going to see more and more of it on the market another reason why i've been interested in it because you know gotta pay attention see what's happening out there uh tell me why you use cbd or why you don't use cbd because i'm also curious about that find me on instagram i'm at susan yara and i'll talk to you guys soon bye [Music]", "ODVX4f3eEDo": "[Music] hi there and welcome to the cannabis kitchen today I thought we would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know

so again I hope you enjoyed this video if you did please hit the like button and we would absolutely love it if you subscribed it really does help us keep this going [Music]", "W-zK3B5Vi-w": "[Music] today I'm going to show you a 12 awesome different ways that you can use DVD small [Music] if you're like me and you work at a desk or you're out and about on your feet for a lot of the day tend to store a lot of tension in your neck your shoulder it can get really irritated if this is a case for you one thing you can do is take a little bit of the bomb comes off really lightly onto your finger tip and just rub onto the sore area give yourself rub it in you know as well as you can give yourself a nice little massage within a couple minutes you should start to feel some relief another thing you can do with the CBD balm is if you or a loved one is able to kind of give yourself full-body massage or you know maybe you your back irritates you a lot and you can get somebody to give you a massage or you see a massage therapist add a little bit of this bomb into the oil that you're using to do the massage I tend to do this actually with my legs after a hard day's work if I've been on my feet or if I've done exercise and overdone it a little bit too much just working like maybe a dime to a quarter-sized amount of that into your hand along with any type of massage oil is just really going to enhance the benefits of you know soothing and comforting your tired sore muscle so that's another great way to use it a lot of folks that come in and see us here at the store have a lot of foot peds whether it's just age wear and tear if you've had an injury in your foot a lot of times that can be very irritating and disruptive to your daily life because everyone uses their feet you know most of us walk and are bearing all of our weight on our feet and so the soreness of that can really become unbearable to some folks so at the end of the day I suggest taking about a dime to a quarter-sized amount of the CBD balm and just giving yourself a nice foot massage rubbing and concentrating on the areas that really need the attention and some you know relief from that discomfort another really great way to use CBD oil fall if you're like me year-round you have dry lips it's crazy but it's something that I always struggle with it's worse in wintertime and when the weather is colder but cvd balm is a great way to moisten your lips Phoebe is full of great omega-3 fatty acids so it's a wonderful oil that is really going to heal and feel chapped lips it's as easy as just taking it to your finger like you would any other type of you know moist lip moisturizer [Music] it actually smells minty fresh and really I think gives as much of a nice glossy glow to your lip as a cosmetic product with a high-end cosmetic product so this is another great way to use CBD oil now if you're headed outside into some really cold weather or you're stuck inside with the heat on you might be noticing that the air is really really dry and that can become super irritating to your sinuses one thing I suggest with the CBD oil balm is to simply take a small amount of it in your finger and rub just underneath your nasal passage this way when you're breathing in the air has a chance to hit the oil and go up into your nasal cavity so if your nasal passages are even more dry and you need some more therapeutic effect on the CBD oil another thing you can do is actually use a cotton swab to scoop up just a small amount less than a pea-sized amount I would say pea-sized at most this is gonna seem kind of gross to you but really it's well worth it if the inside of your nose is really dried out and irritated and discomfort you're experiencing a lot of discomfort you're going to want to try this yes I am totally picking my nose on down but it seriously feels so good after you're able to moisten the inside of your nose definitely throw this cotton swab out when you're done is you don't want to be spreading all those nice germs but doing this is really going to give you a lot of relief and there's another great way to ensure that all the air that you're breathing is really moisturized and beneficial for you if you're in the kitchen a lot and your clock sometimes burns happen well fortunately or unfortunately I don't have any fresh burns to show you here today but I've never heard of an old one that's been lingering on my hands here from a hot pan I was cooking with a couple of weeks ago one great use for CBD oil is actually after this burn happens apply directly to the area very gently you don't want to use this on any exposed skin so skin that's been broken leading anything like that you don't want to use on exposed skin but for any other skin especially burns this works so wonderfully because the omega-3 oils in here are so beneficial at really healing your skin and it feels so good using our hands on the keyboard all day long can result in a lot of discomfort and our fingertips of stiffness sometimes even swelling you may have seen a doctor about this and told you you had a type of condition that we're all pretty familiar with but if the discomfort is really getting to you you may want to consider keeping a bottle of the CBD balm at your desk and just taking a bit of that you can combine it with a hand cream that you may have or a hand oil of some sort or you simply on its own and you just want to apply to the area's focusing on especially we join and areas of discomfort and basically work it into your whole hand as you would a hand cream and let it sit for just a few moments so that the oils have a chance to soak in before you go and use your hands again I promise you you will feel some type of relief from this discomfort most of us at some point in our lives or we may know somebody has suffered from acne and I'm talking about big cystic painful acne those giant bumps that come out out of nowhere and believe me they're not just teenagers that get them it can be really painful and sometimes we can even feel them coming up out of there out of our skin before they even start revealing themselves if that's the case like combat this with CBD oil CBD oil is naturally anti-inflammatory the cystic acne is inflammatory in nature so you want to fight that with good fatty acids omega-3 fatty acids and CBD oil is so rich in them it just takes a tiny little bit of the bomb and you want to just apply directly to the areas on your face that are breaking out and then try this at night when you wake up the next day see what happens so many of us also suffer from migraine settings or just tension headaches these are really common at the end of a long day especially if you've been staring at a screen of some sort your computer a lot of times we feel the tension at our temples over here what you want to do is take just a bit of the CBD balm it doesn't take much and rub into your temple it goes on really nicely it does not feel overly greasy and it will absorb very easily if you just focus inward and use a few minutes of your time to concentrate on addressing the discomfort you can massage the oil in wherever it is on your face even in your scalp if it goes into your scalp that's perfectly fine to get this into where your hair is you may also know somebody that suffers from skin rashes Gailey itchy dry skin again they may have seen a doctor for this condition and that's great to be under a doctor's care but something you can do very easily for yourself if you use some CBD oil directly on those areas of irritation on your skin again as long as there's no exposed skin or you know bleeding areas cuts you don't want to apply the CBD to those areas but others extremely dry itchy scaly flaking skin the CBD oil is incredibly moisturizing and beneficial for skin it's just a matter of rubbing it into the area that's affected last but certainly not least if you or someone you know experiences joint discomfort CBD oil is great for taking or relieving some of that discomfort you want to focus on the areas that you're experiencing this elbows knees knuckles and just give it a good rub in sometimes you know you can benefit from a little bit of massage in that area to really make sure the oil is kind of treating the skin and absorbing and just give it a few moments let it absorb see how you feel okay I just do that again I'm feeling very good now I'm covered in CVD we could do the helical little thing I do", "5KflhpfYzvQ": "your testimonials on your website these things run the gamut you know you have it treating sports injuries chronic back pain cancer radiation burns acne you're talking about circulatory issues you know especially for the for the folks out there tell us the science how do these oils and lotions work you know especially for such a wide variety of issues so my understanding of it which is limited because there hasn't been enough studies yet and I can't wait to learn more about how these actually work but my understanding of it is that the cannabinoids respond to your peripheral nervous system your you have an endocannabinoid system which we as humans have this yeah every human has an endocannabinoid system and it's kind of a regulatory homeostasis system and there's two kinds of receptors there's cb1 receptors which are in your brain and those are the ones that mostly respond to THC and that will give you these psychedelic or a psychoactive you know experience and then you've got the cb2 receptors which are found in your peripheral nervous system and they deal with you injure yourself or you if you have pain they will interact with either your own natural endocannabinoids that your body produces or cannabinoids from cannabis so the topical seem to work with responding to the cb2 receptors in your peripheral nervous system the THC doesn't act actually go into the blood I'm pretty sure I've done like a bunch of drug tests on yeah at least for now is that you're not going to fail a drug test you're going to feel psychoactive effects yeah and so people typically don't feel any sort of psychoactive effect it doesn't seem to get into your blood system it just seems to interact with these cb2 receptors so dealing with the issue right where you put the SAP or the topical on the skin and these cb2 receptors will help the healing response and will help bring your body back to homeostasis once they connect you know with the cannabinoids", "x_h4UQuhjbk": "UNEXPLAINED SCIENCE THERE.

Phil ahead on today on five it'll left", "ngvPXVqJQ6g": "hi there today I want to tell you about an amazing product to enhance wellness and vitality this is CBD oil drops pure CBD oil can be used to produce support for normal everyday stresses healthy recovery from exercise support for a sense of calm and focus and help you sleep and brighten your mood so what is CBD oil CBD stands for can add video and can video is a main component of cannabis and in an all-natural class of molecules called cannabinoids found in the plant genus cannabis sativa L CBD makes up around 40% of the plant and is just one of over a hundred compounds found in cannabis including hemp and marijuana out of all these compounds CBD and THC tetrahydrocannabinol are always the highest concentration they are therefore the most research of all the vital cannabinoids found in cannabis CBD is a non psychoactive component that can hold a wide variety of potential benefits and it doesn't induce the highs that THC does the human body actually has a system known as the endocannabinoid system and thus utilizes cannabinoids in a variety of ways in the body see beady oil is the purest form of cannabidiol extract from the hemp or marijuana plants found in tincture form there are several favorite CBD hemp oil flavors including citrus mint natural berry and vanilla the price depends on size 300 milligrams is $39 600 milligrams $59 1200 milligrams cost in $99 and 2400 milligrams costs a hundred and twenty nine dollars so as you can see the larger the size the cheaper the CBD will be we have three strengths of organically grown hemp CBD oil for sale each has a 12 month shelf life it's always made to order so it'll always be fresh CBD oil is best kept at room temperature away from excessive light heat and moisture some people store it in a pantry others prefer to keep it in the refrigerator it's up to you fab CBD oil products may sometimes vary slightly from batch to batch fab CBD products include whole plant hemp extracts the extracts contain a unique blend of cannabinoids plus terpenes cannabinoids are phytochemical compounds that are produced by the hemp plant they are non psychoactive with only trace amounts of THC that is below North 0.3% take care when using any CBD products as they may fail THC screenings and CBD can metabolize in a way that might give a false positive let's look at the ingredients organically grown hemp extract full-spectrum cannabinoid blend flavorings from natural sources terpenes and medium chain triglycerides which may contain trace amounts of hemp derived THC again less than naught point 3 percent when deciding to buy CBD oil and which potency is best for you it's best to start small and gradually increase your dosage until you get the result that you want you might not need a full CBD serving you also may not need a high potency CBD oil so you could save some money while still achieving the desired CBD oil effects you should of course talk this over with your doctor as you would with any daily health supplement the key features of these products are that they are organically grown provide proper servings they are non-gmo they contain cannabinoids and terpenoids d sides are used and they are farmed in Colorado so I recommend that you try CBD oil for yourself this is a safe product that will elevate your life to a higher level be healthy and be happy", "ScQ6ffP_5e4": "[Music] hey I'm Heidi when healing the harvest homestead and today I'm going to show you how we make our own pain relief staff that we use for sore joints for muscles or back aches you know anything that's you know you have topical pain or even inner pain in it in inside your joints or you know stiffness things like that the salve is amazing there's only a few ingredients and it's really quite simple so what you need is oh and please subscribe if you haven't yet already I'd appreciate that all right so what you need is you need some cayenne powder I purchased this from Starr West botanicals and I'll leave a link below but it's 90,000 heat units you can choose your heat units on your Cayenne you can get it all the way up to a hundred and sixty thousand heat units and I've actually made sab with heat units that powerful before but I have found that 90,000 heat units works in grades so we're going to use this plus I could use it for cooking too and then you are going to need some olive oil so the first thing you want to do is infuse your cayenne powder in your olive oil now I use ginger oil or ginger essential oil as at the end to help warm it up and stimulate it even further if you want to go ahead and add some ginger powder I've done that before in the past and it's wonderful so what you want to do to infuse your Cayenne oil yes this is a little murky I just shook it up is you want to take a jar and you want to fill it about a third of the way full with your powder all right and then you want to pour your olive oil to the top within an inch of the top like you can see it I've got a little head space here and that's because after you put your lid on it you're going to want to keep it shaken up now if you're using herbal powders to infuse oil you're going to want to shake this daily because the powders can get packed it at the bottom and you don't want that so you want to keep your infusing powders and oils shaken daily and you just put it aside on a nice shelf I like to put it where I can see it and I'm reminded to shake it because otherwise I'll forget salt that right back there all right so you you're going to let that infuse for four to six weeks I know that's a long time there's a faster way you can actually infuse your oil in a double boiler and if you go to my website wwlp.com I actually have directions for this tab there I also have directions for how to make an infused oil with herbs and I've got the fast way and the slow way so if you don't want to wait four to six weeks and you want to get this done like today you can just go to my website and I'll put the links below so you can find those articles but I'll talk more about that later in another youtube video too but you can make it faster than four to six weeks but I like the slow method because it really really gives you a powerful powerful trail so once your oil is completely infused and I don't know if you can see how cool this is like a bright orange oil because of the Cayenne it's just lovely but you're gonna have your infused oil so and that's ready to go for the SAP okay I've got it measured out in a one cup you also need beeswax okay and then you need some essential oil if you want the essential oil is optional the thing about the essential oil that I I like it for is that it gives some extra analgesic properties to your staff which means some extra topical pain relief okay the essential oils I like to use our a combination of wintergreen and ginger all right so I've got about 300 drops measured out and my proportions are about 1/4 of the ginger 2 3 4 so the wintergreen and this is a good amount for ten ounces of salve which is approximately what I'm going to get out of this recipe okay so then I'm going to take my jar now this jar you can see it's got residue in it because this is my cayenne snap jar I use this over and over and over for my entire set I keep a lid on it so that it doesn't get achy or you know nasty with germs and things and I just use it over and over if you want to clean it out in between it's really easy you can just wipe it out with a paper towel while the oil is still warm and it comes right out and then you can wash it but I make this stuff quite often so you know I've got my dedicated cayenne stab jar so I'm going to pour my cup of oil look how cool or look how orange that is you guys can you see how orange that is it's just um it's just I'm always amazed at how beautiful Cayenne infused oil is it's amazing to take olive oil which is green and put cayenne powder in it for several weeks and then you strain out the Cayenne I don't know if I mentioned that but you do need to stray out and strain out the cayenne so what I would do with this once this is ready to be strained out I'm going to just simply get a strainer use several layers of cheesecloth or a layer of paper towel even and I'm going to slowly pour my infused oil into the strainer which is going to fall into a pitcher of some kind and collect the strained out oil the more layers you have of your cheesecloth the more clear your resulting liquid is going to be you can see how clear that is there's like no cloudiness in it some herbalists don't mind a little cloudiness some like a crystal-clear infused oil and honestly I take what how it comes out I don't really worry about too much so if it's got a little bit of cayenne powder in it it doesn't bother me but if you are selling this stuff or giving it away as to friends you might want to work on the clarity a little bit okay so anyway onward with our SAP I poured one cup of the Cayenne infused oil into my jar and now I'm going to pour 1/4 cup of beeswax pellets into my jar and that's my basic ratio for SABS it works every time one cup of well - 1/4 cup of east-west pellets and then I'm going to go ahead and put this jar inside my makeshift double boiler now this double boiler is simply a pan I have a cloth at the bottom I'm going to see that I'll show you in a minute with a little bit of water and I set it in there on top of the cloth and now I'm going to take it over to the stove and I'm going to just gently heat this water a little bit and get it nice and warm and it's going to melt those beeswax pellets right into the infused oil ok so here we are with the pan and the cloth and the jar with the infused oil and the beeswax in it and I just got that water barely simmering and it's probably actually a little too hot but that's ok and that but that beeswax is melting gently into the oil this usually takes about 10-15 minutes maybe to do so I will come back in just a moment and show you how to finish up yourself okay so we have melted our bees wax into the infused cayenne and it's just wonderful it turned out great I'm gonna let it cool down for just a minute and talk with you a little and the reason I wanted to cool down just a little bit is because I'm going to pour essential oils in there and I definitely want to be sure that it's not going to damage the essential oils so just like for a minute or two maybe three just let it sit for a second then you can pour your essential oils in I'm going to go ahead and split this salve between three different four ounce two little jelly jars it's not going to completely fill a jar this is going to be about ten ounces so whenever you make a SAP you want to kind of figure out how many ounces you have and how much you're going to or what size jars you're going to need in my case I'm actually going to give these to a couple of friends and then my husband needs a little extra one so we're going to split it between three and one more thing I want to mention to the Cayenne infused oil without the beeswax of course this can actually be used for cooking it's going to be real hot but you know if you want a little spice or if you want a little extra medicinal health for your circulation you can go right ahead and cook with this oil because you know it's cayenne powder and olive oil right it's very good to cook with as well as use topically for your for your pain issues all right so now I'm going to go ahead and pour in my essential oil like I said I used 3/4 of the wintergreen to 1/4 of the ginger usually I have a little stir stick but I don't have one so I'm going to use the end of this pipit for this amount of salve ok I I make ours pretty strong so it's roughly a I would say a 10% dilution which is good for adults but there's about 300 drops or so of essential oil in here total so I'm go ahead and pour my staff into my jars now one thing you're going to want to do is not touch these after you pour them in okay it's tempting it's tempting to kind of like pick it up and see how it's doing but what you want to do is you want to let it set completely up you want to let it harden all the way and ten ounces turned out to be a perfect amount for 3/4 ounce jelly jars you can see I don't know if you can see that but there all of them are almost full except for there's one that's not but let's I'm going to show you what a completed hardened stab looks like so here you go I'm going to come around here so you can see this better this is what your completed stab is going to look like this has been used my my husband uses this all the time so because he works he's a he works physically hard and he'll use this for his neck pain I use it for my low back pain because I have l4 l5 issues and it's just wonderful I have friends who use it on their hands for their joints one little caution with this okay this SAP is hot so you might experience a little bit of itchiness when you first put it on your skin especially on your back or you know a softer area of your body you likely want to crush your your bony areas but you know what it'll go away all right so just just know that you might experience that it's nothing to be concerned with the cayenne powder is very hot and the capsaicin that's in the cayenne powder is what actually soaks in to your through your skin and into your joints and into your muscles and it helps you know relieve that pain so Cayenne is an excellent excellent one of my favorite pain relievers on my blog I do have an article over there my 9 favorite herbs for pain relief and you may all know there's different kinds of pain right you have to figure out where the pain and why the pain is is is happening and then you can go ahead and figure out what to do about it but I talk about that in this article there's also an article over there from start to finish on how to make this sad so if you

saucepan with about an inch of water and it's simmering and then I have a glass bowl place on top and we're gonna melt all of our ingredients together how easy is that why don't you go ahead and pour in that beeswax and then we're adding cocoa butter and then our cannabis coconut oil I've already melted it because it's easier to measure out when it's melted and yes our two tablespoons of jojoba can I just have a silicon spatula I am going to use to mix this all together while it melts easy peasy lemon squeezy so when we're done with this you can put this you can make it into a lotion bar but by putting it in like a cupcake liner I've also saved this little lotion container that you forgot a jar yeah you can put it in a little jar or I actually even saved a chapstick container pour it in the chest and let it cool could wear this also as trap stick so I also brought a measuring cup with a spout so we can use it to pour into my chopstick containers you can also buy these a craft store you could also I clean out an old deodorant container and use that oh yeah you can pour it into the container and let it harden we're almost completely melted so I'm just going to twist it all the way back down and then you can just pour it in there to fill it up isn't that the coolest thing and it you've never heard of I mean one of but the coolest thing and I've set up all of our little containers we have two chopstick containers that I saved from Jeffster and we have some heart-shaped don't mind the heart shapes silicone mold okay so I'm gonna use this to grip the chopstick and then pour are you ready I'm so nervous I just like knock it over okay it's not as bad as I thought it would oh now just leave don't touch it so don't touch it we have to let all these things harden no I'm scared though give it you can do it move over okay give you space okay goodies baby space I'm gonna I'm gonna be the one who spills it it wasn't that bad I just rested it on yeah why is that nerve-racking I was like having anxiety I know it's really because it's such a small little container I kinda it's really so if I had joint pain maybe all my joint pain would be gone but I don't have any joint pain but this feels super nice no it's is no moisturizing and nice mmm smells like chocolate which is bad because it's gonna make me wanna cave chocolate I'm gonna put but some spearmint this is such a quick and easy video you just let it cool at room temperature just let it cool it out yeah just chill Wow quick and easy you saw how fast and easy this was to make our own camp South at home if you were to use regular coconut oil instead of cannabis coconut oil you could just use these as regular lotion bars we also have chopsticks so we can use this chopstick and it's great for if you have joint pain or if you have a bad knee it'll really soothe an easier pains but thank you guys for tuning in to our quick little tutorial on how to make your own canvas style thank you my friend kay we're coming to you knocked huh we're coming to join me and thanks again I'll see you guys next week it's good hang the I see I bye [Music]", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "Fzyiu34FDP0": "[Music] all righty youtubers here we go again it is Monday everyone I had a good weekend everybody is safe we made it we got another Amazon Prime unboxing to do check them out link is gonna be down below I'm not sure what this is so find out take advantage of the Amazon Prime fast and free shipping and you'll get this in no time I think it's like one day shipping they shipped it out so that was pretty fast I must say yeah we go ere we go I'm little one be feeling the pain today that's because I'm getting older here we go let me have a Rosie da ham saliva Silva 2000 mg you oh boy this is the hand pushing CBDs stuff stuff is pretty amazing definitely glad that took some time and went into it and got B I'll be using these a lot more now rosita muscle and body relief I'm sore today so this is definitely gonna help no THC one fluid ounce this wish it was bigger though little tiny little guy but strong stuff there's a good stuff on the back so last one was the thousand I tried I think it actually did work so that's why I'm like getting more into these CBD products so but definitely uh will help out people with arthritis and pain and all that good stuff so I know they got bath bombs other places I seen on Amazon but I wanted to stick with the lotions right now and slowly work up looks pretty cool different do not eat this and I'd like it kind of looks like Jam stick I don't know if you guys could see the full color of it I haven't just I mean cuz it's be Zen there we go that's what it looks like if you guys see it nice and smooth don't smell its drawing so definitely gonna try not working you'll never know don't smell like wheat marijuana or nothing like that so definitely good stuff right here like I said wish I was more in it but this stuff does help this is my first time trying done mm so let you know in a few weeks oh how it goes and all that good stuff so stay tuned for that youtubers definitely check them out if you're serious getting into the seamy de lines the hemp products so nice definitely I'm not taking no pills for pain I don't even take aspirin so the cellphones I sleep arthritis inflammation pain sores like I said my hips are I can't shake it like a salt shaker anymore no those days are done and in big four oh so when they stack up on these for sure so all right you guys be safe have a great day and I will see you guys soon see ya", "vUUdcfQdc_Y": "thank you for joining us on help with answers I'm Matt ours or four lung cancer survivor and patient and I'm here today with dr. Ross hammock and we're going to continue our conversation about CBD THC marijuana and how it is used in lung cancer treatments can we start with talking about how it can be used what it's good for and maybe what's still not proven as for symptoms or a possibly a curative approach so it I mean we said there's THC and CBD so the CBD tends to work best for the symptoms that we associate with cancer and some of the treatments for cancer so it works for lack of appetite can work for insomnia it can work for anxiety it can work for pain I've had some patients that be able to come off their opiate painkillers that can work for nausea the thing is it's just a drug though I mean it works for some people and just like any other painkiller or anything else it doesn't work for everybody so it's it's just another tool in the armamentarium that we can use okay the THC has pretty limited medical role I'd say I mean there there are people who've pushed the very high THC form so there's something called Rick Simpson oil sure has that treatment for cancer and I think there's a tiny bit of truth in that but if you think about all of the developments in lung cancer it's all about personalized therapy so why should there be one treatment for every kind of cancer it doesn't make any sense and I think that's just wishful thinking okay so if someone was interested in starting to use CBD or THC as another tool in their lung cancer treatment yeah how would you want them to approach you and then let's also talk about how they can go about getting it where they should get it from and then also how they should go about using it you know methods of edibles smoking and vaping or what's the best options out there so in states where it's legal for both recreational and medical as in Colorado I mean technically you don't even have to go see your doctor you could just go in and get the stuff recrea recreationally the different recreational medical is the price it's essentially the same stuff or the same range of things that you can select it you go the the medical ramp you go to your doctor and I don't prescribe it I don't get out my prescription pad and say you need this and this dose and this often all I do is fill out the details so you can get an ID card so you can get the reduced price sure I mean my biggest worry though is then you go into a dispensary and somebody who may have no medical knowledge may really just be up to speed on their recreational aspects is then the person saying oh yeah you need this one yeah sure what are some things we still don't know about CBD and THC and its uses well I mean I mean it's a really long list so the the fact that they're I mean this is a natural product there's an analogy that's a bit like saying you know your doctor says you know you should have some alcohol and you go into a liquor store and they say the doctor said I should have some alcohol what should I get and the guy behind the things that you want beer do you want wine do you want liquor or whatever so we're kind of at that state you know which strain of marijuana do you take how do you take it generally speaking I would suggest you take something orally you know I think smoking it bathing it is a bad idea these are very sensitive tissues in your lungs it can be a solid gummy or a candy it can be an oil which allows you to be very sensitive you can't get it as creams but that's the only gonna be an issue of guilt like an achy joining the the other things we don't know is you know what dose do you take how often do you take it sometimes these things can get into your system very quickly ones that the oils tend to get in quicker some people even rub it on their gums which get into their system very quickly but if you do that if you don't or if you don't know that aspect you can overdose really quickly you know a one square of the chocolate bar I think nothing's happened 20 minutes later I eat the rest of the chocolate bar and then two hours later I'm completely stoned so all of this is unknown and desperately in need of study definitely what about drug interactions if someone wants to find out if the treatment they're on the target therapy they're on how it works with with marijuana where should they go for that information or who can they ask well what we're mostly worried about is when two drugs and marijuana is a drug are tab alized are broken down in the body in the same way and they're going to interfere with each other so they're either going to increase the levels of one of the drugs or decrease them and so the best place to do is to go to your your your pharmacist in a Cancer Center and say look I'm thinking about starting this I'm already on these treatments is that okay and I think that's the best place to start but it goes back to the idea of you know don't do the experiment in this weekend and then tell your doctor that you did it say hey this weekend I'm thinking about going to see a dispensary the first time what should I look out for okay perfect do you have anything else that you want touch base on this well so here's my question so have you taken marijuana I have many many years ago obviously not as a treatment option okay but I think what what I really like is that you answer that question directly and this has been a sort of taboo subject for a while and if the patient asked me have I taken marijuana I smoked it once it had no effect I was on a canal boat with some friends who's stoned out of their head and I was the one left driving true story there then you know you have to be able to address it upfront without being awkward about it sure and that's what maintains trust perfect okay well thanks for your time and thank you for joining us on hope with answers", "HYMd4rhjF0A": "it's another beautiful day to watch another video and for me to be here with you right now I just want to talk about full-spectrum hemp oil what it is and what the difference is between it and regular CBD oil so full-spectrum refers to when the pure oil extracted from the hemp plant contains all the same cannabinoids and compounds found in the original plant cannabidiol is actually very very beneficial it makes up over 90% of the cannabinoid content in a plant it's non psychoactive and it's the main focus of the benefits of hemp oil full-spectrum hemp oil contains cannabidiol as well as everything else that's included with it so in addition to all the other different cannabinoids in a hemp plant full-spectrum hemp oil also has a great variety of essential vitamins minerals omega fatty acids flavonoids chlorophyll and terpenes health benefits of a full spectrum hemp oil go beyond just the therapeutic benefits of CBD itself the array of cannabinoids and other natural constituents and compounds that are in the entire hemp oil like the whole oil work together in what's known as the entourage effect and together these compounds all work harmoniously to magnify their therapeutic properties this mix of cannabinoids essential nutrients proteins essential fatty acids they'll work together synergistically to encourage homeostasis and balance in our health full spectrum hemp oil comes in tinctures edibles they also have like lotions and capsules available you guys might want to know like does it show up in drug tests did hemp THC is a very minor constituent and only appears in under 0.3% by dry weight so this extremely low level of THC in hemp makes the hemp oil the full spectrum hemp oil non psychoactive and safe to use for all ages and today we're gonna be checking out this brand called Veritas Farms which is a farm-to-table full spectrum hemp oil company located in Colorado they also have capsules and gummies as you guys know I have been going through a lot of anxiety lately I do have CBD oil but I'm also you know trying out different brands just to see what's different and what I like and so far various farms has been really great transparency and sustainability is really important to them they use organic ingredients as much as possible they grow extract formulate bottle label and ship all from their farm locally they are third-party tested and they also emphasize so much that they're not a CBD company they're not a THC company they offer full spectrum hemp oil which offers the benefits of the entourage effect this one is strawberry flavored but they also have a salted caramel flavor that I was interested in trying out but I wanted to go simple first so I got strawberry I just placed dropper like straight under my tongue I like using the oil tincture for immediate effects for anxiety and stress the gummies and capsules would be the best for sleep because they set in a little bit later and one more item from various farms that I really really have been loving is this full-spectrum Fido cannabinoid rich lotion and we're talking about full spectrum but CBD for sure is really really good for inflammation stress also like joint pain I've been using this on my face lately my skin has been breaking out my like bumps on my chin have been going away had these little things go on they've gotten better this has been really really good for my skin anyway that's my little talk about CBD oil versus full spectrum hemp oil if you want to learn more about full spectrum hemp oil make sure you look in the description below but now I'm going to go I need to take some of this because it's time to go wake my grandma up so I can get her all ready for the day my parents out of town I'm her caregiver for the day which stresses me out a little bit because being a caregiver is very it's really stressful and also when it's somebody that you are related to can also be I don't know it's caused me a lot of anxiety lately so I've definitely been taking advantage of this full spectrum take some of this [Music] [Music] so I really wanted to go to yoga class today at the studio but my brother I guess wouldn't be home until later so no one could take care of my grandma and it kind of life are shaded me a little that I had these plans that was really excited about because it's by a teacher that I've been wanting to go to but that like it didn't fall through and I'm really really rigid with my schedule and I get really frustrated when things don't go my way because I'm like a control freak I especially like when it's things that I'm planning for and then I'm excited for and then it just like doesn't happen for some reason and it's harder for me to be flexible which is really interesting because this morning I was reading a little excerpt from this book called don't sweat the small stuff it just lies around the house they're just simple ways to keep the little things from taking over your life so before I knew that my brother would be coming late and I wouldn't be able to go to this yoga class that I was excited about I read this excerpt said that says be flexible changes in your plans like once we get something into our mind a plan it can be tricky to let go of it and just go with the flow and it's hard for me to go with the flow is it more important to stick to my original set my rigid schedule or to go with what I planned them to be available for my grandmother is missing that yoga class worth getting upset over just because plans didn't fall through the way that they were meant to be the more general question is what's more important getting what I want and keeping my plans or learning to go with the flow clearly to become a more peaceful person you must prioritize being flexible over rigidity most of the time it's also helpful to expect that a certain percentage of plans will change if you make allowances in your mind for this inevitability then whatever happens you can say here's one of those inevitabilities in this little expert you said like you'll feel more relaxed yet you won't sacrifice any productivity you may even become more productive because you won't need to expend so much energy being upset and worried and I think that's a big thing it's like okay I need to just relax accept the fact that I missed a plan that I wanted to make today well rather than worrying about it and rather than be upset over it I could just make more plans and now I have space and room in my life in my head to just clear it out just relax and plan something better and do something else in that time I feel like this little rigidity that I have is what makes it hard for people around me to to like ask me for things or talk to me about things because I'm so rigid with my plan and I'm like me I don't want to change anything and that's what he says - it's like it'll make the people around you feel more peaceful and relaxed around you that they won't be walking on eggshells to ask about different things my mom definitely tiptoes around me because I'm just really rigid with my plans and I'm like very set in my ways and I get like upset over small things that change those plans so I don't know just a little a little tidbit instead of going to that yoga class I'm just going to do yoga outside in the Sun and enjoy it and also be present over here compromise being flexible me and although this might seem like a normal thing to most of you guys to me it's not and this is something that I personally struggle with and I hope I'm not alone on this but some of you might just be like what the heck Amanda it's just like a change in plans just go and do something else like it's not a big deal to most people but it's a big deal to me [Music]", "C-jwTrX4KSM": "you know hemp is known as one of the best plants for pulling up both minerals and toxins from deep down in the soil these minerals and toxins are then concentrated the CBD oil in the plant as why is so incredibly important to know your farmer when using CBD products [Music] [Music] hello I'm Benjamin at the Asher and I'm here in one of Asher's our own fields where are your farmer Zephaniah has been growing a beautiful crop of CBD hemp Zephaniah is a fourth-generation farmer on this exact field so it's kind of in his DNA to know what the plants need ganic farming has definitely been a passion of our family for a long time my grandfather started farming nearly 50 years ago organically well in the early 70s out of conviction that it was that Hearst family's health and after a few years of organic farming health issues started preparing up this really began our multi-generational passion for helping women now raising my own family I'm so grateful for healthy living soil that they can play in free from chemicals or harsh fertilizers someplace that's building their immune system [Music] and farming this way has been a family project there's often 20 or more family members aunts uncles cousins and their children all out in the field planting and making big projects you know hemp is known as one of the best plants for pulling up wolf minerals and toxin from deep down in the soil these minerals and toxins are then concentrated the CBD oil and planter as why is so incredibly important to know your farmer when using CBD products being certified organic is an absolute but even that doesn't keep the plant from pulling up heavy metals and other toxins that are deep in the soil from years of chemical use this is what makes your hemp crop so special for CBD hemp it is probably the oldest organic chemical free farm in the country growing in a volcanic rich soil and fed all year with fresh spring water from Mount Hood so instead of pulling up garbage from deep in the soil these plants are pulling up more minerals and nutrients which are converted into a deeper and wider spectrum of healthy oils the farm is also processing a portion of the cropland 'south and teachers right on site first the plants are hang dried and cured at low temperatures for a couple weeks in order to preserve as much of the fitness of the plant as possible this is far superior to sending the crop to mechanical heated fryers for an hour 99% of the CBD products are extracted at sophisticated labs using harsh chemical solvents extreme pressures temperatures multiple fractionation steps designed to pull certain components out and putting others back in then what is left they dilute back in a carrier oil like coconut oil but there's a simpler method one that you can easily do at home by just gently soaking the flours in organic coconut oil until all the natural oils and goodness is pulled out of the plant this easy tried-and-true extraction method has been used for thousands of years to pull all the goodness out of the plant and one simple step so whether you choose to buy the whole plant and make your own CBD product or by Asher's pre-made you can feel good knowing the farmer that grew it and how it was made using the purest wholesome certified organic product available anywhere sure check out the links below for details on how to make your own CBD oil right in your kitchen hey hi everybody David from Azure and hey today I want to talk once again a little bit about organic hemp him kind of used to scare me I always kind of thought hey it's a bit of a fad it's edge people are just saying things about it because it's not legal everywhere but after I began to become more knowledgeable when our customers begin to request this over and over again can you get CBD products we really want this pain creamer these great CBD products and I said so I began to research it and I researched it in a big way and I realized that there is something to that there is something amazing about some of these CBD type products so I asked our customers in Facebook and that would have been this last spring I asked the customers hey would you like a journey carried CBD products is that important and overwhelmingly everybody said it was very important so I began to research but to find the very best our customers expect the best we want to get them the best so I begin to research and I could have had a horrible time finding the best very little of the product was really organic certainly not certified organic much of it was weak much of it was not respect to the label it was very disheartening to to go through that and a lot of it grown on land that was not properly organically grown for many years that pasture or something else where chemicals or heavy metals could have leached into the product so I came to the conclusion that hey Roger has farm ground will grow it will grow some for our customers and because that's what we do Asher's had been organic since 1973 one of the oldest organic pieces of ground in the state this will be a great piece of ground to put this hemp on so we planted this spring a crop of hemp out here in the fields and it grew beautifully so today we have the hemp harvested it's dried down it's ready to go and I want to be able to offer to sell you just plain dried him why is this important most the time people are selling CBD products and we will - however you can do it yourself you can make the CBD products out of this dried raw here and control the process

eczema for our daughter she got over overnight our one of the azure family her she her daughter has really bad acne she says that it cleared up the acne better than the worst the most nasty medicated cream that she's ever tried so it was it's been amazing to watch and this was just a batch that my wife made out of this exact product that we're offering to you so attached to this email is the recipe that she used and she just wants to share that with all of you there's also the basic recipe to just make the pure coconut oil CBD so today what we're what we're offering you is the dried him

and every day thank you", "jcxCV5xVqZw": "today's review is of veritas farms cbd their full spectrum sports cream i sent it to two independent labs see if it's real i did test their 500 milligram tincture previously at two independent labs and it was real full spectrum cbd and had a little more than they claimed the cost was about average it tasted great and the company passed my background check let's see the sports cream disclosure i do have affiliate links on my site to help me pay for these products i buy myself and the independent lab test but i promise you these are my independent thoughts and you can see the actual lab certs here links below if you want to support me please subscribe like share and all of that sharing helps most because youtube doesn't like to share my videos because plants and lab tests on those plants are dangerous burn bucks okay 600 milligrams claimed a full spectrum hemp oil they are not specific on cbd levels or how much cbd is in this product exactly and the labs found 18 to 20 percent more cannabinoids than suggested by their label this 600 milligrams on the front about 670 to 680 milligrams of cbd which is good if you thought you were getting 600 milligrams of cbd that's actually great let's take a peek peek at the gram breakdown there is 57 grams in this 2 ounce bottle about 12 grams of cbd per gram a gram is about a milliliter and i see your eyes glazing over you american this little bottle here 57 squeezes that's what you need to know so you get 57 squeezes of 12 milligrams of cbd out of this it's not bad it's potent it's full spectrum but the trace levels of other cannabinoids are pretty low i'm uh i'm not sure if the 0.3 milligrams of thc per little gram serving if that's a serving will have any effect it may help the cbd a bit because thc is considered powerful however cbd absorbs 10 times better into the skin than thc so don't expect too much out of the thc according to one research paper or study you don't need to worry about thc and drug tests here because thc does not pass the skin into the blood according to current research but look it up because uh i'm uh just your cbd guinea pig and i'm not your doctor or your probation officer as always i talk about the lab results and not my individual reactions to the product which can be misleading everyone has a different reaction to cbd due to your individual and the cannabinoid system your health conditions so look at the cannabinoid levels and remember those when you find a product that works for you for me this works as well as a cbd cream with the 12 milligrams of cbd per gram but you really need to try cbd lotion yourself to know if it works for you or for whatever you're using it for i do use it for muscle recovery okay the cost here's what i like 4.5 cents which is great mini lotions are priced way too high 10 cents is now about average for tinctures you know the ones the drops you put in your mouth per milligram of cbd that is so this at 4.5 cents for the cream is cheap i don't know why cream is cheaper than the tinctures you put in your mouth but it seems to be here the smell oh damn it all over my beard the smell it's got a bunch of ingredients but it is unscented the one thing about all these ingredients here they are considered safe for use in cosmetics but there are a few safety concerns especially if you look at those uh food babe type of blogs these will kill you if you look at those rest you get a respiratory toxin irritant environmental toxin i'm sure these are all considered uh toxins in very large quantities and safe uh what they use it here they're common when i was a firefighter i once worked a wildland fire all night no respirator it turned out to be a meth dump in the morning when we could see among other things that i will not mention here because i am a gentleman yet i wasn't very concerned but uh if that would concern you and you subscribe to food babe type of blogs maybe you won't like this product maybe i should care more or be more concerned about these ingredients you're right but they're all common ingredients not that that's a good thing okay back to the smell it is a full spectrum and has a very light smell of hemp maybe something else in it it has uh the clean smell of cream i can't say which of those ingredients makes it so maybe it's that good old peg 100 steroid the sweet smell of environmental toxins i like that but it smells like a lotion i know i'm very specific on that lotion smell the hemp smell is not too strong it dies down after a minute or two of putting it on and after about 10 minutes it's hard to smell anything at all which is good if you like going out in public and not smelling like hem i've uh tried some potent hemp creams that are really nasty and they stay nasty for a long time but i don't want to get it twisted with this natural hem it has a little bit of that as light as it is doesn't really smell good it smells okay it smells good for what it is but hemp doesn't really smell good they also make a cream in minted lavender i bet that one actually smells really good based on their tinctures and gummies which taste exceptional the look veritas farms does a great job of packaging and branding it looks very professional the color here let me put a little on my skin again i got a bunch color is a little brown somewhere in between cream color and the color of my beautiful palm color maybe slightly dirty cream and you can uh you can smell it a bit when you put it on now overall it's good the the price is great it's trustworthy the company is trustworthy if you don't like the smell of hemp well you avoid this and maybe buy their minted lavender cream or really avoid full spectrum hemp products most of them and go with a pure cbd cbd isolate because pure cbd itself has no smell so those pure cbd ones can smell great also maybe you won't like this if you read every ingredient in your cosmetics personally i don't i use old spice deodorant which i'm sure will kill me before this product will and i say that without even knowing what's in my old spice because i didn't read the ingredients that and when i used to hang out in meth fields as a firefighter of course disclaimer this is not medical advice this is a good unscented full spectrum cbd at an excellent price see you next time hit that subscribe and notification bell because i've got more coming and you need to know if you're getting fake cbd or real cbd or what it smells like see you next time", "zkPf_U2mEN0": "hi everybody this is Susan Eliot and today we're going to be making our Lian bomb it's a mad soothing Lian bomb now I'm going to say a few words about recipes I am going to do another video just about recipes in my soapy business uh series but for now I just want to talk about recipes I have three types of recipes I have recipes that a basic that I basically give away and I most likely have taken them from someplace else someplace like nature's garden or bramble berry and there's a few very generous suppers on the internet who give away recipes and so I learned from other people I believe we've all have a duty to give back to new people who are coming on and so I have those that I give away freely the other one is I've tweaked the basic one and I usually tell you what my tweak is I might not give you exact measurements and the reason why I do that is because sometimes my tweaks and my modifications don't work out for other people depending on where you live what your customers are like what you know what supplies you're using so I don't give it because I'm trying to keep it to myself I give it because I can't troubleshoot it if it doesn't work for you the third one is something like I'm going to do today it's like I took me a lot of months to come up with it of course I put all of my ingredients on the label so all you have is wearing my label and know how it goes there's a few different steps that you should be aware of when you're making um a muscle balm like this and I'm going to tell you what those are and you know but basically I'm not going to give you the exact recipe it took me months to come up with this and you don't need everything that I put into it this is my sort of super-duper muscle balm this is the the top of the line you could use only some of these ingredients I'll tell you which ones are necessary which ones are not and and have a perfectly fine bomb you could also I don't use any petroleum products you could also use petroleum jelly in place of the salve that I make myself at the beginning of this and I will you know I mean it's perfectly fine if that's what you want to do if you don't if you don't do your own herbal infusions like I do if you don't want to make your own SAP you can use petroleum jelly I don't use drilling products but you can't so what I want to do is tell you what's absolutely necessary ah this is a mask when you're working with menthol which is absolutely necessary you want to be wearing a mask it can get it makes me nauseous some people have trouble when they breathe it in some people it makes them nauseous for me it makes me nauseous that's why I wear a mask please wear a mask whenever you're you're messing around with menthol the other thing is I'm going to make a salve that's going to be the basis of that so if you don't have a SAP you need to have petroleum jelly and this is my recipe pads here I wonder where it went to um so for the SAP I mean these wax that I use local locally sourced organic beeswax so in order to make the salve I need that I need my fuse oils which I'm going to use my own comfrey and my own calendula infused oils do not use any comfrey and few soils on and open on a deep open wound you can use up on superficial wounds but this is a muscle bomb so it really should just go on muscles where there's no deep wound comfrey is so healing that it heals the surface so fast that the skin does not have time to regenerate underneath if it's a deep wound and actually can cause an infection so don't ever use any comfrey based product on a deep wound you could use it on superficial wounds you could use it on rashes you can even use it on broken bones it's great but don't use it on deep wounds I use vitamin E I put vitamin E and all of my bombs all of my self it's just about every product I make has vitamin E in it you need the mental and you need a camphor this is camphor essential oil and basically that's all you need you need the basic salve which in my case I'm going to make myself and I'll show you some of that you need the menthol you need the camphor that and that's it that's all you really need if you use the petroleum jelly instead of the the SAP I also put in cajuput essential oil lavender essential oil frankincense essential oil eucalyptus central oil wintergreen essential oil peppermint essential oil and clove bud essential oil so that's what I use in my top-of-the-line muscle balm you don't have to use all these essential oils you really just need the mental the camphor and the the base to put it in either salve or petroleum jelly but this is my top of the line I make ones that are less potent and they don't have all of these in so I'm going to get started and I also have my jars they are boiling in water so that they're sterilized and I'm going to clean up a bit and then we'll get started now the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to make the salve now the basic recipe for the salve is an ounce of beeswax to a cup of oil so I'm going to take my calendula and my Humphrey oil and I'm going to do half a cup of each one I just did these so that is the comfrey very dark very successful infusion it's very happy with it if you saw the video oh this is Michelangelo this is chamomile which is which is fine and I do make this with a with calendula and I do make it with chamomile today we're going to do chamomile and come a you don't even have to make a salve you can use a petroleum jelly or you can just use a carrier oil with the beeswax you don't you don't have to have infused oil that's just something that I like to do so I have my cup of of oil and now I'm going to slice off an ounce of beeswax oh I know what I was missing I was missing shea butter I put shea butter in my my balm as well and that's because I really wanted to have a nice consistency when all is said and done so I knew there was something else that I was missing so it's the shea butter okay so I have chopped off an ounce of beeswax and I'm going to put this away and I'm going to melt the beeswax and a double boiler so I'm going to do now is I'm going to put the melted beeswax into the oil and it's going to solidify like almost immediately there we go there we go have nice solid and what you can do at this point is you can put this back into the water so that it it melts again or you could heat up the oil before so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put this back in here and get all that these wax out and then I'm going to put the this back in the water now it's all melted and now it's going to cool down and it's going to create a salve if you keep scraping the sides down everything will become a salve now it's a dark green because of the comfrey if it was not if the comfrey was not involved in this it would not be so dark green it would be more like a pale yellow or even a beige but because the comfrey is so dark it's so you see it it's getting very gelatinous and you just mix it around now if you wanted this to be the extent of your product this would be a great great healing salve chamomile and comfrey like I said it's good on everything bruises rashes superficial cuts not deep cuts because the comfrey is so healing it's one of the only things as you can say don't use this because it's too good but it really heals so quickly that it doesn't give the bottom layers enough time to to really do its job so this is mixed up fairly well it looks great so there's a little piece it looks like a little piece of comfrey with them in the oil so anyway this is the South that we're going to use is the basis and I'm going to prepare the menthol and show you what we do so it's important to weigh out exactly how much salve you're going to have when you're finished so this is 5.8 so then I'm going to put in probably half that for a for shea butter and I'm probably going to put around half of that for menthol so I have put the shea butter and the menthol chips in together and I'm going to put them in the double boiler and let them melt and like I said this is where you definitely want to put your mask on now while that is melting what I'm going to do is I'm going to weigh out my oh the menthol is already trying to get to me uh-huh I'm going to weigh out my oils my essential oils and I can tell you that a lot of times it's so light when you when you're dealing with something like this it doesn't really measure out so know how many drops is in you know an ounce or whatever the thing that's the most important is the camphor oil so try to make sure you have at least an ounce of the camphor and you can you know take it from there and try to figure out how many drops are are in it but I'm not going to make you sit through that but I'm just telling you that's how I came up with it because sometimes the scale just doesn't pick up on measuring the essential oils until you've got more than you need ok this is 2 ounces of camphor oil and the next thing that I'm going to need is an ounce of of clove and then cajuput and then everything else I usually put in you know from a few drops to half an ounce okay so our shea butter and our our Ben Thal is nicely melted we have our essential oils and vitamin E right here and like I said the only thing you absolutely need for for muscle balm is the menthol the camphor and some sort of base you know which we made our own comfrey chamomile staff everything else is is optional and I put peppermint eucalyptus and wintergreen in there you really only need one of those I just like this really strong this is for me and I have a lot of really really difficult muscle issues and you know I have lupus so I have a lot of aches and pains and this stuff is just magic the frankincense is also very expensive you don't need that I find that it works better for me you don't need the lavender that works better for me I find the clove to be something that you do need an essential essential oil for this but you could get away without it if you want something very light you know just go with the menthol the camphor and you know add some cajuput a little bit of the clove and you're good to go you know with your base either petroleum jelly or making your own Saveur liniment so anyway I'm going to wait for this to cool down to 120 before I add my essential oils and now mix it all together in the meantime I am sterilizing my jars if this is going to go into and I also have Saint John's wort um which I just got today and so I'm going to be making and infused oil with that so so I have a bigger mason jar in there but I have the smaller jason mason jars in there for this SAP okay so we're almost ready to get going again my this is the shea butter and the mental chips they're almost down to 120 which is where I want them so that I can put the essential oils the vitamin E in and then we'll add the salve as well I have my my little jars have come out of the boiling water where they boiled forever and ever in seen and this is for me so I am OCD and I do um really take a lot of precautions that might seem like overkill to some people and it probably is but that's the way I do it so you know I'm going to make sure that you know these are absolutely dry so that we're not introducing any water into this because we all know that water breeds bacteria and fungus so one of the things that I was saying before about recipes is you know I have basic recipes that I freely give away because people gave to me when I first started making products like this I have other ones that I usually give you the tweaks I might not give you the exact amounts but it get is because your supplies my different than mine where you live might be different then you know how things behave where I live etc etc and then there's ones that you know it's like this you're going to read all of this on the label this recipe took me a very long time to come up with and to get it right now I gave you a sort of an idea of the Rhett you know the recipe and and the amounts but I didn't give you the exact ones because you don't need everything that I put in here you can make a perfectly nice one you know by yourself with it with different things I showed you what was necessary what was not necessary if I go onto somebody's video and they say I never give out recipes I turn it off I never go back there again I will not give them views there are some techniques that people use that yes you do want to see but if somebody's just sitting there making a soap I'm not going to sit there and watch them hand blend some some oils and lye together when they're not showing me anything that I don't already know how to do I don't care and if you're so selfish like you're not curing cancer you should have I believe you can have your proprietary recipes you don't want to give to other people but everybody should have some recipes that they give to new Sopris because people gave to us we didn't learn this in a vacuum we didn't wake up one day know how to do this stuff so if you're you know think that you're so magnificent now you can't share any recipe with anyone ever I will not give you the views on your videos I just won't and I believe that everybody should have some basic recipes that they share with others that they let people know where they've gone from they can point them to the resources you know things like that then there's the other ones where you say you know I took this basic recipe from so-and-so and I put this twist on it you know and then there's ones like this where it's like yeah this is what you absolutely need to make a muscle balm but all these other ingredients you could put in make make it you know really good but you don't have to so I encourage people if you go to somebody's site and they say I don't give out any of my recipes ever shut them off don't give them views it's ridiculous if they have some great technique that you really want to learn you know be a piping or making layers of soap or something like that fine but if it's just them putting some oils and lye together and and dumping it in a mold a big deal who cares like just don't go back there that's what I say so I think that everybody should give back to new Soper's like people gave to me because I didn't know what I was doing and I watched it's videos before I ever started this the other thing that I wanted to say is if when you use in menthol if you don't wear glasses like I do or even if you do and your your eyes are particularly sensitive you might want to put on goggles because the mental affects your your eyes as well and you know it's great if you have a cold or something clear everything up but if you don't you definitely want to cover your your nose your mouth and your eyes so anyway this is 121 we're almost there so like I've shown all my videos you know I alcohol things down especially just gonna be for sale this isn't for sale this is just for me but I do it anyway so this is the spoon that I'm going to use to mix and you know I will alcohol this down I just need a paper towel to do that so I have my alcohol spoon and I'm going to check my temperature should be down below 120 and then I'm just going to mix the essential oils and it is 119 ok here we go let's see I'm just going to this is the essential oils and a vitamin E and if you're going to use vitamin E and let's make sure it's a real vitamin E not you know some crap that they're you know if you look closely it says you know 2% vitamin E or something like that because there's a lot of people out there I would do it ok so that is very strong between the menthol and now all I'm going to do is I'm going to mix in my fabulous fabulous salve this is all going to mix together if you give us what petroleum jelly I don't know how comes out because I've never used it but I assumed that it would be the same thing I can smell the menthol I could smell the camphor now all I got to just get this mixed really well I think I'm actually going to use my hand blender for a minute me trusty stick bag where I'd be without it obviously this is from two different I just grabbed the first bottom and the first top that I saw so it's a little liquidy but I definitely will great so it is liquidy you can see that and you know because the shea butter will firm up and the beeswax the liniment will firm up this will all firm up I'm going to pour this into the jars and let you see see it it pours and this will all this will all firm up and this is one reason why you don't always give out recipes because if for some reason this didn't firm up which I'm sure it well because I've done this just people gonna come to you and say oh I'm one didn't firm up what happened and if this if that happened if this didn't firm up but you stay like this I would just make another salve base and then I would just put it all together until you know was the point that it did but I'm just going to give this a little bit and I'll bring you back while I was waiting for this to set up I did my uh st. John's wort infusion and I want to show you this Saint John's wort is one of the few herbs that I would suggest putting a little bit of oil in the bottom because it's so dense that sometimes it can take a long time for the oil to go all the way through so I just put a little bit at the bottom I probably should have showed you that but anyway this is the st. John's wort it's in sunflower that I have rosemary only arisen in apricot oil and extra virgin olive oil some people have asked me why don't you I'm an oil and you can absolutely use sweet I'm an oil to do infusions it's a great oil to do infusions but I don't use it for people that have allergies because I figure people with nut allergies have enough problem sometimes finding products so I try to make you know my healing balms my healing salve you know very you know nut allergy friendly so anyway so see this is setting up and it will continue to set up as as it firms up okay this has firmed up look at it it looks and smells amazing this is you can see it it's just lovely I'm going to take a little bit I'm going to put it on my very icky shoulders amazing amazing it's creamy it's wonderful so this is our top of the line lion balm if you want it you can order it you you", "yRRRaF_BKy8": "today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD based self by Christy wood from by the bay farms [Music] this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compound smells really really good she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not ena constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really important with any product like this we're really any cannabis product I'm going to move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat panic self massage it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the SAP itself I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life [Music] how's it going everybody its Freddie back here today and I'm bringing you a another product review and this time it is not from a dispensary and it is also not a flower or smokeable product so today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD base South by Christie wood from by the bay farms now Christy's located in Buzzards Bay and she was actually kind enough to reach out to me on Instagram and tell me about her products a little bit and she actually sent me some so this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compounds but I'm super interested in stuff like this because I have very little experience actually no experience with topicals so super exciting really something new for me and hopefully seeing as I get a lot of questions about CBD and the different uses for it this can help me and you both learn a little bit more about this really cool cannabinoid that is getting a lot of attention but people don't seem to have as much hands-on experience with as they'd like including me so firstly thank you thank you very much to Christy I really appreciate the generosity and you reaching out to me anybody who reaches out to me you kind of hold a special place in my heart because I put a lot of work into these videos into these reviews and it's a lot of passion as well and I don't mind doing it but whenever anybody shows appreciation that means a lot to me so you Christie and let's get into it so the South a basic basically the ingredients in here are organic coconut oil beeswax cannabis extracts in essential oils so this is a CBD only product as I mentioned before and the directions are essentially to Chris you suggest that you test a small bit of this SAP on your skin before applying it to a larger area just to make sure there's no reactions or interactions with your skin so essentially it's just like a bomb or something that you rub on your skin she recommends Christie does using a spoon to avoid cross-contamination or bacterial growth within the salad self and the recommendation on this page says that you cannot put too much on so there's no overdoing it with this I've used it a little bit the one thing I would say is it can be a little bit oily if you take too much at once so you might have a little bit of that coconut oily residue on your hands if you grab a little too much for a certain area but honestly what I do with it is if I have a little extra on my hands I know this sounds a little weird but I just like run it through my hair I really can you see this stuff being used for almost any use is kind of a skin facial topical sort of healing ointment type menthol icy hot almost type applicator or application would be a good use for this and I I believe that the coconut oils and stuff like that are really good for hair as well this is just a personal thing for me um I have kind of long hair I put products in it and if I have a little extra of this Salib on my hands just run it right through there some people might think that's weird too gross or greasy but I don't know I think it's natural smells really really good I have to say maybe the aroma the aroma therapy qualities of this stuff might be one of its strongest uses for me or the aroma therapy aromatherapy qualities if that's even a word are some of my favorite parts of the self so when I have it in my hands or on the spoon I just kind of inhale it or just hold up my hands and kind of breathe deeply and that just seems to be a really nice kind of calming effect for me that could be in my head but whatever works for you works for you right so I'm not here to judge and hopefully you aren't either so yeah this stuff is awesome I've been using it pretty much daily Christie recommends using it about 6 to 10 times a day for the first few weeks constant application seems to be the method to the madness with this stuff so getting a baseline of just like any medication really you know getting a baseline of it in your system or on your skin will help you get used to it and will help you reap the benefits from it a little bit faster and more holy so 6 - time 6 to 10 times a day apply it to whichever areas you feel you need it the most and after that you can start to decrease the dosage that you put on according to Christie so she mentions specifically at the end of this little blurb she's written me that she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not enough so if you want to purchase this stuff from Christie or you're thinking about checking it out be wary you're not going to you know put it on one time like some snake oil and immediately be cured of all your ailments it's not how any medicine really works so constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really is really important with any product like this notice how you feel before during and after an experience with something like this or really any cannabis product because that's how you really can you know see the effects because they're not always immediate they're not always super extravagant at first but when you implement cannabis and cannabis infused products into your life daily the little steps it makes over a long period of time make a huge difference so that's what I try to tell people is you know don't expect a one-time care because those don't exist in life but kind of weaving these natural and organic and well done products into your lifestyle will really just make your quality of life so much better in my opinion okay so now I'm gonna give you guys a little breakdown of how I apply this stuff and yeah we'll go from there so I'm going to actually turn and move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat oh okay so as you can see summer has not yet hit in Massachusetts I am pale as a ghost but I like to put this stuff on my shoulders I get a lot of tension in my neck and in my upper shoulders so I find that an early morning application of this South especially after sleeping on my neck weird if by the way if you don't notice if you haven't noticed by now I have a [ __ ] long neck so this thing's always hurting me actually I had to put an extra little book on my tripod because my neck was too long for the Headroom anyway I digress so what I do per the instructions I open this up if that is really cool-looking I'll actually bring it over to you you can see it so you can see the way my fingertips are ready it's smells reminiscent of a mix vapor rub kind of which is one of my all-time favorite scents mixed with cannabis it's got a really strong cannabis smell but it's not overwhelming it's not skunky it's kind of a sweet natural organic smell of cannabis if that makes sense it's so so so medicinal just as an aroma therapy medicine for me I could literally sit here and sniff this stuff all day and it's just calmed me right down I think that's kind of the essential oils that are in here I'm sure that those have a lot to do with it alright so basically what I do is I get a little bit on the spoon and now I don't want it to be too much I don't know if you can see very well here but I don't have a lot have a little bit and then I just put that in my hands and so one thing that Christie talks about in here which i think is really wise and smart is the fact that a lot of times pain or inflammation or symptoms you're experiencing might be localized in one spot that not that may not be the cause of the of the ailment itself or the root cause so you might be feeling pain in one place as you see him rubbing this together you might be feeling pain in one place but the cause might be in another spot next to it so make sure you apply this in a large swath of skin or area because you don't just want to focus on the one localized acute pain point you kind of want to get all around it to loosen everything up so hands super oily right now it's all this stuff so what I like to do is just rub it on my neck and shoulders so right on my upper back kinda massaging it in this would make a really good massage oil too and that's not a necessarily written use for it on here but I'm sure it would be perfect for that so if you are a masseuse you like to give yourself self massage or if you've got a significant other you bless this out give them a little back and booty rub you're gonna have a healthy happy relationship oh man yeah so I just rub it all in and then with the excess I just gotta you know throw it in the hair I got a headband in now so probably to mess it up a little bit but I know that might might be gross to some people you might think it's greasy and weird but I don't care so immediately upon applying this stuff I'll tell you I also put my shirt back on immediately upon applying this stuff I feel a menthol like quality and the CBD seems to take effect and root in right after this menthol like feeling kind of wears off so it's immediately it's not an icy hot it's not intense like you know hot to relax it away or cold anything it's more so just a very not a numbing feeling but a slight kind of anesthetic numbing agent feeling it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to and this could be you know placebo effect but it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the south-- itself so take that for what it's worth that's a personal anecdote of mine I have a nose pick evidence to back that but yeah you put the stuff on you take a take a bowl or a nice bong rip it might have increased efficacy for you and that's something I believe in so definitely something to keep in mind if you do plan on getting some of this South which I do highly recommend like I said overall as a lifestyle choice I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life because we use a lot of oils rubs creams and stuff but to be able to have access to something that's derived from cannabis and has those essential oils and common pounds in them is really cool and nice and I can't thank Christie enough once again I'll say it again Christie would by the bay farm her phone number five zero eight six eight five oh seven seven nine and you can also see her website on cannabis pain SOUTHCOM that is cannabis pain South one word.com south is sa l ve alright so that's about all I have for you today I feel great my muscles are definitely more relaxed after all of this and since I've implemented this as a daily kind of regimen I honestly do feel less or less tight in the morning and overall great experience so I can't recommend it enough Thank You Christy and thank you for watching I really appreciate it have a good one guys you", "1iuA5wDv3Jo": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "GUoZnJAZsXQ": "[Music] medical marijuana and Arkansas CBD oil dr. Kate Chandler from cornerstone clinic for women is here to talk about whether they are safe to use while pregnant good morning to you and what I mean this is a topic that I think we have talked about before but some new studies have come out and so if you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant you'll want to listen up yes so yeah there was a study that was presented last week and medical meeting and it was printed in the journal American Medical Association so that of course marijuana used in pregnant women is on the rise so you know 10 15 years ago was about 3% now it's about 7% and this was a study done about half a million women so one in 14 reported using it but few of them were saying that their doctors say they should use it but they've used it thinking would help with sleep or nausea things like this so are you surprised now when you have a patient come in that says I use CBD oil or medical or marijuana in general well I mean I guess I say it's hard to be surprised about many things that we see but but I am surprised a lot of women may not know that's not a good idea there's just not enough evidence to say it's safe I think what happens when people know oh it's medical it's approved for medical use now or it's recreation approved for recreational use what is because it's been used for medical things like chronic pain or motor OSes or spasticity doesn't mean it's safe just like you know just because alcohol is legal doesn't mean pregnant women should be drinking alcohol when it's just there's some evidence that it might affect the babies IQ later in life their attention span it does it doesn't allow their brain to develop normally because these THC could be hitting the receptors in the brain that are meant for something else to be hitting them now what about CBD oil a lot of people say well that that's safe right I can use that yeah well in CBD I think it can be a great option because see buddy has a lot of the benefits that marijuana could have like affecting decrease inflammation decreasing pain maybe even maybe decreasing there's some studies studies looking at improving immune system decreasing cancer however it's not been proven to be safe in pregnancy either not with pregnancy or breastfeeding because again we don't know how to expecting the brain development and so we shouldn't be using it in pregnancy or with breastfeeding and there's been to that THC definitely crosses the into the breast milk so yeah I want to do that plus here's the other thing is that CBD is not well regulated so you're very careful of where you pick this up because it might have more THC than you know and the other thing I just this isn't a side note but if somebody is using CBD which again I think there's some positives to it you if you're somebody who might be tested like you have to go through if you are in work that you don't need to be doing anything that might be level in their you yeah you can have very strong issues even though they may say there's none in it there's a lot of don't back up claims that you know but we're gonna back you up if your job says it's been found because well plus you never know if there has been some other uses there anyway I just be very cautious yeah err on the side of caution because these studies are still new but we're seeing an increase in women which surprises me as well yeah I think decimal just want to get the word out that even though it has been approved medical use and it's in some states recreational it's not quite in pregnancy breastfeeding alright thank you doctor Chandler we appreciate you we look forward to your next topic okay", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and

Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can.

I'm going to be doing a very much requested video from all of our subscribers which is how to make extra-strength CBD oil but before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please consider hitting that subscribe button and supporting our channel also if you already have subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to show that support so folks the number one request I've gotten and it's our second most viewed video on our channel is how to make CBD oil but a lot of people want to know how they can get more bang for their buck and how they can get more CBD in that oil and today I'm going to show you how you can do it but before we get into the details of how to make this exercise CBD oil if you guys are interested in hemp flour go ahead and email me I'll leave all that in the description below check out our website we have a new menu all new prices and a lot of our customers make CBD oil at home so we've adjusted a lot of our pricing to accommodate people who make their own CBD oil so go ahead and check that out and you can always email me and we accept most major payments at this point via PayPal folks the ingredients really is just one extra step to make extra strength CBD oil now this is a request for a family member this is not how I make CBD oil here on the farm to distribute so this is just as order for a family friend but I thought I would take this opportunity to share with you how you can do it at home so first thing you're gonna need to do is of course you're gonna want to have your hemp flour now again guys you can always grab this from us and again all that information is in the description below but here is some cherry wine hemp flour that our our family friend requested and we are going to make CBD oil with it now our cherry wine has a great amount of CBD in 19% to be exact so we can get more for our money by adding one simple ingredient and that is lesson 10 now with lesson 10 why does it make so much of a difference well MCT oil has a maximum absorption rate which means even a 100% ratio it really can't absorb all the CBD that these flowers have so to bump up the absorption rate you can add less ATIP and less if it has all the essential things to be able to absorb more cannabinoids so that is why a lot of people adolescent in now there is a ton of different less attends out there there's soy lecithin with granular and liquid you got sunflower lesson 10 grandeur and liquid love about capsules but I just buy liquid now I buy sunflower less attendant that is in the liquid form because I don't like soy I'm not a big fan of eating soy I think it's just in too many foods in the United States today so I went with sunflower lesson you can go with regular if that's what you prefer when you filter it out using our magic butter machine it doesn't really make much of a difference I just prefer the liquid now in order to get this started we're gonna have to decarbonise if allah grants stay the same for our CBD well as it does for this we're going to be doing 28 grams of CBD flour and 2 cups of MCT oil so that's approximately 14 grams of flour per cup now you can range that between seven and fourteen depending on your potency but we're really trying to maximize the absorption rate of the oil and the less intense so we're gonna do the maximum amount and we're going to be adding less aten so I'm going to go D carb our cherry wine flour that we have here I'm going to weigh it to 28 grams we've got our D carboxy R and you can see I've already waited and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fire up the oven I'm going to put it at 250 degrees and I'm going to be doing it for approximately 30 minutes so I will see you in 30 minutes with some D carb flour okay folks our flour has now been D carb is out of the oven and it is ready to go so obviously the first thing we're gonna do is go ahead and get all this flour into the magic butter machine now you all know that I absolutely love my magic butter machine you can't convert this recipe to work in a crock-pot or anything else but as always I just want my magic butter machine so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna add our MCT oil now this was purchased online 16 fluid ounces I know a lot of my subscribers always ask me what is my favorite MCT oh oh whoa this has pretty much everything you want to look for it's organic non-gmo and of course it's USDA certified organic which is a big deal so first and foremost we're just going to take the wrapper off of this and go ahead and add it now again like I said 16 fluid ounces equals two cups so there's no need to measure this we can go ahead and add it directly into the machine now here's the change of the recipe folks it really depends on how much less attend you want to add I wouldn't go any more than two tablespoons per cup so a maximum for this recipe would be four tablespoons of less eaten but I'm gonna do right in the middle there I'm gonna probably do about three for this recipe because it's such a high CBD amount that I don't want to overdo it but I also don't want to under do it so go ahead and get your tablespoon measure and you're just going to measure it out now you can see it's very sludgy so it takes a little bit of time it's almost like molasses type texture it's very slow very syrupy so you're gonna have to take your time with it but maybe we'll just do two for this round two for videos sake but you can add whatever you want so as we wait for this to go into the magic butter machine go ahead and cap everything now here's the thing for for you folks at home here's a little trick to the trade keep your MCT oil bottle because a lot of them come with spouts like this one and what I like to do especially for family members isn't the first time I've done this for family members is I usually just refill the bottle with the CBD oil and hand it back to him and you can do that at home and that way you don't have to use a mason jar or anything like that you can just you know even put another label over top of this I use a sharpie so you know that it's cbdo so you don't try cooking with it or anything like that so most of the lesson2 is off but what we're going to do is we're going to use our trusty magic butter spatula and make sure we get it all off of the tablespoon here and you go ahead and see so that's about it best we can now now that we've added the Blessington we're gonna go ahead and fire up our magic butter machine so let me get this plugged in now folks as always same as before we're gonna go up to 160 which is the middle of the road for this so there's your temperature 160 and I do 4 hours for the texture so folks I will see you in four hours to show you the final product all right folks so this has just gone off the magic butter machines timer has gone off so I'm going to do is go ahead and unplug it and you know go ahead and get all the stuff you can off the top of the machine here this one looks pretty good right now actually now the whole lot to get off of there which is good I find that the little spatula that magic butter makes works really well for this now we got their spatula kit from the a couple weeks ago all right so now as always guys you see how it's always on the edge here so you just want to scoop that down in because that has oil in it get all that ends all right and so this process is going to be the same as we've always done with all of our other oils you always put it on the love glove or the the silicone glove you always put it on your dominant hand if your left hand and put it on your left hand it just makes things easier okay so that is the majority of the oil right there now this oil will definitely be darker than a traditional CBD whoa and that is because of the sunflower lecithin note no worries about it it doesn't really have much of a different flavor but it's just something to note if you are using the liquid less inton it will have a darker look to it and I'll show you here so you can see it's a little darker than normal CBD oil not by much but it's definitely noticeable a lot of times when I make it with the by ox you know it comes out a little bit lighter and so typically what I'll do is I'll get all the other stuff there's still plant material that needs to be squeezed but I want to show you guys this trick I go ahead and I put it right back in the bottle okay so what this does to is it frees up this Pyrex measuring cup for me to be able to get all the plant material really not have to worry about splashing any of the oil or wasting any of the oil so you go ahead and you just put it right back in the bottle and then go ahead and put all the plant material in here and get rid of it so now you're not going to get a lot of oil out of the plants but it is worth giving a good squeeze you know making sure it's all out of there get as much as you can again you don't want to waste it it's good stuff takes four hours to make so you want to make sure that you get your money's worth if you're at home looks pretty good one more scoop here all right so that's it get your uh your glove back on and you kind of shake it all down there you're just gonna give it a good squeeze try to get as much of that well as you can out of there now you can refine it a little bit more if you want I have Magic butters other screens the 190th which is what they provide with the magic butter machine works great but if you don't like any type of sediment or plant material in your oil you can't even refine it more but I recommend making sure you do this round first and then go ahead and use a different screen but yeah so we can add that we need to get a lot out of the plant material but it's enough I would say that we got a pretty decent return probably about 13 ounces out of the 16 you're always gonna lose oil so that's just the nature and there's still some in here but that's what I have for you today guys again remember if you need hemp flour my contact information will be in the description below go ahead and check it out we have adjust our prices for people who make their own CBD oil at home to benefit them because a lot of our sales are for that so we're trying to adjust accordingly and I appreciate all the YouTube supporters out there that have purchased from our farm and support our farm I do appreciate it guys but yeah that's the extra-strength CBD oil recipe I hope it works you guys at home you guys have any questions leave a comment below and you can always find me on Instagram and Facebook that information will always be in the description below so that's all I have for you today guys I hope you take care hope this recipe works for you and I will see you in another video", "VfLW9TnHTRc": "hi everybody it's broken Sierra here love happy Monday it is a gorgeous day it's very nice I had lunch and chatted all about what we're talking about today which is topicals but anyway I hope you guys get a chance to outside and enjoy this lovely day and we are going to dive into our recipe that we made today but first we're gonna talk about obviously the skin which is like goes hand in hand with topicals the skin is so important because it is the largest organ of our body so clearly it's important yes and it's important to take care of your skin but it's interesting because our skin is a huge indicator of what is going on internally yes it is so Brooke tell me about what inspired you to make your own balm so as you guys know we do carry a mary's medicinal freeze which is a nice topical and we have our great synergy balm which is awesome I actually broke my foot and I use this around my foot it got great relief from it yeah it's really really nice so one thing that I noticed is that these are our Mary's medicinal CBD and our synergy really relief is a one to one THC CBD I was looking for something that was strictly THC so a high THC bomb so I took it into my own hands to take one of the grassroot RSO syringes and recreate my own bomb so that's what I did oh creative but we thought we would talk about this because we used products that we have here yes to make something that's a little bit more customized you used essential oils used coconut oil the only thing that we don't have which we were talking about you can just get at Whole Foods is beeswax yes and there's no difference between whether you get the pellet fees wax or the chunks of beeswax so either one so let's show the final product tell us how you so I'm give a smell it smells so good I did any tree oil tree yeah cuz so one reason that my bomb is strictly well not strictly but mainly made out of coconut oil and tea tree oil is for its antifungal properties so I suffer from Candida I get it on my back and I get it but it normally flare up in the spring but it's never really something that's to astronomical but I did just have a birthday and went on a sugar overload ship curry whenever a sugar overlays like me for a day weekend it was so fabulous yeah this is one I haven't used yet so you guys it's amazing this won't ruin your clothes no it doesn't ruin my sheets I put it on after the shower or before bed and it doesn't ruin my pajamas doesn't get on my sheets it absorbs really really nicely into the skin so it's because of sort of like how you made it you make sure that it emulsifies properly yeah let it cool yes okay so tell us like step by step so you combined half well this all kind of comes out to half a cup is what you were saying yeah so I feel like it came out to a total all my oils mixed together came out to a half a cup so I did about 1/3 a cup of coconut oil if you have a problem with coconut oil you can always do olive oil or avocado oil we do but we have in the dispensary which is fabulous so I did that I did an ounce of tea tree oil not only for the scent but I also an regime one oh yes I really wanted the antifungal from the tea tree oil so some of the tea tree or I'm sorry some of these scented oils that we have here in the shop are the blood orange the lavender and the peppermint these ones are great for mood boosting and to reduce anxiety so these are fabulous so it depends on what you need like yeah I have to make they don't have to make there's a tea tree nope if you prefer a certain scent if you want to use this before bedtime because we know lavender is a great one to help relax yeah then throw some lavender in there exactly so what's great about this is I had my oils I took everything I did a double boil put everything in there I had my total one ml syringe I did an ounce which is I think half a bottle of one of these guys of my essential oil right and then I did my coconut oil once that all emulsified and became one or I'm sorry that all became one pretty easily because it's all a waste I started to add my beeswax so slowly right yeah do all at one out all at once because you want it to slowly emulsify and become one so beeswax normally it's a one-to-one ratio so if you have a cup of all your oil concoction and then an ounce of beeswax what I had done was because I wanted mine to be more of a balm than like a petroleum jelly right I did double the amount of beeswax so I did two ounces of beeswax for my no no I did one else beeswax for my half a cup of mixture so you can see it's super nice it comes out really nice and it's like a true bomb and it just rubs on nice and there is no psychoactive reaction to this is strictly a topical it's a non edible you put your essential oil in it's it smells really nice and you feel it's not sticky it's just like I love it so it's super simple did it home nice little DIY but along with that yes we're still doing our accessory sales so we're just saying if you don't want to do this process you can really make a tincture in your levo with some clues flour and just make sure to add some essential oils because it's not going to be an ingestible tincture really right so you wouldn't miss for a topic Lori yep you would get your oil all out of this it would take make it a lot easier you're gonna have to DIY everything once your oil comes out you would add yours oh you would add your fees wax find the consistency that you like right let it cool I let this cool for two hours for this guy because it wasn't full all the way but this one I gave a solid sex just to cool all the way before I started using it and I just stored it in the bathroom it's cool Oh dark and yeah it's really good it's really great for Sienna so so this is good for and Brooke talked about how she suffers with Candida but bug bites well yeah but mosquito bites this time higher because you both are those yeah people we are those people here are those people the bugs love us so that's you know obviously uncomfortable you're inflamed when you want to keep eating this will help cool and soothe and reduce that inflammation but eczema athletes yes yes any of those topical you know like dermatitis conditions and I was gonna say that I've been using my balm for a week now and my breakouts on my back have significantly reduced in redness and size and I'm gonna give it a month and see how much balm I have left and see my spots so and keep us posted yeah and those are those Omega six is reacting to the inflammation in my body which is coming out

outside and enjoy this beautiful day and we will see you soon bye bye [Music]", "QH1GEuMw8Dc": "hey this is jeremy orozco and today we are going to go on a magical journey to see if varritus farms is real faritas means truth in latin as all of us remember from latin classes during boarding school or if you didn't go to public school in the united states like me maybe you know some latin well veritas we are gonna see the truth about your cbd farm i sent veritas farms to two independent labs to see if it's real how about the product paid for the lab test you're welcome i do use affiliate links on my website disclosure but if you look at my reviews i give some of the most critical honest cbd reviews on the internet and that's because i'm really bad at business and i would rather give you the truth veritas also known as the roman goddess of truth okay let's see the lab test the price breakdown taste test strength and the good the bad and the ugly on veritas farms subscribe because uh i have more coming and you don't want to miss out on this first problem is they claim 500 milligrams but they only say full spectrum hemp and we don't know if it's milligrams of cannabinoids or cbd who are you for a truth goddess we're off to a rough start what did the labs find both labs found that they are real b scores they give a little bit more cannabinoids than suggested links below to this page to see the official lab test dive into this now they are extremely accurate if you go by cbd 500 milligrams of cbd and they are right on the money within three percent accuracy very accurate and it's full spectrum with a good amount of other cannabinoids i used to berate cbd companies for not claiming cbd amounts specific amounts but now every market place is forcing these companies to be vague and not mention the actual words cbd or cannabinoids so i guess they're okay 10 cents per milligram it's good for a fancy little farm in colorado i should note that there is no discount as you go for the bigger bottles the price per milligram stays the same so there's not much point in that there are a lot of cbd companies charging over 15 cents per milligram so 10 cents is okay you can get cbd for as low as 2 cents per milligram but just pretend i didn't say that if you like this brand the taste was excellent one of the best i've tried and i tried the watermelon it kind of tastes like between a watermelon jolly rancher or maybe a watermelon bubble gum sweet but not too sweet and no harsh taste of hemp it's amazing how far cbd companies have come they also make a peppermint which would appeal to more people and non-flavored i think i'd go for the peppermint because i'm not the candy watermelon guy but it does taste great if you're into that sort of thing i don't judge the strength 17 milligrams is a good starting point 0.6 milligrams of thc won't have side effects for most people i would say but may provide some additional benefits to the cbd see the entourage effect for that i would go as far as to say that you can take this and still jump over a moving vehicle if that's your hobby without delayed reactions from thc but always check with your your doctor first before jumping over moving vehicles while using cbd with thc just remember i said that when you end up in the hospital specifically so you don't sue me i have a disclaimer this is a full spectrum and has good amounts of cbc and cbg it actually has more cbg than the majority of full spectrums that i test that's pretty good i know a lot of people want to know how i feel from cbd from this cbd personally but you should never pay attention too much attention to the experience of just one person and a cbd product the effect of cbd and other cannabinoids is very very individualized on your endocannabinoid system and it can be very misleading to listen to one person so i focus on the actual data the lab test so you can find one you like and actually know what's in it veritas farms is a real farm small farm in colorado they have 140 acres they focus on sustainable farming and avoid pesticides surprisingly this little farm made it into major retailers like kroger and cvs nationwide from what i've seen this adds a lot of credibility to a cbd company and it's much more likely that they'll test well and that's what my lab tests have confirmed i didn't find anything concerning about veritas a plus better business bureau score with no negative reports in my in-depth internet search overall i think this is great for new cbd users occasional users gifs this would be a fantastic gift and i promise you that this is going to taste better than 90 percent of cbd companies out there this looks like something you would get at a spa it has a professional luxury look that still says hey i'm a natural little farm here but i keep my barn clean clean packaging and logo small farms are great because they have full control over their products the consistency the same strain and cannabinoids they're not just buying cheap cbd from thousands of different farms growing with questionable methods and pesticides and whatnot if you met some cannabis farmers you know what i'm talking about they are not however going to compete with the giant companies they can offer super super cheap cbd if you didn't know hemp is becoming very cheap right now so a lot of small farms like this one are struggling so if you want to support a small business and get a luxury cbd product for you or a great gift i think this is great they also make gummies capsules topicals skin care and cbd for pets that is it check the links below for more info i will see you next time", "qFPNyuv3pbM": "Welcome back to another video this week I wanted to show you guys how to make your own cannabis lotion So it is a two-part process. I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay. Bye", "CPFckEZ2of0": "hi I'm dr. Rachel Knox and this is my sister dr. Jessica Knox and we're two of four physicians in our family who make up the Knox docks and we are a team of physicians who specialize in cannabinoid medicine which is with a specialization in the endocannabinoid system so we do consider ourselves endocannabinoids i know that is a mouthful but we are here because we believe in the power of the endocannabinoid system to harness health and wellness and we focus on helping people achieve that using Kanab MO medic products like CBD so a lot of people wonder how can I best get the benefit from CBD when should I take it how should I take it how much should I take yeah a lot of it lots of questions about how to maximize benefit from it and part of that depends on what are you using it for so we actually really like CBD as part of your wellness routine and if that's why you're using CBD then really you can take it at any time of the day and whether that's morning noon night as long as it's something that's working into your routine so that it becomes part of that routine so you can benefit from it on a daily basis yeah and you know a good general serving size for wellness is around 20 to 50 milligrams of CBD the whole idea is to start at low doses and increase slowly over time I think another important thing to know is that CBD is lipophilic meeting it likes fats so it actually dissolves better and sort of more Libby's dinner yeah in a fat based product like in oil as opposed to an alcohol alcohol based product where it was sort of like clump it will clump and then you have to like really shake your your products really well to make sure you're getting CBD but if it's in an oil-based product it'll be distributed nicely in there and you can just sort of take that and feel confident that you're getting CBD in the serving size that you're using yeah so certainly there aren't any restrictions to taking CBD on an empty stomach or on a full stomach you can take it when it makes sense for you but keep in mind that that CBD like dr. Jessica said it's lipophilic it likes fat so if you consume it with fat you'll probably increase the bioavailability meaning the absorption into your body another really important thing to know about CBD is there is sort of like a maximum like point of benefit where we call it a biphasic effect where there's this curve and as you start at sort of like a low dose or low yeah serving and you add on you can get more benefit incremental benefit as you increase that serving size our dosage but there's a point at which beyond this little sweet spot if you keep adding more you're starting to lose the benefit you're going down this other side of the curve where it's just sort of like why why shoot pass this sweet spot because now you're sort of wasting resources and and your body's not getting any additional benefit from going over that serving size for some people we actually see that once they get past this sort of sweet spot there they're sort of losing some of the benefit and what that tells us is hey you need to back off on that serving size a little bit and go back to that sweet spot yeah and we we see that a lot less on our full spectrum fully extracted products and we see that effect a lot more on more isolate CBD products something else that we often don't talk about and you know users and patients don't quite ask enough is are there any drug drug interactions so for consumers or patients who are on a lot of pharmaceuticals we call that public pharmaceutical you do have to consider any CBD drug interactions so CBD is metabolized by the liver along with 25% of our pharmaceutical drugs that's hundreds of drugs and so for folks who might be might be consuming laundry lists of prescription drugs I actually really advise you to talk with a health care professional about using CBD and how much you use because CBD as an inhibitor of certain enzymes in the system that metabolized all of these drugs can cause an increase of the pharmaceutical drugs that we take so I can't stress it enough if you're on a lot of prescription drugs please please please talk to a health care provider about your CV to use yeah because you might need to adjust the dosage of some of those other medications very important yeah and I'm glad you said that because in our in our clinic we see patients on tons of pharmaceutical drugs and it's not that shouldn't take CBD it's exactly like you said we have to sort of adjust the doses of those prescription drugs while we're titrating up or dropping down that CBD dose we hope this information was helpful as you start to look at CBD products and start working them into your routine if you do have more questions drop them below we are looking forward to providing more information on these topics so we'll see you again in the future", "nO7vlAP5Mc0": "hey there Jeffrey here Sephora beauty director and Myesha also beauty director and we're so excited to bring you this video because we're here to talk to you about a topic that's definitely been buzz worthy for sure mm-hmm for sure so CBD is something that you have definitely heard about it's used in many different ways but we're here to talk about six very new very exciting products that we have at Sephora that offer this really great ingredient now we've talked about hemp derived products in the past but it's really important to know that this is the first video that we're actually going to be talking about products that actually contain CBD in them and this is full-spectrum CBD so you get maximum benefit and higher quality of the ingredient so you can rest assured that whichever CBD product that you choose because we have many different formulas and we've picked our favorite for sure that you're gonna get the best most soothing calming ingredients mm-hmm now at Sephora we've definitely put together this is kind of our stance on what CBD actually means and basically this is our curated assortment so when you're watching this video keep that in mind hmm so our first product that we have is something that our boss actually really loves is the first time I heard it was from her showed us a Blakely hi so this is the Lord Jones high CBD formula body lotion it's very very potent and it's very targeted so I would suggest putting your normal moisturizer on I love a good josie maran body butter after the shower that works really well for me and then put it on the areas where you feel like you need that targeted sort of soothing calming this also has shea butter in it so it's gonna go on really nicely it's gonna penetrate really deeply and also has a sort of minty feeling to it as well so it kind of helps with the feeling of just kind of like relaxing the skin so body lotion she's deceivingly small but she packs a punch for sure and remember targeted yes great for after a long day you know especially those of us that work on our feet all day and want to just a nice way to relax of my body like scrubbing and lotions and things like that but this is really going to amp it up for sure definitely take it to the next level first up for facial skincare we have from flora and bath this is a new skincare brand to Sephora this is their age adapting CBD serum now this is a beautiful product and I have to say a gorgeous texture I'm obsessed already this sort of very moisturizing like almost like a dry oil texture a wood additional oil because it's not heavy it dissipates in the skin very quickly exact like a truth serum yeah and a long time ago I would say that oil 's were definitely kind of nature's first serum anyway yeah so even though it feels like an oil it definitely has that that serum effect on the skin it's gonna dissipate really quickly and you'll be able to apply other products right on top of me say if your oily probably like I Oh probably just uses by itself but I could totally or something else on top so one of the key benefits of using this product is it's really gonna help to reduce the appearance of redness it helps to clear blemishes so it's really easy to apply you're gonna want to use five to ten drops and you can use this morning and night okay and it's really important for you again to warm it up in the hands and then press it with your fingertips along the face right just softly where you just along the high plains really working it yeah yeah and it's nice like if you want to maybe touch up your makeup cuz they're just going over you have a very very light complexion on it it looks really nice it's more satiny it doesn't look Whaley it's not breaking up anything No so our next one like I said is more of a traditional sort of oil feeling which is really nice this is the herbivore emerald CBD 100 milligram deep moisture glow oil I would say if you hear the words deep moisture it's still for all skin types it's very very lightweight I feel like it's maybe just like slightly more moisturizing than the last one we talked about with a very lightweight serum oil texture it's really really nice just to kind of put on under your makeup over your makeup it's just a really beautiful texture with a nice scent mm-hmm and I love the color I think it's just gonna look a beautiful thing on anybody's fan wait I do my products according to like what looks cute yeah I do hear that Brad you better make it look me over the weekend or company I'm late so definitely really beautiful to have on your vanity it has a nice calming like very light scent it's Jeffrey was saying kind of grounding and I love the way that it smells yeah so if you're maybe an incense person at night or you know you spritz a little perfume or something on this will kind of help you and it won't be overly distracting at all of a scent either so next up we have another powerhouse product and this one's infused with 20 different botanicals which is amazing this is from Saint Jane and this is the luxury beauty serum now this is another kind of lightweight serum oil and another one where we can talk about the packaging for like three years like this is so beautiful DUP now this one's a beautiful kind of golden color so you know that it's gonna be really great for boosting glow and giving that really nice radiance to the skin which we really really like so and this one's also gonna be really great for some age-defy in there because again like what we talked about there's a lot of antioxidant potential behind CBD so having it infused in the product is really going to help to protect your skin from environmental aggressors and stress throughout the day it has a really nice sort of I don't want to say minty but like what is that scent it's really nice it almost wakes you up I think this would be something really nice to wear in the morning or maybe on those days where you just like have had it you just want something to sort of perk you up a little bit but it's really really nice whatever blend is in there with a twenty different botanicals is really working mm-hmm you got the purest of the pure air which is great so our next one is something that's definitely a favorite of mine I'm not he was quite a bit of josie maran products and when I received this in the mail a few weeks ago I literally at my little mail opening station opened it and put it all over me so excited to use this so this is the Josie Maran skin dope argan oil plus 100 milligrams of CBD so argan oil is probably the most popular oil we have it's important has been for a long time like everybody kind of has tried it in one way or another so same benefits as her original argan oil with the omegas and the argan oil kind of giving you that like nice lipid layer it's very very important it comes in many different varieties but this has the CBD added into it so maybe if you're using that but maybe you're using maybe in anti redness serum or something to calm your skin as well and maybe you want to kind of want to use something that's multi-purpose this would be a really great transition for you and I just I find as someone who's very oily I can actually wear this during the day which I only usually wear oils at night and I was just like all for it as soon as I literally laid eyes on it yeah huge man I've been using it with the Jade roller I really yeah I enjoy it you need an automatic Jade roller that you just stick your face and that'd be cool it's a last step I have a product that I'm super excited to try this is from pharmacy and it's called better days ahead now this is gonna be a restorative kind of cushy cream now this texture is ultra addictive because it's ultra lightweight but gives you a deep hydration without a like greasy residue yes yeah it's really great for makeup prep I could see it used before oil would be really nice now this is gonna be infused with CBD as well but then you've also got an adaptogen blend of reishi mushroom you've got purple ginseng in there which are really gonna help to calm environmental stress but I like about it too if maybe you don't want to go the oil route I felt like this was a pretty good assortment of different kinds of weights of moisture too so this is something that you could use if you just like all for it or live in a very dry climate you could layer one of the oils we talked about on top of this one and you'd like to but it's very like cushiony clouds yeah nice like so so nice okay so that's pretty much it hopefully that was a healthy introduction into CBD as an ingredient for you for sure I feel like really experiencing the parts in person is really gonna solidify what you like and what you need to get I find that the consistency really sells me on you know if I'm looking for something for nighttime or daytime and the reason why we said soothing and calming quite a bit is because it's really gonna do something different for everybody so experiencing it is really the only way to know for sure which one you're gonna fall in love with for sure and we know that you're gonna have a lot of questions on this video so definitely be know that we're gonna be active in the comments section below both us and Sephora will be answering your questions for quite some time so

check and let me guys", "pG34NT3bw60": "what's up guys it's your girl a Paris here and as you can see by the title down below I'm gonna be telling you what cannabis oil has done to my dry brittle disgustingly cracky skin especially with Canadian weather we get like minus 13 degrees up in here it's super super cold and my dry skin is dry in the summer winter fall spring all season long but wintertime my skin is crazy crazy dry so I always look for new products that can help me add moisture back into my skin during these dry winter months so I've been using cannabis oil aka weed oil aka marijuana oil spread past two weeks now and I just want you guys I want to tell you guys all the dramatic changes that I've seen with my skin and before I even continue I am NOT sponsored by this brand I'm not getting paid to do this video this is all like I bought this product with my money nobody said this to me for free this is for real my dead ass feelings about cannabis oil and the benefits that it does for my super dry skin okay like anyone watching this if you think of dry skin you really don't you don't mean my dry skin is redonkulous okay my face be ashy for no reason and no warning no heads-up no nothing it's just dry it's dry and if your returning viewer of my beauty channel Slade parents this one right here you guys know that I rant and raved about how much I love this right here this is the Tony moly hundred hour cream and this stuff is amazing for my skin like I have no complaints about it but I feel like it works best when I'm going to bed because then when I wake up my skin still hasn't wish'd you're in it because it is a hundred hour cream so it's moisturizing my skin for a literally a hundred hours it feels like so I'm not knocking this whatsoever I just personally in my skin regimen I like to use this before I go to sleep and when I wake up sometimes if I forget to put it on before I go to bed now I love this stuff but it's a cream and I am NOT hugest is hugest a word I don't know I'm not a huge fan of face creams I tried this one out because well I bought it because it said maschino and it's like really cute packaging but I bought this one because I wanted it to like just sit on my vanity look cuter whatever and then one day I was like let me just try it and they loved it but normally I use face oils for everything because my skin is super dry and oil absorbs better into my skin rather than creams although like I said before this cream is amazing but I'm the type of girl that I like to try new things I get bored of products really easily I like to try new methods of things like if I have a cream I want to try the oil if I boil or try and miss like that's just who I am I like to mix things around until I find like something that I'm completely in love with and I want to repurchase for the rest of my life and I think I may have found it in this cannabis oil once again not sponsored I went to Sephora and I was looking through a bunch of cannabis oils that I thought would match my skin and this is the one that I just liked the most like the description of it was very appealing to my skin type because my skin type maybe even dry my skin type is action you know I mean and I said it adds moisture to your skin it has omega-3 fatty acids in it actually omega-3 six and nine fatty acids in it it's organic there's just a lot of beneficial ingredients in this product that made me feel like this is the one that I want to try rather than because there are a lot of other cannabis oils out there that do the same thing but this one just appeal to me a little bit more so I decided to pick this one up for around 48 to 60 dollars something like that and it is the before emerald cannabis sativa have deep moisture glow oil and as you guys can see I'm glowing it's not to believe that I have super dry skin I'm glowing hey so even though it's cannabis oil it's actually made from the hemp of cannabis which does not give you like a THC like you're not gonna get hot you ain't gonna put this on your face and be high as a kite you ain't gonna feel no type of psychedelic effect this is purely the beneficial ingredients for your skin from cannabis that is in this bottle here it's in a beautiful green color as you can see here have to do this because anyone who uses face oils often knows that this is important because if I do this and it's not moving as fast as this is and it's going a little bit slow and muggy that means that it's gonna take forever to absorb in your skin you know what I'm saying it's like a thick consistency you don't like it that's well me anyways firstly I don't like thick consistencies when it comes to well it has to move like water when it moves like water you just know that it's gonna absorb to your skin really quickly so it comes with this dropper applicator and let me just show you really quickly gonna do three drops I want to show you guys how quickly this absorbs into your skin first of all look at it drip look at that it's like water again my face oil lovers understand why I have to show that but if I rub it in for you guys you're gonna see how quickly it absorbs into my skin look at that quick and it's not sticky at all there's no type of stickiness whatsoever it's literally fast absorbing and leaves your skin looking like silk let's do a comparison of this dry ass hand and the ones that I just put the whale on oiled hand regular hand do you guys see that now you know camera trick guys realized look at that crazy and I know a lot of people are curious about the smell it doesn't smell like weed it smells very um fresh it's very smells like lavender almost like it's a very fresh floral scent and the instructions actually tells you to breathe heavily in to help you relax and I truly believe that when I put this oil on and I breathe in I feel like a very relaxing feeling throughout my body not like I'm high but like I'm at a spa and I'm breathing in incense or something it's just a very relaxing calming feeling it's really really nice it feels luxurious and for the money and the way it makes my skin look it's worth it's worth every penny so after using this oil for the past two weeks I have to say I will never go to another face oil ever for the rest of my life and I know I've only been using it for two weeks but within two weeks I can always tell if I like a product because normally if I try a skin product and I've never tried it before I will break out within the next 48 hours I haven't broken out my skin is gleaming it's an amazing base for your makeup before your primer I use this as my moisturizer before my primer it's amazing my skin complexion has been so much more clear and it's like every day that I use it as I wake up I see my skin getting so much more healthier and I haven't changed anything in my skin routine except for this so this is the answer this is the reason why my skin is gleaming the way it's gleaming glowing the way it's glowing look in the way it's looking you know I'm saying I just have to share it with you guys and let you guys know how amazing this product is again not sponsored so you can pick this up at Sephora or you can pick it up at the herbivore website as well I believe fun fact I wanted to bring this to New York with me but I was scared that I was gonna get in trouble cuz it said cannabis sativa on it but I don't think I would have back trouble but yeah the pros of this product is it is not sticky whatsoever it's quickly absorbed into your skin it definitely moisturizes your skin for hours on end it has a relaxing soothing scent to it that really like makes you just feel very calm it has evened out my skin tone you get a good amount of product for the amount of money that you pay and you literally look like you're glowing hello the cons about this product I honestly cannot find not even one corner whatsoever I was sitting here I was thinking I was trying to like figure out what could I possibly say because there has to be something wrong with the product nothing the scent is amazing the dropper is amazing the size is perfect like everything is great I have nothing bad to say about this product whatsoever so if you have super dry brittle skin I would definitely recommend you try out the herbivore emerald cannabis teeth I have deep moisture glow oil at your local Sephora you could always go to Sephora just in case you guys didn't know you could always go to Sephora and ask them for a sample of this they'll give it to you in a little container try it out for about three days you're gonna see a huge difference and you're definitely gonna want to buy the full bottle of this because I'm not going back to anything else anything else this stuff is absolutely amazing so in two weeks cannabis oil has definitely restored my skin's moisture made a my skin complexion way more even and has me glow into the dog okay we've kind of navalore let me know if you'd ever tried cannabis oil on your skin let me know what kind of skin type you have let me know if you've even heard of this product or even knew that you could put cannabis oil on your skin if you have dry skin everybody sure works for like combination skin as well I wouldn't recommend for oily although you do need oil for oily skin I feel like this has a little bit too much too many oils are in this they have omega fatty acids they have a whole bunch of different whales than they I feel like there's too much oil in this for someone with Whaley skin what combination you should be okay so definitely check out the spore website to see if this matches your skin type let me know in the comment section down below but make sure you find me on Saturn in Israel all that doesn't description box down below for your convenience thank you guys so much for watch this video I'll see you in the next one poodels", "giyL2gRmFTA": "hey guys I've been experimenting with CBD oil for a little over a month now to help manage my chronic pain my chronic pain is due to almost 40 years now with thoracic outlet syndrome or TOS and also I had three back surgeries including a recent two level spinal fusion lumbar spinal fusion about 19 months ago now so still kind of having problems with that now what I have found is taking the CBD oil doesn't really give me much pain relief it relaxes me but I haven't noticed much pain relief really so it really wasn't gonna even you know keep taking it wasn't gonna buy anymore but in the comments some people said well really for inflammation and stuff sometimes it takes longer maybe a couple of months you know to start really feeling you know the benefits of it so I did go back and and buy another bottle a little bit frustrated because this first bottle I bought was this cost me $38 and it's a one ounce bottle this is a twenty to one ratio CBD to THC and this bottle cost $50 and it's half the print that's like half an ounce bottle this one is 18 to 1 so they were out of this one I'm just going to get the same one because I'm used to it I kind of had the dosage down and everything but this was all they had so I decided to try that so it was a little more expensive and I'm not quite sure how much to take and all that so I'm kind of a little frustrated with the whole thing it's like nothing can ever just be simple but I guess since it's a maybe it's not it's diluted down I don't know so maybe I won't have to take it take as much I mean that's the bottle seems pretty small for fifty dollars but I guess you know I'll try it see what happens you know over you know the next month or so now I have also started smoking the medical marijuana some tea I used to do that in the afternoons I don't really like to smoke much in the morning because it makes me more Dani so what I'll do is take you know some of that a couple of droppers of that in the morning sort of been doing and then in the afternoon I'll smoke some and smoking it works better I think than that it relaxes me a lot better and it does help me kind of relax and kind of Zone in on where I'm tight and you know where I need to stretch or massage my muscles or sometimes I do vacuum cupping so sometimes I'll do some of that but I do think that smoking it is helpful especially before you know I do like mobility exercises or stretching and things like that so so far I'm not really Holland that impressed with the CBD oil but I figured I would give it another month and see if I can notice any difference now I I was pretty frustrated a couple of weeks ago I did have a yeah a pretty bad flare-up of my lower back and legs but then a compound fairly quickly maybe four or five days instead of like sometimes a month it takes to calm down I think it just wasn't as bad a flare sometimes but I started thinking well maybe the CBD oil is you know helping that I don't really know so I I figured I'd give it another month and see what I think so after I've used it another month I'm making it on video and that you guys know what I think and if you guys have any you know opinions or you know you used it and you have any suggestions let me know as well watching it [Music] I don't know laughs sounds like a hot boat kunchu song hey really happy until the sky starts driving maybe I just pain", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "3H3u7vwoszM": "hi welcome back to reveal cannabis today we're going to talk about how to make our cannabis oil which we made last week on the video link that down below we're gonna talk about how to make this into an awesome healing hopefully pain relieving salve so or a cream or a balm it's super easy to do at home and I'm going to show you how to do it right now my name is Andrea I'm a cannabis wellness coach for moms I help moms who are really struggling with just how tough life can be sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "xr9zHDOBuZg": "so I wanted to give a quick review on my experience with the CVD self I've been using it for a year in two months and I started using it because of my eczema I was getting on my hands and you know get the blisters the cracks they would bleed the blisters would pop and it caused a lot of pain so gave this bad boy a try and ever since then I have not gone back this is my go-to product to help with it and it has helped maintain it it has helped prevented it from coming back and it's worth the money especially with it being on sale today because of the twelve days of Christmas that black label hemp is doing and not only about a couple weeks ago my face got really really dry and it was starting to get really flaky around my mouth and my chin and I was really hesitant to put this stuff on my face just because I already have sensitive skin so I didn't know if it was going to break out my face again or or make it worse or make my skin more oily however I was totally totally totally impressed by what it did for me not only did it help with my breakout that I had going on currently and it just got rid of all of this dryness in my face and this was like over one night that improved it and I was having this dry skin issue for like three or four days and I didn't even think to use this I was not thinking but totally worth it this is the 2 ounce bottle it seems really small for the price however a small amount goes a long way and more importantly I'm saying right now I'm not seeing it because I'm getting paid I'm not getting any free product I'm a real customer who has excellent experiences from using these products and I only rave about products that work and this [ __ ] works so you're hesitant understand but you won't know until you give her the truth", "aG7CRdTARLM": "hey everybody thanks for following our channel this is Catherine from French Broad cannabis we're a formulator and manufacturer of CBD and herbal products in Brevard North Carolina today I want to talk to you about something that I am really passionate about and that is CBD selves I use selves every day I would say that they are my favorite CBD product I like them because they work where you put them so whether you just worked out or maybe you're just sore or just anytime you've got something that's targeted maybe like you know just one area that's something you can point to you and touch there's a lot of different kinds of selves on the market I really like some ones that have hello but oil in them the reason for that is that jojoba oil really mimics the skin and the oils in the skin so it passes the skin barrier very well which means that it's a great carrier oil for selves and for CBD which is oil soluble so there's a lot of different stuff on the market you can get stuff that's like hot coals like something you know that kind of cools your skin and then there's ones that are for sensitive skin those are the ones that I like the most there's ones that are just kind of regular selves that hit a larger market maybe if if you don't like hot cold or have sensitive skin you can just go with it selves that you just want to make sure that it doesn't contain any month all if you don't like that hot cold feeling but there's not a lot of research out there to prove or have any real understanding of efficacy of selves that being said the empirical data and the data from folks actually using it like subjective data is huge the selves are one of the best sellers here they're the best sellers and a lot of shops that I and the reason for that is that they work really quickly they're often also combined with other ingredients like arnica oil or camphor and these sorts of things that are also used in herbalism for the same type of stuff that you use a CBD or cannabis cell for so this only creates a more complex and efficacious product so just make sure that when you're using salves you find something that's been tested and you want to find something that's batch traced so something that's got some sort of batch number on the bottom a good company will have a website that you can go to that has full testing panels on their selves so you'll see that it's got heavy metals testing pesticide testing microbial testing that sort of thing microbial testing is very important in salves because a Staphylococcus or ecoli contamination equal I can happen in cannabis and then as far as Staphylococcus you can introduce that during the formulation stage let's say somebody has a cut on their hand or something like that that's the way that Staphylococcus would get into a finished product and it does stick around so if there is contamination with Staphylococcus it's going to stay in the product so you want to make sure that it's been tested for micro because if you put something that's contaminated on an open area or even an area that you know gets caught later or has a little bit of a you know rash enos to it you could infect your your body through a contaminated product you also want to make sure that it has no pesticides or metals that are above the limit set by the EPA and the Food and Safety Administration's that we have so you aren't putting harmful chemicals on your skin like I said something like I solve especially something that's got jojoba oil as a carrier is going to absorb through your skin so just think about your skin as a big organ and you'll be pulling whatever is in the south into your skin you also want to make sure that they're testing for potency and all of this should be batch traceable so you want to make sure that whatever you're getting is what it says it is and has the documentation to prove it because it's very important what selves I'm just going to give you a little peek of what selves look like this is one of the sobs that we make when you put it on you don't need a lot so it's a you know I'm gonna put on just this much here onto my arm when you apply yourself you're gonna want to kind of gently massage the area to rub it in and also to make sure that you're getting good coverage and that you're not um like leaving any chunks on the skin and then also it'll spread further so that amount just spread from here all the way to here so kind of everywhere that you can see this pink flower and blue on my arm um so you want to make sure that it's kind of a thin layer and then I just like to do like a little bit extra you know massaging the area just to make sure that I'm getting good absorption not everyone likes to do this but I like to kind of try to rest the area after I apply itself that way I can make sure that it's getting some good absorption time rather than you know going out and going for a run right afterwards so I like to apply myself in a time that I'm gonna you know have a little bit of rest maybe like a five-minute sit maybe a lunch break or something like that um salves are really convenient because you can just toss a little salt in your purse that's what I do I've also got a bigger jar you know we have bigger jars and often other companies will have bigger jars as well that you can keep by the bed or something like that at home and it's a lot cheaper to have a bigger jar and a smaller jar that you're pulling from the bigger jar into the smaller jar so I like to get one of each to start and then pull from the bigger jar that way I've got like a little container to put in my purse or maybe you have a little contain from you know a sample of some sort but the bigger jars are always gonna have better price points per milligram and per gram of material so using that to your advantage while still being able hot some thing that's cute and convenient to take with you throughout the day can be really good about storage of sobs you want to be careful how you store yourselves when it's too cold you're not gonna have too much of an issue but when it's too hot you're gonna have a big issue you'll start to get melting you might get onto solution where your cells are so separate from itself so you just want to be careful to store yourselves in a location that isn't gonna have big temperature variation and you want to make sure that the solve you're using stays solid at room temperature there's a lot of solves out on the market that aren't solid at room temperature they're almost kind of like creamy I don't like those selves because when I carry them in my purse if there is a natural temperature variation like throughout the day which there always is in my life because I'm in and out and and you know active so those can melt in my purse and create a big mess or mountain in my car or whatever whenever I am going from place to place and leave my purse in my car or something so you just want to be careful about the selves that you've got when you go into a CBD short shop which I believe is the best place to always buy your CBD you want to ask to try it out and they should have like an open sample of the selves that they're selling so that you can see how it applies and and get to know it make sure it doesn't burn your skin I've had plenty of self starts to irritate my skin so you just kind of want to try it out talk to them for a little while you know dilly-dally in the store and just see how it feels you know give it a couple minutes before you purchase that way you're getting to know your product if you're buying online you know that's the best way that you have available to you that's fine I would just start with a smaller amount to make sure that that solves going to work for you before buying a bigger bottle and then purchase the bigger bottle once you know all is good for you because there are a lot of stuff out there is a lot of products out on the market I would also say stay away from anything that's got chemicals in it if you can't pronounce or know the word that's on the ingredient list chances are it's unnatural and that there aren't there isn't a reason for it in your product so you can make a really good CVD solve with no chemicals at all with only natural ingredients so chemicals um companies that are using chemicals and ourselves are putting unnecessary ingredients and a lot of them are purchasing a base like a lotion base or south base from a company and then using that by adding just CBD in it I don't suggest going with those companies first of all that's not like an artisan brand there's not a lot of love in that and secondly there's just no reason for those chemicals so you're you know you're putting things on your skin that you really don't need to be and a natural product in my opinion is always gonna be better for me and just aligns with my morals better and and in with who I support and and what industries I support so if you've got any questions about selves you want to choose a solve you don't know what the best one is or maybe you don't know if a solve is right for you just go ahead and reach out to us we're happy to talk to you about that and you know maybe it's just worth a try like I said if you can point to an issue on your body and say you know that's the problem right here then a solve is probably good for that it's really worth a try people find that anything that's a targeted issue responds really well to a sell when you're using solves you're going to have to reapply it throughout the day it's not going to work as long as like a capsule or something like that um so you are gonna want to have it with you maybe apply like every two hours or something that's what I normally find but for me some days I don't need it at all in some days I need it five times a day on average I used to solve about three times a day one time you know maybe around 11:00 one time around 2:00 and then one time around 5:00 or at that time so to help me sleep and I really liked it for this area the the neck and shoulders just because that area tends to just give me trouble so I like to put it kind of on my back but you can get somebody to help you apply it or just put it wherever you think fit make sure that you're only using salves on external surfaces and don't put it on open areas like cuts or wounds all right give us a reach out to us give us a follow and let me know if you have any questions about selves we've got a great team on board that can answer your questions and is passionate about product and they're happy to answer any questions you have all right see you soon", "kptr6yrH37E": "hi friends I'm Whitney welcome back to another episode of the sitch today we're talking about CBD who knew that's something I thought I had the left behind in my wild college days would become so popular in the health and fitness world Oh what it's not the same thing as never mind cv d stands for cannabidiol which is one of the two major compounds found in the marijuana plant unlike THC though CBD doesn't produce a euphoric high and it was legalized as a supplement in 2018 under the farm bill however CBD regulation is a little murky and foods and beverages containing CBD are still technically illegal in some states CBD belongs to a class of compounds known as cannabinoids there are a hundred and twenty of them and they exist in many plants not just cannabis this non-intoxicating compound has become majorly popular in the past year or so and it can be found in everything from sunscreen to cocktails to coffee I took like ten shots of espresso today but I'm totally joking service DVD in it some of the more outstanding CBD claims include that it can help fix leaky gut syndrome can be used to treat multiple cirrhosis and can cure cancer as there are no human studies supporting those assertions we're gonna move right along to the more plausible and clinically tested claims about CBD as always remember I stick to clinical research that means it was performed on humans animal studies don't rise to the level of evidence-based practice first off there's solid research supporting the use of CBD for at least one condition intractable epilepsy a condition where drugs are ineffective one study showed a 42% reduction in seizure frequency and children and adults taking twenty milligrams of CBD per kilogram of body weight per day for 28 days in fact CBD is the key ingredient in the only cannabis based drug approved by the FDA at the dialects many studies have also looked at the effects of CBD on neurocognitive disorders such as anxiety and depression in one small study on adults with social anxiety disorder a single 600 milligram dose of CBD reduced anxiety and cognitive impairment on a simulated public speaking test in another study a single 300 milligram dose of CBD also reduce symptoms of anxiety during public speaking but not a 100 or 900 milligram dose suggesting that too much or too little effect CBDs efficacy against anxiety several studies have also shown that CBD may possess antipsychotic properties in one study CBD was as effective at reducing psychotic symptoms as the most commonly prescribed drug used to treat schizophrenia another common claim about CBD is that it has the ability to reduce pain whether due to diseases like cancer and arthritis or under normal conditions like post exercise muscle soreness unfortunately according to a recent review of eleven systematic reviews and observational studies there's insufficient evidence to suggest that CBD is effective at reducing pain related to cancer or GI and rheumatic conditions and only limited evidence to suggest efficacy for neuropathic pain studies have shown that while cannabinoids may increase one's pain threshold they don't decrease pain intensity another understandably believable claim that I've heard about CBD is that it can help improve sleep now I have a lot of trouble sleeping so I wish this were true but unfortunately research doesn't entirely support this claim some studies show that CBD has a mildly stimulating effect other research indicates that the dose determines the effect and suggests that while low-dose CBD promotes arousal high dose CBD may increase total sleep time and decrease the number of nighttime wake up's more research in this area is clearly needed so now let's talk about safety a World Health Organization report found that CBD is safe and non addictive up to 1500 milligrams per day has been shown to be well tolerated but it's not without potential side effects some studies have noted nausea vomiting dry mouth decreased appetite and diarrhea and CBD users drug interactions may also be concerned as CBD can behave like grapefruit and may increase the amount of certain drugs in the bloodstream talk to your doctor if you're taking any medications before trying CBD I found like an infomercial now don't I finally because CBD is an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you're getting one study showed that out of 84 CBD supplements 68 percent contained a different amount of CBD than was listed on the label and 21 percent contained detectable levels of THC the psychoactive component marijuana's now this is especially important to consider for athletes as THC is a prohibited substance and consuming it violates anti-doping rules CBD has not been tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women or children and therefore should not be used by these groups and that's this edge what do you think about CBD have you tried it would you try it now after learning more about it let me know your thoughts in the comments below and if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel for more evidence-based nutrition information and healthy plant-based recipes I'm Whitney thanks so much for watching", "waCbh8qv8tw": "hey Jimmy here with holistic magnified doing a quick product comparison with our salvation 33 that's a thousand milligrams south this one is a full spectrum this one is only CBD so cannabidiol full spectrum there's over a hundred different cannabinoids in the hemp plant and the marijuana plant we obviously get our self from the hemp plant so we have all those cannabinoids in here that does include the legal trace amounts of THC below 0.3% is what's federally legal so a little story about how I applied these I went ahead and put some on this one on the full-spectrum on my right knee which I had reconstruction surgery on about 20 years ago I put the isolate based on my left knee which I also had a reconstruction surgery but that was only about three years ago so reconstruction on both played about two and a half hours of basketball this morning both of these are infused with the same organic essential oils um organic beeswax as well and they are both the same price sixty five bucks so we're just we're not looking at it from any other comparison except full-spectrum versus isolate after I put them on I would say about 15 minutes afterwards both knees felt really really good no swelling inside I had full range of motion it's now been about an hour my left knee still feels really good which I used the isolate based on but my patella tendon starting to get a little bit a little bit stiff um the the swelling inside my knee is not there but as I said patella tendon is getting a little bit tight my right knee feels phenomenal so that's basically my personal use today

things that you should know before you start giving CBD to your dog or cat [Music] hello welcome back to my channel if you're new welcome I'm having an upcoming webinar called what you need to know about CBD for dogs and cats you can click the link in the box below for more information the CBD II it stands for cannabidiol it is the largest component of the hemp plant and it's the non psychoactive component before you start giving this to your pooch or your kitty cat there's a number of things you should be aware of first you know what's the source do you really know where those plants have come from you know is it a company that had actually growing their own plants are they just you know outsourcing it getting it from the cheapest available seller they may say it's organic but how do you really know so what you want to look for is verified third-party testing and that they're using a thing called green extraction methods you want to make sure that the using co2 to break down you know there's green plant leafy material to then extract that essential oil companies are they're cutting corners will you'd solvent such as acetone and residues of those solvents can then still be in the CBD oil and they themselves can be carcinogenic summer even neurotoxins the point one his third-party testing [Music] a second if you're going to be giving CBD oil to your dog your cat you want to make sure that's a whole plant extract think about it like taking vitamin C and is it more nutritious take a vitamin C tablet or eat an orange clearly is eating the orange of which I will proceed to do now maybe kill the orange summer break there are no native crazy combos this is based on a principle called the entourage effect you've got over a hundred and different separate ingredients within the canvas plant and those can all interact with each other in a very positive way going so much further in terms of promoting health and wellness that in your dog or cat versus the Dyke just singly isolating a single part a single compound and expecting that to do the same thing so if you're not clear just think orange better versus tablet not so good accurate dosing and this is one of my pet peeves I've actually treated a number of animals with cannabidiol also with THC but anytime I'm using one of these liquid tinctures it has been so difficult to get an accurate dose so you want to look for companies which are using like a medical grade tincture bottle where one drop can be carefully measured and is accurate so as you can see here with this think to your bottle my actually CBD tincture bottle one drop is one drop and you can clearly give the exact amount [Music] for what is the carrier oil so what that means is CBD comes are very concentrated from the hemp plant and a thing called the carrier oil is then added in to help with dilution also help to preserve it and make it easier for you to dose it adequately to your dog or cat most people are using this mzt oil there's a couple problems with that first of all many animals as with many people can get stomach upset from MCT oil last thing you want to have is be dosing your dog or can they're having vomiting vomiting and/or diarrhea secondly you're also asking the body to them metabolize it completely different oil from a completely different plant so if you're gonna have the you know the best benefit from using CBD cannabidiol you want it to also come from the hemp plant so in my opinion the ideal carrier oil this is hemp seed oil v can there be any drug interactions it's a great question most the sites you're gonna read on the internet safe on there's zero interaction but that being said cannabidiol is metabolized in the liver by an enzyme called cytochrome p450 and many of the veterinary drugs that your dog or cat may be on are also metabolized by that same enzyme but fortunately most dogs and cats that are on CBD they're on a low enough dose that there should not be any significant interactions so if you're dosing your dog or cat this suggests the dose of about one milligram per 10 pounds of body weight in all likelihood there won't be any significant interactions but there can be so always talk to your veterinarian before you're gonna start on CBD so if your dog or cat is in on any other veterinary medications two most common veterinary drugs that use the same enzyme the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs metagame REM Adele etc along at the corticosteroids you know such as prednisone so if your pet is on either one of those meds and there's other ones just like heart medications etc you can discuss this with your veterinarian what's the best way to be giving CBD cannabidiol to your dogs or cats it edibles you know you just squirt it into the mouth we're on a bitter there food just encourage them to eat it a CBD in an oil form is best absorbed just on your pets comes or just underneath the tongue because ideally what we want to do is bypass the stomach get higher blood levels also make it easy to give to your dog or cat you guys how easy it is to give tutuila her dose is actually one drop twice a day so she's on it support one drop is two point four milligrams I'm gonna put it on my finger and I'm just gonna rub it on your gums good girl cuz then you're gonna absorb more of that and it's gonna get into your bloodstream quicker making you feel a little bit better there okay - laughs you love the hemp seed oil you over the CBD oil you feel like their little Rastafarians nelson dog don't you good girl yes [Music] point number seven does it allow for topical absorption Murray here's a great example many cats are really difficult to get anything into their mouths or orally especially in an ongoing basis there's some research showing that CBD to be beneficial for animals with diabetes Marv he's been getting a drop a day so not only can I just put it orally put a drop of my finger and I can put this Murray you stick around and get a cap and a drop in here either I'll show him how easy it is just to put it in transdermally okay and because this CBD is decarboxylated there Murray I didn't have to put anything into your mouth well thank you guys so much for watching this edition of venery secrets I really encourage you to sign up for my upcoming webinar and cvd for dogs and cats you've yet to do so you can click that link in the box below", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "3Uar2y6wNL0": "hi guys pepper Pam I am going to be making my warming ginger cayenne salve today we're gonna use the ginger root and use cayenne pepper turmeric I'm using coconut oil as my carrier oil my own beeswax that I cleaned and filtered myself so and I'm going to

of cayenne one tablespoon of ginger root powder one tablespoon of turmeric and then you're gonna put this over a double boiler and you're gonna let it go for about a half hour 30 minutes to 40 minutes about a half hour or so okay so I have everything in the pan I'm gonna put it over the double boiler um you can let this go up to an hour the lower and the slower it brings out more of the wonderful medicinals in the spices so I'm gonna let this sit here and i'ma let it melt and we'll be back okay so this has been going about 45 minutes see that that's the part you're gonna want to get out in the cheesecloth I don't have a cheesecloth but what I do use is a white cotton flour sack you put this down put some clips on here to hold it [Music] then you're gonna rinse this pan out because this is the pan you're gonna now put it up on the stove and you're going to put the beeswax in it [Music] okay so let's see here so this is this is dripping pretty well so I'm gonna just squeeze this out carefully sorry about that sorry sorry sorry ok so I got it all out sorry about the camera falling over so all the spices are inside this now you also can make a second batch with these same spices if you want to set that over there how clear that is now so now I'm going to be adding actually I didn't need to clean that pan out I used another one oh I wasn't thinking okay so this is gonna go on the stove in the double boiler and add the quarter cup of beeswax now you don't have to add the beeswax you can just keep this in a jar and decide what you want to do with it later it's alright it's fine you know you know you're just adding the beeswax to make your bone your hands okay so after you cut it all out you just put that you don't have to put the beeswax in if you don't want to just keep it as massage oil if you want to if it works very good as a on the spot treatment and you can even put it in a roll-on so then in the double boiler they're going to put the beeswax and the infused oil and you're gonna let it melt and you can even add essential oils to it but then after it melts then you're going to be putting it in your jars your right back okay so I wanted to show you what the spices look like I guess I did squeeze all the water out see how powdery it is that's what you're gonna straight yeah wring out of the cheesecloth or your rag or whatever you use okay all the beasts wax is melted I [Music] brought an extra jar out just in case now this doesn't have to be at the you can fill it to the top or pay close to the top if you want perfect okay that's it so this is my ginger cayenne salve you use this when you have aches and pains let me tell you the recipe again really quick actually let me show it to you well you can't see that I'll hold it up here that's all you need right there you first have to make the infusion and that's the part where I use the coconut oil and I did the double boiler method so if you didn't get all this I'm going to also put it in the comment section of the video so all you do I don't need that now we just let it cool it's kind of hardened you'll just be able to dig it out and rub it on your hands if you if you have arthritis if you have a pulled muscle anything like that so we'll let it cool before put the lid on and we will be back when it's harden okay there it is beautiful beautiful beautiful and the reason I put them in the matching size jars I'm taking these to the fair so I'll be looking for a blue ribbon on this one so when you go to use it say you strained your knee you have a backache you have arthritis in your hands you're just gonna you know get some out and you're gonna put it on your hand just like you would your regular lotion make sure you label your jar date it and put what it is and these make awesome Christmas gifts or you know Get Well gifts anything like that people that you know in your life and have arthritis or you know aches and pains that's just perfect for them so I'm gonna put the recipe in the comment section you can also google the cayenne SAFF there's different variations of it you can also add essential oil with this I don't do that I just let the cayenne and the turmeric and the ginger do what they're supposed to do so anyway any questions put them in the comments prep em out have a cool day", "b0ii-rmlqu0": "can CBD help my chronic PPD make be skilled in CBD help the just gives my skin proper autism boost my and CBD help me finally get a good night's sleep every Wednesday this month we are investigating the 99 CBD questions you've been asking we'll be digging into the latest research and conducting our own surveys to bring you the answers that clear up your CBD confusion today we dive into one of the biggest claims that I keep hearing about can CBD help your pain investigative journalist mark Ebner Comfort was here with the results the marijuana has been prescribed for pain to the cancer lots of things actually and now CBD which is a compound of cannabis is being touted for pain as well so walk us through these claims because they're all over the place yeah there are a lot of claims that CVD is very effective in treating all kinds of pain from muscle soreness to joint pain to inflammation to all kinds of chronic pain some even take it a step further and say this can help you recover from injury faster and see meeting is described as having certain compounds that will interrupt those pain signals walk through some of these CBD products and there's a lot of opportunities here to help but these CBD products are interestingly diverse we've got ones that you ingest that start with those what's the glory so there are a wide variety of CBD products that you would take orally from tea to candy to good old-fashioned pills but there's also a wide variety of doses so it goes from as low as five milligrams to as high as thirty milligrams and this is a big gray area it's not like acetaminophen where you know exactly how much to take if you have a headache but this you are just guessing and sometimes that with the tinctures I mean they have a drop-off and your demand dramatically changing the dose there's one drop but what does that mean the whole dropper a big drop a little drop it's very confusing all right over here we've got the ones that you apply topical products yeah topical products big segment of the industry and that ranges from creams to bombs to cooling sticks they even have bath bombs that you can throw in the tub and soak in but just like with the oral products there's really a lot of variety in the doses so like the doses the prices are all over the place we have found some projects as low as $8 we found some as much as 150 bucks how can the same products range in that much of but if footballs cost 850 bucks in some cases it is very very expensive here's the thing CBD is not subject to federal regulations remember this is a supplement not a drug so the companies can really charge anything they want that can be marketing it can be hype now in some cases the price does reflect higher quality a company that's using much stricter production standards but not always well this thing's confusing me the most of them of course people want to get the lower priced item because it's more affordable yeah and they're actually often wasting their money so you wanted to test some of the products out so we had this brainstorming we decided we'll just use Mara to test it out well I have a third-party do it we got the kitty pigment right here so what kinds of aches and pains are we gonna cheat on you yeah I was happy to do it because I do have things that bother me so I have lower back pain that's been recurring for years it's from an old sports injury and my knee now has also started bothering me so with my back it's generally after I've been laying or sleeping for too long it's very tense and sometimes after certain workouts join the club I've got both of those BOCES he thought he probably does as well so where I decided to try CBD products for 3 days to see if they would help her with her pain here's her video diary I wanted to find out which CBD products would best help me with my lower back pain I decided to try three products over the course of three days a balm capsules and mouth drops day is day one and I did wake up with some soreness on my lower back which is actually pretty typical I've been laying all night and it just tends to get sore my knee is not bothering me yet that tends to get worse as the day goes on but I'm gonna get started and we'll see how cuz so it's been about an hour and I will say I was super skeptical I didn't expect it to do anything but my back really just feel better it feels really loose it just doesn't have that like tightness and that pain that it had when I woke up it's day two and today I'm trying the capsules I actually do have quite a bit of back pain today because of a workout I did yesterday so it says take one to two capsules twice a day so it's been a few hours since I took the capsules and I'm really glad that it is a weekend because I am definitely feeling a little bit loopy a little bit lightheaded just it feels like I've just had a glass of wine or two classes so I'm getting ready to go to sleep and I'm definitely still feeling a little bit out of it but I just realized I haven't thought about my pain all night state three and today I am trying the drops so these are water soluble and I'm gonna put into my shape this morning as I'm getting ready to mix this I'm realizing the dosing is a little bit of an issue the bottle says use three drops but that's not very scientific the other thing is does not smell good to see how it tastes it tastes like my normal shape so that's a good thing so it's been a few hours since I had my shake and I don't feel anything up next what Maura things worked and what didn't we're gonna explore the latest science about CBD and pain relief [Music] be sure you subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "yNjvAdbrOFA": "I'm not alert and I'd like to find out if CVD all is going to work for me [Music] anxiety sometime a month to feel a little by now so it's something I'd like to see the back off there's a cannabis extract that's now so popular that you can buy it in just about everything from oils and vape liquids to shampoo and makeup to drinks and even chocolate its classed as a supplement and is being sold in shops and online it's called CBD and at high doses a regulator type is being used in medical studies and it's getting some positive results it's everywhere but there's just so much conflict in advice as well and this song which to choose from two months ago I haven't taken any yet I'm not sure of but I'm not sure how they'll interact okay now some are I mean I've since been diagnosed with other things I've tried a number of prescription drugs mainly antidepressants nothing or pulling me through so you get to a point where you'll just try anything especially when it's been advertised as something more natural I've looked at a couple of sellers website I'll try five milligrams but also a percentage strength I'm just not really sure what all different colors mean I guess the fundamental questions that I want to know over the next couple of days is will it work for me will it work for others how will it work what dosage should I return should all those be taken hi I'm Nathalie thanks for showing us around hi [Music] so we go never look a crop that I planted ten days ago yeah that's good yeah I'm just curious to find out what you grow here and how it works from your side well we grow hemp and flax for fiber we've got a whole processing plant so we can sell clean fiber 4 goes into mattresses and loft insulation by the beginning of August hopefully this will be 10 feet tall travelers people are interested what's the difference between this and marijuana well hemp and marijuana of both cannabis plants yeah but you've got different varieties that produce different cannabinoids how illegal is this and when does it get to the point where it becomes illegal we are perfectly legal because we're licensed by the Home Office to produce hemp strong we're not allowed to harvest the leaf and flower so we have to leave the leaf and flower in the field what do you do with the leaf flower do just leave it there for rest ok so the bit we're throwing away is the part of the plant that the CBD has been extracted from it frustrates me somewhat that the OL CBD producing companies in the UK are allowed to bring leaf and flower in from abroad but we can't produce it if the leaves and flowers go to West well of are they CBD UK are y'all coming from all the UK produced products it's a the core information Europe Oh America ok didn't realize that I'm much of loss people don't most people do when people hear cannabis they usually think getting high and although CBD is cannabis it doesn't get you high and it's legal and that's because cannabis is actually the name of a group of plants and both marijuana and hemp belong to that family cannabis plants have around 100 different chemicals in them called cannabinoids and they can have various effects on us marijuana plants have been bred to have higher levels of a psychoactive chemical known as THC whereas hemp plants have high levels of the chemicals CBD which is not psychoactive and can sometimes have pain relieving and calming effects from researching the CBD oil I just assumed I it was all made in the UK well what I've read nowhere states differently I've been learning today that the local homegrown farmers kind of amused a bit that make the CBD just a little bit of doubt and confusion once again so it's a really exciting area I think especially in psychosis because we don't really have treatments there are as effective as we'd hope and they often come along with lots of very unpleasant side effects it seems that CBD is relatively safe and well tolerated so the study that I worked on looked at people who were at risk of developing psychosis and we gave them a six hundred milligram dose of CBD or a placebo for three weeks and we found that CBD was able to normalize the dysfunction that you see in certain brain areas have got involved in psychosis I haven't tried it but I've opened it and it stinks like I bought this one offline and it's two point five milligrams of CBD per drop that that's probably not going to be very effective if you're looking at 300 milligrams or 600 milligrams I think the risk here is that we just don't have the evidence of whether it works or not the research that we know about is looking at sort of quite high doses 600 to 2,000 milligrams and we know that this could have a clinical benefit but there's the things that you can get on the high street often they have much lower levels and we just don't know basically whether they work or not I know lots of people report that this is helpful however it's difficult to know how much of that is sort of because of the drug or because of a placebo effect and often a placebo effect isn't a bad thing what would you recommend what was your advice before purchasing a product online I think it's important to speak to your doctor if you're considering it because the other thing that we don't know about CBD is the effects that it might have when you're taking another medication for example our bodies are full of receptors that react to cannabis these receptors are part of an internal system which helps control our bodily functions such as our appetite pain relief and coping with stress and anxiety it's called the endocannabinoid system or ECS and it got its name because it was people's use of cannabis that helped lead to its discovery we naturally produce these chemicals all the time and the chemicals THC and CBD from cannabis plants also affect our ECS and can have various effects on our bodies and that's why scientists are now researching potential treatments using them it looks fairly positive I might help man it might be a good impact something but I am still there looking to see what is inside a lot of thought and how much CBD is in it my vaults been open and passed around a little bit so I bought a new bottle do the testing on to make sure that it wasn't contaminated in any other way [Applause] [Music] and can this machine tell us what other chemicals and that being the CBD while CBD and THC are the main ones it also looks for other THC precursors within your product well CBD oil is legal that does depend on how much THC it varies depending on your product and no matter if you had a one meal bottle or a one liter bottle you could don't you would only be allowed one milligram of THC right now in the UK there isn't regulation or manufacturing standards specifically made for CBD supplement products but there is a law that means that the amount of THC that's a psychoactive chemical that gets you high must be less than one milligram per item and it doesn't matter how big the bottle or product is it can still only have one milligram of THC in the whole thing there's strict regulation around the type of CBD that's being used in medical studies that you can't buy online or in shops and there will probably be more official guidance and even laws around low-dose products like CBD oil very soon so of all CBD products in the UK tested and regulated in the same way that we're doing now so in theory yes for every product released in the UK they would need to comply to labeling standards they have the correct amount of CBD that they're advertising within their product if you've ever want to check a supplier should be able to provide you with a certificate that says we've had it tested for this match this is what's in it we ran a series of tests on the product and identified that the THC content within the product was just over four times the legal limit so the legal limit is one milligram per container and we identified just over four milligrams in this in this product four milligrams of THC isn't gonna do anything notable to a person you'd have to have a considerable amount of THC in there for there to be a psychoactive response we found that the CBD content was was pretty much spot-on to what they'd claimed on the product when you extract CBD from the hemp plant you end up with THC as a by-product so it could be the extraction process wasn't cetera as it should have been at separating the cannabinoids properly it could also be a pure misunderstanding of the law the problem is and if you know how to interpret it it's just a page with a load of numbers on it so I think the there needs to be a simpler way of explaining this to to the consumer that doesn't rely on complicated reports on this I would say to Natalie don't worry you know that the THC content in there is very very low don't fear CBD products as a result of this experience and as the industry grows and becomes more mature brands will be explaining better to consumers about their products and making sure that those products comply with all regulations [Music] [Music] [Music] all I have learnt so far I don't think I meditate CBD oil just until a few more studies and tests of being completed I've never seen no attacking it especially because it's becoming more prominent in the media and in the research labs but I definitely keep an open mind about taking it [Music]", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "WqbAYLQiHcw": "hi I'm dr. Joe Namath I'm a periodontist in Southfield Michigan and I want to talk a little bit today about CBD or CBD oil cannabidiol CBD CBD oil can be derived from the marijuana plant or it can be derived from the hemp plant it does not have THC in it THC is the ingredient that causes one to get high so this does not have that in it so it doesn't cause you to get high but it is used for pain control and many people it can be used as a as a rub to help control pain in children it may help control seizures it may help reduce anxiety but today I want to talk about the possible role of CBD in the mouth in oral health and specifically on your gum tissue so there was a study using rats what they did was they induce gum disease or periodontal disease in these rats by using certain kinds of wires that irritate the gum tissue and these rats were given CBD actually there were two groups of rats a control group that did not receive the CBD and the experimental group that did receive the CBD now the CBD was given in the form of injection and of course when you brush your teeth you're not going to be injecting CBD they found that at the end of the trial period the rats that had been given the CBD had much less bone destruction they healed much faster and their gums were much healthier relative to the rats in the control group that did not receive the CBD so CBD by the way CBD is now a buzzword you could hear it everywhere and you're gonna hear even more about it because a lot of people think it's the holy grail well it's not the Holy Grail but it may be helpful in certain situations and maybe it's even helpful in the mouth it does tend to reduce inflammation it doesn't kill bacteria so there are some toothpaste some very strong toothpastes that have ant bacterial agents in them and those antibacterial agents kill most or all of the bacteria in the mouth even the good ones on the other hand there are now toothpastes that have CBD incorporated in the toothpaste and these do not destroy the good bacteria but they enable the good bacteria to to proliferate and continue to grow and minimize the harm of the bad bacteria also a great role for CBD is it does reduce anxiety and so it might be very helpful for patients to take some CBD CBD oil something with CBD before a dental appointment to reduce their anxiety of course in our dental office there's no anxiety because we never cause any patients any pain but basically if one has anxiety it does tend to help reduce anxiety and it's very effective for that in a future video I want to talk more about CBD and specifically I want to talk about marijuana and actually smoking marijuana because as opposed to CBD or CBD oil which could have a therapeutic role I think the jury is still out a bit on it marijuana and the smoke actually is probably and is harmful to the gum tissue because the smoke tends to dry out the gum tissue and may reduce the blood supply to the gum tissue so there's a big difference between smoking marijuana which has THC typically and CBD which doesn't so I'm going to talk more about these subjects marijuana CBD in the future but I just wanted to give you a glimpse of potentially what may be going on now and I want to remind you to keep your mouth healthy because if your mouth is healthy I guarantee your body will be healthier subscribe to our YouTube channel we'd love to hear from you and have a great day restore your smile and your health visit dr.

You've probably seen online a lot of videos,\na lot of articles about CBD oil. I want to talk a little bit about the science\nbehind that. I want to talk about the Populum here, my\nexperience with it, the benefits I felt, and some other things to consider. Let's get started. [music] Marten: I want to talk about the science behind\nCBD. First I want to say, if you want to see a\nlist of my top picks for CBD oil, Google Mattress Clarity best CBD oil. What exactly is CBD? It stands for Cannabidiol. It is a phytocannabinoid, a compound found\nin Cannabis sativa. One of the other phytocannabinoids which we're\ngoing to find in Cannabis sativa is THC. While THC is going to have some stony properties,\nit's going to give you that more of that high feeling, you're not going to get that feeling\nwith CBD taken from hemp plant. While THC is illegal in many states, CBD oil\ntaken from hemp plants is legal in all 50 states. Definitely keep that in mind. In terms of what exactly CBD can help you\nwith, while it's not going to give you that stony feeling, it can help with anxiety, nausea,\nand inflammation. Last but not least, it can help with sleep. As a person who deals with anxiety and that\nhas sleep issues, that's why I want to try out CBD oil. I want to know why you're interested in CBD\noil? Is it to help with your sleep, help with your\nanxiety, or for some other reason? Leave your answer in the comments section\nbelow. I want to see what everyone has to say. Now let's look at the Populum. Before I talk about the Populum, I do want\nto say I am not a doctor. If you're considering adding CBD to your medical\nregimen, or your sleep regimen, do talk to a medical professional. With the Populum here, you're going to have\nthree options -- 250 milligrams, 500 milligrams, and 1,000 milligrams. For the potency I went with a 500-milligram,\ntheir most popular potency. What exactly is in here? First off, you're going to have your CBD oil. This is a full-spectrum hemp oil. While some are going to be CBD isolates, some\nof those competitors are going to get only CBD oil, this is full spectrum. It's also going to have some other phytocannabinoids\nthat naturally occur in hemp plants. In here as well, you're going to have some\nphytocannabinoids such as CBG, which is also going to help with nausea and have anti-inflammatory\nproperties. In addition to that, you're going to have\nsome terpenes. Terpenes are essential oils found in the hemp\nplant, and those are going to have properties. They're going to help with the flavoring,\nalso give you some more sense of well-being. In here, you're also going to have hemp seed\noil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and cold-pressed orange oil. There's a lot in this bottle. These extra elements are going to help with\nflavoring, also going to have some amino acids, help with your metabolism and your immune\nsystem. There's a lot in here. If you want to know exactly what's in this\nmodel, don't worry. Every bottle is going to come with your lab\nresults. You're going to know exactly what is in this\nbatch of CBD oil. It's also a third-party tested. While it's not FDA approved, you know exactly\nit's in this bottle. It's tested for quality and effectiveness. How do you use the Populum? It's very, very simple. You first, unscrew the top here, and it's\ngoing to be a dropper. In terms of how much you want to fill it with,\nit does depend on how long you've used CBD oil for. If you're just getting started, Populum recommends\nusing 8 milligrams to 8.5 milligrams. This is the 500-milligram potency so it's\ngoing to be about a half a dropper. Once I have that, I put it under my tongue\nand then squirt the liquid under my tongue. I'll leave it in my mouth for 30 seconds. They also recommend you can work the liquid\non your cheeks with your tongue. After the 30 seconds, take two deep breaths. You can drink down the liquid and you're good\nto go. Let's talk about my experience with the Populum. I'm going to break that down into three sections\n-- falling asleep, staying asleep, and then the morning after. In terms of falling asleep, this worked very,\nvery well for me. I took it for a few weeks. Every night before bed when I'm watching TV,\nI would take this about 30 minutes before bed, and it definitely calmed me down. My anxiety was less and I deal with anxiety. Before bed sometimes it was hard for me to\nfall asleep. With the Populum, I definitely fell asleep\nmuch more quickly. In terms of staying asleep, I slept through\nthe night with no problem. However, that's not usually a big issue for\nme, staying asleep, so take that into account. But it did not negatively affect my sleep. The morning after, that's where I had some\nissues with the Populum. Waking up, I did feel a little bit groggy,\na little bit washy as I'm started out my day at work, out of it a little bit, having trouble\nfocusing. I will note this is my first time using CBD\noil. I lowered my dose over the next couple days. It did seem to work itself out. But keep that in mind, if you're just starting\nto use the CBD for yourself. Let's talk about some of the pros and some\nof the benefits I experienced using the Populum. First off, it made it easier to fall asleep. If you're looking for a CBD oil to help you\nfall asleep more quickly, definitely ease you down into a nice state of relaxation before\nyou sleep, take a look at the Populum. Also, if you want something to help you stay\nasleep all night, the Populum worked for me in that respect. If you want to sleep throughout the night,\nthe Populum could also work for you. I'm also a big fan the fact the Populum is\nfull spectrum. You're not just getting a CBD isolate, you're\nalso getting other phytocannabinoids. You get the full effect of the hemp plant\nwith this full-spectrum hemp oil. Lastly, speaking about the third-party testing,\nI like the fact they bring in outside scientists to come in and test this product to make sure\nyou get the best quality, the best effectiveness with the CBD oil. Let's talk about the cons. Some of the things you might want to consider\nif you're looking at the Populum. First off, I experience some morning grogginess\nthe next day. If you want someone's going to help you wake\nup clear-eyed and refreshed, the Populum might not be the best match for you. Keep this in mind. If you're looking for something with a lot\nof potency options there are only three with the Populum -- the 250, the 500, and the 1,000-milligram. Some other companies are going to have five\nor six options, so more options for you in terms of potency. Also, this CBD oil is not FDA approved. That's not necessarily a con for the Populum\nbecause most CBD oils are not FDA approved. But keep this in mind if you're going to add\nthis to your medical regimen. Lastly, in terms of price, right now it's\n$99 for a bottle for the 500 milligrams. That is very affordable for a CBD oil, but\nif you're comparing this to other sleep supplements, it might be on the pricier side. In the end, I enjoyed my experience with the\nPopulum. It helped me fall asleep more quickly, stay\nasleep, very much a nice experience overall. I will just note, if you're looking for something\nto have you waking up feeling more refreshed, you might want to look elsewhere. That's about it.

Andrews comes in and says give him some morphine and talk about instant relief it was it was awesome I went back to sleep woke up felt better got on a plane and came back to San Diego were you taking them when you were pitching the night before you were pitching I didn't want to come out of game so I would pop a couple before the game in pitch on and I did that for a long time I would take one or two depending you know the severity of the pain and you know I would pitch on them because it took the pain away and I was able to get through because let me tell you something in 2000 I went 20 games and between the percocets and the cortisone shots that I took that year to keep me on the mound you know 20 is the mecca that's the goal you get 120 games you're doing something and that's like a pitchers dream to win 20 games because normally you're in the hunt for siyoung and that's basically what I did so I started doing that and you know because it just became a part of my life taking these painkillers so when you were taking the percocets how was the feeling the sensation when you were on that drug I felt pretty damn good I mean it got me through pain free when it wears off you just blah you feel your aches and pains so that temptation is there do I take another one I'm pitching at 7:05 and it lasts till you know 10:30 11 o'clock do I need another one you know I've just done my job well after a game usually go out pop another one it wasn't a habit of doing it but I did it quite a bit through my career I'd say probably from 99 on probably 75 80 percent of the time I was on it and then recreational you know depending on we did that week or that weekend I just took the painkillers as needed and then got off of him and that was it until later on in my career 99 when I was you know I had you know just a lot of pains and you know black market stuff you can get because you can't just go to your doctor hey man give me a couple hundred percocets so you know through through friends and all that you you you know where to get them and and that's I'm like wow these are very these are awesome I started taking them as needed you know because I had I can get them touch of a dial boom how many you need I got and then that's that was it for 16 years wells had a steady regimen of vicodin percocet and toradol even continuing use of prescription painkillers after retiring from baseball in 2007 until he was introduced to something that would change his life forever well saw a 60 minute special about something called CBD oil and how it helped a four year old girl overcome chronic seizures his eyes were opened I watched it and I was just really I was like amazed how nobody wants to sell to a four-year-old you know but finally they got her on there these five brothers in Colorado and they got him on so I I called my talked to my buddy Steve I said Steve I said do you know how to get the CBD and he just let them any laughs and he goes I grow it I grow it I said no you don't he goes oh yeah I do I said well I want to try it because I'm tired of the percocets tired of the way I feel feel like crap when I take them Wells began using CBD oil on a regular basis and became such a believer in the therapeutic benefits of the product that he invested in a company called green sticks there are many misconceptions about CBD oil even among the medical community to gain clarity I sat down with dr. Alan Frankel an la-based internist who has spent much of his 37-year career studying the effects of cannabis so what are the facts about CBD one that it's probably over a hundred thousand years old as well as THC this was for sure a medicinal plant it doesn't have the it's not like an opium plant or a coca plant where people get tremendous psychoactivity the natural cannabis plant as it came before the 50s and now we're breeding all those strains back which is a huge part of my work which I love people don't get high they feel good that helps with pain it helps protect the brain the heart it was one of the most protective plants on the planet a lot of athletes get injured have surgeries all the time it's a part of the game what are your thoughts on the traditionally prescribed medicine that these guys get the opioids versus the cannabis that they're not allowed to take and what the benefits would be for an athlete first I'm not saying that opiates are always bad and never indicated in in acute situations they for pain relief they're they're effective the problem is the chronic use so chronic pain or preventing pain or dealing with preventing inflammation is more rational I would argue for CBD on a regular basis frankly for everybody in this room everybody in this building if you're a professional sports person and you're injured I mean it's your family it's money it's your career it's it's everything and once you start down the narcotic path it is never a healthy path because if you get tolerance with narcotics you do not get tolerance with CBD according to dr. Frankel CBD oil can be beneficial in many ways including treating certain cancers seizures anxiety and mood disorders lowering blood glucose and diabetics and pain relief so doctor forgive me if I sound a little crass here but it sounds like the miracle medicine it sounds perfect what's the negative side where's the abuse that can happen with something like this I think the biggest issues with abuse that people talk about all the time are the high schoolers and my personal view is I'm sure there are a very small percentage the US federal government says it's 5% of people who become addicted to cannabis I don't know how many of those people truly become addicted as far as physical addiction because that's difficult with cannabis but if you're not motivated and you're not sure what you want to do and you want to hang around cannabis makes it really easy to do it but every morning you wake up you're totally sober you're not going through withdrawal tell us about the sensation you had when he took the CBD for the first time it was amazing I said am I going to get high because I'm a coach I coach high school baseball so I don't want to go to the park high as a kite I said I need something you know because I'm on my feet all day you know or at least for four or five hours during practice he goes try this twenty minutes later after I did he goes your ID I'm like no I'm the same I said well he goes well take the other when you go home take the other part of it and see how you feel that I took it I had the best night's sleep I've had in years I don't give a crap what people say what they think of me or whatever all you know you're a drag addict I'm not a drug addict I'm living proof that CBD works I got a torn rotator cuff I've been blowing off for three and a half years because I golf every day I go fly fish and I go hunting I'm an outdoorsman and I'm able to get full range of motion by taking CBD just a few times a day Wells recently had a serious rotator cuff surgery and instead of using painkillers is in the past he only used CBD oil to manage his pain after surgery and through the entire rehabilitation process and Wells isn't the only athlete who is pushing for a change and how professional sports handle pain management how do you feel about some professional athletes currently playing today lobbying their leagues to make this legal Eugene Monroe the Baltimore Ravens wrote a letter recently saying that this should be a legal substance to help with pain tolerance and pain management for NFL players for example I'll go on the bandwagon with them because I mean I'm retired athlete I wish I knew about it back when I played because I would have been all over it and I would have took those risks if they tested me in here you got you got marijuana in your system and I'll bring it to them this is what it is dissect it go take it into a lab and see what it's about our government is not given in other countries are there testing it they're doing all this kind of stuff you know our government's not doing anything about it because you know why because they're making almost a billion dollars a year on pharmaceutical you know pills what do you think sports leagues should do with respect to cannabis I think the first thing they should do is stop testing for it I think we have way bigger problems than cannabis number two I would seriously consider putting these athletes typically the ones that have potential head traumas on CBD you don't have to use very much to protect the brain against hits I think sports and cannabis has a very wonderful future and safety I mean we can't knock our brains around and not try something so at the CBD as it's been patented for neural protection and we know it helps healing concussions and so many other disorders why in the world would we not give CBD to our professional athletes a lot of people say if you want to avoid heart disease and heart attacks take aspirin daily is this something that people should be taking on a regular basis the short answer is absolutely yes currently if you're a soldier in Israel and you have a head injury in the battlefield you get CBD on the battlefield if you have a heart attack and you go into emergency room in Jerusalem you get CBD on the way up to the floor if you have a stroke you get CBD up on the way to the floor what did that shown they is a 50% reduction either brain or heart damage I believe 10 years from now coaches and managers will be handing out CBD capsules to their players do you think that the major sports leagues in this country are going to change their drug policy to allow CBD I say no but I hope they research this and understand the value that it can be instead of you know quick fixes which are there they need to open their eyes like I said and and understand what this can do I mean I would rather see a guide take the CVD or take medical marijuana then see a guy taking a painkiller why not do something natural try something different I'm living proof right now that CBD has made a major change in my and I'm you know I'm 53 years old I just turned 53 and I don't want to take those things like I said I'm three and a half years painkiller free that's pretty good", "pMMfp7lEyB0": "CBD is taking over the wellness industry the Center for medicinal cannabis says the UK is home to six million CBD users who take it in supplements cosmetics and vape liquids and with some of the best known pharmacies and health shops stocking up UK sales alone are expected to exceed 1 billion a year by 2025 advocates claim CBD can help with a seemingly endless list of conditions from anxiety to acne but what exactly is CBD does it make you high and most importantly to the bold claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects to better understand health claims it's useful to split CBD into two categories wellness CBD and medical CBD wellness CBD products are available off the shelf in health shops and pharmacies CBD oil is one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles of CBD from health food shops and looked at what's inside them and sometimes they found that there's actually teach seeing them little or no CV some of them have alcohol in them to the level which they could be considered sort of an alcoholic beverage if companies don't adhere to these regulations by March 2021 then their products could be taken off the market the second type of CBD available is medical CBD there are a small number of approved medicines currently available on the NHS that contain much higher doses of CBD and there is some evidence to show that they may be effective at treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only doctors on the specialist registrar can prescribe these on a named patient basis with very little scientific evidence about the effects of wellness CBD and what the shorts or long-term risks are the Food Standards Agency says healthy adults should think carefully before using it and if you're pregnant breastfeeding or taking medication you shouldn't take it at all I also think that when it comes to CBD there's probably a really big placebo effect out there sort of global placebo effect because people are looking for something in their life that can really help them and they're not getting that from their general medications so then they're turning to sort of herbal medications and those having medications should be a quality standard that we all agree upon [Music]", "bgf_xhQV_ok": "get smoking marijuana or eating pot edibles you probably won't even notice the newest way people are getting high 7 News reporter Jacqueline Alan found more and more are turning to a pot patch even though the patch on his wrist may look like something familiar I think it maybe it's a nicotine patch or something Alain Tonkin isn't trying to quit smoking in fact instead of nicotine this 2x2 square is delivering THC I've been using medical marijuana for about the past 11 years ever since a skydiving accident broke his back Allen's pain reliever of choice is weed but smoking breaks at work well I really don't like smelling like marijuana around my customers and so this allows me a way to do be more discreet about being able to take my medicines this is basically where all the magic happens the magic is happening here at Mary's medicinals in Denver CEO Nicole Smith gives us a tour saying unlike smoking pot which wears off fast or edibles that can take time to kick in it's effective in about 10 to 15 minutes and it can last up to 12 hours they start with cannabis extract the oil isolate certain cannabinoids like CBD or THC spread that on sheets and you have the newest way to get high about 80% of Mary's products don't have psychoactive effects they're being used to treat everything from epilepsy to chronic pain to insomnia you know what it's something that we are continuing to strive towards the patches are not FDA approved and while mary's is funding its own clinical trials pot science is still young for people like Allen though it's been I mean it's just been a lifesaver he's been night and day the proof is in being pain-free with a simple patch the biggest side-effect he says has been sometimes having the munchies Jacqueline Allen Seven News the CEO says her company's not regulated by the FDA because they fall under the same category as companies that make vitamins or supplements and if people feel any negative effect from the patch she suggests just taking it off and claims you'll feel better in just about 15 minutes", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "wPMptF7CaPs": "welcome everyone thank you for joining us for today's webinar the efficacy of

Bertrand I will now turn the presentation over to her hello and thank you for attending my webinar on the efficacy of high CBD low THC for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana treatment programs at the end of this presentation there is a YouTube video for you to watch on CBD THC just click on the far left of your screen today's learning objectives are understanding CBD THC ratios in medical marijuana and using high CBD low THC cannabis products to treat disease processes there are at least a hundred and thirteen cannabinoids and this webinar is going to address two of them that work together to provide our bodies with synergy that's high CBD low THC strains of marijuana and how they help patients who use them CBD and THC interact with each other and by using them together patients may find that the effects of THC are lessened but prolonged there are many patients who just cannot tolerate the effects of THC while there are many others who smoke THC in order to relax another factor to consider is the way in which marijuana is consumed such as smoking tinctures edibles and topicals cannabinoids are better absorbed by the body when ingested on a full stomach CBD is intrinsically safe and there is no way to tell if you have had enough as with THC you would just be too high combining CBD and THC causes a reduction in the psychoactive effects of THC CBD will also help to lessen the sedative and appetite appetite inducing effects this is known as the entourage effect where both compounds work best when they're used together these two molecules are a perfect complement to each other in January of this year the medical value of cannabis was recognized by the world who health organization the therapeutic potentials of cannabis and cannabinoids has been acknowledged for the first time since 1954 by this group they have proposed new international scheduling moving towards efforts to increase the potential for countries to provide legal safe access for medical use of cannabis and its research the organization accepted the public's comments on the scheduling of marijuana until March 14th of this year I of course posted my thoughts on the website and implored them to seriously consider removing marijuana as a schedule 1 drug cannabidiol or CBD is a component of the anibus plant that may have enormous therapeutic potential although it doesn't make people feel high like THC CBD is causing quite a buzz among scientists health professionals and medical marijuana patients who are using CBD products to treat a wide variety of conditions including chronic pain cancer Crohn's diabetes rheumatoid arthritis PTSD cardiovascular disease anxiety and antibiotic resistant infections multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and more academic research centers around the world are currently studying effects of CBD on these and other ailments scientists refer to CBD as a promiscuous compound because it confers therapeutic benefits in many different ways while tapping into how we function physiologically and biologically on a deep level extensive preclinical research and some clinical studies have shown that CBD have strong antioxidant anti-inflammatory anticonvulsant antidepressant antipsychotic antitumoral and neuro protective qualities cannabidiol appears to change gene expression and may be helpful in removing beta amyloid plaque which is the hallmark of Alzheimer's from brain cells what is THC CBD and THC are the power couple of cannabis therapeutics they appear to work best together for example CBD is believed to boost th C's pain-killing and anti-cancer properties CBD can also lessen the side effects of too much THC including anxiety and rapid heartbeat relaxing but not intoxicating is how some people describe CBD rich cannabis products CBD and THC both appear to stimulate neurogenesis the creation of new brain cells and adult mammals which may prove helpful for stroke and Parkinson's patients products made from industrial hemp that contain little or no THC are currently being market widely but recent scientific studies suggest that the products made from hemp or synthetic CBD maybe less effective therapeutically than cannabis based medicines because they lack critically secondary cannabinoids and other medicinal compounds that interact with CBD and THC to enhance their therapeutic benefits scientists call this the entourage effect numerous cannabis compounds have medicinal attributes but the therapeutic impact of the whole plant cannabis seems to be greater than the sum of its parts it still seems that patients are looking for the most part the high THC low CBD products but I feel as a nurse that they would be better suited to choose the high CBD low THC products for medicinal purposes it just seems like the high CBD has more benefits for most medical patients CBD binds with CBD receptors in the body and helps to regulate appetite pain management and immune system function such as inflammation Harlequin sweet and sour widow Stephen Hawking Kush ac/dc canna tonic and Pennywise are some of the most popular and common strains of high CBD flour it is not so much that CBD makes you feel good but that it makes you not feel bad and since it's a cap cannabinoid coming from the cannabis plant it is often confused with THC which is a psychoactive compound and people expect to feel high from it it's imperative that we educate patients as well as the public to the fact that being high as they say on cannabis cannot be compared to being intoxicated on alcohol or to the ill effects of most pharmaceuticals such as opiates benzodiazepines antipsychotics and antidepressants with a CBD high you won't feel sedated or groggy for most people it takes about 20 minutes to feel the effects of CBD when taken on an empty stomach if taking on a full stomach it's about an hour there are many studies that find inflammation as the main contributing factor in problems of the brain such as anxiety brain fog depression autism a DD and ADHD CBD oil is proving to be an effective treatment for social anxiety and is naturally calming side effects from cannabis are dose dependent high CBD low THC therapy should always start with low doses increasing slowly so that the patient can find their individual dose and unwanted effects can be avoided CBD also interacts with THC by taking CBD and THC together individuals may find that the effects of THC are tempered but prolonged slightly some people can hardly tolerate any THC the wide range of reaction to THC rich cannabis may be influenced by genetic factors that may be one of the reasons why some people find THC rich cannabis to be unpleasant while hundreds of millions smoked it to relax this genetic variant exists among 20% of people in the European and Middle Eastern population of Caucasians meaning one in five or THC averse less than 10 percent of Africans have this genetic variant and among Asians it's less than 5% how does CBD benefit the human body CBD shows promise for helping to subdue the symptoms of anxiety which most of us about 30% suffer from it produces effects via molecular molecular pathways CBD enhances activation of serotonin to impede disorders such as anxiety it has been found to be a natural anxiety calmer and works very well in the treatment of social anxiety in addition to fighting inflammation in the body CBD oil may reduce anxiety by directly affecting the brain studies have found that CBD actually lowers activity in the amygdala and increases prefrontal cortex activation to parts of the brain involved in anxiety is also evidence that CBD is able to activate new neurons in the hippocampus this accent activates CBD 1 receptors which has a positive balancing impact on gaba and glutamate levels associated with reducing anxiety doctors often advise people with chronic anxiety to avoid cannabis as THC can trigger or amplify feelings of anxiousness and paranoia which is true I think for a lot of people that paranoia is definitely a side effect of a high THC product however authors of a review from neuro therapeutics found that CBD may help to reduce anxiety in people with certain related disorders according to the review CBD may reduce anxiety related behaviors and people with conditions such as PTSD general anxiety disorder panic disorder social anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder the authors noted that current treatments for these disorders can lead to additional symptoms and side effects which can cause some people to stop taking them no further definitive evidence currently leaked CBD to adverse effects and the authors called for further studies of the compound as a treatment for anxiety anxiety and depression or pathologies affect human beings and may aspects of life including social life productivity and health CBD is a compound of the cannabis plant with great psychiatric potential including use as an antidepressant studies involving animal models performing a variety of experiments on the above-mentioned disorder such as the forced swimming test the elevated plus maze and the global conflict test suggest the CBD exhibited an anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in the animal models discussed experiments with CBD demonstrated non activation of neuroreceptor cb1 and cb2 PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological ailment that is beginning to gain the attention of CBD research PTSD exhibits and individuals who have experienced trauma and/or abuse in their lifetime the disorder is most noteworthy and military veterans and accident survivors CBD has proven beneficial in relation to PTSD as it reportedly helps curb manifestations of both depression and anxiety without the debilitating side effects of pharmaceuticals CBDs effectiveness concerning PTSD is evident in the fact that states like Arizona are now recognizing PTSD as an ailment that warrants legal access to medical marijuana CBD has the ability to lower cortisol levels at slow down muscle growth the reason body builders need to work regularly to maintain continued growing their form is because our bodies do not grow muscles naturally in fact our endocrine system produces catabolic hormones such as cortisol which break down muscle mass in order to use the amino acids for other functions to counter this dilemma someone who wishes to build muscle would have to take catabolic supplements and this is where CBD comes into play studies show that cannabidiol can lower the number of catabolic hormones in the human body meaning that muscle game won't be lost so quickly and it makes it easier to gain muscle mass quicker keep in mind that CBD should not be taken with caffeine at least not for this purpose caffeine promotes the production of catabolic hormone so it would only counter the effects of CBD many medical patients tell us that marijuana helps their pain neuropathic pain also known as nerve pain is a unique type of pain that is caused by injured dysfunction or irritated nerves the pain tends to be chronic and severe with no known cure or remedy the individual is left to try numerous strategies to try to find something that works some of the most common sources of neuropathy include diabetes injury cancer infections alcoholism and autoimmune disorders have been human clinical trials that support benefits of THC and CBD for nerve pain there have been fewer studies examining just CBD in an animal study researchers found that oral supplementation of CBD led to improvements in neuropathic pain in rats back pain is one of the most common forms of both acute and chronic pain acute back pain tends to call be caused by an injury such as a fall or by lifting something heavy chronic back pain is that which lasts more than three months and is often caused by a ruptured or bulging disc author itis osteoporosis scoliosis or nerve pain some back pain is partly caused by inflammation and numerous preclinical animal studies have found benefits of CBD for inflammation three possible reduction in both nerve and inflammatory pain CBD may help relieve back pain the main mechanism by which CBD is thought to help mediate pain is by reducing inflammation largely by blocking inflammatory mediators it is also believed to potentiate glycan receptors which help to regulate pain at the spinal level this suppresses both neuropathic and inflammatory pain CBD has been found to exhibit enhancements in treating pain both when used on its own and when used in combination with THC when used alone CBD is largely best for inflammatory pain such as that caused by arthritis or injuries in one animal study on arthritis pain it was found that the topical application of CVD led to a reduction in inflammation and pain another animal study found that CBD helps to reduce neuropathic pain through the suppression of chronic inflammation CBD does not directly bind to the receptors found in the endocannabinoid system so rather works to modulate the effects of endocannabinoids found naturally in our bodies as well as working as a cb-one antagonist when searching for the best cannabis strains for pain relief you will first want to consider how much THC and CBD is found in the stream generally you will find most relief from a string that has large quantities of both CBD and THC with a high CBD THC ratio this is because CBD can help to mediate the side effects of THC while also providing additional anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties some researchers have found that CBD may prove to combat cancer authors of a review published in the British Journal of clinical pharmacology found evidence that CBD significantly helped to prevent the spread of cancer the researchers also noted that the compound tends to suppress the growth of cancer cells and promote their destruction they pointed out that CBD has low levels of toxicity and they called for further research in its potential as an accompaniment to standard cancer treatments type 1 diabetes results from inflammation that occurs when the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas research published in 2016 found that CBD may ease this inflammation in the pancreas this may be the first step in finding a CBD based treatment for type 1 diabetes a paper presented the same year in Lisbon Portugal suggests that CBD may reduce inflammation and protect against the delay or development of type 1 diabetes initial research published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease found CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficit in its participants this means that CBD could help people in the early stages of Alzheimer's keep the ability to recognize the faces of the people that they know this is the first evidence that CBD may slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease across the board it would appear as though CBD is a natural wakefulness promoting compound because of this it seems smart to recommend to take your CBD supplement or full-spectrum hep extract supplement in the morning so as to keep you alert all day and not to interfere with falling asleep interesting enough when subjects do this it appears that not only do they stay alert and awake throughout the day but they also fall asleep at night more quickly without any additional sleep aid and stay asleep longer this would appear to be because CBD is known to modulate the microglia activation of the inflammatory cycle keeping your body in a less inflamed state and lowering your stress in a review of studies done on chronic pain patients the reviewer found adequate evidence to correlate CBD oil consumption with improving multiple sleep biomarkers including sleep onset which is basically how quickly someone falls asleep the study also saw repeating incidents of lower dream recall and CBD subjects which is very interesting it's difficult to point to a mechanism here since very little is known about the nature of dreams in the field of neuroscience however this does point to the idea that dream recall may be regulated by the endocannabinoid system to some degree the same study also saw a decrease in insomnia symptoms among subjects it appears as though CBD is positively correlated with improving sleep patterns but funny enough not actually by making you sleepy as it is a wakefulness promoting agent and not a sedative like THC in fact it appears to promote sleep improvement due to the fact that it can lower stress levels as a powerful antioxidant where it benefits controlling free radicals in induced inflammation are well-documented this is great news as you can consume your CBD supplements in the morning to keep you stress-free and relaxed but focused throughout the day and then you may fall asleep more quickly and stay asleep longer throughout the night using high CB low THC to help quitting smoking some promising evidence suggests that CBD may help people quit smoking cigarettes a pilot study published in addictive behaviors found that smokers who used inhalers containing CBD smoked fewer cigarettes than usual and had no further cravings for nicotine a similar review published in neuro therapeutics found that CBD may be a promising treatment for people with opioid addiction disorders the researchers noted that CBD reduced some symptoms associated with substance use disorders these included anxiety related symptoms pain and insomnia more research is necessary but these findings suggest that CBD may help to prevent or even reduce withdrawal symptoms children with autism spectrum disorder seek significant improvement in symptoms and less reliance on other medications after treatment with tecum ohlins ever deagle medical cannabis as confirmed by a new study published in scientific reports the two-year study followed 188 children with an average age of 13 diagnosed with ASD the patients were treated with tecum \u00f6hlins high CBD low THC medical cannabis strains which have been specifically cultivated and shown to provide symptom relief for ASD and related conditions with minimal psychoactive effect at the study's outset the most common patient symptoms were restlessness rage attacks and agitation after six months of daily cannabis treatment with at tecum olan's clinics in israel 80 point 1 percent of the patients reported improvement of their symptoms with only with 30 point one percent reporting significant improvements other key findings included of the 27 patients who had epilepsy 24 reported improved or disappearance of symptoms 34 point four percent of patients decreased other medications and 20 percent of patients stop using anti-psychotic medication autism is a leading condition of concern worldwide so this study couldn't have come at a better time says dr. Annabelle manola PhD who is tecum olam scientific director this data showed that autism patients can improve their overall quality of life utilizing a high CBD low THC strain and most importantly that young users can safely and effectively benefit from medical cannabis with the study cannabis is shown to be an effective choice for parents looking for the safest and most neuroprotective treatment the side-effects to cannabis treatment were minimal the FDA recently approved epidemics as a medication for children with refractory Caeser disorders and the DEA classified at the dialects sched as a Schedule v substance on September of 2018 epidemics would surely command a lot of off-label attention if not for the potent price tag and just as surely a huge unregulated market for hemp derived CBD isolate will continue to flourish in a tenuous legal environment an already massive consumer demand for CB products has far outpaced the gathering of clinical data on cannabinoid interactions with pharmaceuticals for pain cancer autism heart disease and many other chronic ailments concerning the product that the fda approved to treat two types of epilepsy researchers noticed the following adverse effects in clinical trials liver problems symptoms related to central nervous system such as irritability and lethargy reduced appetite gastrointestinal problems infections rashes and other sensitivity reactions reduce urination and breathing problems the patient information leaflet notes that there is a risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts it is important to monitor anyone who is using this drugs for signs of mood changes research suggests that a person taking the product is unlikely to form a dependency the long-standing Berry to research is a Schedule one status of cannabis a category reserved for dangerous substances with no medical value according to federal law but the paucity of federally sanctioned clinical research a consequence of cannabis prohibition should not be an excuse for physicians or patients to shun non-lethal cannabinoid therapies which show promise for a wide range of conditions when drugs do not have FDA approval it can be difficult to know whether a product contains a safe or effective level of CBD unapproved products may not have the properties or content stated on the package it is important to note that researchers have linked marijuana use during pregnancy to impairments in the fetal development of neurons regular use among teens is also associated with concerning memory behavior and intelligence CBD is just one of the many cannabinoids found in marijuana and it is not psychoactive smoking cannabis is not the same as using CBD oil and using CBD oil was not the same as smoking cannabis a person can use CBD oil in different ways to relieve various symptoms if a doctor prescribes it it's important to follow their instructions CBD products come in many forms some can be mixed into different foods or drinks and taken with a pipette or dropper others are available in capsules or as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin some products are available as sprays to be administered under the tongue recommended dosages vary between individuals and depend on factors such as body weight the concentration of the products and the health issue the studies done on CBD oil have a pretty wide dose range anywhere from a few milligrams to hundreds of milligrams it's suggested to start at the lower end around 10 milligrams and slowly increase over a few weeks or months to see what works for you some people also do well with splitting the dosage throughout the day instead of taking the dose all at once it is always a good idea to talk with your prescribing doctor if you are on any medications CBD is generally very safe but there are some pharmaceutical medications it could potentially interact with an increase or decrease the pharmaceutical drugs effectiveness some CBD manufacturers have come under government scrutiny for wild and defensible claims such as that CBD is a cure-all for cancer we need more research but CBD may prove to be an option for managing anxiety insomnia and chronic pain without sufficient high quality evidence in human studies we can't pinpoint effective doses and because CBD is currently mostly available as an unregulated supplement it's difficult to know exactly what you are getting if you decide to try CBD check with your doctor if for no other reason than to make sure it won't affect other medications that you're taking using CBD THC compounds in concert has been shown to help mitigate side-effects and enhance efficacy with CBD + THC showing more benefit for some conditions and THC alone studies have confirmed that CBD helps to counteract some of the sedative high feeling anxiety and rapid heartbeat that's associated with THC consumption it also has been found to extend the half-life of the THC which may help to extend the pain relieving benefits this has allowed the use of higher doses of THC in clinical trials for the treatment of pain caused by multiple sclerosis peripheral neuropathy intractable cancer pain and rheumatoid arthritis when used in concert a greater efficacy in treating these types of pain has been observed you may be wondering what is the ideal balance a ratio of CBD and THC every strain of Bud that you purchased at a dispensary will be labeled with its THC and CBD content and that's helpful when choosing a strain for pain relief thus far based on the observations regarding the ride spread use of cannabis flour and full spectrum cannabis oil it does not appear that there have been many problems because of cannabinoid drug reactions to the extent that there have been problematic drug interactions with cannabinoids these have involved high doses of CBD isolates not cannabis in general even though THC is an intoxicant and CBD is not the fact that people tend to use much higher doses of pure CBD makes it much riskier player in the metabolic drug interactions 10 milligrams of THC in a cannabis product is a hefty dose for a naive patient and sufficiently psychoactive for the occasional recreational user 10 milligrams of THC combined with equal amounts of CBD in a sativex tincture hits the energies exploit spot in clinical trials there are moderate doses compared to the amount of single molecule CBD administer to epileptic children in clinical trials up to 50 milligrams per kilogram with CBD doses as high as 2,000 milligrams not uncommon among patients who obtain CBD isolates from internet storefronts and other unregulated sources THC has its own built in guardrails consume too much and you'll know you've hit your limit with CBD there are no guardrails no dysphoric feedback loop that says you've had enough CBD is intrinsically safe but when extracting from the plant and concentrated as an isolate high doses are necessary for therapeutic efficacy unlike whole plant CBD rich extracts which have a broader therapeutic window and are effective at lower doses in a single molecule CBD drug interactions are much more likely with high dose CBD therapy than other forms of cannabis consumption physicians and patients should be concerned about this given the current regulatory regime with privileges CBD isolates over artisanal plant-derived multi-component formulations the legality CBD is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational use in use in some American states other states have approved the use of CBD oil as a hemp product but not the general use of medical marijuana some state and federal laws differ and current marijuana and CBD legislation in the United States can be confusing even in states where marijuana is legal there is an ever-changing number of states that do not necessarily consider marijuana to be legal but have laws directly related to CBD oil the following information is accurate as as of May 2018 but the laws change frequently however state legislators usually approve the use of CBD oil at various concentrations to treat a range of epileptic conditions a full list of states that have CBD specific laws is available different states also require different levels of prescriptions to possess and use CBD oil in Missouri for example a person can use CBD of a particular composition if they can show that three other treatment options have failed to treat their epilepsy they can provide information about safe CBD sausage sources and local laws surrounding uses anyone considering CBD oil should speak with a local healthcare provider it's also research your local state laws most states require a prescription my own state of Delaware has a medical marijuana program that currently has close to 7,000 patients thank you so much for watching my webinar on high CBD low THC product efficacy for better patient outcomes in medical marijuana programs I'm Ruth betrayin from Wyoming Delaware I have worked as a nurse for the past 13 years where I come face-to-face with various disease processes daily I'm a member of the American cannabis Nurses Association Delaware normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network I have been an advocate for marijuana since 1975 and I've lobbied at state and national levels for the past couple of years we hope to legalize recreational cannabis here in Delaware this year the legislators in my state decide the fate of marijuana so the only way to make change is to speak to them personally 61% of Delaware again support legalization of recreational cannabis I am by no means an expert on this topic but I recently worked in one of the medical marijuana dispensaries here in Delaware and I know of the pain and suffering the patient's endure for years before they finally get their doctor to agree that marijuana could help it's my hope that patients everywhere are able to utilize marijuana as a first line of defense in their medical treatment instead of it being a last resort I'd like to give a shout out to Jay and Riley mendler of Riley sunshine and thank them for all the hard work and dedication and their continued support of pediatric medical cannabis worldwide I'd also like to thank Delaware Normal and the Delaware cannabis advocacy Network for the continued work towards legalization I'm going to close with the video done by a friend of mine Tommy Lyons he is a veteran who lives in Maryland and he's a medical marijuana patient thank you for watching hey everybody my name is Tommy Lyons and I'm a good friend of Ruth wanted to come on here today and talk to you about why I use CBD products from the cannabis plant specifically I'd like to state that I'm not representing any industry and I'm a registered and approved msec patient which means I have safe access to cannabis in Maryland I'm a service-connected disabled veteran and I use cannabis to offset various symptoms that come along with that I find that the CBD really helps target the symptoms from PTSD major depressive disorder and it helps me just kind of regain my calm I enjoy ac/dc I'm smoker and ac/dc is great it is very high in CBD and almost next to nothing in THC what that does for me is just give me a clear slate just makes me feel alright no high really but I'm not it's hard to say the word high anymore because it does different things for everybody but what we're finding is that the one thing it's doing across the board is providing an increase in quality of life and that's why I like cannabis and CBD it is important to use THC with the CBD to create what's called the entourage effect that was explained to me by a good friend of mine the old buddy old pal bill that CBD Rides and THC drives so you're in the car you've got THC and CBD working together CBD is kind of navigating telling the THC where to go and then the THC is like mmm just kind of takes off and then it's like a little bit too much so the CBD is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa come back here come back here get back to the speed limit so if you ever have too much THC for any reason use some CBD the CBD teamsters the drops that you put under your tongue that's a great way to medicate people are finding that to be very effective as a source to get the CBD into their system I usually recommend a ten to one texture which is ten part CBD and one part THC when it comes to THC and CBD in regard to dosing they're called Colorado doses ten milligrams of THC is one Colorado dose one milligram of CBD is one Colorado dose you can have as much CBD as you can intake you can't have too much CBD which is great you can't have too much THC or any other cannabinoid for that fact but the more you intake of certain cannabinoids the more potential you have for psychotropic psychedelic effects that you might not be looking for if you're looking for medicinal relief in regard to anxiety stress depression cancer looking for tumor reduction looking for symptom relief with HIV ADEs gastrointestinal issues post reconstructive surgery or any kind of surgery for that matter there are bombs THC and CBD bombs that are great for spot application for example if you're having elbow pain rub it right on the elbow there are compounds that are transdermally ingested so those are same things bomb and if you're having spot pain then you rub it on that and then you always rub it on your wrist where the skin is really thin and Venus because the compounds can either be spot application by themselves for spot application with transdermal properties so when it's transdermal and you rub it on the thin part of the skin it's gonna go full bloodstream which is going to give you a better chance for relief and fighting symptoms I've had a great opportunity to learn about cannabis I work as a dispensary technician at nature's care and wellness I'm also a patient consultant so I've worked with I have 3,000 patients that come into the store and I've gotten an opportunity to work with most of them and what we do is come up with plans in regard to how we can help figure this out come together get on a med excuse me get on a medical regimen and then find relief and it's working people keep coming back I've been working with people for over a year now and it works so it's really great to see people coming back people getting relief people's scams coming back clear people are kicking opiates I mean from going going from 280 milligrams a day down to nothing cannabis it's not just about the THC and CBD either there are many cannabinoids there are over 200 identified cannabinoids there are also terpenes which is the flavor and scent there's tart beans and everything stripping's and oranges tomatoes it's all over the place it's plant-based wellness and bringing these things together in an effort to find wellness as possible so it's great there are our CBD vapes CBD heavy vapes that are cannabis for example some strains that are really good are penny wise hardly sue tsunami harley quinn ac/dc shark shock blue dream blue dream is my favorite I've been using blue dream as my meds when I smoke they're the prettiest CBD buds I've ever seen and I mention that because I get relief when I open the bag smell it you know I take the milk out or break it open and just looking at it just makes me go I love that that's one thing about cannabis that you're not gonna get from any kind of prescription medication you're never gonna open up a bottle of pills and be like no it's just it's not like that there are capsules that you can ingest to get CBD and THC into your system there's also RS o which is Rick Simpson oil another good strain what CBD is a ray of sunshine and I've seen that in RSO tubes with a thousand milligrams total cannabinoids 600 milligrams CBD and 200 milligrams THC which is an amazing ratio because that's not going to get you too high but it is gonna get you some serious medicinal relief especially during the day the best way to consume that is called front lining it's a term that I coined basically dry out the inside of your gum with a paper towel have your meds ready pull the paper towel out so it's dry line the gums with the oil it's viscous and then let it sit there before you know it it's full blood streams called sublingual ingestion and it's really helping people alright

channel to see more videos hello everybody welcome back to the channel in today's video I'm gonna be making a very much anticipated and requested video from our subscribers today I'm going to be making CBD hand cream or body butter whatever you'd like to call it an oil based cream but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you very much for your support and if you wouldn't mind please give the video a big thumbs up to continue that support so folks I have received so many emails friends requests and just direct messages about can we make a CBD cream how to make a CBD cream and will you make a video for youtube and the answer to all those questions is yes today I will be showing you how to make a CBD hand cream or body butter now this is not a lotion lotions are water-based for those of you that do not know the difference lotions are a completely water-based and are a totally different recipe and we'll be making that later on so look for that video on our channel but today we are doing an oil based cream or body butter and I'm going to go over the ingredients to be able be able to make it so first and foremost you are going to need sweet almond oil now for those of you that are allergic to nuts you can use avocado oil and I have for this recipe now you're not going to get the same results as we will with the sweet almond oil but for those of you that nut allergy this is a great substitute second you're gonna need cocoa butter this is not the same as shea butter it's a harder texture smells like chocolate so you're gonna need this then next you are gonna need shea butter this is different not the same as coconut butter some people will get them confused and I want to make it clear that these are two separate butters and here we go here is the shea butter it's more malleable definitely have that softer butter texture and then last but not least as far as the cents greediest go for this recipe you will need infuse coconut oil now for those of you that do not have the infused coconut oil you could add CBD pollen or Keef to this recipe however if you want to make the CBD coconut oil that's infused go ahead and check out our video right here on our channel then come on back and after you've made your coconut oil and you start making this recipe so folks that is the essential ingredients to making this hand cream over body butter whatever you'd like to call it the next two ingredients are not essential to this but I will be adding one of the two of them today first is vitamin E oil now it's not necessary but this is a great way to rejuvenate skin it just helps the skin a lot whether it's recovering from damage or just being nice and smooth now you don't need to add it because shea butter has vitamin E in it but this really adds a lot more vitamin E to it to really give you that rejuvenating skin feel the other thing that we are not adding today is an essential oil now if you don't like the smell of chocolate which is what this will come out to smell like because the cocoa butter is very strong you can dampen it and the two I recommend are lavender and mint but today we're not going to be doing that we're cool with the the chocolate smell so let's get right into how I make this CBD hand cream or body butter alright folks before we get started you're going to need a couple things from your kitchen first and foremost a probably a really small spatula to be able to get the oils out of your 1/3 cup measuring cup you'll also need a double boiler or in this case I set it up as a double boiler glass bowl and you have water in the pot we're going ahead and turn that on right now while we're doing all this all right folks now that you've gathered all your kitchen equipment you're just going to need 1/3 cup of every oil and butter so 1/3 cup of cocoa butter 1/3 cup of sweet almond oil and for those of you that using avocado oil it's the same thing 1/3 cup of infused coconut oil and 1/3 cup of shea butter so I'm gonna measure all those out get them into our double boiler and start making our CBD hand cream or body butter so let's get right into it we have measured everything out and we have put it on the stove and as you can see everything's starting to become liquid already now this is the time where you would start thinking about adding your essential oils for us we're just going to do a few drops of the vitamin E so we'll do that you don't need anything crazy maybe five six drops max nothing nothing nuts really just depends on what you like I wouldn't go overboard with the vitamin E though you know ten drops really maximum and so we're just gonna start stirring this around for a little while so we're gonna cut to that so once this all melts down I'll see you in a few minutes okay folks you can see that everything is melted so now we're going to take it off the heat now it's very important this step is that you do not throw it right into the refrigerator you take it off the double boiler and you set it down on the counter get rid of this steam here real quick okay folks so now what you're gonna do is you're going to stir this gently for a little while for about ten minutes you really want it to come down in temperature because first glass can crack and we just put it right into the refrigerator you also want to give the oil some time to rest before you go ahead and cool them down so that's what I'm gonna do for the next ten mathema throw it in the fridge for about an hour and then we'll take it out and we'll whip it so I'll see you in about an hour folks the oil was in the fridge for approximately an hour and a half so a little bit more than an hour and it is now solidified and you really want to get it when it's not totally solid it just transferred over to a solid so it's got that you know loose texture to it and that's important because now what we're going to do is we're gonna whip the oil and this is important because in order to make it a body cream do our hand cream you call a weapon we do this for quite a while and I'll see you okay so we're about halfway done with the whipping here and so what I'm doing is I'm just getting it off the edges and I'm putting it in the middle of the glass bowl here so that we can start whipping it again and I'm going to do this process for a probably about another one to two minutes so I'm going to jump to that next to that alright so now I've lifted for about three minutes and you can tell that it's starting to get that like nice whipped kind of texture to it so what I'm gonna do now is this is the final leg scraped with a bowl because I want to make sure I get everything I can so you can have as much of this body cream as possible but you can tell see it's getting that very whipped type of texture that's what you're gonna look for and you want it to be very fluffy very fluffy and you know kind of Airy just like whipped cream you really want this to have that whipped cream type texture so we're gonna give it one more run through with the blender here and then we'll have the final product alright folks so now we're just gonna store it up and all you need is a mason jar go ahead and just put it right into the mason jar now the great thing about this stuff is it is all ready to be stored it's all oiled so it should be okay on the Shelf you may have to read it if if it deflates for whatever reason but it shouldn't and this should last you quite a while this is a lot of butter or lotion you can use it on your hands use it whatever now it does have a bit of a greasy feel to it and that's typical for body creams and lotions but yeah that's it for today folks I really hope you enjoyed this video I hope you can make this at home and if you guys have any questions comments concerns leave them in the comments below I'll answer them to the best I can if you guys are interested in any kind of flower all my information is down in the description below go ahead and reach out to me and I can give you some price quotes but that's all I have for you today folks I hope you enjoyed today's video I know it was much anticipated and a lot of people were looking forward to it so I hope it doesn't disappoint but yeah that's it for today I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in another video take care [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "BLqIYyv6Dck": "[Music] hi there welcome to the canvas kitchen with Christmas coming I thought it might be a nice idea to make some CBD infused booboo balm now this is just kind of a homemade type of polysporin works great on little cuts and bruises and the CBD oil will help with the pain and maybe help with a little bit of information as well so this is a nice easy recipe it's an infusion recipe today we're going to use CBD oil you can use CBD bud as well and you can infuse that with the other flowers that we're going to be infusing today so we've got some calendula flowers here and on the bottom we've got some lavender buds as well so we're gonna be infusing those into our mixture and we should make a really nice balm when it's done and we'll pack them in some nice little tins and give them away for Christmas so let's start out with some of our more wet ingredients so this here is a mixture so this is a quarter cup of olive oil get the purest one extra virgin and the best one you can find and also in here is a quarter cup of hemp seed oil so we're gonna add that into our double boiler we're going to get that warming up a little bit we want to get all these oils nice and warm so that bill in a few is really nicely with the flowers that were using today okay so the next thing we need is a half a cup of coconut oil I've melted this down just a little bit so that I can do the proper measurement so we're gonna pop that in as well so if you want to you can actually use some cannabis infused coconut oil for this recipe as well but I didn't do that in this one just because I want to keep it just a straight seaweedy recipe but if you have some cannabis that has some CBD in it that would be fine to use as well there okay so the next thing we need to do is add in four tablespoons of beeswax pellets so this is actually a little third cup measuring cup so if you did a heaping third of a cup you can do that as your measurement as well so we're just gonna pop those in we want to get that all nice and melted perfect there so we're just going to get this stirred around and make sure it's melted and then we're going to add our flour to it okay so we have here third of a cup of dried lavender buds and a third of a cup of calendula flowers dried so there then the calendula flowers are a little bit funny looking but they have a very nice smell to them almost an earthy kind of smell and of course the lavender buds smell beautiful so we're just gonna pop these right in just like that and then we're going to mix them around and get them nice and soaked here we are okay so the next thing we're gonna head in is our dose of a CBD oil I'm using some aurora CBD oil today try and find the highest concentration that you can because we're going to be making a few little contains with this we want to make sure it was a good dose in each little bit that people are going to be using so I've got my dose here and I'm just gonna pour that in I would say depending on your strength of your CBD oil you can use like a tablespoon I would say up to about two tablespoons without ruining your recipe because you don't want it to be too mushy either so the next thing we're going to add in is this tiny tiny little bit and this is beautiful this is ten drops of tea tree essential oil as well you can add a little bit more a little bit less to your liking for that too and then we're gonna add in five drops of lavender essential oil I put in a few more I put probably about equal ten in ten of the tea tree and lavender oil but you can do it however you like the recipe that I use usually calls for about five five drops so we're gonna go back to stirring this again this is melting quite nicely there you go now I don't know if you can see this mixture but you can see that the beeswax pellets are melting in here as well quite nicely so what we're going to do with this is we're just gonna let it go we're gonna let that simmer together on the double boiler for about two hours and then we can run it through a strainer get all the flowers back out again and then we can get it packaged so you're just going to let that go if you want to stir it now and again just to keep things moving you can certainly do that and again if you're using CBD bud you're probably going to want to grind that up a little bit not too powdery because you don't want it to be too sneak through the strainer later on or just break some butt up into little pieces and that works as well so we're going to let that sit and we're just gonna let that simmer I've got my double boiler on the water right now isn't quite too boiling so this will probably heat up a little bit faster once that water is at a boiling point and then we can actually turn the stove down a little bit just so that it simmers make sure too that you continue to check the bottom of your pan just to make sure that you haven't lost too much water you'll want to fill that up again if you need to but we're going to let that go for two hours and then once that's ready to go we're gonna put it into packaging okay welcome back so what we've done is we've had this mixture infusing in our little double boiler I mean it's been going for about two hours it looks like everything's lovely and melted together all the beeswax pellets are also all melted in here so what we're going to do now is we're just going to turn off our heat and then we're going to take this bowl we're going to just pour it through here so I just have a regular strainer and a measuring cup and we're just gonna put a little bit of cheese cloth on top I think that will really help us to get all those seeds out maybe we can pick it up like a little tea bag and squish them on low the other thing you can do is like I said before if you have made your mix and put your herbs in your flour just into a little sachet like this and just tie it off you makes your job a little bit easier as well so we're just gonna take this mixture right off the stove under there there we go okay try not to burn yourself use some oven mitts if he need to here we go okay so we're just gonna pour this right through this cheesecloth through the strainer there we go beautiful so just make sure you've got everything get all those oils out from the bottom of your pan there we go perfect let's put that right up there again for now so you can see all the herbs or all the flowers that we've got here so we want to definitely get all of that goodness into the bottom of our container here so we're just going to take a grab of it just like that Oh I'm just gonna gather that up yeah and then we're just gonna push down I just keep squeezing it when it's cooled off enough you can actually do this with your hands it does cool down fairly quickly so there's still quite a bit of oil in there that we need to get out so we're just going to keep squeezing that through so oh we were left to do now is just poured into some containers so let me just dry my little area here first there you're gonna move this Cup right out of the way so I've got these little tins very easy to use her couple ounces each you can buy them on Amazon I will put the link down below in the description below for you or actually probably on the Canadian wheat forum website we've got a whole recipe section there on the forum and I put all my recipes that I make on this channel up on to the website so you can get get the links there for that so what we're gonna do now is just give these a little pour you can fill them as much or as little as you like these ones have a little bit of a line around the outside edge so I like to just fill them up to that edge / so what we're gonna do now is we're just gonna let them sit we're gonna let them get a little bit solid you can actually see just by the cup that it does actually come to temperature to room temperature fairly quickly so I'm gonna heat this up a little bit again and we'll put that into another container and save that for another one but it gives you a general idea of what we're doing here so if you want to fill them up a little bit more you can fill them in like I said is fill is you like because they are gonna get a little bit harder perfect all right so we're just gonna let this sit we're going to let it get to room temperature and then we will check them out and see what you think okay so we have our little containers of our boo boo bomb or it's all back up to warm temperature or to room temperature and it's ready to go so you can see here what it looks like the consistency of it is fairly soft if you like run your hands on it you can feel that it's you know moving some stuff around you can probably dig in there if you want to but basically all you need to do is give a little rub on the top and if you got something sore or a little cut or something you just put it right on there so it works really well um it's a very nice alternative to using anything medicinal in terms of like polysporin or something like that or an antibiotic cream what you can do to add a little bit more properties to it in terms of lasting longer or a healing is a little bit of honey so yeah I've had a teas tablespoon of honey to your mixture that's another nice addition so you can start to take away and add and play around with things as you like I've changed this recipe a few times over the years but this one is my favorite I love the addition of the hemp seed oil and I love the the fact that you can do either see medial or you can use straight bud and both ways works wonderfully so I hope you enjoyed this video thank you again for joining us I'm sure the family members that are getting this and they're stocking this year will be very happy

hopefully we'll see you soon thanks again [Music]", "i8ITLj9AHdQ": "hello again everybody and welcome back to your career economists in today's episode we will be making CBD coconut oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion

lotion base so it's called base lotion there's no no smell to it and you can find this either online they sell it at health food stores are also at the craft store so I picked some of this up at the local craft store and a lot of people like to make these lotions and they make great gifts you know you obviously you're going to have a large batch of this stuff maybe two to five cups so you're not going to want to use it all yourself you go get some of these cute little jars and you fill the lotion up in the jars and then you put the lotion on the skin and then hahaha you get it you catch the drift but anyway you get you give these out as gifts and everybody is going to love you they're going to think you're so creative they're gonna be like wow you made lotion yourself man you are a cool person you know so that's real and I got some people out there Cara thank you for the feedback we appreciate that she says the only thing that helps her arthritis is actual topical lotions so even if she's able to ingest it it doesn't relieve that part of the pain so these topical lotions are helping her out Thank You Cara for for giving us the feedback we love you and go ahead and put that's a half a cup of infused coconut oil so I infused this coconut oil with cannabis ahead of time in my magical butter machine once you have your infused cannabis coconut oil that's your base ingredient now to infuse these lotions so that's exactly what we're doing here and we're going to add some sunflower lecithin to this recipe and that's just three teaspoons and it's going to help all this stuff bind together get a good mixture there so we try to stay away from the soy lecithin I know you may have read that in our owners manual but lecithin is a great binding agent you just want to make sure you get a good healthy form of it so and then what's up Brenda Bloodworth she says it puts the lotion on the skin hashtag it puts the lotion on the skin that's a lot of fun what a weird movie so let's see what we have here oh yes so this is another essential oil we're using some limonene terpene here mmm that's really good add that right in there natural Terps all of them a lotion and then this here is some vitamin E so they either sell this in liquid form or you may have trouble finding that you're going to probably have to get some like vitamin E capsules bust wide open squirt them right in there but about three capsules worth of vitamin E oil there and that's it you combine everything right into your magical butter machine just like that my hands are still pretty much clean if you get a little bit of this stuff on you just rub it in it feels good feels good so I'm gonna close this sucker up I'm going to set our temperature today to 130 degrees for one hour what do you think bud Wow

think I have the very thing you're looking for what kind of CBD product we have a lot here this is a CBD only dispensary oh you had a car accident and how's your back well I am sorry to hear that um thankfully I think we have the thing that will help you out I would recommend to you a tropical South yes I think that it would work best for you you just apply it to the skin you rub it on smooth it over and it should alleviate some muscle pain that you're experiencing it's an anti-inflammatory CBD is and there is different types that you can get and by the way these are frog song farm items and I have been buying from them for a very long time it is a small family farm located in Oregon um near Woodburn and it is just really great they produce and extract their own hemp and CBD and I recommend you giving these products a try what do you think perfect so and they are free of pesticides which is wonderful so the first product I have here is a tropical South that contains 500 milligrams of CBD this might be a bit strong for you considering that you're not someone who uses CBD very often there is mild side effects if you just take a lot of CBD um it could include drowsiness or a dry mouth a little blood pressure but nothing it's quite uncommon and it's also very mild so just so you know in advance okay so I would recommend this cell for you but instead of the 500 milligram we have a 250 milligram and there's Xie butter inside of this coconut oil Aragon oil sweet almond oil beeswax activation time is 5 minutes oh yes yes um CBD is fine to be used on that so you just have to be aware of the proper dosage and be aware of the weight of your pet so do you have to definitely take that into consideration before applying for the intake yes that is a very common question to non-intoxicating the anti-inflammatory antioxidant rich and supportive plant base so those are important things to keep noted before try I mean it may help with sleep conditions anxiety arthritis neurological health definitely worth a try again I would recommend the 250 for you what do you want to do is take a little bit you don't have to take too much because this is very rich in essential oils comments you just really need a little bit it's actually I might have put a little too much there put some back when you rub on like this we're ever needed yes CVT is legal um it was federally legalized in 2018 but it was partially legal in 2014 so another factory that's why it's such a big thing recently as you can see going to store such as new seasons old foods yeah it's a very common it is the next big thing would you like to try some okay yeah here you go give it a go and let me know what you think okay activation time is five minutes so you will feel it in no time there you go excellent okay so another item that I would love to recommend to you is a tincture it is designed to be held under the tongue before swallowing it's just more effective that way however if the consistency or taste is unbearable you can just put some in your food or drink or whatever you wish to do and yeah that's perfectly fine as well and this is the 750 milligrams CBD so this one's a very potent for your situation and socially being someone who's new to CBD I might recommend the lower dose so there's another tincture that has the last CBD unit and I think that one would work perfectly for you yes so yes it is he concluded free so what you do is you shake this and you fill the dropper you can fill it to the point 75 line and I mean you couldn't really use unless on this if you want you know that's perfectly fine I usually use like this much at the point 5 or the 0.25 and you know just use a little bit do you work in real time I think that tinctures really really do a great job when it comes to insomnia or anxiety I think that it does a wonderful job tackling that problem only said something but I've experienced um I like to take some before I go to sleep I think for your condition and the back pain I would recommend a cell for you there's also one other product that I want to show you it is a new product that just came out it is called - the body balm ultra and it is a different consistency from the south is it dries faster and it has a less greasy ER feel compared to the south and it has a little bit of a scent so if you're someone who isn't a big fan of sense roller to get a sense I would maybe recommend itself and really do that's which you prefer so have some of this tincture if you'd like I'm just gonna set it right over here and the next item here which I mentioned earlier activation time is five minutes this also has 500 milligrams of CBD if the two selves they're called a rabbit um the first one that I showed is 500 milligrams of CBD and the second one has 250 those are the two options you have and I'm the tincture again I have the seven so this one might be a little strong for you right now but I think you can start with the 250 rugged and I think after that this might work really well for you since this is less greasy and it dries a lot faster okay as you can see over here it's it's more liquidy there's more watery type of substance consistency what it does smell really nice it's not too strong you know it's it's much lighter than a perfume it's like a natural essential oil kind of smell which I can handle being someone who is quite sensitive to scents and perfumes and clothes and such so yes that one is pretty great again it's a new items so definitely check it out I'm gonna place this right here give it a little give it a go and yeah do you have any other questions okay perfect and which one would you like to purchase today excellent okay so I will put that in a bag I'm glad you decided to go with me nothing 250 so I think sure I think that you made a great decision yeah do you have to let me know helps me I like to rub this on my tummy from time to time it really helps with my cramps cramping pains are just pains and shadow makes it a lot more manageable and I hope that this really uses up the pain in your back yeah just gonna put some on right now if you want back there I notice you have been putting them on your hands so it only takes five minutes again that's pretty fast and the tincture is pretty fast as well just remember to shake it and put it underneath your tongue or if not you're putting food or um the drink yeah probably a drink like juice yes okay well there you are um I hope you have a lovely day and I will see you next time yes let me know what you think of the Frog song farm products I think that they're fabulous fantastic and they've just really helped me so I hope that they help you too okay goodbye", "YRTEx_lcNOI": "today I'm going to teach you how to make your own herbal home scent infused oils you'll need these to make salves and some other soaps and products on your homestead today we're going to go over the infused oils and then I'm going to show you how to make your own healing salve [Music] you so salve ourselves however you say it depends on where you're from but today we're going to go over and paste oils and fast assisted in the beginning and this is a really really easy task something that any homesteader can begin with if you're wanting to get into herbalism this might be the best place for you to begin with making products now I know making products with herbs can be a little bit intimidating but it doesn't have to be so in past videos we've gone over how to make tinctures or salve not fast but infused oils there's a couple different ways to make infused oils but before you can make a fab you to make an infused oil most of the time now there are some stats that we make better just use strictly with essential oils and that's okay you don't have to worry about making and infused oil at that point you just buy the essential oil but today we're actually using calendula chamomile and arnica oil we don't have those in essential oils we have them in infused oils so there are a couple different ways for you to make the infused oil before you make your sad the most commonly popular way that you're going to find online is to fill your jar up with one part herb and five parts oil I just use olive oil you can use fractioned coconut oil grapeseed oil whichever you prefer but I prefer to use olive oil just because it's readily available at all times and so you're going to weigh it out for a one-ounce herb to 5 ounces of oil now this is calendula you can see that the oil does not cover the entire st. part of calendula but you're going to fill your jar up you're going to shake it really well and that's going to sit in a sunny area for about 4 weeks that's just ensure that you get all the best attraction from the oil that's the hard way or the long way to make an infused oil the next way to make an infused oil is to actually put the oil in your oven so what you do is you would set your oven to 300 degrees measure out your herb and your oil and a jar and a glass jar just like this and once your temperature has reached an or degrees you turn your oven off put your jar into the oven to set for two to three hours you're not going to bake or cook the herb you're just wanting the heat to heat up the urban extract it the final way to make an infused oil is to do your same ratio a 1 to 5 ratio 1 ounce or 5 ounces of oil and to put it in a double boiler on your stovetop that takes about 30 minutes to an hour just depending on your herb and how hot it is in your oven so that's the next bit of making the Z's a little 3 easy very easy ways one more time consuming than the other I definitely up for the oven option I actually have herbs in the oven right now that I will show you I've extracted chamomile and arnica this is calendula that I actually had extracting for four weeks in my bathroom cabinet medicine cabinet which gets a lot of sunlight sometimes so I want to put that in there so I'm going to get started and we're going to make a homestead SAP I've gotten my herbs out of the oven this is the kimono oh my gosh chamomile is my favorite herb to extract and oil it smells on - I could eat it now your oils are going to be strained I'm going to go ahead and strain it through a mesh strainer but sometimes for certain herbs they can actually there can slip through the strainer but I'm going to go ahead and try the strainer first and you're going to need to go ahead and separate them into separate jars because I'm actually going to be using these probably more than one time you're just going to go ahead and push down and get all of that oil out now there is some of the flower head that's coming through and that's okay but I may want to go ahead and put it through a mesh towel just one more time just to make sure we get all of that out wisdom soon the the [Music] straining the oil's is probably one of the messiest jobs you have during this entire process so you're going to get dirty make sure you wash your hands after each straining of each oil that way you don't have any contamination and the oil isn't soaking into your skin for a really long time so now that you've made and strained your infused oils now you're going to want to make a salve or some kind of product with them today we're show you how to make a SAP now it's best if you go ahead and do your fu stove ahead of times once you make your infused oil you can actually keep it on the shelf for about a year so you can make it way in advance and then use it when you need it now I'm probably going to have some that will lift so I'll just keep it in the pantry and I'm out of sunlight and it will stay good for a year now your next step with making this app your friend is going to be your kitchen scale you're going to need to measure out your oils because you want to know how much exactly you're putting in to your salve you're going to have your infused oils your beeswax and then you're also going to add you can add essential oils or things like that but today we're just using the empties oils and v-flex so I'm going to show you how to do that alright so with this nifty kitchen skill if you go ahead and put your jar on first it's actually going to measure out the tear for you this is the ocre scale it's really good great love it so just going to hit the on button it's going to calculate the weight for you and it's going to start at zero so for starters I need 2 ounces of calendula oil one and a half ounces of arnica one ounce of chamomile so I'm going to go ahead and measure that all out [Music] I thought it had Mexican ate it all sick bounces even so I put in just roughly one and a half ounces of the beeswax give or take you can add more place the recipe to what you like now we're going to take this and set it and make a makeshift double boiler and melt it all down now I've got a saucepan here that's heating up it's on a medium heat you don't want to be boiling but you do want it to be hot water I'm going to go ahead and set my jar down in there the reason that we put the water in there so that we're not scorching the oil or the herb I'm just going to let it sit there for a few minutes as the water heats up and then I'm going to kind of come in and start really good once it's completely stirred and combined then we're going to go ahead and put it in our little tins and it'll dry and be done all right all you got is melted now we need for a medium your 10 [Music] Oh [Music] and just like that you have your very own SAP and this particular side with the Colangelo arnica and chamomile we use specifically for boo-boos and bruises to heal was if you've had a cut or scrape this is great for that this is also great healing for sore muscles it helps relax the body and it's just a really great faff to hat but here's what it ends up looking like and it's just really great to have here's what it looks like you just rub it like this and put it on you're done so there's your basic fab recipe for the day I encourage you to make it make your infused oils make your staff they do really really well they hold up well the last about a year in your medicine cabinet or pantry and that was really good too so hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please like and subscribe so you'll get a free to share it so if you guys have a great day happy home studying", "9Ws1nGul3_c": "hold on the gardener here in this video I'm going to show you how to make a comfrey sale I'm going to show you how I make a comfrey cell using comfrey olive oil and beeswax but before I get into that I want to extend a very special thank you to Pamela at Garden garden novice farm on her help in helping me and figuring out how to do this also want to give you a word of caution here do not apply this kind of a salve to an open cut wound because it will cause the wound to heal over on top before it has healed from deep within as a cut wound should heal and once it has caused you to heal over on top it could trap inflammation in deep in that wound which would then of course be a problem for you so don't apply it apply it to an open cut wound all right let's get busy making this out first we gotta go pick some countries and then we have to dehydrate it the nice dark color of green that you see that these leaves indicates that I did not dehydrate it at a high temperature dehydrating at a higher temperature could destroy the beneficial properties of the comfrey and it will definitely make a leaves turn dark brown so once you have them dehydrated and all you have to do is take your hands and rub them together with comfrey and the small particles will fall out now we have our dried comfrey let's move on to the next step so here we have our one cup of dry hump relief and now we want to and a half cups of good olive oil I'm going to use a crock-pot to infuse the country into the oil I'm going to not put the lid on so that will help to keep the temperature a little bit lower you now it's the time to get your jars or containers whatever you're going to use ready Here I am using four ounce jelly jars to melt the beeswax I'm going to use my instant pot as you would a steam double boiler my beeswax came in one ounce sticks so I have given a rough cut you it doesn't take very long with the steam on the bottom of the top to start melting the beeswax now I guess one point I ought to make this is not the stainless steel pot that goes in your instant pot this is another bowl that I will use only for making comfrey infusions okay now our bees wax is melted it's time to add our oil olive oil which has been infused with the comfrey if you want to add this olive oil all the beeswax is still warm so you can get a good mixture I'm going to add 800 I use a vitamin e and this will help as a preservative for our country sale the vitamin E is a little gel cap so punch a hole in one end of it and squeeze the contents out into our oil and beeswax mixture now we're ready to pour our country sail up into our jars make sure to let it cool overnight before you put a lid on it next day there it is come free South that's all there is to it now you know how to do it be sure to mark your leads with the date that you made this it should stay good for about six months you", "q4maAFJSWAA": "[Music] I'd like to welcome everybody today's presentation on CBD in the treatment of Alzheimer's addictions and mood disorders I'm your host dr. Donnelly Snipes in this class we're going to talk about how we can use CBD in the treatment of addiction CBD and its impact on mental health issues CBD and its impact on neurodegenerative issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as hit a real high-level overview of CBD adverse events toxicity and drug interactions that is going to be really important because a lot of our clients may decide to try to self-medicate with CBD in addition to other medications and I'll just foreshadow for you CBD oil or CBD interacts with just about every medication out there so we do want to make sure that they're aware of that and hopefully agree to if they're going to try to start taking CBD do it in a physician supervised capacity all right cannabidiol is promise for treatment of substance use disorder CBD is short for cannabidiol and recent models implicate major brain circuits involved in reward salient C so how were warding something is motivation and memory and learned associations in substance abuse we call those triggers in maintaining addiction which may be largely modulated by the endocannabinoid system or the receptors in our brain that respond to cannabinoids and that includes THC as well as cannabidiol the endocannabinoid system or ECS modulates dopamine that's really important to recognize it also has an effect on noradrenaline and Sarah but we'll get there when we talk about addiction though one of the things that we have seen with addiction and try to avoid saying we know because we don't really know a whole lot for a hundred percent certain but one of the things that we've seen repeatedly with addiction is that addictive substances and addictive behaviors cause a dopamine surge the endocannabinoid system is there to try to modulate that dopamine so you don't get those surges quite so much alcohol nicotine and THC which is not CBD it is another cannabinoid that's in marijuana but alcohol nicotine and THC all increased dopamine levels via nerve terminals modulated by the in endocannabinoid system important to recognize that when people are using these addictive substances they are activating that endocannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system including receptors cb1 are which you don't need to know that for the test or anything but there is a particular receptor in there that represents a necessary contributor towards cellular adaptations in the transition from recreational substance use to a use disorder so when this CB 1 R is activated it causes changes or it facilitates changes in the brain cells in the system that facilitate the move from recreational use to dependence and and tolerance and all those other things the ECS mediated synaptic plasticity may facilitate emotional learning and memory processes in increasing emotional responses to substance related cues basically what that's saying is the enactment endocannabinoid system encourages the brain cells to be a little bit more flexible to be a little bit more receptive and responsive and which facilitates learning when though systems are activated that kind of primes the brain for learning based on memory so now they're in this wide-open situation think about a classroom you know when you create a classroom you want it to create an environment that's conducive to learning so you do certain things in the classroom and you don't do other things in order to make it so most people are comfortable there they have the materials they need to learn they are not distracted the same sort of thing goes on in our brain when our brain has the right environment to learn it is much more receptive to things and the endocannabinoid system facilitates that condition in the brain antagonism which means shutting down locking off turning off whatever you want to say antagonism of that cb1 are receptor reduces alcohol induced sensitization and nicotine relapse so they're finding that CBD may reduce the people from developing tolerance and sensitization to ethanol and it tends to make them less likely to relapse on nicotine CBD is non rewarding it doesn't have the psychogenic properties of THC that is super important to remember especially for people who are in recovery because CBD is not going to get them high it had acts on other receptors in order to facilitate other processes it acts on a number of receptor systems including the opioid system the serotonin system and the cannabinoid system so when people take CBD they are modulating those symptoms systemically administered CBD which means orally or intravenously by a doctor I guess but generally we're talking about oral systemic lis administered CBD regulates mesolimbic dopamine act that's important to know and potentially reduces substance-induced dysregulation so when people take CBD orally it keeps them from having that dopamine spike that may occur when they take substances because when we take substances that dopamine system gets dysregulated it just goes wide open and CBD seems to modulate that a little bit treatment with CBD blocked the rewarding effects of morphine and heroin and prevented drug and stress induced reinstatement of condition place preference lasting up to two weeks post administration so that's really interesting now conditioned place preference why do we care about this when somebody receives a reward receives a stimulus gets that dopamine rush in a particular place that place becomes associated with pleasure in substance abuse counseling we talk about this as you know a trigger being in that place being in a bar or if you you know use heroin when you're at home you know being at home could be a trigger and when people were given to CBD it seemed to block those memories and reduce the preference for certain places that are associated with use which is really awesome so it kind of reduces those urges a little bit and it lasted up to two weeks post administration CBD reduces a lot of different things and as always in this presentation all of the hyperlinks will take you to the Articles that I got this information from just to keep it clean I do the hyperlinks but CBD reduces in most people the overall level of alcohol intake the motivation for ethanol it's keeping them from becoming tolerant to it but it also kind of takes some of the rewarding effects out of it since its modulating that dopamine release it reduces anxiety and impulse which is helpful not only in alcoholism but a whole host of other mood mental health and even neurodegenerative disorders alcohol related to ptosis and fibrosis in the liver is also reduced because CBD reduces lipid accumulation so reduces that fatty liver it stimulates Auto Fei Jie so the liver the body starts eating consuming getting rid of whatever you want to say bad cells and it modulates inflammation we know that alcoholism causes inflammation in the liver and CBD helps modulate or reduce some of that inflammation now this isn't a pass where somebody can take CBD and then drink all they want I don't want them to start thinking that way because the addicted brain will go there but it is interesting to notice that CBD may be able to help reverse a little bit some of the liver damage done by the intake of alcohol CBD also reduces oxidative stress by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells this is again something you're seeing that autophagy oxidative stress is when you have byproducts and residual residues of things that have processes that have happened in your body and they can build up and be toxic which is why the stress part and CBD actually causes some of these cells that have gone a little wonky to be consumed to be gotten rid of it also reduces alcohol-related brain damage preventing neuronal loss by it's antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties okay when people drink one cause of brain damage is due to lack of enough thiamine because alcohol blocks thiamine uptake and results in where Nicky korzak or Korsakoff syndrome CBD doesn't seem to help with that so that's one issue but the other issue is that the ingestion of alcohol leads to systemic inflammation and CBD because of its anti-inflammatory properties does seem to reduce the inflammation and reduce the damage to the brain cells because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes CBD in stimulant disorders CBD has reversed toxicity and seizures induced by cocaine not saying again this is not like taking naltrexone or something that with opioids that is an automatic reversal but they have found that it has helped heal the body some when somebody has used cocaine and had had toxicity or seizures it reverses behavioral sensitization induced by M FET amines and it reduces motivation to self administer cocaine and meth we're speculating again that CBDs function in modulating that dopamine and keeping it from you know going wide open is what reduces motivation to self-administer because the high is just not so good it's just like CBD also increased the extinction of cocaine and amphetamine induced conditioned place preference just like I said on the last slide or the slide before because it is reducing the rewarding say reward salience of those places and of those things then what when it's administered then by administering that you're also reducing the trigger salience you're reducing the urges to go there mechanisms involved in the protective effects of CBD on addiction to psycho stimulant drugs include prevention of drug-induced neuro adaptation hopefully it's preventing by addressing that that receptor it's preventing that neuroplasticity that encourages people to move to problematic use it encourages somehow they don't know how exactly but it does encourage the eraser of aberrant drug memories so it helps with some of those for some people they say it helps with their drug dreams that they have elimination of cognitive deficits induced by psycho stimulant drugs so it helps the brain become a little bit healthier an alleviation of mental disorders that are comorbid with psychostimulant abuse you'll learn in a little while that CBD interacts on opioid serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine systems so it is impactful for just about everything in the DSM for not everything but just about cannabis and mental health disorders anxiety social anxiety depression especially depression related to anxiety when somebody's just stressed out for so long they start to develop this sense of hopelessness and helplessness all of those have shown extreme promise for treatment with CBD CBD has many additional targets within and beyond the an endocannabinoid system it's not just that one system it also activates 5ht which you remember our serotonin receptors adrenal receptors so that's your norepinephrine system and your mu opioid receptors those are your pain receptors your heroin opioid related receptors CBD interestingly has the opposite effect of THC in the prefrontal cortex which is where we have our higher-order thinking and our impulse control and in the amygdala when people take THC a lot of times it increases their respiration it increases their heart rate and it activates their amygdala it activates their stress response system CBD seems to have the opposite effect which is interesting when we get down in a few minutes to talking about the implications of treatment of PTSD with CBD CBD either as a mono therapy or added to regular antipsychotic medication improved symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with promising effects especially in early stages of the illness in terms of garden grown marijuana again it's really important to recognize that THC is a major component of your garden grown cannabis it's really there are special seeds special plants special whatever you call them hybrids that you get theoretically to produce hemp which is where the CBD oil is extracted from so garden grown cannabis may not have the same effects because it does have those higher levels of THC now remember some illnesses some conditions actually respond better to THC but we weren't talking about that in this particular presentation so I left those out but do think about the fact that CBD and THC have some opposing psychological effects in one study I didn't find a whole lot of studies on CBD and PTSD but in one study 91% of patients experienced a decrease in PTSD symptom severity as low as evidenced by lower scores on the pcl5 at 8 weeks post treatment as opposed to their initial baseline well that's pretty encouraging again we want to look at where is this coming from since the PT up since PTSD does involve hyper activation of that amay d'leh and it does involve a lot of those other the serotonin system and other things it seems like the endocannabinoid system specifically CBD helps modulate that and kind of get it back to normal I've used the analogy repeatedly of a warm bath and when people are really anxious angry stressed-out hyper vigilant it's running like running hot water wide open and when they're super calm it's like running cold water wide open and it seems like the CBD gets in there and kind of monkeys with it so it's an adequate not too much as getting through but enough is getting through Alzheimer's and dementia cannabidiol or CBD is a phyto cannabinoid which is helpful as an antioxidant to reduce oxidative stress an anti-inflammatory and an agonist of dopamine and serotonin remember antioxidants we talk about all the time we want antioxidants to prevent aging we want antioxidants to help help fight cancer we want antioxidants to help prevent the degeneration of neural pathways and development of Alzheimer's and dementia so antioxidants not only in food but also in CBD are really helpful at reducing oxidative stress Aunty means getting rid of and oxidant means those ox that oxidative stress we already talked some about CBDs anti-inflammatory properties and then remember agonist means increasing dopamine and serotonin so it increases the dopamine and serotonin systems Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are both characterized by inflammation systemically and oxidative stress CBD is also helpful in patients with epilepsy restless legs and multiple sclerosis now with restless legs that has a a lot to do with dopamine imbalances with epilepsy and multiple sclerosis the CBD generally is used in epilepsy for seizures and in multiple sclerosis for tremors CBD as opposed to THC did not negatively alter cardiovascular parameters body temperature psychomotor or psychological functions nor did it induce a catalepsy or a trance-like or seizure like state like THC does in some people it doesn't put them into this zone it really doesn't have much of a psychogenic effect at all based on his pharmacology CBD may be useful not only in Alzheimer's and dementia but also in other mental health and behavioral conditions that have symptoms such as agitation self-injury anxiety aggression like autism spectrum disorders for example so based on its pharmacology CBD may be useful for reducing agitation anxiety psychosis aggression depression pain plaque formation in the brain and oxidative stress all of those things we work with to some level everyday now CBD is not typically strong enough if you want to use that word to really help a lot with sleep unless the person is having difficulty sleeping because of their anxiety or agitation it may help there now I didn't specifically research CBT and you know sleep or CBD and insomnia but it may be helpful as an adjunctive to what the person is currently doing again CBD interacts as does THC cannabinoids interact with a whole host of medications so it's really important to with your patients if they are going to try it because some are just determined that they want to try that and get off prescriptions or whatever that they do need medical consultation other things that CBD does it helps with pain obviously inflammation is an underlying cause for pain in a lot of people autoimmune to see diseases cause systemic inflammation in the body so when people have something like Crohn's disease or fibromyalgia or you know even diabetes is associated with systemic inflammation depression interestingly enough is correlated with systemic inflammation and I have a video on the YouTube channel on leaky gut and gut health that helps explain you know how depression and stress actually can lead to systemic inflammation and vice versa how systemic inflammation can lead to depression and stress asthma now that's not typically associated with mental health issues so to speak but when people are asthmatic some people have anxiety I know my daughter when she was little she had breathing problems and she was terrified to go very far away from home she was terrified to go out hiking and do fun things because she was afraid she would have an asthma attack so there is a certain amount of agoraphobia or anxiety that can be associated with asthma especially bad asthma but that aside if somebody has asthma they found that CBD is an exceptionally potent bronchodilator so it does help open up those bronchioles so people can breathe easier and osteoporosis interestingly enough that's not really associated with inflammation but I didn't have another slide to put it on as people get older especially women as we get older and our estrogen levels change we become more susceptible to osteoporosis cannabidiol CBD as well as some other cannabinoids stimulate bone growth and may be able to help prevent osteoporosis so that's something to look at again why do we care for a mental health from a mental health perspective well because osteoporosis can be painful bone broken bones broken hips from osteoporosis can be painful and debilitating and as we if we feel ourselves getting more fragile it tends to impair our self-efficacy and impair our our mood and our outlook to answer your question Robert all CBD mixtures are not created equal CBD is not regulated by the FDA with the exception there is one drug that is used to treat seizures in epilepsy that has been fda-approved but anything you get over-the-counter is not regulated by the FDA it is also not supposed to make any claims about being able to cure or treat any diseases additionally if you get your CBD oil from acme calm and you get get it on in June and then you order again in August from Acme com same manufacturer same place same even same size jar you may not get the same potency of CBD there's also a lot of variation between producers in the actual potency of the CBD in the tincture that you're getting or the oil or whatever method you're getting it in so no all CBD products are definitely not created equal and you can't even guarantee that you're getting the same dosage even if you get it from the same supplier every single time do be aware of that it's just like all of the workout supplements and stuff that are on the market there's a lot of loosey goosey nests which is it's very frustrating and it can be very scary additionally the dosage for CBD when you go to one manufacturer they may recommend XYZ dosage you go to another manufacturer they may recommend something you know five ten times higher so the recommended dosage is all over the place or the recommended serving size they can't call it a dosage is all over the place which also means you don't know what potency in many of these studies they were very careful to either not say or give a range of the dosage that they used because you know we don't really know yet since cannabic an avid aisle is so new on the market we don't really know what the appropriate and helpful and therapeutic dosage is yet which is again why you need to get a naturopath or somebody who is very familiar with CBD involved in the process if somebody is going to be taking it so what are some of the adverse effects in toxicity and I note here that all of these symptoms can be seen in people when they take CBD at doses higher than recommended for human consumption but like I said the potency is a little bit loosey-goosey you know between suppliers and the recommended serving size varies dramatically between suppliers so the dose that is quote recommended for human consumption really hasn't been all that well established yet but the FDA has weighed in a little bit but when people take too much they can have developmental toxicity so it can impair physical and cycle development if they are still growing embryo fetal mortality and we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a minute but it actually prevents or inhibit implantation of the embryo and it can cause birth defects central nervous system inhibition so and that's the same as a lot of your depressants it can cause slow to reaction times slow breathing slower heart rate to a very bad place neurotoxicity you're too much of a good thing even though it Fioretti helps regulate a lot of different systems in the brain if you take too much just like anything else it can be toxic hepatocellular which means liver injuries and abnormalities we need to be aware that yes it can't help heal the liver but in doses that are too big it can also overwhelm the lip liver and cause problems itself spermatogenesis reduction so the development or creation of sperm is reduced so that sperm count is gonna go down male reproductive system alterations and it goes into you know the size and weight of testes and other things if you want to read about it the articles in your class hypotension so low blood pressure diarrhea vomiting and fatigue however you know I'm putting that out there so you know that CBD yes it's natural but it also can be harmful just like a lot of other natural things that are out there there are a lot of positive effects if used appropriately and it's important to just be aware and and be cognizant of this and yes Logan the seizure medicine is epidemics CBD adverse effects cannabis and CBD use is rising among pregnant women in one study an estimated 4 to 20 percent of 18 to 24 year old pregnant women were using some form of cannabis products now that included THC as well as CBD but that's a that's a lot of pregnant women CBD inhibits embryo implantation and placenta development remember they need the placenta to get the nutrients in order to develop appropriately and prenatal cannabinoid exposure not just CBD but to any of the cannabinoids potentiates the harmful effects of alcohol increasing the risk of the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and craniofacial malformations and eye defects really important to recognize that not only is CBD potentially harmful to a fetus and cannabinoids potentially harmful to a fetus we know that alcohol is potentially very harmful to a fetus when you put them together they potentiate each other so it's I mean it's even more powerful than like one plus one is two it's like one plus one is six really important that pregnant women are not drinking definitely not drinking and using CBD or cannabinoids or cannabis marijuana concurrently and preferably not using cannabinoids either so let's go down to drug reactions and there's a lot of them remember I told you that CBD interacts with just about every drug on the market hmmm well here you go let's go through this laundry list and talk about why we care the first one is sort of a easy go by guide but it doesn't cover all of them however any of your clients who are taking drugs that have a grapefruit warning on them like boosts per\u00f3n or a lot of the antipsychotics those drugs are metabolized by cyp2d6 which is inhibited by CBD so if they're taking that medication then the metabolization of those drugs may not go the way it's supposed to which means in most cases the drug levels are going to bill up to toxic levels in the system way too quickly so it's really important if there's a grapefruit warning on their drugs not to take CBD that's you know just one of those rules but that warning is not on a lot of medications steroids and corticosteroids are used for things like asthma arthritis and other inflammatory conditions we need to ask people are they taking steroids or corticosteroids when my daughter used to get sick she had she was born with lung problems and so every time she would get sick it would go to her chest and she would either develop bronchitis or pneumonia just like that and she would have to be on a nebulizer in order to reduce the inflammation in her in her lungs sometimes she would even have to take oral steroids if it got that bad why do I bring that up because some of our clients may be you know not taking any drugs at all you know any medications at all taking CBD and then they get sick and they get prescribed steroids or corticosteroids it's important for them to recognize that oh this new medication I'm taking might interact with the CBD that I'm already taking they need to let their prescribing physician or physicians know if they're taking it statins these are the drugs that people take for cholesterol most people I know unfortunately who are over the age of about 50 are on some level of statins and you know we could argue whether they need to be or not statins also have some interesting effects on mood just as a side a side effect but if somebody is taking statins CBD will interact with those CBD interacts with calcium channel blockers those are the medications you take for high blood pressure certainly don't want to be monkeying around with that remember CBD can in high enough doses can cause hypotension so if you're taking medication for your blood pressure to reduce it and then you take CBD with it guess what your blood pressure may go through the floor antihistamines interestingly enough HIV antivirals and immune modulators because the CBD is it's in and of itself a immune system modulator sometimes it works with sometimes it works against the HIV drugs and you know depending on what cocktail the person is on is really important to know the interactions I'll put all three of these together benzodiazepines which are your anti-anxiety medications antipsychotics which is like your seroquel and your house all and antidepressant medications and herbs including things like st. John's wort all interact with the gaba system the serotonin system and/or the dopamine system your antipsychotics typically are responsible for reducing dopamine levels so if somebody is taking CBD which increases dopamine you're kind of working against yourself here antidepressant medications increase serotonin and potentially dopamine and or norepinephrine CBD potentially also increases all three of those and so you may put people into a position where they are at risk of things like serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is deadly if people get too much serotonin it spikes their body temperature and results in tremors vomiting potentially loss of consciousness a lot of really bad stuff and it can happen after just one dose it's not something that has to do that they have to do you know for a week or two weeks or months at a time sometimes we see when we talk about serotonin syndrome a lot of times we're talking about when we're talking about serotonin and serotonin syndrome we're also talking about when people take it with antidepressants when they take two different antidepressants together or they take antidepressants and opioids which actually both increase serotonin or they take antidepressants and this is a favorite one of the teenagers dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant a lot of teenagers for a while don't know if they're still doing it we're taking mega doses of dextromethorphan rectally in order to increase the rate of absorption and the dextromethorphan actually increases serotonin levels and they were some of them were getting so much they were developing serotonin syndrome so serotonin is really nothing to monkey around with if you don't know what you're doing like I said herbs were looking at 5ht as well 5htp as well as st. John's wort anticonvulsant like klonopin or clonazepam beta blockers another thing that is used for blood pressure proton pump inhibitors which are things like zantac and there's one that begins with a P and I can't think of it right now but you take it for stomach acid and even oral diabetic medications any of these all of these interact with CBD and it will affect the amount of circulate that certain amount of that medication circulating in your system or the absorbability or availability of it in some cases it reduces and in other cases it increases the point is to know what what the interactions are now one interesting place you can go is to drugs calm and they have an interaction checker see if I can get it to come up okay so to answer somebody else's question as well as to show you how the drug interaction thing works you put in the medication or medications that the person is taking and then it'll tell you drug interactions for this one it says statins and cannabidiol cannabidiol may cause liver problems and using it with other medications that also affect the liver such as statins may increase the risk of liver damage so that's what that's all about so that you just go to drugs calm or search for drugs calm drug interaction checker and I've used it with a lot of my clients to help them understand the side effects of some of the medications they're taking as well as to check for side effects of the medications they're taking with other things like herbs over-the-counter drugs even alcohol CBD is showing promise as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for a variety of things ranging from Alzheimer's and addiction to Parkinson's and schizophrenia I mean if you go to PubMed and I'll go there in a minute you're gonna find tons of articles in your classroom I think I have in the additional resources section I think I have about 17 articles that I cited in in this presentation there's just a plethora of information and I'm really excited that this is coming out but right now they still don't have good recommendations for dosing and even if they did if you're getting the CBD over-the-counter you can't guarantee that you're actually getting that dosage of CBD in that formulation CBD does not have the psychogenic effects that THC does however THC has been found to be more effective at addressing certain issues over-the-counter CBD is non standardized so dosages even from the same manufacturer but in different Lots may have different potency CBD interacts with most medications so it's vital to consult a physician prior to using it the dosages like I said of CBD in the literature varied widely currently there are a couple of CBD based medications that are FDA approved for the treatment of seizure disorder finally remember that CBD oils may also have traces of THC generally not over 0.3% y'all know one of my favorite things is pubmed and I can never remember the long address for it you just type in pubmed cannabidiol and we'll just do an PTSD and i guess i stumped it because it took a long time you can go over here and you can shorten the window so you only see stuff from the last two years I always have free full text checked because I like to read the actual article not just the abstract and you can set additional filters like species I always have mine checked on humans because I'm not as interested in what it did to the rats but then all of these you can you can look at of somebody asked about cannabidiol and insomnia so let's see proof of concept there so then going with just the abstract that one hasn't been done yet they're talking about what they will do result 72 adults had primary concerns of anxiety and poor sleep anxiety scores decreased in 57 patients and sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients but fluctuated over time and CBD was well tolerated in all but three patients so theoretically this may be something that comes out as a newer intervention that is less harmful to the brain than Anna histamines and some of the barbiturates that are currently available for insomnia something to keep your eye on now all right let's look at let's look for that see if I can find anything on the FDA on CBD yeah yeah potential harm of CBD the FDA really doesn't like CBD they want to tell you about all the scary stuff so right now like I said in the research the dosage a lot of times wasn't even noted but other times it was there was a very wide spectrum of what they were offering for it no the research studies that we looked at or that I looked at did not talk about CBD isolate full-spectrum or broad spectrum we can look at those real quick let's see it appears all of those have THC removed but in the full spectrum and broad spectrum they have some of the other cannabinoids that exist in the marijuana plant in there and you know THC is the psychoactive one so if that's what a lot of the drug tests measure for but each one of the cannabinoids has its own independent properties and usefulness and things so I can see why some people would look for a broad spectrum CBD in order to get as much benefit an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as possible without the THC but you notice neither NIDA nor stomps I had anything about that on them what isn't interestingly it appears this article on the National Institute of drug abuse is quite positive about the potential promise of cannabidiol for therapeutic use so I'll put that in here for you guys to read in-depth let me answer your question Logan let's see yes I would say Logan the I mean anything with dextromethorphan that is being taken in addition to a CBD can't have a potentiation effect and the triple triple sees themselves or dextromethorphan alone can cause can in high enough doses can lead to serotonin syndrome so it is that is one of those things that can be really scary oops No oh hush here is a video I did do on serotonin syndrome if you're in Florida and you need medical error prevention you can get CEUs for it but if you don't care about that then you know just watch the video if you're interested in learning more about serotonin syndrome and what the symptoms are are there any other questions I've really enjoyed all your questions about CBD I am still learning about it obviously along with you guys but I was I really enjoyed going through the research and yes I saw somebody else commenting I'm not sure where you're seeing the ads at there shouldn't be any ads during the during the class but unfortunately Google is creepy aware of what you do I swear sometimes they just hear what I'm saying and I'm not even looking online and I start getting fed ads about it so you probably will start seeing some ads about CBD oil one thing you can do if you want to there are some free open-source ad blocker programs my husband has them on his computer because he really hates ads to no end but you can also install those if ads bother you I usually just kind of ignore them but they are distracting for some people alrighty everybody if you have any other questions please feel free to email me at support at all CEUs com otherwise I will see you on

you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys

Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "_cto3i1mVkk": "STATEHOUSE HEARD EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY ON A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO ISSUE ID NUMBERS AND BAR CODE CARDS TO HOOSIERS ON THE STATE REGISTRY TO USE CBD OIL.

junkie plan so onto the video [Music] [Applause] so today I'm going to be talking about one of my favorite things and that's educational skincare facts and we don't smoke weed every day just kidding I'm going to be talking about CBD oil what it is if it's even legal why isn't skincare all that kind of [ __ ] if you've been in touch with the skincare community at all lately you will see that CBD oil in products is huge right now everyone seems to be jumping on the bandwagon of CBD oil and I kind of want it so you know break it down to you guys tell you what it is what it does for the skin if it's even [ __ ] legal so what is CBD oil CBD oil stands for cannabidiol oil I I think that's how you pronounce it but honestly if you've watched my videos before you know that I can suck at pronunciation so we're just we're just gonna go with that a lot of companies have been coming out with CBD oil in their products like heels than their cannabis oil Peter Thomas Roth and their cannabis serum and mass milk makeup and their cannabis infused mascara all different kinds of products and for me when I saw these products I'm like yeah you know like 420 but like what why is it in this stuff like why so after doing a lot of research into like such confusing realms of science that my brain was not made to understand I'm going to try to break this down as simply as possible so that it's you know not boring as [ __ ] and it could be somewhat informative to you guys now I know for me when I started learning about CBD url I was like wait isn't this the same thing as like hemp and like what's the difference and I came to find out that there's a huge difference so let me first explain the difference between CBD and hemp so basically CBD is a can avoid what is a can't avoid a can't avoid is something that our body naturally creates to help regulate our sleep patterns our mental patterns our skin digestion and even our memory now cannabinoids or CBD can also be found in cannabis plants and although this is kind of a different form from the kinds our body creates when we ingest it or apply it topically we can see a plethora of really good benefits for our skin from studies they found that cannabinoids are really rich in vitamin A C and E which if you don't know what those vitamins are they're really good for anti aging abilities soothing redness getting rid of sun damage basically everything that we you know like what in our skin and even better than that a few studies have shown that there are very little risks when it comes to applying CBD oil topically to the skin now what is hemp hemp is a different ingredient that's also sourced from the cannabis plant but in a different way and I'm not going to go through all the scientific like processes of how that's done because when I was reading about it my eyes like starting to glaze over and I felt like I was actually high while reading it because that stuff is so confusing but and basically has different purposes than that it balances oil production within the skin it Sue's redness and inflammation and it treats atopic dermatitis does this still have good skincare benefits absolutely but they're a little different from CBD oil and the way that I would describe it is that CBD oil is much more concentrated and has many more benefits than hemp oil now to be clear CBD oil is not marijuana okay so you can't like figure out a way to roll this oil in a blunt just being honest although that's an expensive way to smoke some weed I am already watching this video be coming to monetize it's super confusing but basically CBD oil is extracted from hemp another strain of the cannabis plant if you can interpret that I will give you this YouTube videos monetary earnings which are nothing now the big question is CBD oil even legal to have in skincare and honestly the answer is a bit confusing my eyes are so red it's almost like I've been smoking which I haven't been no I haven't been it's the [ __ ] light they're too bright so up until a few months ago CBD oil was technically classified as legal due to like anti medical marijuana laws in a lot of states why was it illegal well it was kind of complicated because hemp oil was legalized but THC was not legalized and CBD oil kind of falls right in the middle because it's extracted from hemp but it also has THC qualities for the skin now the good thing is that a few months ago Trump yes I am actually talking positively about Trump on my channel Buddha thought Donald Trump have made hemp oil legal in all 50 states and the exact words were feds have removed all restrictions on the sale transport or possession of hemp derived products produced in a manner consistent with the law now just this legalized marijuana or a little like THC no but it did present an opportunity for companies to have easier access to putting CBD oil in their products and once this happened everyone can jumped on the bandwagon so overall yes CBD oil at this point is pretty much legal you're not gonna see a lot of legal restrictions because of the legalization of hemp oil so much politics oh my gosh anyway moving on from the politics when it comes to CBD oil and hemp oil there are a lot of like fact versus fiction you know confusion that's there while certain studies have proved the benefits of CBD oil it is such a new thing to the industry and because marijuana was a long time considered like an illegal substance that couldn't be consumed not many studies were done on the potential benefits of the drug itself not drug plant now CBD oil hasn't been approved by the FDA which FDA does not mean everything but it's pretty much the most comprehensive way of proving whether or not including it is safe for us or not so because so few studies have been conducted it's really difficult to like fully trust companies on what they say CBD oil can do for a long time it's been praised as like the [ __ ] like miracle plant of all plants which you know I'm all for it but like jeez some people are going like all out now the benefits that I was speaking of before with CBD oil have been proven in studies but there's a lot of other benefits that companies will claim CBD oil has which aren't technically like a hundred percent proven so when it comes to purchasing CBD oil I would be cautious I think it's good to like try new things and see what works for your skin but also like don't put a hundred percent of your belief into it because we still don't know a lot about the ingredient it's good to be cautious when it comes to skin I hope this is all making sense because honestly when I was learning about all of this I was confused though yeah now for my favorite part my favorite CBD oil products that I have found on the market no I will say because a lot of these products are so brand new I haven't had the opportunity to try them out on my face but judging from the ingredient list and the powerful ingredients that have been included in these products I can kind of tell which ones that I would want to use and which ones I wouldn't want to use but I'm just gonna be going through my favorites in this video because possibly it's gonna be only no negativity needed now my personal favorite products would have to be the herbivore this which well the herbivore emerald oil now the reason is is because this includes a high concentration of CBD oil but it also has beneficial ingredients like ashwagandha which is a mushroom that helps like calm down your skin Wow we are on weed and mushrooms in this video oh my God look at where we're coming as a society and other abductions or mushrooms to help soothe the skin and calm skin down as well as really powerful antioxidant oils I think this part is just such a great example of what powerful soothing ingredients you can put in one single oil for the face in addition to that I am loving the Peter Thomas Roth cannabis oil that they recently just came out with I think that one has great ingredients and I really love that it doesn't have fragrance and just a strong concentration of cannabinoids in the product as more and more products come out I will be sure to do reviews and see what I think of them but for now from what I'm seeing those are my top two favorites as a final stay for all of this I think CBD oil has some potentially great beneficial aspects for the skin and I think it's a good idea to try some out and see how your skin responds to it but I also think it's a good idea to not believe everything that you hear about it to take as much caution for CBD oil products as you would for any other skin care product and just to you know try things out safely anyway that's all I have for this video if you guys liked it please leave a comment

about 65 kids in the world diagnosed with us they don't fully understand the ramifications Helen but it is epilepsy is a huge component of the disorder Kalin his mother says he started having seizures at about 17 months old and mom was right here from there began having seventy to a hundred of them each day also causing him to become nonverbal those would also knock him down and kind of he would sleep the rest of the day things began to change though once the family got their first dose of CBD oil back in June and has been seizure-free since starting that medication and this past Christmas we went to see Santa what did Santa say moments like these that the AYGO say might have never been possible had they not picked up the phone compassionate cultivation this is Rhiannon families like the

the recent federal farm bill industrial hemp production will be made not only legal but cheaper it will also be managed by the Department of Agriculture as a crop Denton says compassionate cultivation goes through a very thorough process to make sure patients get nothing less than the best form of CBD oil and hopes there are steps done to make sure all organizations are doing the same and he's not alone will that make regulation so we'll have to inspect test make sure that it's not you know contaminated with too much THC Commissioner Miller was very outspoken about the farm bills passing but solely for the sake of helping Texas farmers and families like the Hegel's let me just make this very plain this is not backdoor you know to grow in weed or marijuana that's not what this is this is about producing a lot of products over 2,500 products made from him the one that that's the hottest right now and people are most interested in is medicinal uses like CBD or but while the Eagles have been met with challenges that perhaps most families haven't had to face parents Chad and CJ say they're proud of everything they've built together childproof gates locks and all Apple up see can can

disorders and dogs and potentially save their lives few things are more heart-wrenching than watching a beloved dog gripped by a seizure most pass quickly without lasting harm but multiple seizures in a short period of time can damage a dog's brain Alexa Ram Ford told me her dog jigsaw has suffered seizures for two years he will fall over on his side and start convulsing is a very violent thing that they go through about five percent of dogs have epilepsy it's usually an inherited condition but the exact cause is unknown left untreated it can limit a dog's life even cause death they will either be euthanized early because of the seizures or because of the medication side effects I traveled to Colorado State University to meet with dr. Stephanie McGrath she's doing a groundbreaking study to assess the use of cannabis oil or CBD for dogs with epilepsy for many years now people have used CBD in Colorado a state where recreational marijuana use is legal people were using it for themselves for you know their their various different ailments and so they felt that potentially it would be something that they could use with their dog dr. McGrath launched her CBD pilot study was 16 dogs nine of the dogs were given CBD which has a trace amount of THC the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana the results were remarkable about 90 percent of the dogs in the treatment group had a reduction in seizure activity as compared to 43 percent in the control group like humans CBD works on brain receptors and dogs it's somehow alters brain chemistry to reduce the chance of a seizure but exactly how and why it works remains a mystery there's some theories but we don't know how it works but Alexa knows it's helped jigsaw he's now part of

"PeR_k54Q_cQ": "[Music] hey everyone I'm not and I'm Val and we are the product reviewers from yoga lifestyles today we are reviewing Vita essentials hemp selves okay so in this video we'll go over what is it what it's not what its uses are for price point and who it might be best for all right so hemp oil you've heard a lot about hemp oil right I have I just I've never used it yes I haven't used it until now I've seen hemp in products like handbags and clothes and basically what my is an extract from the hemp plant and it's been used to treat muscle soreness and help with digestion and a bunch of other really cool things other than clothing so one thing that hemp oil is not is it doesn't have all right so first of all when you think of hemp what's the first thing that comes to your mind full disclosure so the thing is with hemp oil there is no THC in it right so THC is the mind-altering drug that gets you high if you smoke marijuana and there is no THC in hemp oil and in vena's hemp oil as well inside you'll find arnica comfrey ginger and violet infused extra virgin olive oil beeswax camphor grapefruit peel Cypress lavender lavender wild mint Burger moment pen Royal peppermint basil sweet marjoram tur Pence's hemp extract all right so there's an asterisk next to a quite a few of these ingredients and the asterisk means organic all right so if you guys are familiar with bengay or icy hot after I workout I just love slathering it on it's disgusting I would bathe in it if I could I was okay with that until until now but basically it helps soothe your sore muscles by helping with the blood circulation and things like that but it smells awful and there's tons of really gross ingredients in it and a bunch of toxic stuff that you can't pronounce everything in here you can pronounce and I've tried it and it works so with bengay what it does it creates kind of like a cooling sensation this creates almost like a warming sensation and it smells amazing so I you can see I've already used a little bit here but if you just kind of take it on your finger so you just need a little bit a little goes a long way so if you want to smell it it smells awesome it's super moisturizing you can use it on your your elbows your sore muscles like I definitely like to use it on my shoulders and all my lower back too if you have lower back pain this is awesome for that because it really helps soothe and relax the muscles what it does it helps the blood flow increase there's peppermint in there also that helps with blood flow so that the muscle can relax and focus on healing so that's that's what I really love about that and definitely smell the peppermint and it's almost wants to go lip balm ya know it's like a lip balm that has a lip balm consistency and you'll see it's very moisturizing it absorbs right into your skin so it's not like super oily like a lot of the other stuff so that's another reason why I love it in this 2 ounce jar what is our price point what are we looking at for this Val so on Amazon it's currently $24.99 $24.99 awesome alright so who would this hemp self be best for honestly it's great for anyone who's super active goes to the gym a lot maybe you're a runner or if you have lower back pain this really helps soothe and relieve that pain temporarily and also if you're just looking for an all-natural product that will help with that pain relief so if you like bengay or icy hot or any of the other pain relieving lotions but you just you hate the smell it's disgusting this is a great natural alternative for that and you'll see like it's it's not super oily it's moisturizing its pleasant but be sure anytime introduced anything on or into your body to please check with your doctor first so if you guys have anything that you

Today, we're taking a look at the 2500 milligram\nCBD oil from American Hemp. The Internet's been buzzing about CBD's positive\nhealth benefits for years now. I was curious? Could it improve my sleep? To find out, I tested American Hemp's oil\nfor two weeks. Ya'll, I thought I knew what it was going\nto feel like, but I was genuinely surprised by the results. Curious to know what they are? Well, then you'd better keep watching. [background music] Cody: American Hemp was founded in 2016 by\na group of CBD enthusiasts who wanted to share the benefits of cannabidiol with the world. Nowadays, the Florida-based company sells\na ton of different CBD products including oils, creams, gel capsules, and even CBD oil\nfor pets. Since I work for a sleep website, I asked\nthe folks at American Hemp to hook me up with the product they thought would lull me to\nsleep the fastest, which is why they hooked me up with the 2500 milligram CBD oil. First things first, what the [beep] is CBD? Well, CBD or cannabidiol is one of 100 different\ncompounds of phytocannabinoids contained within the flower of the cannabis plant, the most\npopular of which is tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Unlike its trippy-dippy sister THC, CBD is\nnot psychoactive. I repeat, CBD does not trigger hallucinations,\nintoxication, or any other stereotypically stony side-effects. Instead, CBD is often contained in oils, creams,\nand lotions to treat everything from joint pain to anxiety, loss of appetite -- and yes,\neven poor sleep. I should also mention that hemp-derived CBD\nis totally legal to buy and consume in all 50 states. Though the studies done into the side-effects\nof CBD are scarce, the research that does exist supports it as a totally safe and well-tolerated\ncompound. A comprehensive study from 2010, which aggregated\ndata from numerous studies, found CBD to be non-toxic and safe up to doses of 1500 milligrams\nper day. A 2017 study, which sought to add information\nto that survey, further found that CBD was not only safe for chronic long-term use, but\nactually had a better side effect profile than other drugs when treating certain medical\nconditions, such as epilepsy and psychotic disorders. American Hemp uses 100 percent natural CBD\nderived from industrial hemp to create its oil. I should also add that all of its products\nare third-party tested, which means that scientists unaffiliated with American Hemp have approved\nthe products for sale and consumption. Now that I've gone over the brand and dug\ninto the ingredients, it's time to talk about my experience with this product. The 2500 milligram CBD oil from American Hemp\nis the brand's highest quality oil and it retails for $140. According to the company, one dropper of this\noil contains about 15 drops or 83 milligrams of active CBD. To use, all you have to do is place the drops\nunder your tongue, hold for 15 seconds, and then swallow. [background music] Cody: If you're familiar with CBD, the number\n83 may have stuck out to you because that is a really high dosage of CBD. Most CBD products on the market, be it gummies\nor cream, usually have between 20 to 40 milligrams per serving. This is a really high dosage. Remember, that if you're less tolerant, or\njust trying CBD out for the first time, you can take half a dropper, or you can take a\nquarter dropper. You don't have to take the full thing. In fact, I encourage you to experiment around\nto find the dosage that's going to right for you. I'm 6 feet tall, 165 pounds and already pretty\nfamiliar with CBD. I went ahead and took the entire dropper each\nnight for two weeks before bed. When I talk about my experience, I'm going\nto break it down into three sections -- falling asleep, staying asleep and the morning after. Before I get into that, I do have one last\nthing to say, which is though my pronunciation of tetrahydrocannabinol [ring sound] is flawless,\nI'm not a doctor. All my thoughts are personal and specific\nto me, and may differ from your own experiences. That being said, if you're trying out CBD\nfor the first time or just looking for a new sleep regime, I highly recommend that you\nconsult with a medical professional before you do so. Let's get into my experience starting with\nwhat it felt like to fall asleep using the American Hemp CBD oil. Falling asleep is a huge problem for me, because\nas soon as my head hits the pillow my mind is racing with a ton of competing thoughts. Whenever, I'm looking at sleep supplements,\nor CBD oil, a really important factor for me is how well does it quiet those thoughts\nand allow me to fall asleep. I've got to say that this oil was fantastic\nat helping me to fall asleep. When I took the drops, I took it as recommended. I put 15 drops under my tongue, held it for\n15 seconds, and then swallowed. Within 10 minutes, I felt totally relaxed. My shoulders were relaxing. My mind was quieting down. The world was in a sort of... [background music] Cody: ...beautiful rosy fuzziness. I felt totally zenned out. I wouldn't say that the oil knocked me out,\nper se, but it got me into a really nice state of relaxation which made it totally easy to\nfall asleep. Staying asleep is another huge problem for\nme. Typically, I'm up every night at 2:00 AM or\n3:00 AM, throwing myself a private dance party in my room, pacing the floors and thinking\nabout all my past regrets. When I'm looking at a supplement, I'm also\nreally curious to see if it's going to help me stay asleep all night long. While the American Hemp oil helped me fall\nasleep, I can't really say that it helped me stay asleep. The effects wore off in about an hour or two. I still found that I was waking up in the\nmiddle of the night. If you're like me, and you have a lot issues\nstaying asleep, I'm not sure I would totally recommend this CBD oil for that. Normally, when I take sleep supplements or\nCBD oil, I feel super groggy the next day. I'm really happy to report that the CBD oil\nfrom American Hemp didn't make me feel groggy at all. I woke up feeling clear-eyed and ready to\ngo, which I think is a huge plus for this product. [background music] Cody: Now that we've gone over my entire experience,\nlet's break it down into a few general pros and cons for this product, starting with the\npros. First things first, I love that this is all\nnatural, which makes me feel really good about taking it. I also love that the oil helped me to fall\nasleep super-fast. Within 10 minutes of taking it, my body felt\nreally relaxed. I felt totally zen and ready to sleep. Thirdly, I didn't experience any morning hangovers. I was able to get up and get started with\nmy day. Unfortunately, there are a couple of cons. Number one, the CBD oil is quite expensive. Again, one vial of this costs $140, which\nis a pretty penny. Keep in mind that most CBD oils do cost between\n$140 and $240. It's really more about CBD oil in general\nand not necessarily about this specific product. Number two, it didn't really help me to stay\nasleep at night. The effects wore off in about an hour or two. I found that I was waking up in the middle\nof the night most nights. All right, folks, that does it for my review\nof the 2500 milligram CBD oil from American Hemp.

Until next time, happy dreaming.", "_knJDER3PkE": "True or false. CBD is the same as marijuana. [Rachel} That's Correct.\nIt's false, Yes. Cannabis is the genus of a plant it's the category of plant. Under cannabis you have marijuana and hemp plants. Okay? The difference, they look the same by the way they smell the same. Right. But the difference between these two plants is the amount of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol now this is the active ingredient in marijuana that's what is the psychoactive ingredient. But you typically know when you think of marijuana you think that people are getting high that's the psychoactive ingredient. The difference is that if a plant has 0.3% or less by dry weight, it is considered to be hemp plant. Correct. If it has more than 0.3% by dry weight it is considered to be marijuana. So that's, right away, the definition. CBD is a cannabinoid. There are lots of cannabinoids that have a lot of active properties in our body. Our body produces endo-cannabinoids which are naturally occurring. Here on the screen you see two different things. To the left is THC. These have the same number of atoms. The same type of atoms, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But, the reason why we highlighted this structure is different. And this is what makes the big difference between THC which is psychoactive and CBD, which is not psychoactive. When the chemical binds to the receptor that structural difference will make something happen different in the body. Right. So that is the difference between THC and CBD. And CBD. Very important, okay? CBD, if it is taken exclusively solely from the hemp plant, it is legal. It is allowed in all 50 states. However, if the CBD is taken from the marijuana plant or it's partially taken from the marijuana plant it depends on the state. As to whether or not they allow it to be legal. As to whether or not it's legal, right. CBD comes in all types of products. When you go to the store, you're gonna see it in all different ways. And I want to kind of guide you through how to choose what you want. Here are some examples of things that you might find. And there are more than this, by the way. But this is a bath powder. So people put these into their bath they dissolve it into their bath.\nI've actually never seen it in bath powder. But I think that that makes sense.\nYeah. Because people soak to relieve pain and inflammation as well.\n100% Right. So it gets into your skin and it give you that soft tissue relief that you're looking for. Lots of lotions out there. So you go to a lot of these beauty stores and cosmetic stores, they have it in the lotions or some of the pharmacies.\nI use a balm. It's like a very thick.\nRight. Dense balm. That's right, so it's thick sometimes, like a salve or it's like a nice thin lotions so they're all different types depending on what you want to get out of it. There are capsules that you can take. Yup. Then you mentioned earlier for Isabu they're tinctures. You have the little dropper and it tells you how much to take and you put on your tongue, boom that's it. And then, this is what I wanted to talk to you about. A pain rub. So this is a freeze right here. This is not about the CBD, by the way that is a primary ingredient but it's about other components. So, the question is, you need to be able to get the CBD and the pain relief chemical into your skin. Right. So it depends on else the manufacturer puts in there to help it seep into the skin. The first thing, is you want to be very clear that it actually says CBD. CBD.\nPeriod. Because, that's right. CBD, it's gotta say that, number one. Number two. So you want to look to see what it says about THC. THC free.\nThis is THC free, very good. The other thing is, you want to make sure it tells you what type of CBD it is. This is very important, pay attention. So here, it says pure isolate. What that means is that the product is 99.9% CBD. It's as pure as you can get it. So it doesn't have any THC. But there's also something called broad spectrum. Broad spectrum means that not only does it have CBD, it has the other cannabinoids I mentioned before. Right. Other good chemicals for you. It's broad spectrum. And lastly, there's something that's called full spectrum. This is where you have to pay attention. Full spectrum means it actually has THC. Okay? So, when you see isolate, that's pure CBD. When you see broad spectrum it's other cannabinoids but still no THC. When you see full spectrum It includes the THC.\nIt includes the THC. Please look at the ingredient list. Because you want to know actually what's in there. So make sure you do that. And lastly, make sure it tells you how many milligrams are on here. Right?\nAnd that's where you get that huge price discrepancy. Ah, there you go.\nThat's right. There you go. So, if the price looks too good to be true. It is.\nIt is. (laughs)\nIt ain't true. Because CBD cost money and so if you want high quality I'm not saying you have to break the bank on it. And it's buyer beware. Yes.\nLike, you really do have to study up on this. You can't just dive in. Please. And the last thing I want to say. (crowd claps) The last thing I want to say is this. A lot of these products have a QR code on it. And you can take your phone and put it up and look at the certificate of analysis. Make sure that the product has been third party tested. Which means they've sent it out to a third party lab to test to make sure it has what is says it has and doesn't have, which you don't want. That's so true of every supplement and vitamin. (crowd cheers) (crowd claps) (bells chime)", "W8eOkNvE9Gg": "[Music] hi everybody dr. mark here in this video I want to talk a little bit about cannabis but more specifically talk about one of its chemical components that we term CBD also known as cannabidiol now the reason why I'm doing this video is because there's a lot of talk at the moment mainly online about the potential therapeutic benefits of certain components of cannabis such as CBD so what I've done is I've evaluated the evidence within the scientific literature and I'm going to talk about what it may be beneficial for and what the evidence does not suggest it's beneficial for at all so first thing is that cannabis also known as marijuana has around about 400 different chemicals inside of it and of these 400 chemicals 120 or what we term cannabinoids now the term cannabinoids because they bind to specific receptors in our body that are termed cannabinoid receptors and this endocannabinoid system that we have within our body plays a number of a multitude of different roles such as involved in sleep-wake cycles mood appetite pain memory a whole bunch of different things okay and so a hundred twenty chemicals within cannabis has been shown to bind to these receptors and have a variety of effects depending on what subtype of receptor it's bound to now of these 120 cannabinoids you've probably heard of these two THC and CBD they're the two most abundant and you'll find that THC is tetrahydrocannabinol and that is the psychoactive component and CBD which is cannabidiol is the non psychoactive component probably to be more specific you would say that THC gives you that high and is intoxicating and that CBD does not give you that high and is not intoxicating alright you've probably heard a CBD being taken as an oil that's probably the most common way that individuals take CBD but what I want to talk about is what does the literature state about its therapeutic use alright first thing is this the evidence demonstrates this again I'm just talking about CBD I'm not talking about cannabis as a whole whether it be smoked or vaporized or whatever it may be I'm just talking CBD as a chemical first line of evidence suggests within the literature that it is beneficial for childhood seizures not just any childhood seizures but severe childhood seizures that often fit under these two categories of gervais syndrome and lennox-gastaut syndrome now these two types of seizures disorders are severe and are within children and CBD has been shown to be beneficial for these seizures so they've actually turned CBD into a drug a medication that can be taken and therefore there is a therapeutic benefit for these particular syndromes it's also been shown to be beneficial for chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting and also for anorexia associated with HIV so there's a tick there that CBD has been beneficial for those particular disorders now the range of effects downstream that a lot of other people are talking about is that for pain and inflammation neurodegeneration cancer and anxiety and depression let's talk about these firstly chronic pain so we know that cannabinoids or cannabinoid receptors when stimulated can play a role in pain and pain management however what we find is that the current studies looking at the role of CBD and chronic pain the evidence is quite poor that it's beneficial okay so it's not strong at all there's animal models and what we call in vitro in dish models which show that there's some benefit and influencing or mitigating pain but unfortunately the evidence for humans is not that strong for its use in chronic pain we need more human studies more clinical trials what about for anti-inflammation well again the animal models and the in vitro work is promising that it does play a role in anti-inflammation as an anti-inflammatory agent but again we need more human clinical trials to state where the CBD is actually beneficial for inflammation what about neuro degeneration here I'm talking about Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease again the models are promised thing that it may have some benefit but again more human studies are required you may be sitting there thinking oh god what are you on about this is what we need when you take a drug that helps you it only helps you because it's been proven multiple times within clinical trials okay required cancer in actual fact there's no evidence to support that it's beneficial in the treatment of cancers okay and the last one which I haven't popped down here is that for anxiety and depression there is some evidence out there some tentative evidence to suggest that it may be beneficial for treating anxiety and sleep disorders potentially depression but again we need more controlled clinical trials so at the moment the evidence suggests that CBD is beneficial for severe childhood seizures specifically of these particular types of syndromes and chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting but the evidence is poor for everything else that is the current evidence for CBD", "4ixxyByF2zE": "hi hi hi today's video is a little different little different best CBD oils my favorite so far of 2020 if you're new to this channel what I do is I buy CD products for full price I send them to a lab to see if they're real well as of 2020 this year I send every product to two labs for blind testing why blind test products can you be so obtuse did you call me obtuse CBD products why can't we just trust blindly trust CBD companies and allow them to send whatever they went to a lab that they pay a lot of money to throw out any bad results and only post the good ones and then sell you crap I tested over 80 products over the course of a year without any sponsorship or affiliation but full disclosure this month for the first time I have added affiliate links to CBD examine calm to help pay for the products and lab tests product in lab tests are super super expensive and that's how we're gonna continue to pay for these lab tests well that's where I see things just a little differently contractor no I will not bow to any sponsor I did feel dirty adding the affiliate links to CBD examine calm though almost all review websites work with affiliate links or sponsorships of some sort but it felt dirty right it's like people only do things because they get paid and that's just really sad nothing will change on my website all new products will be purchased for retail price the CBD companies can't send me anything I need to buy them sent to two different labs for blind testing and the official reports of course will be available on each review the process all documented for your eyeballs and I will still be the same jerk that gives critical reviews but this following list was picked last week when I was still innocent pure and poor so after 80 product reviews here are eight of my favorite and these will probably change because I just sent fifty more products to a lab so hit that subscribe button to see more soon I'm gonna go over these super quick and you can just hit the link below to see all the full reviews the official lab tests or watch the YouTube videos on each one number eight oh Jesus look at that beautiful face okay this one needs an update someone lost their job back when Sun soil was called Green Mountain because they didn't know that full-spectrum products contain THC drug test look for THC when I did my review last year I thought that their their lab results could be a little more clear but they fix that issue since their lab results are now very clear I still think CBD companies should do a little more to warn people about THC and drug tests but that's a whole nother problem because if they put the appropriate warning on them certain government employees will flag them in mistake totally legal hemp for marijuana because the government the government in this tone is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently anyway back to us on soil here it's super cheap 30 bucks 600 milligrams of CBD our lab test found it was incredibly accurate on CBD trace levels of THC and lots of other cannabinoids the taste was not bad it's good for all the cannabinoids and the mint chocolate taste helps the natural flavor out a bit but it is a natural taste and it is a good full spectrum so that tastes a little like hemp EMP chocolate so if you don't like the taste of hemp move along just choose a different one if you want the cheapest full-spectrum USDA Organic CBD I think you found it five cents per milligram of CBD is incredibly cheap at only $30 numero seven cheap and trusted and that's not just a CBD company I tested Garden of life's 10 milligram in 20 milligram formulas that's two labs for lab tests dive in links below the $50 30 milligram formula that's 900 milligrams total came in at 5 cents flat cheap he's also taste excellent it's peppermint and orange zest it's really good both are labeled as broad-spectrum so it should have CBD other cannabinoids but no THC nope our labs found that they're basically just a CBD oil which is typical of broad spectrums nothing else most broad spectrum suck I like this as a pure CBD but really if you want other cannabinoids just go with a full spectrum instead of a broad spectrum this one has some essential oils added peppermint frankincense I guess you might be able to say entourage effect I give it to them because almost every broad-spectrum extract I've tasted is pure CBD and other cannabinoids are usually so low that they don't matter in these broad spectrums it's still a great deal for pure CBD and you're getting garden of life they've been around for 20 years and they're a great company I do like that their CBD is formulated by dr. Perlmutter you know grain brain I know it's probably BS he probably just tasted it and was like taste good and they were like okay good because we're gonna say you formulated it on the package and pay you a bunch of money you think that dude is in a lab formulating products probably on some yacht drinking herbal tea or something weird I would think brain maker that was a good book too okay on to number six most trusted brand bar liens our lab tests found this 1125 milligram bottle a full spectrum 70 bucks is a good full spectrum extract you've got CBD THC and good amounts of other cannabinoids like CBC and CBG by the way you guys I know uh people claim a certain CBD oil will be good for specific conditions we don't have enough research to suggest that these cannabinoids change everything I post the cannabinoid profile on every review you might like a lot of THC someone else may have negative effects from tea see you might find that cbc helps you someone else might just like pure CBD you really just got to try a few look at the cannabinoids when you find one you like they affect everyone differently under six cents per milligram great price I really like bar leans they've been around for thirty years and you really can't find anything bad about them well except I did find one thing bad the Center for Food Safety gave them a bad score for CBD testing which was complete [ __ ] that was my December 2019 update and my June 2020 update showed that the Center for Food Safety changed their score to an a stupid government I can say that now that I don't work for the government they were rating CBD companies on testing and transparency without testing anything I know I know and that's why you're here watching a completely insane person sense CBD to labs in California instead of putting your faith in the government yeah I was a government employee but don't don't hold that against me number five most loved CBD company this one is hard to argue with if I wasn't so cheap they would probably be my number one of everything they made the famous strange Charlotte's Web named after Charlotte Figi dr. Sanjay Gupta I don't think I said that right dr. Sanjay Gupta dr. Sanjay had a documentary that featured Charlotte and CBD and that really started the whole CBD movement you can trust dr. Sanjay because cannabis radar ranked him the number one CBD influencer of all time who's that clean-shaven baby face right there that's number two influencer in the world Charlotte's Web played a huge part and the legalization of hemp and I don't know if hemp would be legal today if it wasn't for this company probably not just don't say anything bad about them on the internet their followers really are passionate about them and will email you here's the here's the bad thing I said I really didn't like that the front of their bottle used to say hemp extract that's a [ __ ] term people confuse it with CBD it's not but I always gave him a little bit of slack because they were one of the first maybe the first to navigate the CBD world when you couldn't say CBD for legal reasons on the bottle they started this made CBD products before sea but he was legal then they helped make CBD illegal gangsters only halfway joking about the gangster part what they did was incredible and pretty pretty gangster now their labels are all updated and specific which I like because that's what I look for at CBD examine calm honest labeling our lab testing found that they make a good full spectrum extract even really need me to tell you that they're famous for that they have research on their company the only complaint I have is that they are on the expensive side their $30 bottle that's a new price is about 13 cents per milligram of CBD 15 cents is average but average to me is expensive I'm cheap you know that but if you're willing to buy their more potent formulas you can get a great deal they're 60 milligrams formula goes down to four point six cents per milligram of CBD if you're willing to shell out 275 bucks yeah so I would say go big or don't go at all but you really can't put a price on a specific strain grown by one company that's helped more people than any other CBD company and by more people I mean that they are the largest CBD company with by far the most reviews quantity a positive reviews number for re botanicals this is the first brand to receive a USDA Organic cert it's small but the founder was also the founder of Nu Teva the giant hemp super food brand that people seem to really like our lab tests found that re botanicals makes a well rounded full spectrum extract their new prices are between seven cents and nine cents per milligram of CBD average is 15 cents so good well great value for organic B first USDA Organic I use their role on peppermint CBD oil a lot this one smells so damn good I'm cheap but that smell gets me every time I like it put it on your temples relax a little bit number three best pure CBD med Tara matera is one of the first CBD companies to win a mainstream retail contract you can find them in CVS yeah there's a yeah there's a theme here I like well-respected companies that have pushed the CBD movement forward mainstream in this case by the way they reduce the price of thirty five bucks it seems like all CBD companies are getting cheaper right now I need to update those prices I bought before because they're dropping especially in the last few months in light of a certain shutdown of the economy not sure how that makes CBD cheaper but it has met Tara is nice for people that don't want th see our lab tests found that this is just clean CBD oil nothing else not even CBD V just CBD and they don't make any THC products so this is good for anyone who can't have THC in their system and doesn't want the chance of the product that the product might get mixed up with a THC product or somebody might look at them differently for having a CBD product with THC this doesn't have it this is the one that I recommend to my firefighter friends that can't have THC or shouldn't if I was still a government employee this is what I would pick up and if you have a soul-sucking job where you also get tested for THC met Tara's great I have a full video on CBD and drug testing there's a caveat a bad test is still in use today but for the most part pure CB means that you'll have no problem with drug test that tests for THC their new price brings this down to six cents per milligram of CBD excellent I've tested some that are over thirty cents six cents is great pure CBD has no taste so this has no flavor no weird hemp flavor I like med Terra but if you do want THC look out for Lazarus number two cheapest CBD on earth Lazarus Naturals now in the Bible I didn't read it but I do have Wikipedia Lazarus died and Jesus brought him back to life so when I was deathly ill from a hangover I thought maybe using Lazarus I could come back to life I'm not gonna make medical claims or suggestions for hangovers but miraculously I did come back to life this also happens to be one of the most potent extracts that we've tested for THC so it could have been that by the way always look at the THC levels of the CBD you're getting two milligrams is a lot you will feel that and I cannot confirm that it will bring you back from the dead like it did for me but you may feel it a bit there full-spectrum CBD is so damn cheap I can't believe it when I tested it it was at four cents per milligram of CBD for their $32 bottle and they just updated their prices this month and it's now three cents they're stronger formula is at two cents per milligram it's so cheap it was already the cheapest now it's it's that they beat their own record it's the cheapest cheapest cheapest but please let me know if you found anything cheaper than this because I'd like to test that one out to our testing found that they were extremely accurate and it was one of the most potent full spectrums that we've tested with a lot of CBC and CPG as well now the only downside is that the flavor is also potent it's super earthy but just looking at the candle levels I would expect that they use a natural ethanol extraction process some people don't like that because it does keep the natural flavors ethanol alcohol goes away completely during the evaporation stage but you're also left with one of the most potent extracts possible of kin monoids so if you don't like the natural flavor of hemp this won't be for you but it is such a good deal they make pure sativa tea products as well and I'm testing a bunch of their new products so stay tuned for that number one best CBD company Bluebird botanicals I've been a fan of Bluebird for a long time I wrote about them in my book hemp for migraine best book ever by the way and I'm a very modest person and I wrote about them on CBD examined for a long time where I test products for transparency and accuracy this company pioneered transparency today most companies provide lab tests online a lot of companies provide inaccurate lab reports but that's beside the point Bluebird was one of the first to may be the first to show real lab tests for everything I've tested for of their products now a couple of multiple times I've got more tests on the way also and their lab results have been excellent my only complaint is that they don't make any flavored products no gummies and instead of lowering prices in this time desperation the prices actually went up by a couple dollars still cheap still great still the best company but I might need to rethink this number one spot because everyone else is lowering their prices and I'm super cheap Lazarus load their prices last week Bluebird I'd like to tell everyone you did to in an update next week it's not like my opinion matters it's not like people pay attention to the top video review on Google right now out of 3810 Bluebird review results there are full-spectrum extracts are well rounded and potent I've always compared them to Charlotte's Web but cheaper still cheaper so I can't really complain about the price that prices have always been great and everything about the CBD company is positive too many good things to list and I really like that they give massive discounts to disabled low-income and vets Lazarus does that too if I didn't mention that before bluebirds founder is also the vice-president of the u.s. hemp roundtable which led the political fight for hemp legalization this is just a solid company that has built a reputation over years pioneered CBD transparency and pushed for legalization they really are in a league of their own so there you have it my favorite CBD companies and this list is bound to change because I've already sent 50 more products to the lab subscribe so you don't miss out and I will see you next time", "N_ygi8eLzZQ": "hi and welcome to the CBD oil source your

It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "KrJ70CAZspk": "a Southwest Florida woman is taking a non-traditional route to remedy her multiple sclerosis symptoms on top of taking medications prescribed by her doctor she is using CBD to deal with the pain of MS Rachel Lloyd has the story Nikki shanaar has been living with multiple sclerosis for two decades she says it's caused her pain in her hands knees and back she worked as a dental hygienist for 25 years but says it must cost her her job I'd get home and I'd be mentally exhausted and physically exhausted because I had tremors in my hands and I didn't have medicine for that yet ms causes the body's auto immune system to attack its immune system which affects your nervous system she says her condition got really bad when she had an episode two years after her diagnosis it had taken over her whole body and she was hospitalized and then sent to a nursing home for weeks I had blood transfusions and God knows what they put in me and I really don't remember most of it I could not walk I had to learn how to walk and since then she's been using several different medicines prescribed by her doctor typical according to dr. Jean Mahaney with pain management consultants we treat the pain in a similar way we treat any other pain with opioids pain medications neuropathic pain medications and injections to keep pain under

primal living my goodness we have such an exciting show for you today okay so why is CBD oil so popular it's a supplement that has been known to help so many people in so many different ways which we're going to explore right right now and today but first of all introduce the fabulous cherry Kapil cherry hey lovely to see you very good now you're the co shows the co-founder of pro-life CBD yes explain a little bit about your company okay so pro-life seaweedy for anybody who doesn't know we've been working with primal for a while now a long time now it has been a long time and we're we feel so privileged to to be here and have pro-life here because our aim pro life's story if you like and what a more goal is to be the best provider of CBD oils and in sounds that were going to talk about later as well in world so we started this company we'll talk about this later but we set up the company quite a long time ago due to some personal issues that rule which we'll go into but we source the best CBD available in the world as far as we are concerned and from start to finish yes and that's what we bring to you today and it's so lovely it's so lovely to have cherry here in the studio as well to answer questions I'm going to be asking lots of questions that you may have at home you may know lots about there and the C video or you may know a little bit but we're really going to be exploring your mania may know nothing about it at all but first of all I've talked about the offers we have today okay so let's just talk through the oils now just be very clear these are oils you ingest these are oils you take will explain the quantities to stress the everything about this so there are three on off the today as well as the South okay so we'll talk again I'm just done so these are all the first way is 10 millimeter ten millimeter sized okay which is 3 that's the 8% the scale 8% in strength another 10 millimeters as well which is 20% and then we've got the bigger volume here as in quantity 300 million 400 milliliters and that sits in between a 10 percent yes okay and of course we've got the self as well where you can read target parts of the body as well yeah okay lots of questions to be home and what I love talking to you cherry because you're so passionate about this this comes off you're a real ambassador for for the oils there's not actually one question you don't know the answer to yeah and it's always fueled with such passion and I've got you know take us on a few journeys as well personal stories and how yeah but let's start right at the beginning yeah what is CBD good question really isn't it it's something that so many of us heard of now and so many people do know about it but also there are people new new customers all the time and so CBD stands for cannabidiol you will hear it pronounced differently especially by the Americans pronunciations but what did it puts as simply as I possibly can put it it is a compound okay so you will hear me talk about and you'll hear other people refer to cannabinoids yeah and this is from the hemp plant so the hemp plant is made up of over a hundred different cannabinoids cannabinoid just means compound right so CBD itself is the most important compound from the hemp plant as simply as I can yeah that's it okay and that is what we're focusing on it'sit's the compound that has the most health benefits that's proving to help people the most through so much research that's going on right now our oils do have other compounds in as well which we can touch on later yeah sure but CBD itself is is what everybody is talking about what everybody wants and it really is proving to be magical really just extreme will come on to how how it's been known to help her along the way but just just really signpost the quality of this pro life it really is different than what I've seen out there again we'll come to this yeah I'm always interested when we have where we have guests on and meet people like yourself cherry is how quite often there's a personal story or a narrative did CBD find you or did you find it and if you don't mind explain how yeah absolutely and Toby made many of you will have seen Toby here because he's done more shows yes and actually he's a here's the reason why we are here today unfortunately Toby last year was diagnosed with cancer okay he's only 30 in fact it was just before 30th birthday and of course that's devastation as it would be for anybody yeah and I'd already heard of CBD because of my own conditions I have epilepsy and diabetes and was told to take it and as I'm sure most people feel I don't know enough about it I didn't look into it enough I trust medicine medicine saved my life I think it's amazing but with cancer Toby having cancer it did find us in a way CBD did find us because we wanted an alternative option of course we were going to do everything possible for Toby in the medic going down the medical route but what if what more can we do to help him and so I thought let's give CBD ago what's the what's the harm it's been known to help reduce tumors it's been known to help with nausea yeah so I saw stem CBD or we sourced it together at the time and actually cutting a long story short we were sold something that wasn't what it said it was on Anton okay and now of course that fills you with doubt and mistrust and I thought well we've just spent a lot of money on something that actually isn't helping him it was that I think it was labeled as 20% in it and we found out it was 2% so you went through the tests to find out yeah yeah because it just we weren't seeing the effect and anyway long story short we ended up going to a company in America yeah that's how long it took us some trialing CBDs in the UK we ended up in America with a fantastic company who they set up because a little girl over there she was having 300 seizures a week and they also needed an option an alternative option because no medication was helping I had epilepsy they set at the CBD company and it's she's now seizure free which blows my mind it's absolutely amazing and of course I thought that works that's amazing oil we need it yeah and as we've we then bought it for what it over for Toby and it wasn't really until a friends and family said why don't you do this is it there is obviously a huge gap in the UK market for for this amazing oil there's lots available you will see it being sold in many many stores yeah but the quality wasn't there not that we could find not that we wanted for a serious condition like cancer yeah and so that's how it was born because our friends and family said why you I mean this is going to help people why don't you why don't you yeah offer it to the world it's not going to DJ I feel this from you and Toby there's an incredible passion I feel and with your pioneer is in many way that the purpose of what you're doing here was a driven from a passion of getting a quality getting the quality product to the people who yeah absolutely it's honestly it's it's strange to sit here and almost talk about it like it's a business because it was a personal help to our family it was just a it was to help to try and improve my brother's health yes to then change into a business and help other people has been amazing it's been one of the most incredible journeys and the feedback we've been getting and we've been getting from here at Prime yeah and that's where the passion comes from because the the feeling every single day yeah that you are helping people improve their lives is one of the best things in the world yes just unbelievable and also we didn't know at the time where the Toby would be how poorly he'd be he would be yeah he travels a lot for work he goes on television we didn't have to do this hair we didn't all these things and we thought you know what this gives him a project it's helping his health let's help other people and we are hugely passionate about it comes across and it comes across in the products well in the oils as well and here at primer living we love learning you are love learning as well we again it's always feel if you if we if we learn empowers as we can make more informed decisions and with the pro life it seems a very same sort of ethos as well about in getting that that knowledge absolutely and we learn all the time as well we're always learning right now as I say the I've just first of all and I just talk about what it can help with or how it's helped people yeah exactly but but just before then is this legal absolutely legal yes you can there's been a lot of debate around see we do yours but it is 100% legal in almost every country now now there are a couple of countries around the world that are yet to change their their laws but is in terms of you buying at home and taking in the UK it is 100% legal there is nothing about our oils that are okay we're really going to explore the ingredients and what's in these fabulous bottles along the way as well now what can now we've had who you've had to help me out as well as what can if I'm actually it's a very loaded question the big question what pan CBD helped with so I printed this off in it because yes it's never ending list almost do you know what this isn't even this doesn't touch the sides right because the list is ridiculous so let me just read for you and Finnick yeah just some of the conditions and this is this policy go online and have a look for yourself because this is just a tenth I mean there isn't anything yet that someone's come to me with where it hasn't I haven't been able to find a way that CBD would help so Justin lists a few addiction they go there on the screen for you as well ADHD Alzheimer's anorexia anxiety anxiety huge arthritis also huge heart disease glue coma depression diabetes my experience with diabetes is amazing epilepsy liver disease kidney disease nausea OCD are super Isis Parkinson's PTSD skin condition sleep disorders stress and stress this huge as well it helps people in stroke recovery anyone with bipolar disorders migraines moods yes I could honestly we could do extraordinary yeah yeah I mean I mean what were your thoughts and feelings here with this one and what I don't know what here at Brown living we have and we want the whole our show which is great but I know sometimes when you got people for five minutes or ten days people dip in and dip out so really championing and signposting the quality of these particular oils that we see I've seen CVD elsewhere for example yeah quality of these prolong it's it's everything I must say it's this is this is where it always boils back to why we are here yeah the reason why we didn't end up with an oil from the UK the reason why I love a soft little question then why are we here talking about this what is in these bottles is in our bodies anyway so cannabinoids all these compounds that you get within these bottles have always been within our body we produce them naturally but that's a whole that's a whole different thing we'll talk about that in a second but no but why pro life exists yeah is it's because it was for our health so we are not messing around on quality we don't try and cook any corners we aren't trying to produce it faster we aren't trying to produce it cheaper because to drop any of our quality standards in the process of the plant to getting it into that bottle yeah it just wouldn't it just wouldn't fit what we're trying to do I think one's across I mean I've been since I was doing this show with you I have research research research and there's all kinds of other extraction procedure which will go into yeah and they're in in a little while with any kind of when we here on probably living with any kind of the vitamins a bit minerals or someone's always have those two questions how where why which and how so how does this work give it a go alright this is a big one this and this will if you haven't heard about this before will fascinate you in terms of in terms of how it works yeah you need to try it then I'm not for yeah absolutely okay so this still today I have talked about CBD for I don't know how many days and hours of my life and it still blows my mind that this is that this works in in the way that it does okay so you get pipette yeah so let me first of all tell you about the endocannabinoid system yes that's everything we have a system in our bodies that they only discovered 30 years ago and you've got basically if Elliot could show us the picture there it is so you've gotta talk us through talk us through that is there you see all those green dots they are receptors uh-huh and that is what your endocannabinoid system is so it's receptors all throughout the body and what they control everything Wow mood appetite stress and anything that send you a body out of balance yeah yeah the endocannabinoid system is there to bring you back to homeostasis which is a word you will hear a lot here at primal a word that you will hear a lot associated with CBD the whole point of this system and there was an article the other day that actually said it is the most important system you've never heard of so should I take - no and you can't explain what if Nick takes them and then I can explain what is happening immediately and this is what's so so unbelievable about CBD yeah so you juice you produce this anyway okay yep so can we have cannabinoids that we produce within our body that naturally happens an endocannabinoid system works very nicely yeah until we become deficient which I'll talk about in a second okay and then you now are about to top up your cannabinoids wonderful okay so good in the bottle you get your pipette yes okay now what I would recommend we'll talk about doses and strengths later on yeah what I would recommend for you now if you just have like a third zapper pet yeah directly under your tongue why under the tongue because it will absorb into your bloodstream okay so the reason we don't do capsules the reason that we focus on oil rather than capsules is because it goes directly in your bloodstream and you don't if you had it at the capsule you would lose the absorption of course okay so under the tongue and you'll have to keep it there for 90 seconds please 96 yeah right okay so okay so how many do tell me cops recommend the my I would say just just for now let's plane drops ace about a third of the pipette I would do just under or just down okay so under your tongue okay so nips now taking it under his tongue in a very glamorous way and if we go back to the endocannabinoid system I'll tell you what's happening so then you don't have to look at Nick just [Laughter] this right now in Nick's body imagine that's Nick on screen now all of these kind of receptors are there what the CBD is doing now is going to the receptors that need it the most so you might I don't know people take it for migraines or I or IBS exactly I've surf a lot from anxiety and yep the nervousness anxiety that's something I you know deal with in managing my own way but I mean everybody does have a way of managing it but this is we're seeing such a huge response in terms of anxiety yes what this will do now is it will bind to your receptors if you were anxious now it would deal with that problem never be anxious with you cherry ever knows what it does it's binds to these receptors and it puts you back in balance right gotcha so unfortunately because of our life today because of other stresses of life because of our diet because of the pollution because of the way that we live yeah our systems are more out of balance more and more unfortunately it's hitting on the head and that's what would you know we talked a lot about here at primer I mean if you meant a technology for example technology's meant to enhance that quality of life and make as more efficient how much does it in which makes me it just makes us more seemingly for me I can speak personally but more stressful but if you look at all the qualities of life absolutely right it's almost like we're again are we built for this amount of sorry I don't know you know that's the thing I think we're stressing our bodies more and more this is where is this is why I think this has become so important recently because as that happens so as you're stressed as you're anxious as you're our diet isn't maybe as good as it should be yeah our bodies basically go out balance and that's where this comes in yes because where your body can't produce enough cannabinoids it enough of its own cannabinoids yeah and where the receptors are starting to slow down and not work as well yeah in comes this yes so CBD does two things yes it encourages your body to produce its own cannabinoids again mm-hmm and what then all these cannabinoids are going to do is work with the receptors in your endocannabinoid system sorry for being so technical that's good it's good but I love this view it is you know love this we love learning it's empowering and it's exciting because you think I won't how do we not know about this until we salute yeah yeah but the bottom line is CBD helps to get your body back in balance right and when you're in balance you're not sick and when you're in balance you fit have more energy and when you're in balance it's just it just makes sense doesn't it when you're at optimum health you feel your best yeah and that is the simplest way I can put it is Brede is there to get you back into balance absolutely okay so just to recap I know we've got I hope you got me for that the whole show but some people depend about five minutes these are the CBD oils on offer today okay let's talk you through so I've got the you've got ten mill are over 8% 8% in strength with the toolbox we will come we're going to come to the Trent's a little I've got the 10 mil off if I put that there 20% and the bigger bottle as in with volume and this is 100 mil at 10% so in between the two and we've also got the solved to come yeah as well well goes to the 20% round just so the cameras can see you can see at home okay so so starting with the strength and who where do people begin who would be so we start with the 8% who would who'd you recommend that for okay so a lot of people come to us that have tried maybe two and a half percent or three percent or five percent from somewhere else right and I understand why people try that because it's more affordable okay because you're getting less CBD yeah yeah the reason why our eight percent is our entry level if you like is because that's where we believe you get benefits but also not everyone necessarily needs higher than that so it's a perfect place to start so we have lots of people coming to a set of tried CBD from elsewhere and that's where they start yeah because I personally think you have to you have to gauge what you need everyone's doing we're all different and we respond differently to so I could easily recommend okay go straight in with 20% but you might not need that it depends on what you're taking it for so my mum for example perfect example doesn't take it for a specific ailment she just takes yep said everyday to give a dose and keep her as a preventative perhaps as a preventative and there's a key thing all my friends and family now that take it yeah I say well why you might not take it for a specific ailment but don't wait to get ill too then say I need CBD or like Toby unfortunately but that's what happened with Tony a lot of people take it as a preventative now yeah because it's keeping you in balance yeah and if you go out of balance yeah then you're more likely to get sick it's what it's difficult to know whether what comes first yes body goes out of balance and you get a disease yeah yeah well you get a disease and it sends you out of balance either way yeah this helps to keep that homeostasis going I mean this I mean I can I know so many people buzzing about this right now the deal is are as in you're stripping you're watching this means the deals still here so the free phone number is on the screen there as well if you have any questions we've got more to bring you as well cherries brain to pick as we go on but you've got the the three different sizes of bottle and strengths as well and exceed the price is flashed up on the on the screen here now cherry just before we came to wear as well with the shelves talking to Terry about the the processes because I've really researched and other brands as I say and the extraction processes you don't downplay it but there's so much work so much passion and so much emphasis on your extraction process and I can I do you mind if I taught you about this because is it quite extraordinary so and and it again we talked about the safety of the quality and the efficiency but the extraction process of your and the pro-life CD can you talk us through yeah absolutely and this applies by the way to all three because the eight percent that we were just talking about is is the same in theory as the twenty percent the ten percent there is no range in quality they're all absolute top quality it's simply how much do you need to take so the eight percent is the entry level is is is something that most people most people would take for the first time and then you might go up to the ten percent or 20 percent but I just wanted to make it clear that every single one is the same quality same extraction yeah yeah it's just how much you want to each bottles but yes extraction it okay so I was reading there are some practice out there or for example using ethanol yeah this is now you can read about this online and there are many different opinions about this okay I guess pro-life approach we co2 extract so I'll try next time explain this sorry I put on this - there's so much - but no there is so much to it and it's very very scientific but the bottom line is everything we do is natural no pesticides no herbicides no alcohol anyway not yeah there is we do not cut a corner most companies now most use ethanol extraction and that basically means simply as I can put it you soak all of the hemp in ethanol mm-hmm yes it will get rid of your pesticides and herbicides you can't then fully extract the ethanol gotcha you don't want to take you don't want to be taking ethanol that's not the idea so we do co2 extraction and not just that it's this is I don't know whether it's too technical but we do supercritical co2 extraction this is this is what my I was being treated by when researching researching earlier before you before and we came to air is they you don't have to do this but the fact is you do because you're so passionate about this I feel like you have you have I feel like you have to do it to say that you were offering quality CBD because you take CBD for your health you can't then say on what on the one hand take it for your health but then oh but you're also taking F and although you've also got okay pesticides everything has to be all gotten and we are certified that's another thing is growing it organically grown organically and it's certified and we don't just certify it in the US where it's come from this is from Colorado by the way it's all from Colorado the best the best base that we know of in the world and our relationship with them is fantastic but they certified in Colorado it's certified in the UK and we certified in Spain which is the best lab in Europe because we want anybody who takes this whether they're buying from the UK Europe America to know that their local lab if you like also supports what we are doing it is the best that we can visit make we cannot do anything better to make it more natural more organic and higher-quality nothing all of these that you are seeing now on the screen are just showing to you yeah that we have full-spectrum oils we have zero THC zero psychoactive hallucinogenic right so that that can I just yeah come to that because so so obviously so can you get high off CBD no why no you mentioned THC can you explain a bit more about THC I don't want THC to be seen as something bad because actually it has phenomenal the reason what they found the Inuk endocannabinoid system 30 years ago is because they were testing the effect of THC on the body and just for our viewers explain what what THC is THC is tetra hydro kind of a doll yeah just it was the HD yeah it's another compound so it's Warner for the 100 and I think 112 maybe more all of these compounds are in the hemp plant THC is the only one that has a psychoactive effect the only one that is illegal okay and it's not found in here right yeah no it's not in here not in family Hitler no nothing it's not found in our CBD oil and actually anyone who's selling legally has to be at it's less than 0.03 percent you have to have less than 0.03 percent for it to be legal okay in the u.s. I think it's less than 0.05 okay we have there we don't have less than we have there and we make sure that it's all tested to prove that there is not less than naught point naught 3 it's just zero there's nothing found no trace when it should and it should say yeah it says th see on the screen there and be determined at all yeah and that's really key for us because there is no doubt in your mind that this has any psychoactive properties at all because we do see I mean children take it so much and my family my relatives my friends clients that come to us ask them that you're giving it to their children it's very important I can say hand on heart there is zero psychoactive element in there not true rather than just oh yeah there's less now yeah we just eliminate it completely yeah okay so go come back to the CBD that we have here again talk about the quality of it talk about the concentration this trains a little bit in a second or so but can you overdose no as far there's been zero reports of overdosing because because this is something you naturally produced in your body cannabinoids that's what's in that bottle cannabinoids yeah and a little bit of a carrier oil whether that's coconut oil or hemp work but that's totally natural as well yeah so everything in there in terms of the compounds that cannabinoids we we are we are known to produce them ourselves yeah so you you can't take too much so we will talk about dosages and how much people take or how many how much people take for different conditions but if you had half a pipette there's a quarter you're fine there there's no problem okay and what about if I'm on medication different kinds of medication what's its relationship with that so everybody is different again I've not had one single report at all of it interfering the medication but always check because because what it is doing is restoring balance in your body right now I can talk to you actually about my own experience with this so I've been on the highest doses of medication for my epilepsy for eight years or so mm-hmm and they kept trying to stop my seizures from happening and nothing worked nothing worked nothing eventually medicine came through and I have been on the highest dose of the medication I can take four for eight years until this came in now I along with my doctor said okay I don't want to be on strong medication for my whole life yeah because it has its own effects on you it's right numbing and I was tired and so what I've slowly done is taken as much CBD as I think I need and reduce my medication now I've done that with the support of my doctor and I would always recommend that you ask the question yeah always that chat with your GP yeah I'm a living and yeah there's nothing to be there's nothing to hide here there yeah absolutely it's encouraged and more and more doctors I mean we've talked about this before doctors are coming through saying we've got actually I'm not sure if Elliott can find it but we had a doctor he was anti all of this right I've been in the medical medical profession for a long time and he is apologize has come out and apologized and said I was so wrong I'm so sorry and he's one of the biggest supporters now there is dr. Sanjay Gupta one of the biggest supporters of CBD right now and please research him because he's he's so famous and he's such a credible person to to tell you all about the amazing benefits but yeah going back to your question it's safe but but ask the question that's so high and that's it about education empowering ourselves pooling our intelligences but yeah do check with you obviously with your with your personal GP or the yeah speak to speak meet two people and get to get that advice as well any side effects have you known off of these we've had we've had no reports of side effects and I thought we can ask something nice we I mean because we're dealing we deal with people daily yes from having anxiety through to cancer through to Parkinson's I mean serious serious serious illnesses like we discussed on that list and you think with the amount of medication they're on mm-hmm with how they're feeling anyway even if they confuse their nausea with taking CBD but we have not had a single person come back to us and say I've had this negative side of us extraordinary is it is extraordin painkillers or you know things that we take some people will have a negative start most people won't but some people will have a negative side effect this we have had zero side effects reported actually now as I say when you can it is available elsewhere well what I'm asking you right now is what makes the pro life CBD different in its quality that's the simplest way that is it a lot of people are selling CBD because it seems on trend at the moment yes same with anything that happens and I look we've seen a lot of people close down in the last in the last year including the company that sold as the dud CBD photo be in the first folks they've gone and will see that more and more its pro-life CBD is going to be the best CBD available well because we make sure we come week that we are up to date with new press and I've seen this area I've seen with you on Toby you're so incredibly power about and also what I'm actually buzzing about that what you've you brought to us are the different strengths so you looked at the 8% yes now the 20% strengths can you talk us to who would you recommend this sauce this is in the the middle bottle here okay so this is 10 millimeters let's use this for that is currently a best seller and it changes all the time but 20% okay this is for people who generally found that 8% is giving them amazing results yeah yeah and that is it is incredible for for that reason because you don't necessarily need more than the 8% but people just love it and want they want they feel like they want to help them as much as they possibly can it doesn't actually necessarily work that way if you if you have the 8% you can still take more of it like I said the quality is the same throughout yeah it's not the 20% it's better quality the quality is the same throughout it's just stronger so you need to take a little bit okay so the strong it's a yes it's quite self-explanatory out of 10 but yes and strongly is the less you need to take perhaps so you can manage it yourself and so if you if you if the 8% is got four I think it's four milligrams a drop uh-huh yeah they're about yeah yeah and and the 20 will be 10 10 milligrams so it's very popular though endure all probably unfortunately it's very popular because we have a lot of people now coming to us with very serious conditions right okay so not everyone needs to 20% but there's a lot of people that have serious serious problems that need the 20% and actually we've got requests for an even higher percentage which we're looking at yeah but that's basically what it supports for more serious conditions but it like we said earlier you can't take too much with anybody so it's just this it's the strongest quality sorry the stronger strength that we strongest percentage yeah and I think we touched upon it earlier when I was doing research and research and research and I know you there's nothing you don't know about this but when I've looked elsewhere and the the a percent is the lowest percent we have here but that seems to be beyond of some people's highest percent that's why we do it you know we truly believe if we're honest we could offer a 20 pound bottle bottle if we did two and a half percent or five percent we don't believe that good enough effects yeah and so for the extra 20 pounds 10 pounds 30 pounds how much value you put on your help this is the thing and we think there's no point in offering a lower percentage because it doesn't do enough that's just our philosophy just what we believe why yes we are stronger than everyone else and maybe a little bit more expensive than other people but at least we're seeing massive benefits from that customers it's just the home of quality CBD it's experience has the highest quality so just to recap so we've been looking at the 20% which is in the hundred mill bottle again with the pipette that looks like a 10 mil forgive me 10 mil so 20 percent all the detail on the screen the Oh 800 number and must stress as well and they're all popular this again for many is there the one of choice by getting it's down to your which one you're liking the look off or or Lottie will subscribe to these as well so yeah the number there are 800 number to get involved and ok so that was a little my taste but I've tasted it it's a very distinctive taste it's not exact it's a how did you find out if you haven't tried these like nothing I think that it's an earthly it's not unpleasant don't get me wrong it's not unpleasant at all but it's not it's I can't sort of compartmentalize it feels I said organic feels it's real come to that yeah so yes we talk about that but we use well we used offer as the carrier oil so it has to go into an oil it has to be in a carrier oil and these three that you're seeing today are in MCT coconut oil okay which has a hole so this is another sch\u00f6nox ane so just very briefly what are the benefits of having it with coconut oh well it's it helps with your metabolism it's bacterial it's it just has so many so many health benefits on its own yeah so it's just good generally for your health people take I mean my mum takes a spoonful of coconut oil every morning just yeah just another supplement well we we love here at problem we love coconut it's always a welcome addition to why we did it because we thought well if we can put it in coconut oil hemp oil is also amazing yeah and we used to offer that that was very earthy yes no I think this coconut oils neutralized it a little bit so it's I I feel more like I'm taking coconut oil than the hemp was a little bit more earthy a little bit stronger in taste but I my preference well in fact not just not just me we followed our feedback and as you know you can pay a premium for quality coconut oil yeah no please yes increase the price here or anything that I so know now I get the benefit of that as well and timeframes there's always intrigued me about things like this and so so so somebody tries lost that with do I feel something straightaway what's the how long should I take it forward ongoing yeah well your sort of thoughts on that it well I kind of touched on it but didn't expand early wrong because it's so much to talk about so yeah it this is what blows me away every single day and I don't get used to it and this is why I can't see it we can't sit here and talk testimonials because I cry last time poppy and I were both in tears you didn't show it just to if you did miss that show I know many many of you will of course it and you did show it poppy yeah it was quite emotional though it is but it's emotional all the time because like I said we started this because Toby was poorly yeah not because we intended to help the world the feeling that you get when you're helping so many people yeah and they are so thankful it's a long talk about right that's it there are just a moment we flush them up they're awesome on the problem living website as well yeah please do have a look and and and have a look at any reviews because they are amazing and we don't shy away from them at all they they fascinate me every day we have a new problem every day we have a new new illness every day we have a new review and it's just incredible to thousands and thousands of people that come to us and thank us will come to us and say please help me it is the most rewarding thing I've ever done and that's why I don't see it as a business I don't sit here as I do sit here is founder of relaxing but you might be so proud and I can see that coming from you and we're very proud to have the partnership as well I'm proud that we found it yeah I mean there are shortcuts we can make it cheaper you can make it quicker we can use other I always think you down pay this is what I'm saying I tell you never put that of the amout the work that goes into say the extraction the safety and he yeah you know I think sorry going back to your question you gone off on a tangent know what what amazes me more than anything else first of all there in the cannabinoid system and the fact that it exists and can do this this oil from a plant can do something so magical yeah but you I've witnessed and please look at this on line because it is one of the most amazing things you will ever see in your life I have witnessed somebody having an epileptic fit or somebody physically shaking with Parkinson's stop within seconds mmm-hmm how how is that it's it's a miracle to me yeah it's very moving it's extraordinary it is so the answer is yes immediate immediate so not everybody don't get so wrong not everybody feels in the median but if you think what I just did the top what moments to be feeling now he said people who are in pain people who have arthritis people who have Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety panic leaf illnesses are sleeps huge so you can take it before sleep and I guarantee if you've never taken CBD before if the first time you take it you will have one of the best night's sleep you've ever had because and the reason I can guarantee that is because every single person has given me that feedback we've talked before about Poppy's nan Tobi with his sleep because he was so anxious when he was poorly sleep was amazing but it does have an immediate effect because we've seen that in the likes of epilepsy Parkinson's and also the lovely lady who was really struggling with panic attacks is adjusting her dose at the moment because she's getting anxious going into busy situations right a shopping mall a meeting yeah somewhere somewhere where she feels that it's gonna be a lot of people that's what she struggles with yeah a lot of people do right you know to some level it's always do different volumes of it absolutely the biggest biggest topics well in the world right now yeah mental health is people talking about it a little bit more willing to talk about it great yeah it's a bit more as you say more people are I don't know is it more open more open more education towards it but as you say people are people sharing and we're coming across something like CVD that's actually giving people an answer which is so amazing not everybody wants to take prescription jokes not everyone wants to admit that they possibly have something that they need help with yeah this is a natural totally organic natural that you're not taking drugs you're not taking anything from from a pharmacy yeah and people are much more comfortable with that yeah I mean we're getting there there's always been this stigma around the the psychoactive side the THC as more and more people are coming to us listening to us there's a lot more education a lot more doctors scientists researchers yes saying this is safe yeah this is changing people's lives we're getting there very slowly and so it's I mean everyone's just going going crazy for it and of course as we say hit primal living always checked with your GP your doctor for advice and again ask those questions about empowering ourselves and again the emphasis of Juno will here at prom living is education learning those facts so you can make the informed decisions as opposed to scrambling in the it's crumbling in the in the dark we've got the big bottle to talk about now okay now this is big I mean we'll talk about them well it'll work what you're getting okay okay say this is the big bottle yeah okay and the strength of this 10% yes so sits between so it's this was the debate at the beginning what do we do what strengths what sizes and there's a constant requests for different things okay can I have a 40% gonna have a 30ml but still kinda happy we're working on it but trust us we're getting there that it's what do we do how do we do it effectively cost-effectively for you if we would see the 20% for example in a big bottle yes I'll be talking a lot money right and so it's we're trying to meet your needs absolutely but we're just deciding on where we take it next so eight percent as an entry level people want to try it yes they don't necessarily want to buy big bottle immediately understandable that's why we have the eight percent in the small bottle twenty percent in a smaller bottle again to help with the price it's the 10% that's where every single member of my family that's what they've got yet so that's there oh yeah the middle ground uh-huh so I find if you ask me I had if I had to pick one bottle that we could only supply one bottle it would be that one because I find most people that's where most people are well families are all temperament family size your question is family size bottle - no you're right actually it's them exactly that for we've had a lot of people who have tried and then said okay I want all my families to take it yeah and exactly that it's on it's there in the kitchen in the morning everyone has their their dose and off they go and so just to put again so you're putting this booklet so if you were taking the recommended dose of you drop's a time how long guesstimate would you say a bottle of the size would last you yeah it's difficult to say because of because you decide how much you take but as a rule I would say six months Wow okay and that that it is the most cost effective way yes terms of price per drop that's your bottle yeah and that is for everybody most people go from the eight percent quite quickly to either the twenty will attend because the ten percent gives you that longevity so you don't have to you don't have to worry about ordering three weeks later yes and of course you have the subscription though so you can do do it however you wish but that does last yeah so I would say my grandma and granddad yeah about six months in there's two of them so that's that's my benchmark for them but it's it's the most popular bottle foot what people say okay I need this in my life yeah I'm gonna take it every day then that's the boss they go for that's acetate okay so you can see the all the oils and the size and the strength on the on the website on the graphics right now you can see the big family bottle or the big bottle if it's just for you which is ten percent and I mean this is extraordinary just again for people just just spin it Victor on Terry and say well I appreciate what you I sit I've seen it elsewhere lower price what's what do you come back to that it's available but the quality is inferior quality yeah it's everything I don't mean to put everybody else am so that's not fair either okay there are good companies out there and CBD bottom line CBD is good the problem is it's how you how its extracted yes so what else is in that bottled it yeah you don't want to be taking ethanol you don't want pesticides you don't want any any nasties in there yeah some people are cutting corners and therefore you have got nasties in them or you will see a more affordable there are still good companies out there offering more affordable yes but it's two and a half cent so you'd have to take so much of that to feel the effect of one drop of well more drops for one drop of irate dissent yeah we sort of asking the questions I believe many people asking at home but I've done so much research on CBD and I'm not seeing anything like anything like the quality you're getting here out there this kind of a price value sorry sorry I've just passed again it's hard not to get passionate when you hear their stories and and and I feel as though we're doing a disservice because we have an hour show which is a long time and but we should be down as far as I just on that note yeah I can sit here very confidently and so I do not believe there is better quality available in the UK America we've basically taken that amazing company in America yeah I bought it here we've we found out where they got it from why they were so good why this little girl was you know went from 300 seizures to nothing so yeah and we wanted that and we said that's what's missing yeah and that's what we are providing is there's nothing we can do better nothing and now you might have called net all-natural ingredients to go yeah you brought an image of the of the farm can you talk us through there we go that little well big him blow that is Colorado a for you so look out look how laughing that looks I like to walk through that wonderful now families we mentioned and can see be CBD with what's the deal with children it's safe to take yeah all well what circumstances would a child be given to a child for example okay so any that's the thing is in what in one respect is no different to adults I mean we started like talk about that little girl it's very very common in children with epilepsy no probably one in the when I first started researching CBD that's probably the biggest thing that came up yeah always check again always check GP yes medication yeah and especially for younger children yeah that can't communicate with you just always check the reason I've grown ups who want to explore this is an avenue obviously getting the advice first questions it's so common yeah like you said it's so common that children take it there was a Elliott we got is an art school just friend of ours Jo sent it to me the other day and I love this because so many people like you are passionate this is the first time we've sat in talks about this and I can know what you tell you're passionate so many of my friends and family are passionate so many of our clients more passionate it just picks people up along the way they're the more people and it's just hard not also people are so excited to tell me things yeah are you mentioned a research team things every day and our friend Te'o sent us an article the other day about how about breast milk actually and how research has found confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk and look if you just look at that quote it's one line from this article according to the findings of several major scientific extends human breast milk naturally contains the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant which are vital for proper human development now what that's basically telling us is from the moment that a child is born they are getting cannabinoids from breast milk it's extraordinary so this is why I say this is what we are providing CBD is they cannabinoid yeah the difference is you might you might hear endo verses fighter and doe cannabinoids are from within us we reduce them 5 towers plant yeah that's it so as far as I'm concerned please look online have a look there's a lot of research and scientists and doctors that support children taking it and the results that children are getting for epilepsy and certain certain diseases incredible again and I don't know many many of our customers become a Pasteur's for in their own in their own yeah there's no impassionate way but of course do check with DPS and doctors before just we've got the South which is a remove is the is new rave and buzzing about just before we get there just something about travel laws Airport when you did touch upon it earlier and watch see what's the deal is could I take it to the airport for example or what you need to do is just check before you go then it's legal in the country you're going to so there is we need it on our website actually but if you've gone on to primal livings website there is a list of countries as to where it's legal might it's not there are a couple that it's travel size in the in the year and in most OB where I've been I've taken him yeah but check check and don't want you to get confiscated at the airport because you wait in trouble that they will confiscate it from you you know you don't want that so just make sure that wherever you're going it they accept it and also do a recent checkers look as things change laws are changing so that it's become legal in so many countries over the last few years which is great but yeah just a couple couple I came behind just double check ok this South and now everybody in the office buzzing everybody again with customers as well so talk us through the stuff so this way of doing a target to local Ike toca target though you talk to be on the skin so it's Lindsay description that's exactly that it's the same way for example you wouldn't necessarily way I can think to describe it this I always think work from the inside out so for any kind of illness take the oil that's what I that's how I yes see it just think it's your best way however you wouldn't graze your arm right take a paracetamol necessarily yeah and I think of it in the same way you puts a blood on it and the brands are available sorry but you'd put a cream on it for example same thing if you've got a spray yeah or you've got something like and psoriasis is a big is a huge thing at the moment yeah in fact one of my lovely clients recently has been I've never seen anyone so excited that her psoriasis has got better from this self that and you apply it topically like you would a cream so it's targeting a specific so I still say take the oil I mean I've every one who buys herself I say take the oil as well because work from the inside out yeah but for something that is more of an external problem and is the anti-inflammatory yes it's got I mean let's just it sorry I'm just checking it has got in here and I always have said because of that much in there we've got the coconut oil we've got the beeswax we've got the argan oil we've got rosehip oil we've got geranium oil we have eucalyptus lavender essential oil and then cannabinoid which him so it has got the there was actually a there is I won't name names but there is a fantastic moisturizer that I use it I think it's the best in the world basically what we've done is taken all the ingredients of the one of the best moisturizers and added in the CBD which is of course what will help the healing process and I'm noticing an absence for example of petroleum and things you know that can crop up everything I mean you could eat that if don't don't but yeah and it's there's nothing harmful in there it's all totally natural absolutely and we know we absolutely adore our essential oils here at prime anything so this is the the Sal and I really in the production before as well be said Nicolas make sure you say it's well stocks last I was gonna say because probably said earlier that the staff is really popular really limited and we are also limited so unfortunately we are behind a little bit in because it's been so popular we're struggling to keep up with demand on well on everything but especially itself just one thing while I remember as well with the self not only for skin conditions enjoyed pain I've never heard so I didn't expect this so many people have reported for things like cold sores and just have spots okay yeah up quickly it's got rid of them yes of course we all know how long spot can hang around for all code so unfortunately and swearing by unfortunately I haven't I haven't had one you know but all my word people are swearing by that yeah I resides as well repetitive strain injuries yeah so this post surgery yeah yeah post-surgery foot recovery alongside physio proposed rain it's everything I mean everything you can think of where you would think to apply for example heat yes all the opposite poles that's what it's gonna do for you yeah but also this equally skin conditioner as a moisturizer people use it as a moisturizer people use it as a lip balm mm-hm because it's natural so everything you're putting on your skin is natural can I use on my face yes yeah so the only thing I would say about that if I'm totally honest you can use it on your face a friend of the family recently had really bad acne and put it all over her face the only thing I would suggest is you do that at night time okay cuz it isn't all it is oily still yeah and so I put it on a night time and then it's on for that period of time wash your face in the morning because yeah I'm not sure how I make it would react with it yeah I haven't tried that but that's what I would suggest is that almost put it on as a night cream if you're gonna put it on your face okay and havoc so we talking it's 50 ml inside yes and how much CBDs in this we have got 300 milligrams in there okay so that's what we have found everything that we do is based on research basic yeah yeah what's what what's needed we don't want to put more than you need in there and that seems to be the the amount that people are really getting benefits far as the optimum yeah of level and concentration the the bomb by the way is very when you open it it looks quite hard once you get going with it it's it becomes more malleable but that is also to make sure that you don't know that happens a lot with natural ingredients anyway he hasn't it you have to study gonna make it more malleable okay so there in a nutshell with the with the cell what can it help with with itself in their self anything external any so grazes and this is where kids come back in as well I mean the amount kids fall over and you just put yeah interestingly because my daughter's knees gets tougher for than white boys days yeah Jesus well you know we scarlet running around so yeah so we absolutely right so so perfect that exactly but of course like you said only arrived after the gym that's popular for that muscle soreness post surgery and anything external that you think Xmas Isis yes and most skin conditions in fact every skin condition that we have helped it has worked with if you're concerned like we keep saying if you're concerned ask your doctor but generally you can apply it like you would a moisturizer or like you would other creams that are available and you just rub it in yeah well it will get to work I'm thinking about after shaving perhaps as well again yeah great so the great thing about it is I also use I use an aloe vera a lot yeah you can't ally beer with Sarah Leon to open skin of course yeah so for things like cuts I had made this mistake with Charlie my stepson and it jellyfish yeah sting yeah I know oh yeah oh my word he went through the roof because it was still actually even though it didn't look like an open yeah weave but it's still so saw so as much as I love aloe vera brilliant and this doesn't have any of that stinging property so you can put it directly on a cut gotcha so whether it's because some people are such bad skin conditions where it's almost that open open wound open sores but actually this is very soothing there's nothing in there that will make it sting mm-hmm so yeah after shaving be great and you've seen the deals here just extraordinary please I mean I'm gonna do it my personal email address out again it's Nick at primarily living Calm it's Nick and I see cap please feedback to what your experiences and enjoying the growing groups of people who are so passionate and that CVD and passionate about this particular quality that we've got here so just go over again the the size of the bottles and the strengths as well and just feel free survive survive was leaving stop with to drop the what you sky was an entry level eight percent that's where everyone starts nearly everybody starts and I would advise it because if you are coming if you are currently taking something from somewhere else yes and it's a lower percentage see the difference I want to experience yeah I want you to experience the difference between a five percents from somewhere else yeah I'm taking our 8% because I want you yeah there it would be yep see the difference yeah and it you can gauge from that whether you need more yes so if you're getting through the 8% ball so quickly you use it you might think okay I want a high strength or people stay at 8% and that's just enough to you know as a daily supplement fantastic so that's the ten mill at 8% yeah and then we've got jump to 20% in strength again with ten mill yep with ten melt so that is our highest strength currently and that is taken by well there's two ways of looking at it it's taken by people with more serious illnesses who need the higher strength or want the higher strength mm-hmm or it's taken by customers who maybe want to take less so of course if there's four milligrams in an eight in the Apes impulse will per job yeah ten milligrams in the 20% bottle per drop you just have to take less so yeah it is premium popular at the moment I think because people want to be taking as much CBD as possible but same quality same quality within both it's just how much you ingest okay gross we've got about a minute left on show so again a perfect forum travel size with these smaller bottles and we described more as the family size now this sits percentage-wise in the mid-water down the middle between a 10% 10% that's what we have found to be the most popular requested suitable yeah presenters that people want and that's a hundred mil and that's hundred bill the reason why it's a hundred mil is because exactly that people want to buy in in a big box and it's in the cell now as and then then finally of course we've got the self 50 mils of selves and and we've really got across marine sale mode now quick how do you get involved how do you get in touch how do you get to own these prized oils for its employees the year Oh 800 number on the screen we've talked lots of questions that you may have please we'll ask the core central or cherry thank you very much for coming pa Matz thank you so much for joining us give us a ring and make these yours", "wRuY6JSRoME": "oh yeah I got caught smoking weed at universities I had my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park I didn't get called by the police but I was outside of the jurassic park ride and i was like all right you know bring him to go get a soda or whatever i'm gonna sit here and smoke my vape pen and there's like one of the handlers they have a thing where they have a velociraptors I get person into costume but it's again i'ma try to cost ya and they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the the trainers like trying to calm him down it's a whole display with the kids and everyone's really excited so I'm just like how I watching it like getting stone zoning out and at one point the girls got like one of those you know microphone face pieces on she just goes she goes sir not here and that was it I went up and then I just sir not here fade it off yeah I know I wonder if they're cooler about it now now this is a year ago oh there's not that long ago Wow I was very surprised I was like this is California well not only that would it would if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that probably not I think they're smoking areas that are designated but she knew what it was she saw my face my mouth was a gape watching real velociraptors walking around I was losing my mind it was all dude like get out of here stoner yeah that was listening to the radio in Utah and they were talking about how they have to re they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now cuz there's no reason it must be some is there a change in Utah as Utah changing their their drug policy because it was funny that's listening to this old dude on just for the for the [ __ ] of it I was listening the AM radio rock radio and this old dude was talking about how they they're gonna decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs because they'd use him on like traffic stops there we go medical marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines just [ __ ] putting these dogs down well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs you when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah you know first of all you realize goddamn pot is really you can't stop it's here the genies out of the bottle it's here the revenues and Grandma feels better ya know the alzheimer the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing brightest patients people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that works the way cannabis does they just give it in and then they're making all this money but then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're talking about it and they they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are gonna go away bright how many dogs are gonna be one of them smoke weed so they're like it's not really my problem and interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue the problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge so it's it for a long time it was difficult to take him serious yeah you needed straight-laced guys to come in and you know there's a lot of money there there's so much money in it that you're getting that but when you have [ __ ] hippies playing hacky sack and you know you know weren't puka-shell necklace is is sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know yeah I don't like for I don't I don't use we SS doesn't try to I do take CBD I did literally during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time so I guess you take whirl - I do I take CBD excellent daily but I don't know infinite CBD sponsors are our podcast and great festivals well they're also I'll get you a bunch of products is there a really great company that supports comedy they sponsored my tour when I was prepare for my special they're [ __ ] dope but I take it daily I take the the oil just because you know apparently all of the the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making you feel better and getting back in line I don't know the [ __ ] effects I smoke weed every day as well so I'm sure i'm getting CBD effects as well but in my mind I'm going to I have a bunch of this stuff I know that since I started taking it i weirdly feel better but i can't really connect you said before you take CBD and you go into another realm well I was taking one and one it's like one gram of CBD - one gram of THC like it's it's one part well so whatever milligrams you have it's Bo like it's ten milligrams CBD it's ten milligrams we as well its Pope yeah I take regular CBD too though I take oil I feel like it's it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory benefits then just smoking it smoking it does something for you definitely reduces inflammation makes you feel better I was taking sore joints a topical I was using topical is good too but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil you don't have to say but people a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one versus one plus one like one part THC one part so it's like edible like you know marijuana mixed with CBD a lot of people find great benefit in that for some reason yeah I had a trick my aunt because my aunt so anti drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from hemp shoot she wouldn't take it was just bad arthritis and I gave it to her for for that and she loves it and I told her after the fact but it's grabbing dude it's just a plant folks and if you just get straight CBD it has no psychoactive properties there's no it's not gonna the only thing it's gonna do is for some folks and it works a little bit left wave with me it alleviates some anxiety just relaxes you yeah yeah that's uh that's why I smoke weed - yeah I smile and I've been arrested probably ten times in my life and every time was for smoking a joint in the street every single time dude the arrested they take you in yeah New York Turkey [ __ ] cell it's crazy still there still do the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago me and Dave Smith two years ago maybe me and you tell me you were Lewis J Gomez guy told me Louis calm eyes that's when I start using the middle in - I was like you know what it's problems election [ __ ] Lewis Gomez's must have rap sheets doggy every time I come back into the country I'm pulled into a room and they [ __ ] they look like they're about to fist [ __ ] me with a rubber glove every time have you been to Panama honey ton recently sir yes come right this way every single any time Bolivia sir but yet dude when in New York City the way it works is you its dude it sucks it's happened so many times it's the worst because it's just a major inconvenience you know pay me ask to get into Canada I can do it now cuz they changed the laws but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being arrested for a joint we're not talking about like I have an ounce that I just bought from my dealer and they found a large amount on me a joint smoking on the street what they do is they they at first they they take the weed and they go all right we're gonna give you a ticket just hang tight relax we're gonna put cuffs on you this is just keep you calm and just to [ __ ] get you in the paddy wagon this is all a process then they put you in a paddy wagon they used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go and try to find kids smoking weed kid drunk kids college kids pissing in public public intoxication and the entire night they would just pick up everybody and fill up paddy wagons and create criminals just create criminals out of teenagers you know kitten they were targeted that's why the stop and frisk law has happened in New York they changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids", "ao7eg4s36DY": "what's going on this is dr.

Sanjay\u00a0\nGupta who actually advocate for CBD as well as\u00a0\u00a0 non-medical celebrities such as Joe Rogan Morgan\u00a0\nFreeman Quentin Paltrow then you got athletes such\u00a0\u00a0 as David Wells who argue on behalf of CBD use\u00a0\nin sports medicine where it's anti-inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0 power would allow players to recover more quickly\u00a0\nand not risk opioid addiction there are plenty of\u00a0\u00a0 MMA fighters who swear by it as well in Bubba\u00a0\nWatson a professional golfer said that his\u00a0\u00a0 decisions UCB was quote-unquote a no brainer the\u00a0\nFDA even joined the bandwagon last year at least\u00a0\u00a0 partially approving the CBD medication at the\u00a0\ndialects this is despite the fact that cannabis\u00a0\u00a0 remains illegal in eyes of the federal government\u00a0\nso CBD use is growing by leaps and bounds with a\u00a0\u00a0 projected twenty two billion dollar market by the\u00a0\nyear 2022 CBD is cannabidiol which is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 the flower of cannabis the only plant genus that\u00a0\ncontains YOUnique class of molecular compounds\u00a0\u00a0 called phytochemicals so there's more than 8500\u00a0\ncannabinoids that have been identified but the\u00a0\u00a0 two most prevalent are tetrahydrocannabinol\u00a0\naka THC and cannabidiol which is CBD THC is\u00a0\u00a0 the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis meaning\u00a0\nTHC is the component that gets you high while\u00a0\u00a0 CBD is the quote/unquote anti psychoactive\u00a0\ningredient meaning it doesn't get you high\u00a0\u00a0 there are actually two types of cannabis plants\u00a0\nmeaning there are two subspecies one is marijuana\u00a0\u00a0 which is rich in THC and thus has been cultivated\u00a0\nfor the high associated with its recreational use\u00a0\u00a0 and then there is hemp which is low in THC hemp\u00a0\nwas historically cultivated for the industrial\u00a0\u00a0 uses or its tough fibers in December of 2018\u00a0\nin part because a growing body of scientific\u00a0\u00a0 evidence showing CBDs therapeutic attributes\u00a0\nthe federal government legalized him although\u00a0\u00a0 33 states have legalized medical marijuana\u00a0\nincluding 10 states with legal recreational\u00a0\u00a0 use marijuana remains prohibited at the federal\u00a0\nlevel so both hemp and marijuana contains CBD\u00a0\u00a0 the recent full legalization of hemp is part\u00a0\nof the reason why some experts believe the CBD\u00a0\u00a0 market will have a societal impact as monumentous\u00a0\nas the tech revolution two decades ago but to\u00a0\u00a0 really understand what CBD is and why it is only\u00a0\nso recently burst into such almost revolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 prominence it helps to know a little bit about\u00a0\nthe history of cannabis and the biology of its use\u00a0\u00a0 cannabis is believed to have been used medicinally\u00a0\nrecreationally and for spiritual reasons\u00a0\u00a0 throughout much of humankind's history it's been\u00a0\nused in some form by societies throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 world the oldest known written record regarding\u00a0\nits use comes from almost 5000 years ago in\u00a0\u00a0 China ancient Greeks used it to dress wounds at\u00a0\nhorses and to apply to human nosebleeds it was\u00a0\u00a0 medicinally popular among Vikings and medieval\u00a0\nGermans for relieving pain during childbirth and\u00a0\u00a0 for toothaches while Queen Elizabeth used cannabis\u00a0\nto relieve her menstrual cramps but only in recent\u00a0\u00a0 decades it's have we come to understand how\u00a0\nand why cannabis affects humans the plant\u00a0\u00a0 was largely excluded from scientific study due to\u00a0\nits widespread illegality until the 1960s when an\u00a0\u00a0 Israeli chemist named Rafael McCollum McCullum was\u00a0\nable to obtain confiscated hashish from police and\u00a0\u00a0 study it he elucidated the structure of THC and\u00a0\nCBD and then in 1992 made an even more fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 discovery the existence of the endocannabinoid\u00a0\nsystem meaning the EC s in the human body so the\u00a0\u00a0 EC s is the body's largest system of receptors and\u00a0\nit's found throughout the brain nervous system and\u00a0\u00a0 organs it's been described as the molecular bridge\u00a0\nbetween the body and the mind scientists have come\u00a0\u00a0 to believe the EC s is among the most important\u00a0\nphysiological systems involved in human health\u00a0\u00a0 because it regulates both mood and homeostasis\u00a0\nkeeping internal systems balanced in the face of\u00a0\u00a0 external stress and inflammation he said that by\u00a0\nusing a plant that has been around for thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years we discovered a new physiological system\u00a0\nof immense importance we wouldn't have been able\u00a0\u00a0 to get there if we had not looked at the plant\u00a0\nso the implications of this discovery including\u00a0\u00a0 the burgeoning applications of CBD are only\u00a0\nbeginning to take shape and looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 ec s McCullum uncovered naturally occurring\u00a0\nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids that\u00a0\u00a0 are structurally nearly identical to the phyto\u00a0\ncannabinoids found in cannabis THC mimics these\u00a0\u00a0 endocannabinoids endocannabinoids and binds to\u00a0\nthe two main kinds of receptors in the body cb1\u00a0\u00a0 and cb2 CBD doesn't directly bind the cb1 or cb2\u00a0\nreceptors but instead serves as a real take and\u00a0\u00a0 break down inhibitor preventing the breakdown of\u00a0\nnaturally-occurring endocannabinoids in the body\u00a0\u00a0 this is essentially the same way that selective\u00a0\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs work which\u00a0\u00a0 prevent the reuptake and breakdown of serotonin\u00a0\nin the brain and if you're not familiar with\u00a0\u00a0 SSRIs these are the medications that are mainly\u00a0\nused to treat anxiety and depression think paxil\u00a0\u00a0 zoloft cetera so CBDs health impacts span the\u00a0\nentire endocannabinoid system in particular\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have found a CBD increases the levels\u00a0\nof an and amide and cannabinoid known as the Bliss\u00a0\u00a0 molecule derived from the Sanskrit word Ananda\u00a0\nwhich means extreme happiness or one of the\u00a0\u00a0 highest states of being CBD has shown to generally\u00a0\nserve as a boon for brain health serving as both\u00a0\u00a0 a protectant and enhancing neuroplasticity it's\u00a0\nbeen shown to be effective applied topically in\u00a0\u00a0 reducing inflammation and overall body pain some\u00a0\nearly studies suggest that CBD might help fight\u00a0\u00a0 cancer and has already earned a place in overall\u00a0\ncancer treatment force ability to reduce nausea\u00a0\u00a0 and help with pain and the benefits of CBD appear\u00a0\nto come with little to no side effects according\u00a0\u00a0 to the World Health Organization they said CBD\u00a0\nexhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or\u00a0\u00a0 dependence potential and today there's no evidence\u00a0\nof public health related problems associated with\u00a0\u00a0 the use of pure CBD because this is all relatively\u00a0\nnew science studies of CBDs efficacy in a number\u00a0\u00a0 of treatments are still preliminary and its actual\u00a0\nmarketing is often suspect many products are being\u00a0\u00a0 released without much regulatory oversight and\u00a0\nthe CBD levels and overall quality of CBD products\u00a0\u00a0 are not always as advertised mostly they don't\u00a0\ncome as advertised so some CBD products contain\u00a0\u00a0 unwanted THC which means some people might test\u00a0\npositive for marijuana so you really have to do\u00a0\u00a0 your research to learn what CBD brands you can\u00a0\ntrust besides determining the safety and efficacy\u00a0\u00a0 of CBD for various medical conditions there are\u00a0\nlots of other questions that scientists need to\u00a0\u00a0 answer for example what form of CBD should be\u00a0\ntaken what is the recommended dosage and much\u00a0\u00a0 more so there's a

even feel I'm like hello even reopen hi youtube 'yes i'm back and i'm reviewing go green hem i have two bottles one is orange and one is unflavored looks like this you can see it is a 500 milligram bottle and it's 30 milliliters they both go for around 39.99 i believe it was the actual price on their website theirs they also have a cinnamon flavour but i'm only reviewing the orange and the unflavored for right now so in the mail it came with these packages Hedison spit in my travel case so they're kind of jagged right now but come in those little packages and it comes with a little pamphlet telling you more about the CBD i'm gonna start with the natural one the unflavored natural so i check this one before i had a show and i had a little bit of anxiety and it actually went away I took about I think five to ten droppers and I didn't have any anxiety while I was performing that was nice it did not reduce so sometimes I take CBD before I drink so that I don't get a hangover the next day did not reduce the hangover did nothing for the hangover I had a hangover but you know maybe that's because the alcohol I drink or how much I drink who knows oh I also traveled while I was taking this one I took three droppers before I got on the plane and I didn't have an anxiety for my whole flight I also noticed that compared to the fab CBD this which was the same milligram content fab CBD worked a little bit better for me I had to take more go green than I did fab CBD and I usually like to take less if I can so for me personally I'd rather have something more effective but go green is actually very useful because it did get rid of my anxiety so it is still a good choice oh the taste was very very we'd like it wasn't it wasn't as strong as blue birds we'd kind of planned he taste but it still you could still taste the cannabis and yeah it was clearing colors that was nice moving on to the orange go green hemp so this one tasted heavenly it tasted exactly like oranges it was like this is the best tasting CBD that I've ever had if you can't do the whole wheat taste with your CBD I would highly recommend getting the orange one because it's an amazing phenomenal I tried this one for pain I had cramps because it was my time of the month and I took it it didn't really help for my cramps I also used it for oh I also used it for two things that I had and it didn't really diminish any pain or I didn't notice a difference at all but it didn't work for anxiety like the other natural one did so that was nice it does work for you you guys are out there looking for a CDD for your anxiety this one is something I would recommend I also tried this one for it's a hangover thing and it didn't help for the hangover that I had after I drink another night but usually after drinking I get anxiety the next day and I did not give it anxiety I felt a little bit aloof still because after drinking also get like well kind of believe things I had a splash like yeah feel a little funky after drinking I still felt aloof but I didn't have high anxiety after drinking which is wonderful overall I really liked both of these I would definitely opt for the orange because it tastes amazing but if you're into the cannabis taste and maybe try this one too yeah go try it guys I'll leave the links below", "_EXpzWSipko": "nearly 7% of Americans use CBD the hemp derivative for

cannabis plants it doesn't make you high but it's being marketed to relieve all kinds of ailments Noland Southie who has stage 4 pancreatic cancer swears by it CBD takes away my anxiety CBD is help me with my appetite my knees used to kill me all the time but now I rub the CBD oil on my joints and I don't really have much pain anymore but we wondered if you're always getting the amount of CBD that you're paying for to find out we bought some products and sent them to a lab for testing they can go with a small bottle at first we purchased CBD from all types of retailers from upscale stores to items sold online the results were surprising tests found three of the nine products we purchased contained less CBD than they claimed like these CBD gummies from Barneys each gummy is supposed to have 10 milligrams but our tests found just 6 to 7 milligrams when we told the distributor lab to beauty they insisted the amount was correct and provided us their independent lab tests to back it up I'm actually looking for some of the lavender lotion and the label for this CBD lotion at a store called hemp garden in new york city says it has 500 milligrams of CBD in each bottle but the lab found one bottle had only 64 milligrams how do you explain that you guys are selling something that doesn't have the amount of CBD in it that it says it at this moment of time I can't comment on that however I will say those products have been pulled from the shelves and it was a manufacturing issue we are on top of it thank you so much finally these CBD products are sold by Slade Smiley and gretchen Rossi of the Real Housewives of Orange County I just encourage everyone to try it we tested this one that claims to have 560 milligrams of CBD and curcumin an herbal supplement but we found it barely had any CBD only about one milligram we asked the reality stars where's the CBD if it says this on the label why aren't you giving the consumer that same amount because again it is a that amount is correct because that's what's in the bottle according to expert dr. Damien Kadam ski from ieh labs the product has hardly any CBD what is your claim for the amount of actual CBD in the product it should be about two percent okay okay so we never filmed even that amount we found less than that if this label is misleading in any way I want to make sure that we change it well they have since changed the label for that product as for the gummies we bought

"hi I'm Tanner with nature's ultra in this episode of CBD 101 we're going to talk about how to use CBD and answer some of the common questions about making it part of your daily routine [Applause] [Music] let's start with the easy stuff how to use CBD to use one of our CBD oils you'll want to apply one full dropper to the desired area if you're using our CBD muscle rub you can apply it generously to your joints or muscle and massage it in well if you're using our calm CBD roll-on you apply it to your neck and chest as desired pretty simple right of course it's not just important to know how to use CBD knowing how to make it part of your daily routine is just as crucial you see a lot of people use CBD once or twice and when they don't experience instant results decide that it just doesn't work for them but before you decide CBD doesn't work for you be sure to give it a chance we recommend using it daily for 30 days that will give you the opportunity to really see how CBD can work for you the idea is to make it a consistent habit if you're using calm CBD roll-on make it part of your bedtime routine if you exercise regularly make CBD muscle rub part of your post-workout routine it's combination of pure essential oils and CBD offers a cooling sensation and can help soothe sore muscles use CBD oils it may help to use it around the same time every day to establish a routine you can always use that at different times as desired but it's a good idea to try to use it regularly so it becomes a habit as you create a routine around CBD it's important to remember that everyone is different we all have our own unique circumstances and things affect us in different ways your experience with CBD may not be identical to other people who have used it don't get caught up thinking that your own experience is a failure just because it's different than somebody else's try writing down why you chose to start using CBD then jot down a few notes about how you feel every day so you can track your well-being over time and at the end of 30 days you'll be able to look back and reflect you may also experience more result by using a higher strength product nature's ultra each of the products is available in two concentrations of CBD some people achieve the results start looking for at a lower strength and others will achieve them at a higher strength we recommend starting

coconut oil aloe vera okay right okay so we added a whole package of wax which is about yet and a half pound okay so we do four parts coconut four part temp usually but I go a little bit more than him and we should do an equal amount of aloe vera so this is a 16 ounces and there's so we'll use about less than half of that all right we'll add that in right after we do the coconut then we're going to turn the heat off your skin when it starts to develop a little bit of a skin on it and look for the hemp oil in there mix it up real good then we let it settle down and then right after that I guess well I've never had I've always added the vanilla beads but we'll just add the vanilla oil skew drops maybe even let's drop it around and it'll smell good yeah watch so we used a half pound with beeswax we're gonna use two pounds of because [Music] unless so you like to seeing what you make your M Sava I guess there is coconut on that something was in we try to get a couple bite game what

Misha Lee to explain how can I does the same thing separates not a liquid when you pour it in as a liquid at guitar now what we'll do is we'll turn this off then when it starts to develop the skin will put the hemp oil in then we'll add the vanilla variant [Music] four parts in oil hipsters make this ad you'll have to give me a recipe Jeremy okay he's our Peduto my jaw she can still do that I'll give you the oil and then you put the vanilla no it's one part beeswax which goes in first one part beeps what then four parts coconut which goes in second and you wait for it to become homogeneous one part or a little bit more aloe vera and they'd add that after the coconut and again you got to wait for it to become homogeneous and you let it cool down develop that skin and you put four types ham little more if you want and thin yes that's right and then I use it and I become homogeneous I use it in Munster almost kind of proven hair sucker you homeboy idea radius militia mark guy who's gay gay gay this is Ruben lol [ __ ] what he said it's probably mess under shoot from the hip that's just purely for the system yeah well the know has you know people like the vanilla scent on energy pleasant for a man or alone yeah and there's good for you you don't add it what does it smell like just nothing there's coconut oh yeah don't get a big smell out of it it's really gonna be what I'm real definitely add it you can add anything up so where do you purchase this coconut oil and refined I got that off the internet on at the bread route and get a staple and spice you get up in probably good non organic coconut oil at I did it health record Google this is here yeah okay so the part doesn't know there's some part ears as long as they're all equal parts I mean do you use the same measurement part yeah whatever whatever you happen to do so I use I used to have a pound of beeswax approximately so I want to use two pounds of fat that's approximately two months all right here baby cheese type stuff and say just different stuff that's not liquid how many boards over one part or mark depending on what you want and then you add hemp oil once it's cooled down to the point where it develops skin so that's for putter Templar then you can add other essential oils at that time you could also add vitamin E at that time add vitamin E once it's cooled down to him and I will

certain affiliations for where I use vanilla just because it's it works for both genders and everybody likes signals alright gender friendly amount for parts coconut let it become homogenous one part or more LOV rapid fridge to develop a skin or parts hemp oil add vitamin E or any essential oil right need to stir it to mix it all up and put in the fridge and let it become thick that's what it mr.

this is a very high dose CBD product especially for topical in the entire tin I believe is about 400 milligrams of CBD that they list there on the top and they do come in different strains mainly ACDC and Charlotte's Web I wish I had the you know original full tin it usually comes in a kind of the large silver tin and that can run I think it usually runs around $40 in the dispensary depending on the area of coverage that you need to cover can be less or more you know of a value for you oh it's kind of nice system support a small business it's not one of a you know very large conglomerate yeah so when you smell this it is essentially is unscented there's no aromatherapy oils or anything else in here to you know make it very fragrant it is just raw like smells like coconut oil really just really smell like cannabis at all but when you you know it is filled with cannabis when you use it the past couple of days my knee has just been totally inflamed I hadn't been able to walk on it

topical CBD you see how that you know really helped my my knee injury the coconut oil is a little bit thicker sometimes you can almost seem like a solid at first but when you touch it it actually just kind of melts into a liquid oil right there and your finger yeah look at it just melts right into an oil just with the heat of your your skin aren't there a little bit does go a long way with this but I found you know for males so you might actually need more than if you're a female just because have a bunch of hair the hair end up absorbing a bunch of it so I kind of had to use more than I you know I think someone less like hair we'd have to use so I just kind of got a solid glob on there now almost my my top part of my knee was hurting like right above the kneecap so I went ahead got it on both sides of that as well as on top and around the kneecap and just rubbed it in nice and gently now rub me I didn't was a little bit you know sore if you have a really sort area it's again I heard two rubbed in so just you know you can be gentle with it and I believe it is best to do this at night now I use it throughout the day you can use it throughout the day it doesn't actually get you high or medicated but at night when you're sleeping your skin temperature increases and that's when you're gonna be doing most your healing so it's gonna really be most beneficial and you know be a little bit more receptive I feel at nighttime or early morning or maybe even after a shower when you're you know nice and warm then I would take a little bit more I would actually just essentially just coat the entire area and sometimes if you can find like a source or you know find where the paint's traveling from I've actually hit that area with a little bit as well and what I found although I was very skeptical at first because you don't think you know topical is gonna work because it seems like just a lotion but it really really took the edge off now it didn't completely take the pain away when I was active and trying to move on it and you know not doing good things probably but you know when I was just sitting here you know trying to be comfortable and rest it very very very much helped the just ambient pain and just you know just the pain that's radiating and pulsating when you're just trying to relax you know conditions vary and it's really hard to say this will work for you this will work for your condition but I would definitely give it a try there's a lot of different brands out there make sure you find cvd that's derived from marijuana flower not CBD isolate from hemp it has anecdotally been found to be much less effective the have CBD isolate why that is you know a lot of people can just say it's entourage effect or it's the terpenes and the cannabis plant maybe it's the miniscule amounts of THC or the other cannabinoids we don't really know for sure I found that I much prefer those products I found them to be much more effective and if I'm to be just more reputable their testing results tend to come from reputable sources within the state and they tend to have testing sources man I can do a whole video and that you know what I will I'm gonna do a whole video on CBD just misinformation because it's seriously my pet peeve CBD isolates that are just found in a wellness store that's advertising CBD is not going to be a quality CBD product yeah people might might hate that but just be very aware when you're looking for CBD online be very skeptical until you have you know less reasons to be just be skeptical of CBT online especially from dispensaries still be skeptical just make sure you do your research look into it know what your product contains yeah supports been some great people lab test is 100% flower bud ACDC CBD topical great stuff alright so sub Ward's artisan South find them in a dispensary near you thank you for tuning ken guy please like and subscribe to the channel", "bsR6nU_8UZs": "all right hi guys welcome back to our Channel today we are going to do a tutorial on how to make your own CBD coconut oil in a crock pot and then we're going to show you how to use that to make your own organic CBD dog treats the coconut oil has been asked for a couple times just because it can be used for a number of different things you can use it for baking and cooking like we're gonna do or you can also use it for selves if you have pain and stuff which is really awesome I have made some that I use for cramp cream which is beyond amazing and super helpful you can use it for pretty much anything you want it's a lot cheaper to make it yourself than it is to buy one of those like little tiny containers for like fifty dollars whereas you can buy an ounce and 1/4 of coconut oil which is what we're gonna use today and it creates quite a bit for you that will last a while okay and then we're going to use that to turn it into CBD of coconut oil dog treats that are gonna be all organic these are really handy if your dog is anything like mine and suffers from social anxiety separation anxiety he has a really about habit of chewing out himself when he's anxious we've tried so many different types of medicines and solutions from the vet which just don't help very well so CBD is our next option which is going to be really awesome and a lot healthier than a lot of medications so we're really excited about that as well okay so keep watching you are gonna need a few different things for this video for the coconut oil you would need a crock pot one quart of coconut oil and one ounce of flour and then for your dog treats you're going to do two large sweet potatoes half a cup of coconut flour half a cup of your cvd coconut oil and 1/8 and this created about 24 different sized dog treats so it creates quite a few and you can always freeze the dog treats for later because they don't have any preservatives in them so they aren't gonna stay good for all that long so it's handy to be able to keep them long-term okay so get ready if you want to keep watching and see how we do it alrighty guys we're gonna start out by baking two large sweet potatoes at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes we're then gonna bake our buds just like last time on about 250 just for like 10 or 15 minutes and then we're gonna grind it up in our handy-dandy coffee grinder so that we can put it into our coconut oil all right for this next part you can use any kind of coconut oil we used an already the liquid coconut oil just because it's a little bit easier and then you're gonna put your butt in there and let it sit for 24 hours stir it all up to make sure it's mixed very well you're only gonna want to stir it once or twice while it's sitting in there because the crock pot doesn't need to be stirred as much as the butter did all righty guys just like we did with our butter we are gonna strain that coconut oil through cheesecloth to get all of those chunks out because we do not want any chunks in our food or anything it will not taste good you all righty and then just like we did with our cvd butter tutorial you were going to strain it through the cheesecloth and then squeeze that cheesecloth to get any excess liquid out of there you all righty it's gonna look really dark at first but I promise once we refrigerate it again it will get that beautiful green color that we love already for this next part you're gonna want to mash up your sweet potatoes just like mashed potatoes add all your ingredients together and mix well you're gonna roll it out just like cookie dough and cut out your little doggie treats you want to bank them at 375 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes they're not gonna harden right away so you're gonna want to lay them out until they fully so he wanted to sit on the ottoman and he gets to just but right now good good puppy okay okay sit sit good", "wF5Lk1ZBtWU": "we're talking about CBD a cannabis compound that doesn't get you high but has been shown to improve one's quality of life drastically tonight we speak with a Sengupta family about how CBD has transformed the life of their six-year-old son not having CBD oil at home isn't is not an option it is not an option we absolutely have to Alexandr Sen Gupta's six-year-old son Oliver used to have upwards of 20 seizures a night it led to sleepless nights for Sengupta glad to stay awake at all hours to watch over his young son because I would be watching him through the night and and monitoring him and making sure that he was breathing making sure that he was in a safe position through his through his sleep cycles and when he would wake up and have a seizure I would be there to handle him and to make sure that he was fine medication initially prescribed ended up making Oliver seizures even worse just over two years ago Sengupta learned about CBD and began exploring it as an option while also changing all of us died itand therapy though doctors at SickKids wouldn't prescribe CBD the family had to get an appointment with a different doctor and then it was a waiting game of finding out when we could get the appointment and then getting in and going there with him then we've had issues with regards to making sure that the that the volume was correct we had difficulty with with the delivery of it there's so many steps that add to the complexity of making sure that we have it on hand the medication has been a life changer for Oliver and the family he now only has one seizure every week to two weeks fearing there could be a shortage of CBD once marijuana was legalized the Sengupta ordered the maximum amount the prescription would allow they feel that their fears were well-placed they now know a family struggling to find the game change in cannabis extract some of the parents that we know both through sick kids and through through all over school that really school they've had a difficult time with regards to making sure that they're their stock levels are high enough everybody feels as though there's a limited supply right because it's not as widely accessible as it could be the demand for some CBD products is evident on the provinces recreational cannabis website where CBD capsules have been out of stock for weeks in a statement to city news marijuana company canopy growth says in part we have made a point to always prioritize our medical patients and ensure there is at least one CBD product available on her medical site spectrum cannabis at all times I'm thinking that this is actually more of a distribution chant challenge just as much as it appears to be of supply issues the CEO of Canadians for fair access to medical marijuana believes there needs to be a big push to get medicinal cannabis in drugstores to increase supply and knowledge for patients I would say it's not only a matter of the actual sourcing of the product what's really critically important this is what we hear from patients over and over again is the lack of that advice around contraindication risk and more and more patients are asking today hey will that CBD or will my medical cannabis cause any problems with my blood pressure mad for it to be streamlined for it to be either in long counter or behind the counter item at a pharmacy or at the store would be probably the smartest thing there's nothing there's no harm in it and CBD isn't cheap either the singh group does go about go through about 4 bottles each month at a cost of more than $500 it isn't covered under their medical benefits now even with the cost and difficulty getting their hands on CBD Alexander Sengupta says he and his family are simply grateful to live in a country or getting the drug is even possible", "IB4Z7_XBopc": "[Music] well I'm standing in a beautiful field with barb Iverson now you usually see barb in us here the spring talking about their wonderful tulip fields however barb you've you've gone down a different path of opening up another part of your business your big business and that is a growing hemp now in my world my mom would have thought this was the bad stuff but it isn't is it no the bad stuff has the highest THC in it that's like the cousin of this is a whole different place this plant has low THC under 0.3 percent THC and high CBD and the CBD is what but people that use it really say it works wonderful on so many medical problems with them and pain right right that's what we're after so you actually then you grow this but it's not like you just got some seeds and throughout here this is really tracked by the state of Oregon it is something that they write and make sure it's right right we have to buy a license from the Oregon Department of Ag and then they monitor the field we pin it where the exact location is the number a KERS and then we have it tested and it has to test below that point three percent THC or we have to destroy the crown I just have to get rid of it so then not only do you grow this and I know I've talked to a lot of people who want to buy it as a medicine type thing is helping with them in some way which not have that really been proven but they still have used it they believe in it so they're concerned about the stuff being healthy you grow this right here in this field we grow it and you then you make it you you do all the processing of it right that's right we chop it down we dry it we and then we make it into an oil well then I think we should leave this beautiful field and go over there and see and find out some more about how you process it how's that sound sounds good wonderful barb come on okay but her so this is a very clean room it is plans this is you've done the harvesting and this is where you bring those harvest oh no first one after we harvest we have to dry the material first game that creates biomass we call biomass and we separate that biomass we take the woody parts out of it then we bring it in here to extract it and these are co2 extractors so you say extract it extract so what's tracked so we extract the plant waxes and cannabinoids out of that dry biomass okay and that this is a process that you have to go through to actually do that it's not just like ringing a minute no no no you go through this process and it's temperature and pressure and then that separates out all the cannabinoids and plant waxes and then is that CBD no no no eh then that's raw well from there we take it into our lab where we refine it further we take it down and and we separate out the plant waxes and purify it a little bit more and then we warm it up to decarboxylated so we're really yeah it's not just a simple process of getting the oil from the plants I mean youth there are so many steps that you have to follow and legally to make sure that it's right that's right wow that's so interesting now after all of this you have some of the the product has been made into different things that you're selling now so let's go to that store and and look and see what ultimately we can get from that that's good all

welcome thanks for coming out [Music] you", "kBK9fpyedaI": "Narrator: With all the\nweed trucks and imagery all over New York these days,\nyou might think to yourself, \"Hey, is marijuana legal now?\" Not quite. What these companies are selling is actually something called CBD. It's found in everything\nfrom lollipops to lattes. And business is booming. CBD products are part of\nwhat is estimated to be a roughly one billion dollar\nindustry in the United States. And it's perfectly legal. So, what does CBD have\nthat marijuana doesn't? Martin Lee: The fact of the matter is we're kind of in the midst\nof a CBD craze right now. Narrator: Martin Lee is the\ndirector of Project CBD, an educational platform that focuses on cannabis science and therapeutics. Lee: CBD stands for cannabidiol. That's a component of the cannabis plant that has significant\ntherapeutic properties, but it's not intoxicating. It doesn't get you high like THC. Narrator: As it happens, not all cannabis plants are created equal. Take a look at these two varieties. One is marijuana, the other is hemp. One gets you high, the other doesn't. The key difference is\nwhat's on the inside. Lee: THC and CBD are the main components of the cannabis plant. Narrator: THC is what makes you feel high, and marijuana plants are loaded with it. Dave Chappelle: I don't know about y'all, but I can't even move. Narrator: Hemp, on the other hand, has hardly any THC at all. But what it lacks in THC it makes up for with higher amounts of CBD. Now, CBD won't get you high, but it does have a redeeming\nquality: it's legal. And at least according to the marketing, it has a relaxing effect. So since this stuff is all the rage, let's see how it's made. So, once you have a cannabis\nplant, one simple way to make extract can be\ndone in your own kitchen. Lee: As simple as using\nolive oil or butter and heating the trim from the plant or a little bit of the green\nmaterial from the plant. Obviously that's not very useful for mass industrial production,\nto be cooking up something in your kitchen with butter and cannabis. Narrator: But the more common way involves a specialized, complex machine. Lee: One very widespread way is using what's called a\nsupercritical CO2 extraction. It's ground up to have the texture initially of like a coffee grind. And it's poured into vessels, literally, of a supercritical CO2 machine. It will stay in that machine\nfor upwards to 24 hours under different pressures and temperatures at different times of\nthe extraction process. And ultimately you'll end up with a thick, golden oil that's very waxy in texture. Narrator: You can also extract it using ethanol and hydrocarbons. You can find this oil in a number of different products these days. Lee: It can be administered\nin various different forms. It might be ingested, it\nmight be applied topically. Narrator: They even have CBD\noil products for your pets. I stopped by a cafe in New York which sells all sorts\nof CBD-infused products. I tried a CBD matcha\nlatte and a CBD macaroon. These snacks tasted great, and I felt a little more relaxed after, but it was hard to tell if the CBD was actually doing anything for me or if it was all in my head. Scientists are actually\nstill trying to figure out exactly how CBD affects the body. Lee: So, there really\nis a scientific basis for understanding why CBD can work, but we're still really a long\nway of mastering the hows. Narrator: Still, CBD\nmay have more benefits than just a relaxing afternoon. Some initial studies have\nshown that CBD can help with a number of different\nmedical conditions. In fact, in June 2018, the FDA\napproved the first CBD drug, Epidiolex, which is\nused to treat epilepsy. So, who knows? Perhaps we'll be seeing CBD in more places than just cannabis-decorated\nvans in the future.", "UOHqixhs_Hs": "come on come on do you go do you like sweet baby boy alright we'll go after hi welcome to Angel's anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy -

should holler you should force yourself to tolerate them but right you know in many of the people that we work with you know cutting out alcohol altogether to begin with is very important but then adding some of that back in can certainly have benefits for multiple reasons can we talk about CBD and THC we both live in states where that's legal now yeah and I can tell you I first started doing CBD oil last year and just to help out with with sleep I've heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "xsg-LbxlGao": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to talk about can CBD oil help with depression now full disclosure we sell CBD oil on our website a cure botanicals calm that we make from hemp that we grow on our farm so I guess it's a little bit like asking a barber if you need a haircut but all I'm gonna do here is share my story and what's worked for me I also want to say that none of this is medical advice this is just my experience and what's worked for me in my life with that being said let's get into it so I think I first started noticing feelings of being down when I was probably 9 or 10 and I didn't even know what it was at the time and it wasn't until I was maybe 12 years old I started getting these really sharp shooting pain headaches like I called them lightening headaches B couldn't know what was going on and so I remember 12 years old and I started researching on the internet what this was and I finally found a website that said that it could be related to depression and before then I had never even considered myself to be depressed I'd never even never even crossed my mind started talking to somebody and then they said yeah I think you should go on some medication so they prescribed me Zoloft and they had to keep upping the the medication dosage and they said if this doesn't work for you we're gonna have to put you on antipsychotics luckily that dosage of zola off actually worked enough to where we didn't need to take that route however you know the depression didn't go away it was always sort of there and just maybe wasn't as deeply felt and as I got into high school I discovered cannabis and that actually really helped with with depression and insomnia fast forward I go to college I begin drinking I begin experimenting with pills like benzodiazepines which is an anti-anxiety med things like klonopin which changes your brain chemistry to where your brain is then dependent on these drugs it can't really function without them you know that kind of led me down this path of of substance abuse and dependence and and felt no joy and felt no hope and was just at about his rock bottom as I think I could give where I just realized that something needed to change and I'd say that's probably the first step is determining that you want to change and I know people are gonna say it's not that easy look I know it's not that easy that's just the first step it's just creating that intention in your life to say but I want to take steps to try to get better the first action the simplest action that you can take is start eating healthy I cannot stress how important that is and and I didn't realize it for so long it I was eating crap I was I mean in college I was living off of things like hot dogs and pasta and beer and that was like my diet I mean it was just putting crap food I mean 25 cent burritos just the worst food you could buy just putting it into my body and always wondered why I had no energy and why I was always depressed again this all comes down to brain chemistry and your brain chemistry is very dependent on what you're putting in your body if you eat like crap you're gonna feel like crap so the first and simplest thing you can do is change your diet and eat something I eat a diet that is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables lean protein just overall healthy food limit the junk food limit the alcohol intake and you will notice a big difference right off a bat that's the first thing easiest thing you can do step number two konna ties into that and that's to get active to exercise and if you can if you can do that exercise outside I think there's an added benefit to being outdoors breathing in fresh air and and being under the Sun the Sun is good for endorphins and I want to say when I was getting off of all my medication like you can't just cut it off cold turkey so this was a battle for me I had to go down sliver by sliver and the way I did that was I worked out like a maniac I mean I would go to the gym and I would just go hardcore for about two hours completely exhaust myself but what I was doing and I didn't even know it at the time but what I was doing was rebuilding my brain chemistry I was releasing those those chemicals naturally so that I didn't need to get them from a he'll third thing I would recommend is to develop some sort of a spiritual practice now this could be prayer meditation this could be sitting quietly in the woods this could be finding a way to just serve others I believe serving others is a form of spiritual practice and what that does is it gives us a sense of purpose it gives us a sense of meaning it gives us a sense of community and you know it kind of helps tape the focus off yourself which when you're in that state can really be useful because when you're in it it's like a negative loop pattern you've got these negative thoughts that just keep on circulating and they wear you down I mean it's just non-stop all day from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep and a lot of times you can't even sleep because they keep on going around and around I've been there I understand I mean just trying to do random acts of kindness if helping people at this point is a little overwhelming I get it that's why I would suggest develop some sort of a meditation you know there's so many guided meditation practices out there which I think really help until you can kind of get into the flow yourself and and just trying to establish that sort of calm that peace that quietness fourth thing that I would recommend doing is surround yourself with good people you need to surround yourself with positive influences and you need to cut out all the negative influences in your life now that might sound really harsh these could be people that have been friends or even family members that are maybe just constant negativity and you know they say misery loves company but all that company does is keep both people miserable so you know it almost becomes a codependent relationship with two miserable people keeping each other miserable and that's not good for anybody focus on the people that bring positivity encouragement and love into your life you know find people with common interests join a meetup group volunteer your time we as humans need that we are tribal people and we need support from other humans especially in times of hardship and that's why I would say definitely find a group of people that can encourage you and kind of pick you up when you get down now the fifth thing I want to touch on is supplements now I left this one for last and this guy's back to our original question can CBD oil help with depression CBD oil is a supplement right and so I feel like yes it can absolutely it can but it's not a magic bullet what CBD oil does for me now personally when I take it is I typically feel within about five to ten minutes and it's sort of just this like it'll kind of just bring things a little bit more into focus calm my mind down enough to where I can think clearly and that's the thing we go back to these negative loop patterns when you're just in that you can't see any way out of it and you can't even begin to uncover what's really bothering you so none of this is a magic bullet none of this is easy but what I believe supplements like CBD oil could do is just maybe give you the tools to begin unpacking some of that baggage and getting in there and and really trying to figure out what is actually going on and it's really hard to do when your mind is just in these constant negative loop patterns a lot of times people from the outside might look and say what's what's the matter what's what's so bad and the thing is is they can't see it because they're not in it and you can't see any way out of it because you're so stuck in it you have no other perspective I want to make this very clear that if you are suffering from depression it is not a sign of weakness in fact it's oftentimes a sign of greatness and I believe that once you do overcome it you have a tremendous amount of power from having gone through it so keep that in mind you know I am the person I am today because I went through these things and I wouldn't change it because to be honest I never thought I could be this happy I mean I really didn't and so for me I'm incredibly grateful for everything in my life because I've gone through it because I've seen the other side and know that things do get better and I want to encourage you if you know somebody who is currently suffering with depression please share this video with them and I'm gonna put my email in the cop in the description down below and and anybody out there who's watching this who's suffering with depression shoot I want to help I want to help other people get through this because I feel so incredibly fortunate to have come out on the other side and I want to do whatever I can again if you're interested in CBD oil you can check out our website at Caribou tanika's com I don't care if you buy it from us or even if you take it at all I think you can get through this without it but I do believe that it is an extra tool that can help kind of get things moving in the right direction find a trusted source make sure that they're doing testing make sure that it's a pure product and and just kind of go from there because there's a lot of snake oil out there and I wouldn't want you to to try it and then say oh this doesn't work and you've wasted your money I know that it works but you got to be getting it from a good source anyway thank you guys for watching I'll see y'all next time if you guys like this video and you'd like to see more like

subscribe to study couch thanks for watching and have a good day", "zqRNCSX_uJQ": "hey what's going on everybody hope you have a healthy day and if you see what's going on out there you know CBD is extremely popular there's so many companies so many different options it could make your head spin well it was a couple years ago I actually tried a CBD brand didn't really do anything for me I tried a liquid I tried a cream just it just didn't work and I do see this where people say some it will work some don't and it was just a few weeks ago I connected with a company called calm by wellness and had the opportunity to have a conversation what I really impress or what really impressed me was that the company wanted to spend time to introduce themselves what they do what they stand for and then talk about one of their products which they sent to me to try and review it's called sleep and again I've had the opportunity now for a good couple weeks to try it I really wanted to make sure and see how it worked for me before I shared with you now I'm gonna put a link in the description where you could learn more about the company and if you really dive in and learn about the company I think you're gonna be impressed as was I so they thought we'd try sleep before we try some of the other products this is a 17 milligrams per serving blueberry lavender and as far as the ingredients well a couple other things its THC free which was really important to know and when you go onto their website you'll see they've got lab information lab reporting so you'll be able to get that there as well it's a broad spectrum hemp extract sleep turban blend and it's made in the USA so it's all-natural non-gmo organically grown gluten free and again it's processed and made here in the USA as far as the the different blend that it has in there it's got lavender flower chamomile it's got hops lemongrass hoe wood which is leaf orange and pine and jasmine so it's got a really nice combination it's kind of got a fruity combination and as far as taking it you take it about an hour or where there abouts an hour before going to sleep and the recommended is just to take a drop put it under your tongue and then let it dissolve in under your tongue I let it dissolve there about for a met a minute and then I swallow so as far as the product and how it worked for me I tried it both actually with one full dropper and two full droppers just to see the difference so initially the one dropper I felt like it worked okay for me then it went to two droppers and I felt I was getting a bit groggy when I was getting up so then I went back to one but as I started using it over the several days and over a couple weeks what I found is that it does kick in for me where I start getting more relaxed and I then really start getting very tired when I'm laying on my bed and I used before I go to sleep I use I use an acupressure mat and I and I found that when I started using this I really started getting tired now during the night I'm still waking up I'm going to the bathroom so that's not changing a lot but I do find that it is helping me get a bit more relaxed and definitely feeling more tired to fall asleep quicker so that's the results for me so I will say that I do feel like it is working for me when you are looking at the CBD companies it's so important to really know what's behind the company and when you go to the website and they really have a nice website there's a ton of testimonials as well you'll find that they you know they just talk about that they have an in-house farmers in how scientists they also do third-party testing and also as as far as what they do versus other company so other companies outsource their farmers they outsource their science labs and they're not quality tested and this company does do their testing again you can also scroll down and then here is the certificate of analysis and when I actually was talking to some my friends and sharing on Facebook about it they were asking me do you have that and they do have that there and to me that is impressive so you definitely wanted to check out the website so there you go that's my experience they have a number of other products that you can try as well but if you are in need of sleep you know again it's worked for me it's worked for me some and will definitely continue taking it and look forward to trying other products so I'll try and answer any questions you have but please click on the link where you can get more information greatly appreciated if you find this video helped I definitely appreciate also a thumbs up and hope this will work for you as well if you are taking this product I'd love if you would leave your comments that would be really helpful and you know again if you have any questions I'll try and answer those harde everybody have a very healthy day thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video take care", "j3AtaxZRIJE": "[Music] so this is part one of making an anti-inflammatory full-spectrum hemp oil SAP this is the base the salve base which is olive oil which you can use straight organic olive oil or like I did I steeped for a few weeks this jar full of comfrey with olive oil poured over it and then I drained it out poured it in here there's a half a cup of coconut oil there are three tablespoons of shea butter and about four tablespoon or eight blocks of rock cow butter so you put all that together and then you're going to put it in a double boiler and heat it up part two if you don't have a double boiler you can do this which is what I do a larger pan with water in it and a smaller pan with your oil base in the top of it and you just keep stirring until all the solid particles liquefy so here's the dish and the consistency is soft but I like it I brought it out of the freezer and it's been sitting at room temperature for few minutes so it's okay so I poured the dissolved from the top of the double boiler into a measuring cup where I've already put my essential oils and the DIY hemp oil which this stuff is awesome and I did add a little copaiba oil now it's all in here and ready to get put in little containers and that will", "s-0pg9n7FsA": "my last question which is probably on many people's minds can you file a drug test for taking CBD it's a practical one that depends right so if you if you're extracting from a plant so in the plant even if you say him right that's not just see me Dean there's always a ratio twenty to one thirty to one naturally occurring in that plant so a hemp plant so hemp and marijuana are legal definitions cannabis is scientific right so we've put limits we said not more than 0.3% THC that's what qualifies a hemp plant if you remove the plant material if I remove ninety five percent of the material and I've got five percent cannabinoids left in some ratio that's no different than if I remove 70% of plant and I have 30 percent cannabinoids but you know it's higher THC but the ratio is still the same so you know I think some nuance around what that term means and if you're taking a whole plant extract and then as THC you will probably fail the drug test and if they isolate the CBD then you probably won't but that depends on what analytical standards are we talking dipstick or is their cross reactivity or whatever so I would say it's certainly feasible definitely with plant extracts full-spectrum broad-spectrum and less likely with Islip it's still possible and I think this is a really important point because especially now that hemp derived CBD is legal I think most folks don't realize that it can still contain up to 0.3 percent THC and that yes especially if you're dosing chronically absolutely that could lead to a positive drug test and we have data we actually you know did this and you know tested folks that are just taking hemp extract and they're popping positive left and right in pretty decent quantities because it's storing in your fat and again point three percent you're like that's so teeny no it's by volume right so actually 0.3% when you think about a milliliter of CBD or something like that and an extract it's up to what two point eight point seven to seven milligrams so ten will get you high so four milliliters will get you high there's forty four milliliters in a shot glass so if it's at point three percent you know that's that's what a teaspoon so a teaspoon at point three percent would get you eye", "_jeNJE8Rh28": ">> [Inaudible]. Thanks, Chad. So yes, today I'll talk\na bit about the use of cannabinoids to treat pain. And I have no financial\ndisclosures that relate to this. And before I get into\nthe scientific background of how we actually use\ncannabinoids to treat pain, I think we just need to acknowledge what a\nmess this situation is; so [laughter] we have\nfairly few states with legal medical cannabis. This slide as of a couple\ndays ago is outdated because Illinois just passed\nadult use recreational law, so we now have 11 states\nwith adult use cannabis. And this is despite\nit being schedule one so under the Controlled\nSubstances Act, it has no accepted medical use,\nand a high potential for abuse. So this has created such a\nmismatch for so many clinicians who want to know how to\nadjust the use of cannabis in their patients,\nand how to do this in a safe and effective way. And so to this point\na little bit -- we just published a paper little\nwhile ago, we see the conditions for which people are\nactually using cannabis. Far and away, the most\nprevalent qualifying condition for your cannabis\nlicense is chronic pain. It's about two-thirds\nof the total number of qualifying conditions, and\nabout 80% of the total patients. So what does this look\nlike then in Michigan? We're one of the biggest\nstates in terms of the number of medical cannabis patients. We have about 270,000\npatients as of 2017. And we've had medical\ncannabis -- a medical cannabis\nlaw since 2008. But because of this mismatch,\nwe have a lot of uncertainty about how to actually\ninterface with patients. A lot of physicians are\nuncomfortable regarding certifications for\ntheir patients. They're not actually saying,\n\"This is the prescription, and this is how you\nshould go use cannabis.\" Instead, what they're doing\nwhen they sign an application for your medical cannabis\nlicense is they're saying, \"Yes, you have a condition\nthat qualifies you under the state law to\npossess cannabis up to two and a half ounces and 12 plants, and go and figure it\nout for yourself.\" And so because so many\nphysicians are uncomfortable with this, there's also a lot\nof clinics that have popped up where all they do is\nmedical cannabis certifications. You can go in, get a five-minute\nappointment, pay 100 bucks or something, and voila,\nyou have a license, but still no idea of\nwhat necessarily to do. So we have that mess\non that side. And then of course, as\neverybody's been talking about today, we're in the\nmidst of an opioid crisis. And there's a lot of interest in\nusing cannabis or cannabinoids, the active compounds\nin the cannabis plant, to treat both opioid\naddiction, but then some of the undergoing chronic pain that has driven this\nopioid crisis. And there is some support\nof this being plausible. So we know from a lot\nof preclinical studies, as well as like there\nare some clinical trial that there does seem to be\nsome synergism between THC, one of the compounds in\ncannabis, and opioids. So in this recent\nclinical trial, they gave people Oxycodone, as\nwell as [inaudible]cannabis. And they found with\nsub-threshold dose of the cannabis and\nOxycodone together, they got the same\npain relief with -- as they saw with a\nhigher dose of the opioid. So there's some interest\nthere, and might be a way that people are able to reduce\ntheir opioid consumption when they start using cannabis. But then we also see statewide\nanalyses where people have shown that states with medical\ncannabis legislation have lower rates of opioid overdose,\nlower opioid prescribing than the states without. And having active operating\ndispensaries is really important for these effects. We then also see numerous --\ndozens of studies at this point in the US, in Israel, in\nCanada, where people say, \"Yes, I've substituted\ncannabis for opioids, and I do so for better\nsymptom management, and I do so because there's\nfewer adverse side effects.\" So, again, schedule\none substance, not much clinical guidance,\nwidespread availability. You can see why we're\nin quite a mess. So I think that what we need\nto do next is then figure out where the evidence\nlies for chronic pain, how we can use this in a\nsafe of a way as possible, and how to conceptualize\ncannabis in the correct way, which, at least in my view,\nis rather than thinking of it as a panacea or a poison, which\nare really the extended -- the dichotomist use that are\nreally out there at this point, and think of it, \"Well, this is\npotentially one pain medication that people could use,\nand this is the way in which they could do so.\" So with that, let's drum\ninto some of the science, so in terms of definition\nand background, then I'll go into some of the risks that\nare known about cannabinoids, their role in pain\nmanagement, looking at some of the clinical trials, and\nthen some practical tips and guidelines on how\nof use these compounds. So and much of this comes\nfrom the National Academies of Sciences 27 through --\nreport on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids. There is some stuff that's\nbeen updated since this time, but this is a really\ngood place to start. It's available to\nanybody online, so I would suggest looking\ninto it if you would like. In terms of definitions, so I'm\ngoing to use \"cannabis\" instead of \"marijuana\", just because \"cannabis\" is the botanical\nname, and \"marijuana\" has, you know, [inaudible]\nxenophobic history to the word, so I'll just avoid\nusing that for now. And so there's subspecies\n[inaudible]. And then we also\nhave cannabinoids, which is active compounds,\nboth in the cannabis plant, but also we -- our\nbody makes its own endo or endogenous cannabinoids. And then there's also\nsynthetic cannabinoids, which either are replicas\nof the phytocannabinoids that are synthesized\nin the labs, or novel cannabinoid\ncompounds that we think of as having potential\ntherapeutic uses. These compounds all\ninterface with the endogenous or endocannabinoid system,\nwhich is the set of receptors from your naturally\nrecurring ligands and enzymes regulating control. And this system is so ancient,\nso widespread, and involved in so many functions including\nmemory, analgesia, stress, appetite, sleep that\nthere's a lot of excitement about targeting it for\nclinical applications. I guess I can't tell\nif it shows up nicely. The two most common\nreceptors in this system, the ones that are the\nmost widely studied, are cannabinoid receptors\none and two. CB1 is one of the\nmost common receptors in the central nervous system. And it is -- when\nit's activated, it tends to be more involved in the sleep memory analgesia\nappetite, those responses. By contrast, CBQ is found\nmore in the immune system. And when it's activated, it\ndoesn't seem to have any kind of psychoactive effects in the\nsame way as the CB1 receptor, so there's a lot of\ninterest in targeting that immune system-related\nconditions. So next let's go into\nsome of these cannabinoids and what we know about them. At this point, I'm just\ngoing to touch on two, even though there's over 100\nwhich have been discovered. But the most commonly studied\nis THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. It's analgesic, it's\nmood-altering, and appetite-stimulating, and it partially binds\nto both CB1 and CB2. I will note that even though\nthere's a lot of concern about the psychoactive\neffects and all of that of THC when in smoked cannabis,\nthat synthetic THC as dronabinol has\nbeen legal for decades for treating chemotherapy\ninduced nausea and vomiting, and AIDS-related anorexia. So there is a known\ntherapeutic use. It's FDA-approved. It's a schedule-free substance, while herbal cannabis\nis schedule one, further muddying\nconfusion in the waters about what's going on with this. Hot on the scene is\nCBD or cannabidiol. We've known about this\ncompound as long as we've known about THC, but there's so\nmuch more excitement about it at this point because\nit is non-intoxicating. It seems to protect against some of the psychoactive\neffects of THC. And then in a lot of\npreclinical studies, it has anti-inflammatory\neffects, it has effects on pain, and most excitedly, is a\nvery potent anticonvulsant. In fact, the FDA just approved\na CBD-based drug last -- I think it was last June\nin 2018 called \"Epidiolex\" for childhood epileptic\ndisorders. And it is schedule five, so\nvery low abuse potential. I would be remiss if I didn't\nmention the other cannabinoids. I'm not going to go into\nthem much, except to say that there's over 100 of them. And there's a big dispute in the\nmedical and scientific community at this point about how\nto account for them, because classically\npharmaceuticals will try to find the active ingredient\nand synthesize that and give that in isolation and say,\n\"Okay, that's a good -- that's the effect that we want.\" But because there are so many\nterpenes responsible for aroma and taste, et cetera, as well\nas these other cannabinoids and herbal [inaudible],\npeople want to know, \"Should we use a\nfull spectrum product or should we use an isolate?\" So I'm not going to\ngo anymore into that, but just to say that\nit's out there. In terms of photos, you\ncan see that there -- it's a close-up of\na cannabis bud, and then a cannabis\noil [inaudible]. And you can -- now that\nCBD is so exciting and hot on the scene, you\ncan buy it anywhere. You can buy it on Amazon, you\ncan buy it at gas stations, you can but it at CVS. And to the frustration\nof scientists who want to actually do studies on\nthis stuff, but you have to get a scheduling license\nto do so, you can buy it for your dog [laughter] in\ncase your buddy has anxiety or joint pain, or\nsomething like that. You can get this in BarkBox\ndelivered to your house. [Laughter] So we also see that this situation is\nevolving quite quickly. So in 2018 -- at\nthe end of 2018, President Trump signed\nthe 2018 Farm Bill that legalized industrial\nhemp, and thus opened the door for the availability for many\nhemp derived CBD products; so they have less\nthan .3% THC in them. But there's not a\nlot of uncertainty about how the FDA is\ngoing to regulate that, so there are concerns about\nproducts that have heavy metals because hemp is a\nbioaccumulator. There's also a lot of shady,\nyou know, companies out there who don't have good processes in\nplace that remove the solvents that are used to extract these\ncompounds, or they use a lot of pesticides and then\ndon't do anything about that when they're actually\ndoing the extraction. So it's really important\nto go to -- ideally to go to a place that has third-party\nindependent testing for metals, for solvents, for\npesticides, and then also so you'll actually know\nwhat is in the product that your patients\nmight be using. One such place, there's a\nnonprofit called [inaudible] that has collaborated\nwith places like Johns Hopkins University. And they've done much of this\nsafety and potency testing, and have a list of product\nthat they verify as being safe and actually accurately labeled. And then lastly,\nin this definitions and background section,\nI just want to talk about how these compounds\nwork a little bit in the body, because this will come in later\nwhen we're talking about how to use them and the\neffectiveness. So pharmacokinetically, you\ncan see from this slide the way that THC shows up in\nthe blood [inaudible] administration groups. If anybody knows of anybody\nwho's injected cannabinoids, please let me know so that,\none, that injection one, it looks almost the\nsame as smoking. So you can just go with that. But if you [laughter] actually\ningest the compounds orally, you have less of a spike of\nTHC in the bloodstream and less of a fast taper, and instead\nyou have an extended -- it takes a while to hit\nand then an extended taper. So you can think about slow and fast release\nadministration groups for using these compounds,\nespecially knowing that the feeling of high maps onto those pharmakinetics\nreally nicely. And then lastly, about how\nthese interact in the body; we do seem to see a\nu-shaped curve for cannabis and cannabinoid effects. So with that in mind, what\nthis means is there's a kind of sweet spot above which if\nyou go above a certain point, you can end up overshooting\nyour medical dose, and then just get higher, in\nfact maybe even get worse pain. So if you look at the Y axis, you see a green plus\nand a red minus. The curve shows where\nsomebody's pain relief is. So maybe you have a low dose\nand you get a little bit of pain relief, you'd\nfind that sweet spot up at the top of that curve. But if you go past that, people\ncould have increased anxiety, they could have increased pain. So trying to figure\nout how to do that safely is something\nthat's really important when using these compounds. All right; so next let's\nmove into cannabinoid risks. I feel like this is\nreally important to go into because there's so\nmuch concern about this, just given that cannabis is\nstill a schedule one drug. And actually, this is where the\nbulk of the research funding from the National Institutes\nof Health has gone in the past. And we don't have that much info\non the medical risks of cannabis and cannabinoids because these\nstudies have typically looked at recreational users. But because many of these folks who are using it recreationally\nwould be considered the chronic heavy users, they're\nsmoking a lot daily, and tend to be younger,\nwe can say, \"Well, these are probably -- this\nis the worst case scenario of what this might look like, at\nleast as a surrogate right now.\" We know that smoking,\nnot really good. So the respiratory effects\nof that, those are some of most widely known\nrisks of cannabinoids, but there's also risk of\ndependence and addiction. About nine percent of people who use cannabis develop some\nkind of dependency issue. There's also increased rates\nof psychotic illness developed by people, especially using\ncannabis under the age of 25. I also need to addend the point\non dependence and addiction. People who use cannabis at a\nyounger age have about a double of that risk of addiction, so\nimportant to note that as well. And that's a particularly\nvulnerable population. And we see some long-term\neffects on memory and brain structure in\ncannabis users as well. In terms of in the acute phase,\nwe see dizziness, somnolence, euphoria, although some\npeople might not say that that is a risk, lightheadedness,\nanxiety, and others. Less commonly, but\nespecially seen in people who take way too much in\nterms of an edible dose, you'll see some vomiting,\nparanoia, occasionally seizures and hallucinations, although\nthose are more associated with the synthetic cannabinoids\nlike spice that people can buy on the street, not typically\ncannabis itself; and then, vehicle accidents, of\ncourse, and then lastly, as with the CBD products\nthat you can buy on Amazon, there's an uncertain\nquality of many of the herbal [inaudible]\nas well. So in states that don't have\ngood regulatory statutes in place about testing\nfor safety and potency, you can end up with things with\nbud mold on them like you see in that -- in the upper picture. And if somebody's\nimmunocompromised and smoking that, it can be\nreally serious and problematic if they get some kind of\nsystemic fungal infection. So in terms of the risks\nof medical cannabinoid use, as I said, we have much\nfewer data on this. The best study that I've\nseen came out of Canada on McGill called\nthe \"COMPASS Study\" and what they did was they\nfollowed folks using 12.5% THC smokable cannabis for a\nyear, and what they -- and compared to people\nwho were not using it in a chronic pain setting. And what they found is about\na double direct increase in minor adverse effects in\npeople who were using cannabis, compared to those who were\nnot, but also increases -- or improvements in pain\nand quality of life. So definitely a mixed\nprofile there, but in a place, excuse me, that needs a lot more\nwork, especially given that, you know, there are so many\npeople using cannabis medically and we just don't really\nhave a good sense of what that looks like risk wise. A couple studies that\ndid come out of Israel where they have more regimented\ntitration regimes have found that there's a pretty low risk\nprofile in elderly adults. They would be looking\nin a population of mixed cancer patients\nand they found with this titration regimen that they saw very\nfew adverse events. Okay; so going into the\nrole of cannabinoids and pain management,\nwe've talked a lot today about the mechanisms of\npain so I'm going to skip over this a little bit,\nexcept to remind you that there's the\nperipheral neuropathic and centralized pain states,\nand that people can have any of these in combination. In terms of preclinical models\nof pain, we know that CB1 and CB2 agonists are quite\neffective in many of these types of pain, but people\nare really concerned about the CB1 acting compounds because of the off-target\ncentral nervous system activity, the types of effects\nthat we'd associate with the cannabis high. While CB2 agonists\nthere's a lot of excitement about at this point because as\nI said, they don't really seem to produce that effect. And there's actually a company\nmaking a compound called [inaudible] that\nthey're testing in a lot of inflammatory disorders that doesn't really\nappear to bind to CB1. And so there's some\npotential there to maybe in the future see some\nCB2-specific compounds on the market. In terms of clinical\ntrials with chronic pain, the most recent meta-analysis\nthat looked at all of the clinical trials noted,\nas with all the other studies that have done this, that\nthese are short-length studies, they have small sample size, they have unrepresentative\ndosing of what people actually use. And they typically find a\nmodest decrease in pain, compared to placebo\nacross pain states. But most of this effect\nsize is driven by the data in neuropathic pain, using the\ncombination of THC plus CBT -- CBD excuse me, called \"sativex\", which is a sublingual\n[inaudible], it's a one-to-one\nratio of the two. It would be really nice, if\nI could give you more data about how CBD alone is effective\nin different types of pain, but unfortunately, I've only\nseen one study that has looked at that in any kind\nof long-term setting, and that has just been\npublished as an abstract, as opposed to a published paper. They did find decreases in pain\nand improvement in function, but mostly in men with\nknee osteoarthritis. I will say also that there's\na pretty clear mismatch between these clinical trials\nand the observational studies in which many people using\ncannabis who have been followed over time they say that they've\ngreat success, they've been able to taper off opioids,\nwhatever it might be. But that uncontrolled nature of their dosing makes\nit really unclear about how exactly they're doing\nthat, and how to translate that into a more\nclinical setting. Because we've talked\nabout -- oops, excuse me; because we've talked about\nsurgical pain a little bit as well, I'll just\ntouch on that briefly. There's only been about seven\nstudies that have been done in the acute or surgical\npain setting, and unlike in the\nchronic pain space, there's pretty much no\nevidence that cannabinoids that have been tested thus far\nare effective in this setting. But similarly to the\nchronic pain studies, fairly limited in length. Many of them actually use\nnovel cannabinoid compounds that have CB1 intoxication\npsychoactive effects. And none of these\nstudies used CBD. And given that there's actually\na CBD clinical trial that came out in the last week, that there\nwas a lot of excitement about it because it seemed to decrease\n-- what am I trying to say, it seemed to decrease\ncravings and anxiety related to heroin addiction\nand recovery in people who were ex-heroin users. There's a lot of excitement\nabout using it potentially as an opioid sparing medication,\npotentially in a surgical space, or as an opioid substitute,\nagain just CBD alone. Okay. So in summary, then,\nwe know that cannabinoids and chronic pain, that\nthey do that plausibility for therapeutic value. We know that dosing\nis really important, and we know that using them in the right people\nis also important. We need to consider how much to\nuse, because we want to figure out that sweet spot\non that u-shaped curve so we don't overshoot\nan effective dose. We want to know about\ncannabinoid content, THC versus CBD, and then the\nadministration groups as well, because smoking all day\nevery day probably is not an effective strategy. But it's possible\nthat you could think of using a long-acting\nform of a cannabis compound like an edible, and then have -- or a capsule, and\nthen having something for short-term great\nfor pain relief. So actually I was just talking to Evan Latinas [assumed\nspelling], my colleague at [inaudible] Medicine,\nand something that they do is they give people\nCBD alone for the daytime, and if people have\nissues with sleeping, they give them a little bit\nof THC with CBD at nighttime to help with that, as well\nas the CBD [inaudible] for your pain, starting\nat very low doses so that people can avoid\ngetting too high, incidentally, by taking a product that they\ndon't know what's in it or one that has too much THC. So I guess along\nthose lines, then, some practical tips would then\nbe to start low and go slow; so again, those low doses\nso you don't overshoot, using a verifiable source with\ncredible third-party testing so you know what you're getting and you're avoiding heavy\nmetals, pesticides, et cetera. And then because we know that smoking is really\nnot probably a good way to ingest medicine\nif you can avoid it, using other administration\ngroups that are available, tinctures, capsules, vaporizing\nif somebody absolutely feels that they have to inhale,\nthings of that nature. And using a combination\nof CBD and THC, because using just\nTHC alone seems to have a much lower toxic\nthreshold for psychosis and potentially other\nadverse events, than using that combination\ntogether. And actually, Dan and I\npublished a paper in \"Annals of Internal Medicine\"\nwith a commentary of how we think people should be\nusing these compounds from more of a harm reduction standpoint\nand on a safety standpoint. And if anybody's\ninterested in that, I'm happy to send it your way. So with that, I know I'm at the\nend of my time, I'd be happy to take any questions. \"And thanks so much for\nyour kind attention. [ Applause ]", "Dncnf1mNTpA": "so what exactly is in these cbd products mimit uh and i met up at a lab here in los angeles a few weeks ago because we wanted to find out take a look our teams managed to obtain some vials of cbd being sold by several different companies claiming to have our endorsement we send them to dr pedram sullenpoor to be tested at a lab we want to know exactly what is in this alleged cbd it's time to get to the bottom of this dr salampur how are you how are you thank you very much for coming can i show you around we'll follow you fantastic quite a large operation thank you so this is where the testing is done for thc cbd all of the cannabinoids all of the pesticides there are 66 of them that we test for and all of the heavy metals what's really important to remember is that cbd is regulated by the fda for only one drug epidiolex and that's for two rare childhood seizure disorders for everything else it's the wild wild west so you test these things here that aren't regulated and you're looking for what over here so over here we're looking for heavy metals right cadmium arsenic mercury lead pesticides and those things show up in a lot of the cbd products that come through here unfortunately they do because remember hemp is a bioaccumulator so whatever is in the ground gets sucked up into that plant if there's lead in the ground it's going to get sucked up into the plant and whatever gets sucked up into the plant is going to end up in the final product unless it's intentionally taken out what have you found in general we have found pesticides in general we have found heavy metals we have found mycotoxins aspergillus causes aspergilloma in patients that are immune compromised that can wreak havoc some of the people that are seeking this out are already immune compromised then they're especially vulnerable to the heavy metals the pesticides in particular to the fungus that you just mentioned because it grows like these big moth balls in your lungs takes over your breathing ability it can kill you it can burn its weight in the arteries it means horrible death i had no idea you were finding those kinds of elements as well it's just sloppy they're not bothering because they don't care about the people they're just a checkbook they're a credit card yeah they just want their money they don't care about the consequences and when if a consequence arises they're gone i mean they're like trying to sack fog you can't find them they just poof remember testing for this stuff isn't cheap one of these things costs half a million dollars this is the same kind of equipment that tests baby formula so what you're describing costs money and there's a financial incentive if you don't have to to not do it and then they're using our names to validate it fraudulently it doesn't cost them anything to steal our names they don't have to pay you money to test it appropriately it's cash cash cash which is all they're seeing dollar signs when they're talking to people that ask us for advice well when you skip steps and steal names it's easy it's all profit that's right so was there actually cbd at the level that's supposed to be in these products there often is not as much cbd as they purport to put in there because cbd can be very expensive it can cost close to ten thousand dollars a pound for the cbd so you can imagine there's a pretty significant economic disincentive not to put cbd in the product if you don't have to and no one's going to check could you take us through the actual products that we said absolutely sure so we tested a product that came to us from someone that was purporting to have you be their spokesperson but the test that we did on this failed it failed because it is not safe for human consumption under any circumstance it failed because it was too high in its lead content in lead in lead 15 times higher than safe levels 500 times higher than our level of detection okay 15 times higher than safe so this isn't a close call this is highly toxic highly toxic and very dangerous because lead accumulates and again because nobody takes just one of these pills or one droplet this is stuff that people use continuously it's interesting that one of the products that we brought here that tested positive for lead 15 times above acceptable level is called verified

guys welcome back to my channel I'm - a case of the Queen and today I want to talk to you about my experience using IMC the oil lotion and this one is from Anna Lou natural and it's very carousel lion so what else further ado let's dive on it I don't know if you've noticed but I've seen so many company advertised skincare products with hemp seed oil in it so of course I was curious to try it and I'm very happy that people to send you this it's the animals natural and aloe Naturals channeis L botanical body lotion it's a chamomile and works relief flavour and known as harmony so this lotion contains a plant extract as the name suggests and that's actually good for us because it provides antioxidants it's anti-inflammatory and what all of this does for our skin is that it helps us with agent CH gracefully and it also helps your skin to stay hydrated and protects you from environmental damage the next thing I really like about this lotion is that they use a hundred percent URM seed oil and the fact that I use this means that you get all the nutrients and vitamins that comes with the MC know else so for example you get vitamin E B and C as well as omega fatty acids there are a few other features of the solution that I really like for one is tc3 they use organic ingredients is gluten free it's vegan and also is cruelty free the thing that I like the best about this is that it has the vitamin C and aloe vera in it and you know that vitamin C house to improve your complexion and aloe vera helps with retaining moisture in your skin so it makes it very soft let me show you the texture of this I really like that it's not thin at all like agent Jessie there it is so its first smooth and it really observes quickly into your skin and it's very moisturizing so I'm just gonna wash my hand I'm gonna use black soap so you know it's a bit drying for the skin so you can see and see how my see rising this is so I just washed my hand let me show you this part right here maybe that's a bit too much so it goes on very small and it feels really good to be honest feels really really good and you see it's not greasy or anything this yes can see it looks yes and it feels really nice but here's the thing about it it smells like like we'd be surprised it just smells like weed I know that a cancer line is fairly new so they're still working on making new flavors and if they make one that I like then of course I would definitely use it because I really like the ingredients I like how it feels on my skin I like on my service and it is my older downside is the smell I've seen reviews online where some people actually like the smell of it because it it picks them up so if you're someone that we'd smell picks you up then this probably would be perfect for you but for me I don't think I would feel comfortable wearing this out the thing about it is that it doesn't last for very long to be honest smell I think two hours or so cuz I had it on for a while and didn't really smell it that much but because I know it smells like that I don't know if maybe I've just gotten used to the smell after two hours and then I don't smell it anymore whereas someone who just bump into me would smell it even a disaster so I'm not really sure if it's if it's just that I got used to it or it actually wears off but outside of that it has really good benefits but they make another flavor then perfect I would actually buy my wonders maybe laughing or wisdom or any other flavor or even flavorless I think that would actually work too well thanks a lot for watching my video

here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out factory6cbd.com watch more of our videos this is trent the wizard with factory six factoids again we'll see you next time you", "43C5YlAV1QM": "Cannabidiol or CBD for short, is an oil derived from cannabis. It contains none of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, so there is no \u2018high\u2019 from it. But the many health benefits claimed for CBD including: reducing inflammation, pain relief and reducing anxiety has seen its use in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics become one of the fastest growing trends in the process industry. Silverson high speed, high shear mixers are increasingly being used for R&D and small scale production in this emerging market. They're ideal for a wide range of applications, including blending, emulsifying, dissolving, disintegrating and powder/liquid mixing. A Silverson can easily mix liquids of widely different viscosities, so high viscosity CBD oil can be blended in a fraction of the time taken by conventional mixers. One of the main production challenges is dispersing the oil into aqueous systems such as beverages, as minimising the droplet size is the key to maximising the yield of the active ingredient. With a Silverson this can be achieved almost instantaneously. The same goes for other ingredients such as flavouring essences which can be difficult to disperse. For emulsions such as creams and lotions, the high shear action of a Silverson mixer finely disperses the droplets to give a stable emulsion with a typical droplet size of 2 - 5 microns. Finer emulsions down to 0.5 microns can also be achieved, depending on the formulation. By simply changing the workhead, the mixer can also be used to perform many other operations such as preparation of gels and sugar solutions, disintegrating solids and incorporating powdered ingredients such as stabilisers and other supplements. Another advantage of Silverson mixers is scaling up from the laboratory to full production is a straight forward process, as all our mixers are engineered to the same fine tolerances and exceptional quality we have been known for, for over 70 years. Whether you're looking to make beverages, gummies, snacks, baked goods or creams, shampoos, lotions or capsules, a Silverson mixer offers the most versatile and efficient solution to your mixing requirements.

crystal powder and despite everything you've heard in the last few years this is 100% legal in all 50 states and it is real in today's episode of thermal mermaid were making New England summer body butter infused with CBD and scented with cedar wood and cinnamon now for those of you who are brand new to CBD this is a chemical that's been extracted from the hemp plant and in decades past using CBD was illegal along with its cousin THC which as you know some people smoke now CBD can be consumed or it can be used topically and the products that we have here is made for topical use it's packaged specifically from soap supply companies to go into cosmetics it's not for consumption now this is what it looks like when you buy one gram of isolate powder but you can buy it already suspended in shea butter or in an oil like coconut oil if you want to now I find this way easier to measure because I can see just how much I'm putting into my formula for myself these tiny little spoons are meant to measure 0.15 gram of powder and I'm going to show you here that 10 of these heaping spoonfuls divide one gram perfectly so one spoonful it's about one tenth of a gram now it is a little easier to divide it this way because for me it's a real hassle to get my scale to measure such a small weight if you want to be more accurate you can weigh it but I find that this is always the same measurement for me now if you want to learn more about CBD or cannabis you can learn more in my book cannabis cosmetics this is available on Amazon or you can download an instant PDF copy when you become a member at thermo mermaid calm the links are listed below now this book does go into more detail about CBD and you'll get the full recipe that goes along with this demonstration along with 24 of the recipes that include hemp oil homemade soaps shampoos conditioners face masks lotions and a variety of other things so if you're into CBD as a topical treatment you may be interested in learning more now we're gonna get right into the actual body butter and demonstrate this product here are the list of ingredients that are going into this body butter shea butter you can use mango if you're allergic to Shea cocoa butter hemp oil coconut oil argan oil goat's milk arrowroot and of course our CBD crystalline powder putting this recipe together is not even slightly complicated I'm going to add all the oils into my kitchen mixer now the hard Orioles will stay hard except for the cocoa butter and typically I'll start with the shea butter and give it a little time to break down in the bowl before I start adding in the rest the mixer you see here is set on the slowest setting now once the shea butter starts to soften up I'll gradually add in the other oils and then just let the mixer do all the work even if it looks like it's not doing anything the only thing that you may need to do is loosen the shea away from the beater every few minutes but as the liquid oils melt the shea it'll start to turn into a sloppy soup as this happens just give the mixer time to get everything blended together now if you have spent any time browsing through the other recipes listed over in the members directory at thermal mermaid you may have noticed that I label some body butters winter butters and some of them summer butters but they have almost the exact same texture in the finished product well it's not the thickness that makes me classify whether a body butter is a winter or summer formula this is just by the way arbitrary it's just how I feel about it but when I do this it's based on how my skin feels after its applied now this combination of ingredients has a light slick feel that melts instantly on contact with your skin now as soon as it's applied after just a few seconds your skin feels matte and dry it doesn't leave any build-up or any waxy layer behind and this is really nice for a warm or even hot weather it won't leave your skin dewy and sweaty feeling now part of the light matte texture is in the goat's milk which is rich in caprylic acid lactic acid and also alpha hydroxy acid and of course this also eats up the dead skin cells leaving the surface of your skin feeling fresh and new so even some of these small subtle changes to your base recipe can give you a twist on how to use the product or whether it will feel like when it's finished now at this point we have our mixer running for about the last five minutes and we're just gonna let this work for another few minutes before we introduce the dry ingredients I want all of the oils to be as uniform as possible before we add the rest now if you're an avid lotion maker you'll notice I'm not adding a preservative to this particular batch and that's because what you're watching me make this is just a gift for a friend who's gonna be graduating from Wellesley this week and I'll be going up to give this to her in person so I'm not gonna be selling this now although this product does not have any water in it and it will be perfectly fine for several months without a preservative I always put a preservative in anything that goes out for retail and I recommend that so you may notice that the preservative is listed in the printable recipe over on the website but we're not adding it in right here in this demonstration and in goes the goat's milk and the arrowroot and of course you can use corn starch if you don't put in the arrowroot those two are interchangeable and as soon as this is all blended in you'll start to notice that the butter starts looking fluffier and creaming and so we'll just give these two powders a moment to do their job while we continue mixing next we'll get the CBD powder blended in now this batch that I have right here will make four jars at about sixty grams each and each package I want a hundred milligrams of powder so the entire batch is going to get four scoops in order for me to get that 400 milligrams and of course this is a gift so here's my fourth scoop and put one extra scoop in just for my friend now our fragrance that we're adding today is a beautiful combination of cedar wood and cinnamon and you can make make this a novelty item if you want to you can pull it cannabis flower fragrance oil in there and it smells just like it and what happens is is that younger people love the surprise of something scented cannabis they're picking it up at your market tables it does draw a lot of attention but in my experience my adult friends don't want to walk around smelling like cannabis and so I find that cedar wood and cinnamon it still has that edgy musk aroma and then you add the candy spice and it really is a really pretty combination but it won't get any rumors started at work so this is the one that I choose to put in once all the ingredients are incorporated I have the mixer turned on to the highest setting and now we just let it whip with air now the volume will immediately begin to expand it becomes fluffy we have these nice firm peaks and the texture of the oils start to become something like a wedding cake sugar icing and we all get the texture that we won after we let this whip for about three minutes and then we shut it all down now at this point our body butter is almost done we only have a few more steps to give it a unique look that will make it stand out from other butters with other fragrances you can get a nice close look at how fluffy and smooth the oils have become here once you have all the air whips to this texture this won't deflate it will stay fluffy like this as long as you keep your product at room temperature remember coconut oil becomes a liquid at 76 degrees and you do have coconut oil in here so you have to keep this below 70 degrees because as soon as one oil melts it all starts to separate and it might even encourage the rest of it to melt so you have to keep everything in a neutral temperature and this will stay and remain stable the two colorants that I'm using for this recipe are angry rose and so very green and this will give me a cinnamon and a hemp themed color each part only gets 1/8 of a teaspoon and this is just meant to tint the butter not color it I'm not real big on bright colors in my lotions because this is again it's it's a cosmetic grade mica which means it's also a shadow so you don't want the color to transfer on to your skin so a nice light tint will do the job okay if you caught my last episode which was a short webinar I told you that I will be giving registered members a place on my server and a website at their MoMA made to have their own e-commerce shopping cart now this is set up very similar to Etsy so you can sell your products online the only difference is you don't have any listing fees and there's actually no

tomorrow and you have to be registered at with your account at thermo mermaid Calm it's four siren and mermaid level registrations now what will be what we'll be doing after I post some of these beginner tutorials to get people started with their shopping cart is we'll be discussing how to integrate your sales to the people that you meet in the real world online and if you want to follow with these conversations and watch these tutorials then make sure you're subscribed to now piping the butter into the jar is probably the most fun part of this project now you don't have to pipe this if you don't want to it might be a little bit too much effort but this is how you get that to tone to swirl into the jar now when you're doing this for real meaning if you're making a retail product just set the jar on the scale and then pipe up to sixty grams and it'll just fill the jar right to the surface and you might need to tap it down a little bit if you can but I'm over filling these so you can get a good look at how the colors blend and you can see the texture as it's being filled I'm exaggerating these Peaks a little bit just for the photos but the cream will stay in this shape and once you've put it all into the jar now remember this is not a lotion to use this you only take just a pea-sized amount and then you rub that into the surface of your skin to get a lot of coverage if you end up using too much it'll feel like you just poured a teaspoon of oil into your hand when you touch the butter and then you slide it across your skin it melts on contact so this product is very condensed if you're gonna turn this recipe into a lightweight lotion we would end up filling 12 to 16 ounce jars not just this 60 grams that we're putting into these four ounce jars so just keep that in mind when you use it but also keep that in mind when you're selling it and you're pricing it because this is a much much more expensive product than your standard lotions that you would be making so now we have our finished product and let's get one last close-up of just how fluffy and stable this frosting is now let's take a quick look at how it absorbs into my skin I'm going to take just a tiny bit and then rub this into the back of my hand and as you can see it absorbs almost instantly and it doesn't leave anything behind the hemp oil and the goat's milk leave my hand feeling conditioned but no heavy layer and here's our finished product of the New England summer body butter infused with CBD and hemp oil I hope you guys enjoyed this episode and until tomorrow happy creating [Music] [Music]", "oKQGYOtTPeo": "[Music] and now for this one like the title says I'm going to be using a crock-pot I'm going to do maybe a cup maybe a little more of the coconut oil and a half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis we're going to throw it in the crock-pot below and we're gonna let it sit in there for about four to five hours go ahead and strain it through the cheesecloth basic simple straightforward take that half ounce of flour throw it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes grab a smoke if you'd like forty minutes later that should be looking a nice golden-brown perfect just about ready let's go ahead and turn our crock-pot on to low using organic unrefined coconut oil eight ounces add the half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis stir and cover leave on low for 3 to 5 hours I did four hours stir occasionally double layer the cheesecloth for a finer strain squeeze or press it to make sure you get all that oil out infusion complete overall in terms of the process I'm liking this method the best it's nice you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the flame if you have a gas stove top like me even an electric range you still got to keep an eye because it might get too hot and you don't want to burn anything that ease of the crock-pot I am feeling and I'm excited to use this coconut oil and some nice gummies you know I love doing it in a smoothie I'll do a video about that even though it's really simple just to show you how I do it let your imagination run wild throw this coconut oil whatever your heart desires thanks for chilling on truebloods TV check out one of these videos click the link and i'll catch you on the next [Music]", "u1iUDSIx7Jc": "it's really important to make sure we start with the clean urine sample which is what we did so this is what you take see believe ten days the video hi I'm David I love fitness wellness and all things CBD this is my office this is my temple and this it's all green TV is it a banger what's happening this David it's all green TV now other people worry if taken see buddy is gonna make them grow fail a drug test well we talked about it in other videos I thought proofs in the pudding so what have I done over the last 10 days I've been taking see 20 50 milligrams every single day and here's what happens now I want to show you that I've completely clear system beforehand so I've taken a test in advance we're gonna check back in the overlay so you can see that you can see I'm being completely honest I'm clean as a whistle so we've got on the under cameras on the best angle so this is the multi screen drug test can test for many different things I'm gonna dunk in here for just 15 seconds so I'm just gonna so there you go that's my piss on a jar so two lines means negative so let's find out over the next 10 days if taking CBD we're gonna use sample vial for no fail so it's not branded yet you'll see if broad-spectrum CBD can cause you to have all failed drug tests that's it so that's it this was the benchmark this was me introducing myself as an absolute weirdo let's find out what happens when we take CBD oil we use 500 milligram what do you think 10 days well we found a drug test so I doubt right so day one go ahead I'm branded bottle for a no-fail CBD we're gonna take one full pipette to 10 more bottle 500 milligram in that means 50 mg per day which is generally in good allowance to take per day part of this testing option we're taking these drops to see whether or not will we favor drugs tests of CBD so just so you know we could do 10 days Nora okay Google what's the date today it is Wednesday the 14th of August 2019 there you go so this is day 1 I think I want [Music] [Music] 25 20:19 what [Music] so got this little bad boy here this is a drum turf the actually test for loads more things than just CBD doesn't necessarily test for THC and this is the thing people worry about is see video oil will bring up the THC metabolites that's what shows up on a drugs test and if you work in an engineering industry nursing medical science police force whatever the last thing you wanted to be pulled up for a CDT compulsive drug test to get them in the forces and sharp like that the THC if you haven't ever had a split or haven't been smoking weed that's the last and once you can use basic CBI so we wanted to show that RC videos see videos that we work with as flexi we need our remedy it's even a dispensary use the same source it's broad spectrum CVD that means it's been filtered for today from from the source and i want to do a little turn they test to show you whether or not it comes up on a drug test and i'm going to show that it doesn't what it's hoping if you see this video didn't come up on the drug test i want to go for a piss I'm going to take a wife otherwise technically a sexual-harassment to get anyone else to fill me I can correspond to to just shake your home health drug test kit mean tampered with right one step so that's before don't give the piss for 10 to 15 seconds and then we read it in five minutes there's the tester as you can see we're looking for this one here at THC [Music] and we'll leave that for five minutes so I've already seen it was all come for anyway it doesn't wait five minutes generally but if the second line comes forever that means is negative which is an absolute relief I'm gonna show you here I'm gonna check on the camera can actually see it it is the second from the left see th see to try and bring it down this is really hard to try and do it while focusing on the camera you can see bring along TC warmly cocaine is quite faint but yeah there you go so you can take your CBD for last ten days taking 50 milligram every single day 500 milligram ball that was the broad spectrum CBD oil from Fleck CBD so if you do sports and your industry then you worried about drug tests or it's showing up for THC test cannabis tests what CAC is there you go 10 days that's what happened didn't shove the drug test I wouldn't fail a drug test so now you know you're not going to find a drugs test provider you take Bruce paradise of the CBD now you're gonna jump over on the next video and we're going to talk about what are the five most common CBD mistakes hit the link I'll see you there", "xsDY8gylRoY": "so you want to know about cannabis oil\nand autism in this video I'm

in this video what they're all look at what is CBD oil\nwhy would you take it and what does it do we're gonna look at the legal status\n surrounding cannabis oils and look at some of the potential side effects or\nside effects from the oils themselves so I'm gonna feature some products in\nthis video I was sent a bunch load of CBD products from a company called\nhealed By Hemp and you get them out there website healedbyhemp.us\nreally nice company they're really nice people and they sent me a bunch of lot\nof stuff that is CBD oil containing so I'm gonna go through some of those\nproducts show you guys all of the products but I'm gonna start off with\nthe CBD oil which I'm used to taking now this oil is a CBD oil which is a 3% CBD\noil and a 0.05 percent THC I'll get into a little bit about that in a minute and\nthis is from a company in Amsterdam and these are the cannabis oil oven if you\nguys can see them but this is let me just hold this up here\nI take on a day-to-day basis it's it's very cool and it comes in this like this\nthere's a little pot that you have a pipette with and you literally take the\noil out and you can prepare it into your mouth\nas so and then you put it under your tongue and it just dissolves under your tongue to your bloodstream so that is how to take the oil and that's what the\noil I've been taking now for about two months or so okay so what is CBD oil and\nwhat is cannabis oil so cannabis oil is the oil extracted from the cannabis\nplant or the hemp plant so THC which is the the more illegal version of the oil\nwhich is taken from the female buds of the plant which is the cannabis plant\nthe marijuana plant which produces THC is highly illegal because of its adverse\neffects on psychological conditions when people take it CBD on the other hand\ncomes from hemp and hemp is I believe the male plant but please correct me if\nI'm wrong here but the male plant and this has non-psychotic effect but it\nhas really good health benefits similar to that of THC but all of the\nall of the oils do actually contain some THC so CBD oil does contain THC but it's\nin such small quantities in volume that it actually doesn't come into the illegal\nside of actually owning the oil so what does CBD oil do so I take CBD oil every\nday and you're supposed to say you know that there's a guide lines of \nhow much you should take your day it says up to 15 drops a day but I\nactually take about five drops in the morning and that's it all day unless I\nfeel like I need any more and what it does is it actually helps with a bunch\nlot of things so if you've got like aches and pains it generally just helps\nrelieve a bit of those aches and pains if you like have maybe arthritis or\nsome other kind of muscular or tension pain issues it can help relieve those\ndepending on the severity of the pain obviously and depending on your body\ntype under pending on the strength of the cannabis so like I said this one I\ntake is a 3% CBD oil but you can get higher ones like a 5% CBD oil also I use\nit mainly for anxiety panic attacks I obviously on the autism\nspectrum but I don't like to take a lot of the medicines that they prescribe\nbecause I feel like they kind of push your personality down they suppress that\nand then you become a bit of a robot but because I don't like to take those\nbecause I don't like the feeling of them I still get super anxious I have on I do\nin time to take diazepam because sometimes I get a panic attack and it's\njust so bad I just need something to kind of calm me down but I'd rather\nsomething a bit more natural now I hear that CBD oil does this and so I've been\ntesting it out so I've been taking CBD oil now for about two or three months or\nmaybe two months and testing out see if it would actually help and it actually\nhelps reduce my anxiety a lot to help me get through the day a bit more less\nanxious and a little less worried and it's really really effective\nI found a highly effective now you can take it in all kinds of ways now this is\nthe stuff I'm going to show you so the awesome company healed by hemp sent me a\nbunch older stuff because like I said I put this oil underneath my tongue every\nsingle day but it tastes a bit weird and it's not everybody's cup of tea now that\nare the ways of ingesting cannabis oil you can take the Elixirs oil which is\nthis type of stuff and you can actually put this into food you can cook with it\nyou can again this like a pipette and you get this oil and you can put it into\nfood or like you can just put it within two drinks or whatever and this will\nhelp you calm down I suppose you could just ingest it directly into the time\nagain like this one does as well but this is the the healed\nby hemp CBD extract and this one is really really nice\nthis one is an orange cream flavour really really nice and they also sent me\nanother one which is a lemon cookie flavor which is awesome try this one yet\nbut both of these can be used with your food or in drink or just under your\ntongue but you can also get a different form of it called an isolate and the\nisolate can go into a vape pen so you can are a vape chamber so you can\nactually like inhale it and smoke it if you really want to because some people\nlike to take like that or you can put it into a capsule you can make capsules out\nof these performers like pills or capsules which is cool\nalso they sent me this beard oil which is a CBD beard oil which I haven't tried\nyet but I do have a beard it's not a little world's longest beard or biggest\nbeard but I'm gonna try this oil because it's another way of a absorbing\nCBD into your body and I know it just supposed to have really good effects now\nthis is a CBD moisturizing lotion and again this you can rub it on your hands\nor whatever you you know you want to rub a moisturizing lotion but this is a cool\nway of getting CBD into your system without actually having to ingest it\nthrough your mouth or whatever which I find very very interesting and\nintriguing I haven't tried this yet but I'm really really excited too okay so\nnext up we have this a skin care cream which is a made by heal by help again\nthis smells amazing it smells very like like fresh and springtime kind of but\nlook it's like a creamy oil you can just rub into your skin which is very very\ninteresting because again if you're not really into taking it orally then you\ncould just take it like this and I'll just show you the other two products\nI've got here one is a tattoo argument which is amazing which is gonna be\nawesome I get more and more tattoos because tattoo ointment I find that it's\nhard to find one that isn't genetically modified or a bit more natural so CBD\ntattoo ointment is amazing and the next one here is a healing balm for deep\nmuscle issues so if you've got like a deep muscle issues you can rub this into\nit and hopefully it will help and I know that CBD is very very good at healing\nstuff I studied chemistry as a BSc and I have a degree in chemistry and we looked\nat CBD and THC's medical properties and this stuff is very very good for\nhealing things like that okay so let's talk about the legal status of CBD oil\nnow here in the UK the CBD oil is completely legal you can walk into any\nstore that sells it and pick it up I bought this off the counter it was like\n9 quid and you walk in there and pick it up this one is a few percent CBD oil I\nknow they do a 5% CBD oil and I'm pretty sure there's a 7% one as well so and\nthere's no legal issues with that whatsoever\nthis actually contains a 0.05 percent THC which is the illegal ingredient but\nit's within the boundaries of a legal amount of volume within the CBD oil and\nI know that in America CBD oil is legal to an extent I think in some states you\nmay have to get a license for it but as long as it has a zero or less than zero\npoint nine percent THC in it you'll be okay to actually take that CBD oil and\na lot of people take the oils for cancer treatment I've seen THC highly effective\nin battling cancer I mean like excessively effective in battling cancer\nand I want to know that people take a mixture of THC and CBD together to to\nbattle cancer but it's really good for your health as like a food extract so\nthat's why people actually take it but obviously there will be some side\neffects from the THC side which we'll get into in a minute but the legal status\nhere in the UK is basically that THC is the bad part of it and  CBD is the good part so everyone's allowed to take to CBD but not THC and I don't know if\nTHC will ever become legal I hope so because of its medical properties but\nobviously there'll be some issues there surrounding it you know if it does\nbecome legal because people smoke marijuana which isn't like the best way\nto ingest a healing property or chemical but I know a lot of people do it to pain\nrelief and that's kind of cool I guess if that's what you're into so let's talk\nabout side effects with THC the side effects are quite interesting if you\nstart taking THC which is the illegal counterpart you can get low blood\npressure you can become really docile very sleepy\nnot you can lose focus you can lose inhibitions you can at least like excessive\neating paranoia I'm not sure it's if you smoke it it's not good for the brain or\nthe respiratory system and they can make you a little psychotic and have some\nlasting effects on your mental ability to cognitively behave but with the \nthat's just THC but with the CBD oil there are no real side-effects that I\nknow of that by taking CBD oil it doesn't have any any bizarre side\neffects I've never heard of anybody run into the skin and have an any side\neffect I've never heard of anybody ingesting it orally and having any side\neffects not made anybody ill and I think the stuff is pretty interesting it\ndefinitely helped me so I would say that there are really no side effects to\ntaking CBD oil the only thing I will say is study the company you want to buy it\nfrom and make sure it's legit and it's organic and it's from the pure sorce\nthis one was made in the USA and this one was made in\nAmsterdam in Europe and this is a highly reputable company these guys are new\nstartup and they're really reputable they've got some great reviews they're\nreally nice people they really care so again it's doing your research on the\ncompany you know if you find them that they're like a you know a home cottage\nindustries in somebody's basement they've had no sales and no kind of\nreviews it's a bit you know you go just make sure that you're taking the right\nstuff because you never know what you'll buy especially on the internet I know\nfor a fact that the NHS cancer unit over here tell cancer patients look yes you\ncan take THC oil if you believe it'll work for you that's fine because they\nhave had some good results with it but don't buy on the internet because you\njust can't be writing vegetable oil or something ridiculous and it's a very\nvery expensive oil so the price of it the CBD is quite reasonably priced\nI think this bottle which is only about I'm not actually sure that the actual\nvolume of this bottle but it only cost me about nine pounds but it was on sale\nso usually usually this cost about twenty pounds but it was nine pounds on\nsale and these products from healed by hemp are very wide variety of prices I\nhighly recommend checking out this site healedbyhemp.us I will leave a\nlink in the description below so you guys can check them out out on the\nscreen here please share them some love send them some social media love and\nthat tell them that Dan from the Aspie World sent you so in conclusion I'd\nlove to know your take on CBD oils are and if you think that they are effective\nfor people on the spectrum and if people should be taking them or should we stay\naway from cannabis oils

hi guys welcome back to healthy with Nicole and today in the kitchen I am making a CBD oil cream so really simple actually this crazy-looking bottle is the base lotion that I made in another video and I'll put the link over here for that if you want to learn how to make all-natural lotion from scratch I've put some other additives in it that extra nutrients that are kind of nice but this is my basic lotion that I can use to make other things like sunscreen you can find the video for that over here for natural tinted sunscreen and also to make other things that we want to add different nutrients to it so today I'm going to use CBD oil and I'm going to mix it just simply in with my lotion cream and this is used one as a way to get it into the body because CBD oil has been shown to be really effective for pain in the joints inflammation in the joints just also problems on the skin check out you just google it to find the effects of CBD oil what people are getting really good results and dealing with some things like arthritis and all kinds of stuff so you can make your own you'll just have to source your own CBD oil so for this recipe I'm just using a 2 ounce jar here and I'm gonna use about C my cream has gotten super thick so I'm going to use about two let's see two tablespoons of my homemade cream and this is one tablespoon of the CBD oil and this has an orange flavor added to it because it's used for internal it doesn't matter you can still use it external so it does smell a little bit orange e it's not orange essential oil though so I think you're okay is for our Sun but I put this on at night just anyway because it might little sticky and by the way CBD oil is not the same as marijuana it's not going to get you high it has no psychoactive properties at all so it's only used for inflammation and things like that so this is really simple I'm just going to stir it up here with my cream it smells kind of Archie if you wanted to add other essential oils to it you know I always go for something like lavender or even a mint those are still great still good for the body have their own properties to them for the skin and even the joints and things like that so it's as simple as that and mixing the cream up and then make sure you put a label on it so you know what's in this jar so CBD cream use it on your face anywhere on your joints or skin

"Q4SzpaHq-u0": "[Music] so I'm in a massive cannabis field right now and we're not in Colombia or Colorado we're actually in China near the Himalayas local farmers have been tending this field for the past five months and today they're ready to harvest the fruits of their labor they're about to top down 24 tons of cannabis the whole mission their company about how the heart cannot be you'll find your plan the whole woman the ha she knew and by the way it's like some that whining flu a few months ago this clot was all tobacco in court but now young Lou who manages this field says they're growing hemp a strain of the cannabis plant known for the increasingly popular non psychotropic component CBD the CBD market in the US will grow by 700 percent this year and be worth more than twenty three billion dollars by 2023 in China wants a piece of that fields like this in Yunnan Province are now a part of a growing CBD boom in China research analysts say UN and Heilongjiang provinces alone produced just over 11 percent of the global CBD supply last year the extract is taken from these plants then sold in the US demand for CBD from China has ballooned because of its supposed health Frenchie's consumer products increased with CBD like coffee bath bombs and gummy bears claim to help with pain and relaxation whatta man the CBD honey would go Edie ones yeah oh wow kind of sweet and fruity in a way wonder chefs here we're in Quin being here dozens of startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the u.s. the city has become a trailblazer for cannabis much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the u.s. Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match

I have been involved in\nthe cannabis industries since about 2007. There has always been\nabout smoking the stuff and getting high. However there's a whole\ndifferent side to cannabis and that's the medicinal side. I never really believed in it until when my mum started to take CBD oil. She has arthritis-like symptoms. Let's talk to mum herself. Please welcome my mum. Hey mum, thank you for being here with us. We wanted to ask you a few\nquestions about your CBD oil. - Hello, yes, we can do that. - Okay, why are you using it? - Because day in and day\nout I was in terrible pain and couldn't get relief from pain pills. The pain was always there. And of course, that burdened me a lot. - What kind of pain was it? - It's a pain in the joints. The whole body was stiff. My ability to move became worse and worse and I was getting desperate. - And in the past you used\npainkillers I believe? - Yes I used painkillers, one in the morning and one in the evening. And I've been using a\nrheumatism medication. - And then you started using\nCBD oil and what happened then? - I take one drop in the morning\nand it lasts the whole day, and I'm much more flexible. Everything is much easier,\nmuch more pleasant. And in the evening I take two drops, which makes the night\ncalm and I can sleep well. - Okay and we also wanna\nsay that you work in H Care and you work a lot with doctors and pharmaceutical medicines. You know a little bit\nabout this stuff, right? - Yes I think I know my way around. I just sat over everything\nand took the drops. I have now reported to the doctors that I'm taking these drops, and the reaction is zero. I have a feeling that the\ndoctors think that this is great, but they are not willing to prescribe it. So I got this privately. - And does it make you high? Or is it addictive? - No, not at all. This oil just makes my pain\ngo away, and nothing more. I have been taking this one\ndrop for weeks and months now, and I have not had to increase the dose. - Can you show us the\noil that you're using? - I think you can't go\nwrong with one drop anyway. - And were you able to\nstop using the painkillers? - Yes I have stopped\ntaking the painkillers and I'm using much less\nrheumatoid medication. - Okay, thank you very much and I'm gonna put this in our video and I hope this will help other people who have similar symptoms like you. - Yeah, maybe this can\nencourage other people to get in there and take CBD oil too. - Thank you very much. (foreign language) - Now there is a problem with CBD oil because at the moment\nthere is kind of a hype. There are thousands and thousands\nof products on the market, many of them are really bad. For example it happened to\nus that we bought CBD oil, the taste was horrible and\nthere was virtually no effect. The best way to buy CBD oil depends on the country you live in. In the USA, you now have service providers who test CBD products for effectiveness. This website here, they test products for\nCBD content and quality. The advantage is that you\ncan be sure that the value that is given on these bottles are true. I am going to show you two\nproducts that I recommend. This stuff is what I\nknow worked for my mom. So it is safe for arthritis problems. I would also try this stuff here. This is a full spectrum oil, that means it has not only CBD, but it also has these terpenes in there. So if you wanna imagine an\norchestra that plays music. If you wanna have a nice song, you will need many different instruments. I think this is the new way to go. In the future, all oils will\nbe full spectrum like this. There are different concentrations of oil and you wanna start with\na low concentration. You can see here, 125mg, 250, 500, 1000. There is such thing as tolerance, and if you start off\nwith just the highest, most concentrated oil, then you have no room to go upwards. You wanna start with a low dose first. So for example, the 250mg. If at some point you get tolerant to it, you can use it a bit more often and you can also use a higher concentrate. If you live in Europe, things\nare a little bit different. I have experience buying\nCBD oil over there, and I'm going to recommend you the product that we have\nbought and that we know works. It's called Candropharm100, from this website called cbdoilkaufen.de. The link is under this video. So there you go. If you haven't tried CBD oil yet, give it a go, because it may help with\npainful conditions you have. The link for products\nare under this video.

high cbd strain was effective though terpenes are important as well as other minor cannabinoids are also important another study from researchers in georgia found cbd reduced inflammation and protected lung tissues in coven 19 patients so far all of that cbd covered research has been done in models animals or replicated human tissue now to be clear scientists at nusey spoke with say this doesn't mean you should be planning a trip to the dispensary much more research is needed including clinical trials in humans like ones that might combine cbd with other antiviral treatments like rum desservier any antivirus therapy probably does like 90 percent of the job or 80 percent of the job or seventy percent of the job he may not doing hundred percent and what we're proposing maybe cbd can

"wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell

want to share with you so for the last six months i have been on a hunt okay for products that has specific ingredients in it you know ingredients that is sure to grow your hair i'm sure to moisturize thicken and sure to also bring you some length retention i have been on a hunt and i have been using these products that i'm about to tell you about for maybe about two months and i have seen a

things like protein vitamins like vitamin b vitamin e vitamin a zinc vitamin c vitamin c biotin uh tea tree oil what else rosemary oil these products that i chose for my hair has really been showing my hair some improvement so let's just go ahead and you know get started and let me just tell you about these combos that i find that is good for my hair okay alright so let's get started with the first product and it is a shampoo this particular brand i'm going to show these two at the same time this particular brand i found at my neighborhood beauty supply store i didn't find it anywhere else i did find it online at amazon but i got mine at the beauty supply store and it is this product here it is the sunny aisle refinish and rejuvenating moisturizing shampoo with c b d i'm going to put on the screen here all the benefits that cbd brings to your hair strands the cbd is working i know you guys have seen so many products or even just on the news the different states are starting to legalize cbd cbd oil because you know everyone is starting to find out that cbd has a lot of healing agents growing agents and just so many agents within cbd that's just all around helpful for your health this is a moisturizing shampoo and it is infused with jamaican black castor oil and it has a thousand mcg per ounce of pure cbd the shampoo you don't need a whole lot but it's very moisturizing my hair really loves it it does not strip my hair paired with this i paired this at the end of my wash routine and this is the moisturizing conditioner which is also infused with jamaican black castor oil and this also has a thousand mcg per ounce of pure c b d but one thing is for sure that i know is that it rejuvenates the hair strand and the scalp which is a breeding ground for growing hair the next product that i have been using faithfully is this edens body works natural conditioner it is the peppermint tea tree moisturizing and detangling conditioner i love this product because it packs a huge punch of peppermint and tea tree you soon as your scalp feels this conditioner your scalp just automatically just start tingling i love this product and it smells really good and everyone knows that peppermint and tea tree well tea tree is really good for cleansing the scalp and getting any like debris or impurities and things like that lifted up off the scalp and peppermint is really good for stimulating your scalp which in turn does what produces hair growth so love this i use this every single week in conjunction with everything that i am going to talk to you guys about today alright the only thing that i don't use weekly um is the moisturizing shampoo but i do use that every two weeks the next product that i love to use is the main choice this um three in one revitalizing refresh conditioner it is a co-wash leave-in and a detangler i have been using this probably twice a week because i have been trying to get really into moisturizing and deep conditioning my hair twice a week instead of once a week and i'll tell you why towards the end of this video but i really love this particular product because of biotin that it has in it i and the vitamin e that it has in it which in turn promotes hair growth so you see where i'm going with this this is really good for hair growth and the vitamin e is really good for moisture so with those two naturally it's going to be a breeding ground for good nutrients and hair growth so this particular product here all right and for my next item here which is a deep conditioner i have a bunch of deep conditioners okay and i've used almost all of them but i wanted to hone in on just one particular deep conditioner because i wanted to find out which deep conditioner is working really well for my hair and that is this shea moisture black sorry this shea moisture jamaican black castor oil strength and restore treatment mask this deep conditioner has shea butter moisture peppermint peppermint told you peppermint another product peppermint these ingredients are really good to stimulate hair growth okay along with the apple cider vinegar which is apple cider vinegar is a cleansing agent and it also helps balance your ph levels in your hair strand been using this for years but like i said i wanted to really just hone in on one particular deep conditioner just to make sure that i'm able to give you guys like just some set ingredients or set products that is really working for me all right so moving right along i just want to talk about just a couple of more items next thing is your oils oils are very important they have so many moisturizing and healing and cleansing agents and most of all they have some awesome scalp rejuvenating agents in them so i have really really really been adopting oils to my hair and scalp massages every night using these particular oils every single night so the oils couple of oils that i do want to talk about one of them is main choice like this growth oil is really good um let's see what it says here it's timeless length and lasting retention releases clogged oil and buildup on the scalp it also has biotin in it and a few other oils in here like grape seed oil sweet almond oil they have some sativa oil in here sativa oil cbd sativa if you know then you know all right so love this oil every night i put a little bit so i don't do all of these oils every night i kind of like alternate them i would probably use this one every other night but every single night i do use this miles rosemary mint scalp and hair strengthening oil this has it is infused with biotin and encourage and it encourages hair growth it is for daily use it's a scalp treatment and it also um has split end care look this is like my third bottle and i'm gonna tell y'all this really works it really really works like rosemary and mint that mint is like the peppermint that stimulates scalp stimulating and the rosemary with the healing and the the the gr the length retention properties in it this is a good one you don't necessarily have to get this brand but you definitely want to just think about the rosemary and the mint you know avocado oil again peppermint oil tea tree oil all of those type of oils will definitely help and aid in hair growth all right and one last product that i do want to mention is moisturizing milks if you are low porosity that means that your hair follicles are not open it actually takes a lot for your hair follicles to open like things like heat and um steam things like that opens up your hair follicles pretty easily and i try not to use a lot of like heavy thick like butters because it's hard for it to get inside of my hair strands so i really love this tginn sweet honey hair milk that is this is with raw honey and agave nectar that raw honey is giving you moisture moisture moisture moisture okay and this has so many uh moisturizing agents in it when i put this on my hair um my i can probably go maybe okay i'm not gonna push it okay two days i'm going to say about two days without re-moisturizing my hair and you can get this tgi in along with the main choice shea moisture and the eden's bodyworks you can get those all at your local beauty supply store along with the sunny aisle cbd moisturizing conditioner and moisturizing shampoo at your local beauty supply store but if you cannot get it there you can definitely find it on amazon now i am telling you guys all of this because i have decided to put myself or take myself on a hair care journey for 2021 okay the first three months of 2021 and i am starting now i actually i started probably last week but to really get my hair in tune with it and let you guys know with what i'm doing i'm recording i'm filming and editing this video in december december but i am going to be really going full fledged with this hair growth challenge come january one okay it's all about hair retention thickness and growth okay so the the hair that you grow you want to retain it and the hair that you're retaining you just want it to continue to just get be flourished and growing okay now you guys probably want to know is this my hair well the answer is no this is not my hair but i will say these are my hair goals i'm not too far off the thickness i'm far off but i will get there that's why i'm doing this whole challenge this is like those headband head band wigs that have been going around everywhere i don't want to tell you where i got this one from because it was a little pricey and when i started doing more research i found out that i could have got this wig right here for a fraction of the cost so i don't want to tell you where i got this particular one from but you can definitely search online headband wigs and you will be able to find so many companies that are doing it i'll list maybe two below that i feel like is a good price i will say that okay this particular headband wig is a1 okay it's thick i did have to dye it i dyed it um black a natural black it did come like a natural brown color and the thickness i didn't have to cut anything the texture is a 3c4a no the texture is a 3 b3c which is my texture here i do have a little 4c in there but it's really mostly at the top and but the rest of them it looks exactly like my hair just not as full this is 14 inches and i believe it's 150 density and it's about 22 inches round that's actually a little bit too big for my hair so i'm gonna have to do some alterations but i love this you guys know this is me okay y'all know this is me so i am gonna be doing these headband wigs for the next two or three months and while i'm doing that i'm going to be moisturizing conditioning scalp massages using these type of products with these type of ingredients in them i will list you know what i can do i can list all the ingredients that you want to be looking for in your hair products i'll list them also below so then that way you can kind of like go back and forth take a screenshot or whatever so when you're looking for your products because you don't have to get these products that i mentioned okay you can these products are not the only products that have these awesome ingredients in it but if it was one that i would say get and just mark my words just go ahead and get it you love it this sunny owl cbd moisturizing shampoo and moisturizing conditioner these two right here i'm gonna say go ahead and try these out because cbd is really really good for your hair skin so anyway that is all of the products that i wanted to go over with you guys today i'm gonna definitely be doing a um hair length check for you guys i am gonna say right now my hair is about 13 and a half maybe 14 inches this is 14 inches and this is 14 inch and i feel like my hair comes to about right here about right here and that's about 14 inches so in about a month i'm going to check back in with a length check just to let you guys know where i am with using these particular products with these particular ingredients or just products like this with the ingredients in there all right so if you guys have any questions or comments let's converse about it below in the comment section please do not forget

into my next video you guys i'll see you later [Music] bye [Music] is", "zaFs3Cmx3Ds": "-You've probably started\nseeing CBD products popping up\nin a lot of places -- pharmacies, health-food stores,\nfarmers' markets. One place it's not\nsupposed to show up -- Amazon. But the e-commerce giant\nhas become an outlet for CBD supplements, despite Amazon's policy\nbarring those items. That's because\nthe vast retail site, where consumers search through\n500 million items on any given day, is too large for even the tech\ngiant to thoroughly police. Sellers use alternative terms, like \"hemp oil\"\nor \"hemp extract,\" to avoid Amazon's\ndetection algorithms that would likely sniff out\nthose listings and remove them. So, to see if third-party\nmerchants were violating Amazon's policy,\nwe decided to buy 13 products that had high likelihood\nof containing CBD and have them tested at EVIO\nLabs in Berkeley, California. We should note that Amazon\nfounder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns\nThe Washington Post. David Egerton is\nthe lab director at EVIO and tested each\nof the products to determine\nif they include CBD. Okay, so, let's look\nat the Select CBD products. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It does. There's close to 900 milligrams\nin the container. -And maybe another giveaway --\nit says \"CBD\" on the label. -It does, indeed. -If I were to go to a\nnatural-food store in Berkeley, and purchase a CBD product\nfrom them, would it have a similar profile? Would it have about 30%, milligrams to milliliter,\nof CBD in it? -It's very difficult to say\nthat for sure, because a lot of these products have a wide range\nof concentrations that we see. Even in what we see\nin front of us here, you know, we can see,\nthere's some products that claim to have\n5 milligrams per serving, others that claim to have 100. -Let's look at\nRestorative Botanicals. Does this have CBD in it?\n-It does, indeed. In comparison to\nthe other sample that we just looked at,\nthere was, say -- where there was only\nCBD detected, here we see\na variety of cannabinoids, including THC,\nat a very low level. But this variety of cannabinoids\nindicates that it was likely manufactured using what they referred to\nas a full-spectrum hemp oil. -Okay, let's go to\nthe Lazarus Naturals. Does this product\nhave CBD in it? -It absolutely does.\n-And again, dead giveaway, it says \"CBD tincture.\" So, now,\nlet's talk about this one. This is a tincture made\nby a company called Tranquilo. What was interesting to me\nabout this company is, its Twitter\nhandle is AmazonBestCBD. Is there any CBD in this one? -There was no CBD detected\nin this sample. [chuckles]\n-This also says on its label \"hemp oil, 500 milligrams.\" Is there 500 milligrams of anything in this\nthat you detected? -Uh, none of the cannabinoids\nthat we report. -Today we asked you\nto check 13 products. We have them all lined up here. Of these 13 products, how\nmany actually had CBD in them? -11 out of the 13 contained CBD. -And the two that didn't is\nthis one oil from Tranquilo -- -Mm-hmm.\n-And the other, the Hemp Gummies\nhere from Mix Rx. -Correct.\n-So, even though Amazon prohibits\nthe sale of CBD products on its website, we found 11 out\nof our 13 products purchased contained\nthe substance. After informing Amazon of\nour purchases and testing, the company removed some, but not all,\nof the product listings. Amazon said the company\nrequires merchants to follow selling guidelines and that it has teams\nthat use machine-learning tools to keep prohibited products\nout of its marketplace. But the company declined to say\nit believed that no CBD products\nwere available on its site.", "izyBmfgg-wo": "[Music] hi there and welcome back to kitten school what can we do about a very shy cat a while back I made a video about my extremely shy cat Kate Moss who was so skittish that she runs under the bed when anyone walks into the room now Katie's been with me since she was a tiny feral kitten but while the rest of her litter were all quickly socialized she just never got over her intense shyness katie spends most of her time on or under the bed in our guest room but she loves to eat and so she'll usually venture out when it's dinnertime just to make sure she's not forgotten sometimes she'll allow one of us to pet her but after a moment she quickly bolts away it's like she'll forget for a few seconds to be scared but then it always comes right back I think Katie does want affection but she has a very strong fear reflex which is something all cats instinctually have as a survival mechanism Katie is now almost 15 years old and while age has mellowed her some she's still very shy she has a great life she gets along well with the other cats but I've always felt bad that she's just so nervous I recently read about the use of CBD oil being used to help calm nervous cats so I thought I'd give it a try and see if it might help Kate Moss now what exactly is CBD oil well it's an oil made from the flowers and leaves of the hemp plant which is a cousin of the marijuana plant unlike marijuana hemp lacks the THC compound that makes you stoned but it does have other compounds called phytochemicals which some have claimed can heal all kinds of ailments from depression to inflammation to even epilepsy I even take it myself sometimes when I'm feeling like I need to relax a little and it does help but whether this supposed miracle oil would make any difference in Katie's anxiety would to be seen I decided to try two different brands of CBD oil formulated for cats this one by pet relief and this one by Bluebird each dose contains about three to four percent CBD oil and it can be mixed into the cats food the oil has a pretty strong herbal smell that some cats might not like but Katy never a picky eater scarped it down without hesitation Katy received a morning dose of the pet relief oil for two weeks and then I switched to the blue bird oil for the next two weeks I figured a month would be sufficient time for any therapeutic effects of the CBD oil to take place and so did the CBD oil turn my achingly shy Wallflower Kitty into a high struttin attention seeking party cat well not quite but here's my observations I do think katie has been more relaxed and she's not hiding as much under the bed I've even caught her cuddling with singsing on a chilly morning and she's ventured out to other areas of the house which we'd rarely seen her do before as for her interactions with us I think she's a little bit more tolerant of being petted there was a point a while ago and Katy wouldn't even come out from the guest room and we'd even have to take her dinner to her now she's usually right under my feet meowing the whole time when I'm preparing food in addition to the increased relaxation I've also noticed some positive physical changes since Katy started taking the oil such as the improvement in her fur which has always been a little rough and scraggly probably because she won't allow me to brush her after a month of the CBD oil her coat looks thicker and more lustrous though I really wish she'd let me comb out some of that loose fur the CBD has a coconut oil base and it also contains antioxidants which can contribute to skin and code health so what are my conclusions after Kate Moss's month of CBD oil well while I think it's helped to take an edge off her nervousness she's still a very shy skittish cat and won't allow us to get too much closer to her than she did before but I do think she's calmer and happier in her daily lightning and she's interacting more with our other cats so for now I will continue giving Katie the CBD oil but these oils are not cheap they run between 30 and 70 dollars per bottle so I'm only going to use them if I continue to see benefits while CBD oil has shown promise in some studies it is not an FDA regulated supplement and Moore's research is needed to confirm its effectiveness there is a lot of hype out there for pet supplements which generate billions of dollars and sales so I can be kind of skeptical about miracle oils or herbs when there's just not a lot of scientific study to back up the big claims there's also a lot of low quality CBD oils that are being sold and contain few of the beneficial compounds at all so be sure to buy from a reputable CBD company it won't hurt to try CBD oil for your anxious cat and perhaps it really can help but you know your cat better than anyone and if you don't see any results after a month of giving it I say don't waste your money thanks

lot about and that is CBD oil now big disclaimer right up front I'm in no way shape or form at all recommending that you take CBD oil this is something that you've got to do your own research you've got to decide whether or not it's right for you alright today I just want to share with you my experience and what I have found as a result of using CBD oil every day for the past seven months these are my bottles of CBD oil a few months ago back in April I did a video talking about my nighttime routine in that I sort of told you that I was starting to experiment with CBD oil and I was liking the results but I wasn't ready to share my thoughts I did that last video back in April about trying CBD I got tons of companies reaching out saying hey do you want to try my CBD do you want to try our CBD do you want to try our CBD the issue with CBD in this industry something that you're going to find out if you start exploring and experimenting is that anybody and their mother can create a private-label CBD company there are a lot of companies out there that manufacture hemp or that grow hemp that are like oh let's get in on the CBD market and their private labeling the stuff and so there are so many tons of different brands out there now the big issue is that you have no idea what you're taking you have no idea of the potency the strength and with CBD it is my personal opinion that you got to know what the hell you are actually taking a lot of these I would say the majority of these CBD companies out there you really have no idea and the only way you're going to be able to figure out dosage and if something's working and what you can change is if you have a super pure form of CBD oil and you actually are buying it from a company that is like in the business of standardizing things testing things and making sure that the product that they're giving you is pure and plant therapy is a company that's been around for years I have known about the because they specialize in essential oils and oil therapies and that is why the company plant therapy is my choice and my partner for this video I've been using plant therapies CBD oil for the past four months they're in the business of oils and extracts and making sure that the quality is there the transparency is their plan therapy is the best in the business in my opinion I have tried a lot of other CBD brands and I noticed the biggest difference when I was actually able to know what specific dosage I was taking and then monitor it and adjust it from there the plan therapy extracts are pure they do the research they cite all of their research guys they have done an amazing job cutting out all the [ __ ] and making sure that they are providing you incredible information something that I asked them to do for you because there are so much information out there when it comes to CBD oil on our landing page down below they have three sections that I encourage you to go and check out if you're thinking about experimenting or trying CBD oil number one is the frequently asked question you've got a question about CBD oil chances are somebody else has had that question it's going to be listed there along with the answer there's also going to be a section about the proposed benefits of CBD oil and then there's also and this is something that's incredibly important the serving chart so that you know sort of what you're taking how to sort of structure a plan that's going to be right for you and if after and only after you do all of your research you decide that you want to try CBD oil guys you will not go wrong buying from plant therapy we have a discount code there are also three different strengths there they have three different flavors you've got natural you are like unflavored you've got cinnamon and you've got pina colada I am a fan of the sentiment and the natural just doesn't really taste like anything that's it now let's talk about my experience with CBD alright so about seven months ago I decided it was finally time for me to try CBD oil I had been suffering with a little bit of anxiety I've also been suffering from some injuries from working out I've always slept like really good but three benefits primary benefits that you hear people reporting from trying CBD oil is sleep anxiety and sort of like inflammation now the reason why those three things are so like reported when it comes to CBD oil is what CBD oil is now I'm not going to attempt to try and explain what a cannabinoid is and how you've got different receptors like in your brain and in your body that's part of like the endocrine system I'm not going to go into the whole independent how cannabinoids work but if you are interested in learning why CBD oil is actually effective for treating certain things guys hit our link and go read sort of the FAQ s and more about CBD oil and how it really works but at the end of the day about seven months ago I decided I was going to give it a try for one is anxiety I have been a little bit stressed lately and not like feeling like myself and so I was you know like hey if this can help a little bit with anxiety and kind of just like take the edge off I'm good um the other thing is sleep now I typically sleep very well but I was like hey if it can improve my sleep I know that sleep is like one of the most important things that you're going to do during the day or during the night that's going to help you with so many other things and the other thing is inflammation I have been suffering because I exercise like all the time and I use my body hard I am always dealing with like some type of injury and I had something called plantar fasciitis for a few months and probably started about I don't know probably nine months ago and it just wasn't getting any better and it was a bit debilitating and so I'm like alright I got to try something because what I'm trying is not working and I did not want to go to like a position and just get like shot with like a cortisone shot or something like that I am a firm believer that nature can heal us but I'm not like some like crazy over-the-top like weirdo like never use like antibiotics and definitely get your vaccines but I am a believer in in nutrition I'm believer in supplements and taking multivitamins and vitamin b-complex and C and d3 like I believe in all that stuff I grew up on it I was in the nutrition industry for a long time and it's just something that I personally believe in for me and so I decided to give CBD oil a try I went to one of my buddies who was sort of in the business I'm like yo can you hook me up he's like yeah and so he sent me this I'm like all right I had no idea what I was doing but I was like all right I'm gonna try this at night now something else you need to understand they're really two types of different CBD oil there is full spectrum and there is broad spectrum CBD full spectrum means that it also has THC THC is the stuff in weed that gets you high now in CBD oil that is full-spectrum it is a very low dose like I think legally it has to be like under like 0.3% and and I could be wrong about that in order for it to be sold legally but I didn't want to take anything with THC I don't smoke weed personally not that I have anything against it I know a lot of people some of my best friends some of my loved ones absolutely do smoke weed it's just not something that I like I don't like the way that it makes me feel and so I decided to go with a broad spectrum full spectrum CBD has everything including a little bit of THC I didn't want that and so I went broad-spectrum and so I got my bottle I was like all right he's like yo use one dropper I'm like all right I had no idea what milligram I didn't know anything about that but at night before I went to bed like after I brushed my teeth and did all that I took a dropper under my tongue held it there under my tongue for about a minute swallowed it and that first night I slept like a frickin rock was it the CBD I had no idea all I knew is that I slept like a rock I'm like damn I slept like super sound I didn't sleep longer but when I woke up I felt just like invigorated I felt like I got more sleep than I actually did and so I'm like yo that was pretty awesome and so next night guess what I did boom exactly again and guess what I slept like a rock so month number one through three I took it one time a day at night before I went to bed and my sleep was good my anxiety I didn't really notice anything my plantar fasciitis in my body it's still eight and so I really didn't notice anything there and then once I started doing more research I realized that a lot of people are saying that you need to take CBD oil actually twice a day and so when I started with actually I started with this one therapy I started with the lowest dosage 16 milligrams or 16 milligram milliliters 500 milligram bottle like I said guys if you have no idea about dosage that link down below there's a chart that actually will talk you through sort of how to start using this and trying it and all that's good stuff anyway took it at night but then what I started doing in the afternoon at around 11 o'clock after I got done exercising I started taking it again and almost immediately I felt this like it was weird I felt this just like calmness and I'm like could it be like the CBD oil or is it totally like placebo effect but the next day did it again afternoon along with at night and I was chill I felt better and then I'm like alright I really got to test this out and so then the third day I didn't take it and I I don't know like I said I don't know if it was placebo effect I personally don't believe it is because I was like I was chilled I felt good I wasn't all like stressed out and anxious something else that happened about like two weeks after I started taking it twice a day my foot my leg it started to feel better I wasn't all like sore and getting like muscle cramps and spasms now I'm not saying that everything is linked I'm not saying that CBD oil cured everything but I know that my foot started to feel better and so the next bottle that I got from plant therapy actually upped the dosage to thirty three milligrams with a thousand milligrams bottle and and that's when it kind of like went away completely my pain in my foot twice a day rocking this and honestly I'm on my fourth bottle now of of the plant therapy CBD I feel better than I've felt in a really long time and I was a bit skeptical from from the first time I started hearing about CBD am I you know like I was like okay this is just a fad this really doesn't work and so going into it being a skeptic and really taking my time over the past seven months and sort of analyzing and trying different dosages and and and different amounts like I feel like I have like my formula for me and I'm going to continue to take CVD oil because I truly feel for me it was beneficial and I feel great and so I just wanted to do this video and kind of share my opinion my opinion is for me I feel like it's made a big difference for me I'm gonna keep doing it but I don't know I mean you've got to decide for yourself like I said there's a ton of information out there there also a ton of brands you've just got to be careful you've got to make sure that the brand that you're buying is pure you've got to make sure that you know what you're doing and you don't just like try like one milligram this day and one milligram that day and just like all over the place typically you don't just try something once and feel like amazing for me I don't know if it was placebo effect I don't know if it was the CBD oil but I noticed the difference my anxiety I noticed that immediately my sleep but regardless of if it was possible effect or not I don't care because I feel better I just wanted to do this video I told you that I would back in April when I sort of mentioned that I was starting to use CBD oil and seeing some positive results for me I'm gonna keep doing it for me I love it for me I truly feel like it's been a bit of a game changer in my overall well-being in health I don't know what the long-term effects of CBD oil is I don't know that it's been out long enough there could be adverse effects I have no idea but I know that for right now you know I I dig it and I encourage you that if you're somebody who struggles with something of you know sleep anxiety or maybe you know pain or some issues but but there are other things right because you know this endocrine system it's like a collection of like glands and it regulates hormones and just makes everything in your body work better and so do your research like I said there are other reported benefits but these were the three most reported and the three that I was interested in seeing if it would actually have an effect on me but at the end of the day guys you've got to decide for yourself do not do it because I'm doing it do it because you want to you have to do your research", "x6tLO5niNeQ": "it's been sprouting up in everything from lattes to baked goods baby date CBD CBD and now cannabidiol or CBD is being marketed as one of the most exciting skincare ingredients of our time a beauty game-changer said to help ease dry skin reduce inflammation and alleviate other skin issues with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties but is there any truth to these claims or are cannabis based cosmetics just a new marketing trend first things first CBD does not get you high it's a non psychoactive ingredient found in both cannabis plants marijuana and hemp not to be confused with THC which is the chemicals solely found in marijuana that gets you high so even though this ad for cush mascara looks like it'll get you high it will not there is a common fear about it as soon as you talk about CBD always people think that oh it's you're putting marijuana on your skin so you could get psychoactive chemicals in your system that's not the case the problem is in many cases CBD on labels is being misrepresented a 20-17 study found that nearly 70% of CBD products online or miss labels back to this mascara it actually has no CBD in it instead it contains cannabis sativa seed oil also known as hemp oil and derives from the seeds of the hemp plants which has been around for decades most of the beauty products that actually contain CBD come from industrial hemp you have to note that hemp seed oil or can give us speed or even the same thing as CED oil CBD oil is a different component so it's extracted from the leeks and flowers of the hemp plant at the finer and lighter oil as compared to hemp seed oil that tends to be a greasy ER this type of CBD is usually listed in the ingredients as cannabis oil or full spectrum hemp it has less than 0.3 percent THC and saw a massive bloom in the US after the 2018 farm bill was passed and hemp derived CBD became legal in all 50 states marijuana's derives CBD is illegal in the US except for the states where marijuana is legalized in Canada topicals are legal but can only be bought at federally licensed pot shops but whether it was extracted from hemp or marijuana the CBD is identical on a molecular level outside of the label confusion people really just want to know if these products actually work on your skin I think the thing with skin is it's like a hot topic everybody's jumping on the bandwagon everybody wants to get a piece of pie and the Mart is more marketing than science research has shown CBD can help with some things but there's not enough evidence out there to prove it will clear up your acne or wrinkles I think the most powerful studies I reviewed for this discussion is not in skincare it's actually in pain control and arthritic pain or anti-inflammatory for joints there's there's more studies in that realm and just because it's plant-based she adds doesn't mean it can't have side effects anything that can comes from the earth can give you a rash and as the use of it increases and maybe higher concentrations are put into products like especially in high-risk areas like lips and mascara we might start see allergic reactions so canna Beauty may not be the magic solution it's marketed to be and as the industry continues to grow consumers will need to be extra careful with what's truth

the truth about CBD oil for pain? If you are looking for\nany type of marijuana, cannabis, or insight\ntied to whether or not CBD oil is legal, I'll explain, the crazy sale coming right up. (upbeat music) CBD oil, medical marijuana, and more. Oh my. Great to be with you, hello. Little bit of, spray of that. Imagine that being able to ease your pain. If you've never seen me before, I'm the YouTube Deal Guy, Matt Granite. You might know me from your CBS, NBC, ABC TV stations, I also host\na show for Amazon Live, and I'm Canadian where the\nlegalities of marijuana have really not been\ndebated to the same extent in different countries or cities and, I don't have any type of\npolitical stance on anything. I hunt down deals. I'm here only to answer the question, does CBD oil for pain\nwork and is it legal? So, first things first,\nI'm just gonna make sure I got all my legal notes\nright up here, a reminder, that CBD oil from hemp\nis legal in the U.S., it is not psychoactive cannabinoid. That does not contain\ntetrahydrocannabinol, THC. Do I sound like an expert? No, I'm not. I'm a deal expert. In fact, I actually asked two experts to assist with today's\ndeal, including a doctor. But before we get to that, I have pain. Imagine, if you've ever\nused Bengay, or Icy Hot. Every time you have that\npain, you put it on, you get your hands covered,\nand then you have your, smell like aromatherapy\nfor the next five years, like peppermint extract. And with this beautiful\nbaby, who I've shown you in some videos, by the\nway, she's getting bigger. She weighs over 20 pounds\nnow at eight months, so just about twenty\npounds, and my back, neck, and shoulders are hurting more\nthan they have in the past. The concept of a spray\nthat could alleviate pain, is something that I wanna\nshow to you right now, in fact, there's a deal link for it, just expand the video\ndescription box right under me, and you will have your\nlink revealed to that. But before we get to why I like it, let's actually hear from two experts. I have Dr. Derek, who you\nmight have seen on TV, he's a USA Today contributor, and then Bruno Roder, who is, I believe, a physical therapist, and\nhe also works with people who live with pain across the country. - Pain relief, many people\nare in need of pain relief, possibly problems in the shoulders, the hips, the knees,\nthe back, or the neck. Now there is many ways\ntraditionally, to handle pain relief, many drug medications\nand surgical treatment could be very invasive,\nor some easier things, something newer more modern\nlike CBD oil is extremely effective and is gaining more credibility. Why? Because it gives you\nthe actual pain relief. On top of the fact, what\nI love about this kind is they mix it with magnesium. Now, magnesium, in case you're wondering, is a natural pain reliever, but also, it's a muscle relaxant,\nso it gets the muscles to relax before we get the\ninflammation and the pain out with the CBD oil. Very effective when used\nin conjunction with ice, and some other treatment as well. Take this, one or two\nsprays at the affected area. I love using it on my knees\nor my hands to get rid of some arthritis pain. Also too, I work with a lot of clients that might have pain in the\nlower back or in the knees. Very effective with that as well. And lastly, it smells delightful. You don't have to worry about\nit smelling like a medicine cabinet coming your way, so try this. One or two sprays to the affected area, and you'll be amazed at how fast it works, and how good you feel. - We all get sore. Whether we work out or not, we get sore. I've been turned on to a muscle\nspray that is so amazing. You spray it on, feels cool\nat first, then it warms up, goes right to the\nmuscles, no mess, no fuss, I even like the odor, it's amazing. - So why do I like it? If you have knee, shoulder, hand, foot, neck,\nor back, and hip pain, this unique spray design allows\nfor that clean application, as opposed to those creams, which I mentioned could get messy, and soil other items that you touch. This is also the only natural\nand safe modern extra strength pain relief, without a prescription. So the CBD, you get that pain relief, and the inflammation\nreducer, the magnesium, which is the muscle relaxant. And keep in mind that\nthis is the only product on the market that has both. Magnesium is a natural mineral salt extracted from the brine of the Dead Sea, which allows your muscles to relax. and then the CBD oil,\nobviously, the concentrations, are a natural yet powerful inflammation and swelling reliever. The peppermint oil will\nrefresh and relax your skin, and then the chamomile is\njust another botanical boost to soothe that tired skin. It really works. I've used Icy Hot, or I think it was usually\ncalled antiphygesia, I know they have different\nthings in different countries, but, I'm telling you right now, this is awesome. And despite all of the arguments about what should be\ntransported and made where, and what's in what product, I'm not here to debate any of that, only to tell you that\nthis really does work. And its legal. So that's great. If you do want to take\nadvantage of this item, obviously the company behind this is not paying me to say nice things about them, I'm not endorsing this, I'm\njust telling you that it works. And if you do talk to a chiropractor, physical therapist, or Doctor\nDerek, or another doctor, they can attest the fact\nthat the formulation of this product is beneficial. That's all I'm here to do, show you a deal on it. Click that video. Click that link below the\nvideo description box, I wonder if they had a spray\nto help you speak properly. That would be awesome. And you'll find what you're looking for. Thank you again for watching. The only reason I knew to hunt this down, was because subscribers\nrequested this product. I was actually getting a\nlot of requests for this. By the way, if you have\nnot yet subscribed to or listened to my Deal Guy podcast which is available to Spotify and iTunes, The Deal Guy podcast,\nfeel free to do that, because a lot of the\nlisteners will also chime in, so its like between YouTube subscribers, and podcast listeners,\nI'm rewarded on both sides by amazing insight because you guys all make me\nmuch better at my job. Now, if only, I could learn how to speak. I love you. Thanks for watching. If you're not yet subscribed,\nthis is what you could do.

I could do this now,\nbecause I have no pain.", "e6dD81GhgiI": "welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember to subscribe to the demystifying medicine channel for more videos", "jzA-nORdJyE": "there was a misconception that CBD is not psychoactive and that people think it's inert and very very very safe and doesn't produce any acute drug effects so we wanted to bring that into laboratory and test that assumption what we found is that oral dosing doesn't produce much in the way of a drug effect or impact drug testing when the substance is pure when it's vaporized though we did see discriminable drug effects they were not THC like so people didn't report getting high but they did feel a subjective change in how they felt mostly positive not really negative and we didn't see anything in the way of impairment of cognitive performance when we added some THC to the mixed we used a cannabis that was high in THC or high in CBD and low in THC we found that people reported modest drug effects again no impairment of cognitive functioning at the doses we tested but you know relatively strong drug effects we also found in this study that acute dosing with that high CBD low THC cannabis could produce a positive drug test in some individuals the other interesting finding from this is that in consistent with other studies that have been done we found that women tended to be more sensitive to the drug effects than men so women reported stronger drug effects overall especially in the vaporization and the high CBD low THC drug conditions and they reported greater ratings of irritation of their throat when they were inhaling the drug this is a stepping stone study so it's a very small study with a single dose given one time so you know obviously from here we there are a number of ways we want to expand on this a number of directions we want to move forward at some point multiple different doses and and different formulations to

I'm at the fields at Veritas Farms where we're surrounded by about 38,000 hemp plants and I'm actually joined by the VP of agriculture here Spencer fuller Spencer talked to me about what we're seeing around us yep right here we are in the middle of our field agriculture this is where all of our hemp plants flower off they're gonna be here until about October when we begin the harvest process we put these out in May and we're expecting around 70,000 pounds of dried hemp plant yep in the greenhouse we saw the moms and over here we're seeing what the moms actually produced all their little babies so we do drip irrigation basically what that is is each little plant gets its own watering and we run that on a cycle through our own well here on on property and we're a 100% organic cultivation awesome and so you have some products on you can you talk to me about what these are yep right here we have our solve it's a cooling menthol it's really awesome super cooling obviously and our moisturizing lotion you can't go wrong with that as well as our orange cream lip balm you can find these in Kroger stores City Market King Soopers so how long does it take from us to see the plants here to them going inside those products it's gonna take us about six months to finish our process here before we hand it over to extraction okay awesome anything else you wanted to ask no I think just kind of enjoy the view Thank You Spencer appreciate it and actually industrial hemp was a federally legalized in 2018 with the passing of the farm bill so now you can find all these products online and inside retailers - always watching out for you Southern Colorado Jessica barreto used by", "uuZwjeiofE8": "POLICE POLICE ASK POLICE ASK THAT POLICE ASK THAT YOU POLICE ASK THAT YOU

ban from that country after bringing CBD oil over the border as John Paul Tasker tells us the woman thought the cannabis derived pain reliever was allowed because it's legal in the state where she was going all along the world's longest border there are signs warning travelers not to bring cannabis across the border that's because cannabis is still strictly illegal in the United States in fact it's still on par with heroin so it's prohibited at all border crossings and one cane woman found out this past weekend that it's not just cannabis buds it's not just cannabis leaves it's not just cannabis joints that will find you on the wrong side of the law and that's because she was carrying CBD oil something that she uses to treat pain associated with scoliosis it's the non psychoactive component of the cannabis plant that many people use to deal with pain to deal with anxiety to deal with sleeping disorders but that doesn't matter to border guards at the blaine washington crossing they pulled her a sign for a secondary inspection asked if she had any leafy greens on her person she didn't think her pain reliever of choice would qualify as a leafy green but of course it did when they found that CBD oil in her backpack they charged her they find her they fingerprinted her they sent her away with a stack of paperwork that she'll have to fill out if she has any hope of coming back to the United States and she has to apply now for a special waiver but an immigration lawyer we spoke to believes that a special waiver might not be enough for this woman to get back into the United States even though she made an honest mistake if the officers deem that she has a controlled substance with her and she admitted to it then she's inadmissible for the rest of her life a spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection's as its responsibility of all travelers to know US law and they said just because some states have legalized marijuana doesn't mean that it's legal to bring across the border because federal law trumps all at all border crossings John Paul Tasker CBC News Ottawa", "okq7mHdXv2U": "hello my little apples and welcome back to another video if you're like me in this case I really hope that you're not because it kind of sucks but you suffer from migraines or anxiety or sleep deprivation then please keep watching this video because as you can tell from the title I started taking CBD oil about a month ago regularly and I am feeling like a new person but before we get started if you're new here and you like content like this holistic healing nutrition veganism lifestyle and all that good stuff oh and also education because I'm currently a Dietetic student at the moment make sure you hit that subscribe button and also that notification bow so bye well that's interesting I just got a text message but make sure you hit that notification bell so that you know whenever I post a new video which is weekly by the way I also have social media is like the instagrams and the Twitter's so if you're ever you know wondering what I'm doing in my day to day you could check me out over there but let's get into the video so in a CNN report and I just looked this up because I was really curious about it but in 2016 it was reported that the average American spends about half their day behind the screen and I'm not saying that you spend your day behind the screen and I'm not saying that you're an average American or if you're an average American then you automatically spend the rest of your day in front of the screen but I'm saying that I'm pretty much the average American I currently have my social medias I make youtube videos so I mean that's just a lot of screen time in general and then I have my phone where I'm spending a lot of time behind the screen and then I'm currently interning as a Dietetic intern where a lot of the times in the hospital the dieticians and their time behind a computer screen reading charts learning about patients trying to prescribe the right diet or modified diets and that's a lot of strain on my eyeballs I first realized that I was training my eyeballs a lot I think in the beginning at like the end of 2017 the beginning of this year because I started taking on more online classes all of my books are online and I edited a lot of videos and I noticed that when I spent a lot of time on my computer and behind my phone I we get migraines for days and you know when Millennials use the term for days that just like exaggerating until like five minutes I literally got migraines for days and at first I tried using blue light glasses which helps because it kind of blocks the harsh light that comes from screens sorry if you can hear sirens I'm just recording from my room right now I live right next to a hospital what has really helped me these past couple weeks was CBD oil and this CBD oil specifically is from green roads and they were kind enough to sponsor this video so thank you green roads I have been wanting to use CBD oil for a long time and like actually try it with my migraines and I actually tried it before I got into contact with green roads one of my friends actually suffers from chronic migraines and she let me try some of her CBD and it was amazing like my migraine went away it was in a couple hours that's something that I was trying to get rid of like all day and all of a sudden it wasn't like a magical oh it's gone but at the end of the day I was like whoa what my migraine go that's weird so then I was looking into really good CBD oils and I came across this one which is pharmacists formulated so it's medical grade CBD in case you wanted to know CBD does not get you high CBD is economic cut CBD stands for cannabidiol it's one of the many chemical compounds in the cannabis plants CBD and THC are the two most prominent chemical compounds in the cannabis plant but unlike THC CBD does not have a psychoactive factor in it so it does not get you high we actually have a whole endocannabinoid system in our bodies that is responsible for maintaining a healthy balance at every stage of biological life so we have a bunch of endocannabinoid receptors in our body that's because our body creates endocannabinoids does that help with so many functions in our lives but the problem is that our body also creates enzymes that break down these endocannabinoids so the purpose of implementing exogenous CBD like CBD oil which also comes in like different forms so there's an edible which there's like a fruit roll-up that Green Road sent me but I ate it already and they also have cream this I use but I'll talk about it later the purpose of adding exogenous DVD into our system is so that it can reduce the enzymes that break down the endogenous cannabinoids that our bodies make because our endocannabinoid system works with so many areas of our bodies CBD has been linked to so many things such as epilepsy there's been so many papers on epilepsy epilepsy pain chronic anxiety inflammation sleeps just to name a few those are the biggest ones but if you want to know more I will leave a link in the description below that literally shows like why people use CBD like people use CBD for acne treatment why people use CBD for lupus why do people use CBD for Addison's disease or digestive problems or autism or social anxiety so you can check all those out but right now I just wanted to talk about the personal benefits that I've had by using CBD oil this past month it's really made such a huge difference in my life like now I don't even use those blue light glasses anymore and I'm behind a screen all the time and I take CBD every night and I not only sleep better I not only have less anxiety but I've also been able to not have as many migraines throughout my weeks migraines are actually really crippling because you're going throughout your day and you want to think about good things and you want to be comfortable and you want to be productive but all you can think about is this pain just like radiating all over and I used to just be like you know what this migraine will go away it'll be fine my body's strong it's a warrior but what actually happens is that when you allow your body to stress itself out enough you create more and more cortisol which is not good for your body if you guys know about cortisol that's the stress hormone by using the CBD oil nightly and so I'll just do like three to five drops leave it under my tongue for at least 45 seconds and then swallow it has really really helped me wind down in the evening and the next day I don't have a migraine and throughout the day I don't have migraines and I didn't even realize this until two or three weeks into using it and I was like wait I used to get migraines all the time and I'm on a screen way way way more now than I have been before and I really honestly believe that it has to do with using CBD oil have you see video before but I recorded my first reaction of using the CBD oil on camera for you guys so you could see it so I'll show you now hey hey guys just got back from the gym and I look like a boy but I promise I have hair looks like this and has vegetable glycerin Fido cannabinoid rich oil essential hemp oil so place one two three drops under the tongue for at least ten to thirty seconds before swallowing this tastes really good and I'm told what this is but it tastes really really good first impression just like saliva building up in my mouth because I can't swallow anything but on a small office first impression is that it tastes really really good immediately I dropped it under my tongue I felt a little bit of tingling under my tongue but the tingling went away and now I am I guess I'm just waiting for the calmness to overcome me but I just came from a long day at my internship and I have a huge migraine because I was looking at the screen all day and that normally is what happens to me I really like the days it's pretty good back to you Amanda now I'm about four weeks into using it and I've never felt any better when I was actually sitting down to write out my thoughts on CBD I realized that I have been sleeping way better it kind of helps me like relax and wind down for the night there have been so many studies documenting CBDs beneficial effects on anxiety and noticed that that anxiety is kind of wound down more from when I started using CBD and I'm just way more relaxed and I fall asleep way easier and I stay asleep my problem is I fall asleep but then I wake up and I fall asleep and then I wake up and I never really felt completely rested when I woke up from my sleep so say I'd sleep like a good like six to eight hours because that's like a good time for me I'll wake up and feel like I still haven't slept but ever since using this I've honestly felt rested like I wake up and I actually wake up and ready to go yeah I'll hit the snooze button for five minutes but in that five minutes I'm like still awake and I'm just like letting myself rest a little bit more but I know that I'm awake and I don't just like knock right back out what I've set my snooze you know what I mean DVD is definitely helped with my migraines my sleep quality and as for anxiety I feel like I've just mentioned this over and over again there's no black and white where it just you know I'm super super anxious and all of a sudden huh I'm good I'm chill but it's just this gradual like hmm I can think about other things now I'm doing other things now and then I look back and I'm like wait wasn't I just like extremely anxious a couple of minutes ago huh so that's what it's been like for me so long story short that's what my experience has been like using CBD and I will continue to be using CBD oil because it has been so beneficial if you've never tried it and you suffer from the like sleep deprivation and anxiety migraines inflammation pains and aches in your bodies I would highly suggest trying out CBD it's completely legal it's safe good for your body speaking of body aches the green roads also has this bare green muscle and joint cream and I actually use it on my jaws because I have this gum chewing problem and like I've been really really trying to not chew as much gum but my jaws will get really really sore and they'll actually hurt and I notice it when I use this they're agreed and just like put it on my jaws it has this nice like calming effect and then my jaws just don't hurt anymore not to say that the soreness goes away completely but I just don't feel like as tight and tense and so I feel like this would be really good for those of you who have like tense necks or tense backs were like you always feel like you're holding tension there because your muscles are constantly I mean because that can happen when you're stressed and anxious subconsciously you just hold a stiffness in your body because that's the mood or that's the emotion that's going on within you and it just manifests physically but I feel like this could really help with that now you know CBD works for migraines anxiety sleep at least for me and I hope if you give it a try for those issues it works for you as well if you want to know more about CBD or you're not completely convinced please click the links in the description below I hope you guys learned something from this video and that you enjoyed it if you have ever experienced using CBD or if you use CBD or if you have any opinions or comments about it you leave them down in the comment section below because I love hearing what you guys have to say about anything so again please leave them in the comments below make sure you subscribe for more content turn on that notification bow so that you know when I post a new video every single week I hope you guys are having a wonderful morning moon day or night wherever you are and I will see you next time bye", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "kd1rKFBDt4M": "if you visited a farm field in Minnesota before World War two you likely would have come across a crop that is not very common today hemp when the US government passed the marihuana Tax Act of 1937 hemp dominance took a significant downturn aimed at the commercial sales of cannabis products the Act also imposed an excessive tax on hemp sales which was a hindrance to many farmers during World War two hemp made a comeback when imports of hemp that were needed to produce parachutes marine rope and other military necessities became scarce the federal government even launched a Pro hemp campaign which included the distribution of four hundred thousand pounds of seed it also released the hemp for victory film to encourage farmers to grow as much hemp as possible for the war effort so hemp was grown pretty widely in the state of Minnesota especially around World War two surrounding the kind of war effort the federal government was really encouraging farmers to grow hemp and we had a lot of processing capability to make things like canvas and rope and things that were needed for the war after that the need for the products kind of went down but then also we were having conversations about drugs in America and that led to the passage of the 1970 Controlled Substances Act in which hemp was really linked with marijuana as a Schedule one narcotic so it could not be grown anymore in an agronomic setting nearly 50 years later hemp is once again starting to take root in the u.s. with the passing of the 2014 farm bill states like Minnesota are able to implement laws that allow its Department of Agriculture and universities to grow him for research or pilot programs under the 2018 farm bill states are allowed to set up a plan to regulate hemp to ensure that any crop grown doesn't exceed federal standards for THC so after the passage of the 2014 farm bill the Minnesota Legislature passed the industrial hemp Development Act in 2015 and that really gave the department of agriculture authority to run a pile program under the farm bill and so the department had hemp growers growing and that first year we had six growers growing 40 acres which was really an achievement since we hadn't had him growing since the 1950s in Minnesota but there were a lot of challenges getting the program up and running we had to get a DEA permit to even move hemp material into the state and so it was very much a learning experience that first year so out of the applications that we have right now we have about 12,000 acres and about half of those acres are registered to be growing for CBD about the other half is registered to be growing for grain and we only have about a hundred and twenty acres growing for fiber and so because that market isn't there we think that's the reason why a lot of people aren't growing for fiber if you're growing hemp in Minnesota you have to be registered with the state and so that is for the pilot program but also farmers license to grow hemp so in order to be licensed through the Department of Ag you have to go through a background check you have to get your fingerprints taken you have to pay any sort of fees that we request for the program and then you have to identify all of the locations that you plan to grow hemp on and that's because at the end of the growing season 30 days before harvest MDA comes out and tests that hemp to make sure that it's not over the point three percent threshold of THC levels and so those locations are really critical to us the farmers also are required to sign a memorandum of understanding with the state that outlines what the requirements are or the pilot program while Lee and Shanna Berry's vision for raising hemp and they're traditionally corn and soybean farm began about three years ago 2019 will mark their first growing season I guess the reason why we got in this year it been a thought for long enough and we finally had to act on it get our act together and get moving and just try it and make her make our mistakes and getting hopefully some successes along the way Lee had told me a couple years ago that they were interested in growing something indoor at the ranch if possible just not 100% sure what and then about a year ago it turned into an interest into the hemp and the CBD and use and so I started just in general researching and just what they needed from me was to learn how to grow it and and specifically the nutrition this field went in in June the 15th we were a couple weeks later than we our target date we had to do some transplanting and in places and and then we have been planting off and on for basically a month yep so we'll find out if the later plants do what they'll do and in the earlier plants but ideally we'd like to be in closer to the June first you hand plant them through the with a waterwheel planter it rolls across the top of the plastic pokes a hole and and we drop the plant in and then come back and hand packed the plants and recovered about six acres total we have we designated areas according to type just to see which soils are better pest pressure eight heads just how it if it works good with a cabana you know close to another crop and just kind of spread it out and and see what's working and what if there's better areas that we need to concentrate on just like in in corn and beans there's there's a million ways that a grower can grow a corn crop so you know 28 growers that I work with not one of them does the same as another one and so it's the same in the hemp industry is that some growers are going to grow solid seed males females they're going to harvest a seed bale the straw lean Shanna decided to go this route and that was that was the way that that they had had chose was to go this route more like how tobacco has grown and so the spacing for some research Lee had done was the spacing and then the equipment that went along with it and then from there on and feminized seed and from there on knowing that end-use of how they wanted to have that and oil content that's kind of everything just kind of is a domino effect from one choice to the next to the next we try to get it like a garden and when we form our bed everything just works so much better when when you get when you got you don't you're not dealing with any sod and in the moisture that it just doesn't flow through the machine like it should so we had to make some modifications and and stumble through it because we had a window to get to get our beds made so we could get in with the plants but if it's not right the plants don't go in good the drip tape doesn't want to lace where should there's you get in you get critters living underneath the plastic where you got voids so yeah it's it's it's got to be good it's just got to be a good garden type tillage the watering we're still figuring that out again it's it's a very trial and error basis and each site is different we found that lie clean Shan have been very intensively managing all the sites on the watering end of it they've we're finding that we know that the plants don't like wet feet but they definitely like water and the sites that are are set up this year are very well drained sites which work really well there's one that's probably a little bit heavier that tends to hold water a little bit longer but it's it's just kind of managing managing the plant's response and that's one of the things learning about this and connecting with people that are much more seasoned than than I am in this a consult on the west coast and that was one of the things I struggled with is there was no quantitative values of anything going into this watering nutrition and a lot of them just said well you kind of just get the feel of the plant you'll do something to it and you'll see how it responds and that's virtually what we've learned how it really is it's not not like a normal being in corn crap you make the watering applications the nutrition applications and you see how it responds and then you kind of dial it in from there on how much more or less you need to do so our logging in our and keeping track of everything that we're doing we do a few different ways just to have a couple checks and balances that something doesn't get missed but anything that's that started as seed starts everything gets labeled everything that I've cloned gets labeled and and then in our our girl room we have a calendar of what gets done each day just a just in general and then we have a shared file note file that gets shared back and forth between these in my phone that it's what what they're doing for applications what I'm doing for cloning or planting or applications or or seeing in the field those types of things all get documented in that note file and then I also have a shared photo album that gets shared also so any of my scouting that I do in general on the farm plus with these sites I have a shared album for each site so all the protocols that have been written for nutrition anytime that I'm scouting there's a picture of a bug or a date or a note everything is on those shared files so he always has access to each each site how much gets put down on certain runs and the calculations are already done and about a week there'll be a protocol started where there will be a another party coming in to take tests tissue tests and they will run it through their lab and then that will give us a weekly guideline to go by on the THC and then also visual once we get into the flowering stages and the resin is visible then we can start seeing whether it's virtually the color of the resin of when we need to start pulling the pin of of when it's going to start turning to hot for us to harvest and we want to for sure beyond the early side of that if you do go over that threshold the state does offer a retest you you pay to get your material retested if it comes back to say as the first test then you destroy your crop we all right ordered a harvester this spring then found out that the it'll dismissed our miss our harvest window it'll won't be here till like December and we will hand harvest the flower here in the field well we'll put it send everything through a bunker to strip all the leaves off the majority leaves in stem so that you leave them behind and then the bud will be transported down to the ranch and we will put it out on in dried out on racks bring the moisture down and then once it's at the proper level for storage then we can go ahead and bag it and store it and be ready for the extraction process tht numbers were really low this year I think 1.17 was our highest THC content so it was very very low we would had warmer weather I would have been dissipated those numbers being a little bit higher but well under the threshold it just varied so much from plant planning and when you you know your yield at the end was did you have enough water did you have enough heat did you have this did you have that talking to all the different growers we were all kind of in a very similar weather pattern and that really made the difference it is the this that yield at the end of the day input costs weren't some varied because of where you bought your starts or if you started them to yourselves or if you you know you if you're on organic ground and you didn't have to put a bunch of fertilizer in in labor did you have enough labor to do your own harvest did you have to hire labor to do your harvest and the harvest kind of falls on top of all the other harvests out there so that part kind of gets tricky as far as being able to staff appropriately for 2020 season we're gonna have one large site it will be a site that we use last year but double the size and the the site hasn't been amended and prep work already done and then we'll possibly have another smaller site is my plan just to have a small research site so that can control all the variables on a smaller scale and continue the feeding and tissue test regimen and and hopefully continue to learn on on multiple strains within a site as well as our large site it's just that we'll be more efficient with our time and travels although there is still much uncertainty in the hemp industry the strong market growth for hemp derived products like CBD make betting on hence future stability an attractive option for many farmers the buyer market has changed a little bit last year you were able to sell it in the crude form there was a lot of demand for a lot of people getting into the industry this year it seems like it has to be of the highest quality in order to to move it on you don't get you don't have mediocre oil and expect to move it so that process has kind of changed there's been some back-end refinement that needs to be done to improve the numbers as we wait for guidance from the federal government from the USDA on the farm bill we're gonna be able to have our program up and running by the next growing season so on the grower side of things I think we'll have our regulations figured out on kind of the food side of things and you know the marketing side of things those challenges will take a little bit more time I know FDA has started considering changing the rules that they have for food and drugs with CBD but you know those are long public processes that that take a lot of input and a lot of data that again we don't have because we haven't been researching this crop for a long time so I think the Department of egg will have our ducks in a row in terms of the program but there are all these other considerations that need to be made to make the industry really a success in Minnesota what excites me about going up is the industry's young that it's a it's a big enthusiastic group there's a lot of things that haven't been done it's a new crop to the area and it's a challenge I guess just be prepared whatever you can get done today do it today get your license get your get your background check then start working towards that the more you can put behind you the easier it is the ground you work in the ground getting things right makes it go a whole lot easier start small it can be overwhelming don't be afraid to to reach out to people but don't be afraid to do it your own way either because there really is no right or wrong way we don't know that there's a right or wrong way and we still don't know but there's as far as learning for the year you you know more like we say we know more today than we did yesterday and there's a lot less things that I can tell you that I didn't learn that I did learn in the last seven months hi I'm Dave moats thanks for watching if you like this video hit subscribe right here if you haven't already and click that little bell right here to be notified when we post a new video and click here to see more great videos", "08qTKHI26Uc": "when people see CBD or they see a marijuana leaf or a hemp leaf they automatically assume drugs you know illegal activity and that's not the case with this type of product this this product is supposed to be presented in a more medicinal way what's it like to be on the ground floor of a new industry that few people fully understand welcome to the business of CBD the CBD superstore in Queens New York actually used to be a vape shop but a few years ago the owner saw the potential in CBD and gradually started changing his business originally we started off with a couple of products that we tested ourselves some for anxiety some for pain and we saw the growing popularity of the product and the results that customers were getting and before you know it it just it grew into a full blown-out CBD business though this company this is actually a specific facial serum yeah CBD infuse but it has some great ingredients in it my name is Nick Aragon EC I own CBD superstore here in Whitestone New York and what we do here is provide high quality pharmaceutical grade CBD products to our consumers but the jar the jars are those jars the seven gram jars are forty-five but the ones that we have loose those are fifty four seven grams don't necessarily get caught up with the strongest only because every strain could affect you differently in a better way so just because something says 20% doesn't mean you might not get great results from a 16% the Sun sets 19.5 the juicy fruit is 16.7 this is 7 grams that comes in a jar or you can get 14 grams which is doubled so in the beginning obviously there was a stigma you know people thought that when they heard hemp and they heard CBD it was automatically a marijuana product it was an intoxicating product and that really wasn't the case the fact is that we actually had some kickback from community people who actually thought we were a dispensary or we were opening up a marijuana dispensary in selling marijuana and you know the police department came in and we spoke to them and we spoke to the community groups Whitestone itself as a conservative community you know it's a family-oriented community so our job was to actually inform them and send out you know mailers to everybody's homes and reach out to the civic associations to explain what the product was how it works and how it does not conflict with any type of illegal substance that's on the market today unlike marijuana which comes from cannabis plants containing high levels of the psychoactive compound THC CBD is derived from him a different variety of cannabis with very low levels of THC that won't get you high despite its many uses the hemp variety of cannabis has been mostly illegal for decades due to its close relationship to marijuana but last year the 2018 Farm Bill legalized industrial hemp production CBD products are still in a legal gray area and potentially subject regulations the brightfield group an industry analyst estimates that in three years the CBD market could hit 22 billion dollars everybody was looking at the THC version of cannabis thinking that that's going to be where the real market is is people wanting adult use cannabis for recreational purposes you know fast forward to the hemp legalization in the 2018 farm bill and all the sudden everybody realizes wow we can put him derive CBD and just about everything under the Sun the companies kind of did this pivot and thought well of course we want to have this THC type of cannabis product but we might be able to make big big money having something really mainstream that could be sold on Amazon or even a Walmart typical would be a oral ingestion of either a tincture or a capsule all comes out the gummies different types of gummies dog treats we have isolates we have fruits shoes it's not necessarily the cure-all for everything it's not a miracle type of product you know we market the product as a natural relief while new products seem to be hitting the shelves of stores like NYX each week CBDs actual health benefits are still being studied now that hemp is legal and CBDs popularity has exploded a flood of new products claiming CBD content has hit the market the challenge for Nick is figuring out what's actually good you know obviously I would still buy them from you if you got them but we need to know where they come from well not by here I said you have to really talk to the farm owners you have to talk to the manufacturers and you have to talk to the companies you have to see how their products are being made how they're being sourced you also have to confirm that there are third-party lab results so there's no conflict of interest of companies testing their own products and that's been the problem for the consumers they don't know whether they're getting a good CBD product or a bad CBD product you know we need to know the cannabinoid profile in these products prior to getting them we need to know it has a medicinal benefit that's our job in the industries to be able to prove to a customer the validity of the product and the legitimacy of the company that we're buying from hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the

including a trace amount of and that amount isn't enough to have an intense high or psychoactive sensation and a lot of our farm fam who have intense anxiety or ptsd really really prefer that also we're a veteran family-owned company so shout out to our veterans", "w4bquPPJo5U": "what's up high intensity health errs today we're gonna talk all about the endocannabinoids system we're gonna talk about CBD THC and various endocannabinoids synthetic cannabinoid receptors and how you have an endogenous endocannabinoids system researchers actually dubbed this the endocannabinoid ohm because it's this complex metabolomic Anapa dori receptors most namely cb1 and cb2 are stimulated they initiate a blini of downstream metabolic processes that affect both appetite satiety mood anxiety epilepsy seizures they even affect things like adiposity they even affect metabolism ampk this endocannabinoids system is really elaborate so I want to welcome you back to high intensity health I'm like Mott so I'm super excited and an honor that you were here if at any point you're like dude these videos are cool please subscribe hit that like button and I love your comments because I learned from you just like you learned hopefully from these videos so if you have a question comment about CBD THC the endocannabinoids system please leave it below so why in the heck are we talking about this well number one I have been supplementing with phyto cannabinoids for a while I like ned's product they are show sponsor they are not paying me to make this video at all I just want to learn more about this complex system that I've known about for a while and I want to just give you a little shoutout I'm a book here called belly fan effect when I was studying for that book writing that book back in 2009 to 2013 I came across this researcher Patras canny and he's I think he's in Brussels in Belgium but I know he does some work outside of London at King's College and he published a few papers about the endogenous endocannabinoids system and how dysbiotic gut bacteria can cross talk with the endocannabinoids system in fat cells what scientists dub as adipocytes and how there's altered cb1 signaling within the fat cells as a consequence of perturbed gut bacteria so I've been kind of remotely interested almost for about 10 years now and just kind of following loosely the endocannabinoid research in the endocannabinoids system I think it's pretty fascinating fast forward to 2019 then my dog very recently got really ill she appeared to be in pain had labored breathing she appeared to have like some upper respiratory stuff going on and so I started supplementing you know giving her phyto cannabinoids from Ned and her health started to improve and I was like this is crazy what's going on what's going on their immune system I was just hoping to get a little bit of pain relief maybe help her sleep better maybe increase her appetite because she was not eating anything so I started to dive into the research and this is where things got really really fascinating for me because I love molecular biology and I assume because you're still watching this video that you do to so let's now with that as a preface let's talk about this and let me just pause I tried to film a video with my dog Shasta and I started crying I'm gonna try and keep it together during this video but basically um basically my dog is dying and I did a bunch of research around cannabinoids to just see like how I could help her at the at these final stages it was really emotional for me because I was you know telling you all the things I've learned or I was trying to articulate to you all these things that I've learned about the endocannabinoids system and cb1 receptors and the anandam ID and all this and I was crying so here we are with part two hopefully it's a little bit more polished so here's a few three things you need to know okay you have two different primary endocannabinoids receptors in your body these are endogenous receptors friends even if you don't supplement with any phyto cannabinoid if you never touch THC or cannabis it doesn't matter you still have these receptors which is really fasting so you have the cb1 receptor and the cb2 receptor let's talk about the cb2 receptor first because I think this is very important its newly identified and we now know that when we take endogenous phyto cannabinoids and things like that that we stimulate this cb2 receptor it's found and it's ubiquitously expressed in our immune system this is where we might get some antiproliferative and maybe even cancer supportive benefits from supplementing or taking or at least finding of fine-tuning the endocannabinoid system tone by way of stimulating the cb2 receptor in our immune system but now let me pause here I don't want to make any regis claims I was sitting in Airport at an airport recently and overheard people talking about how they cure cancer by taking CBD I'm not gonna say that or make that claim at all but there is some interesting research showing that individuals with cancer may benefit from taking CBD potentially because it may stimulate or affect this receptor and therefore make our immune system more resilient okay so and I'm just just going to leave it at that but very interesting now here's where things get a little bit more fascinating behind me the cb1 receptor I'll throw some things on the screen here this is ubiquitous expressed in the brain so in the cerebellum and basal ganglia and this is why in different disease states such as epilepsy and Parkinson's there is some interesting research being done and conducted about the utility of stimulating the cb1 receptor because in those different disease states the cerebellum and basal ganglia is implicated in the etiology of the disease even in Alzheimer's what we see is a compensatory increase in the cb1 receptor as a means to potentially modulate or read you know balance abnormal brain chemistry and Alzheimer's okay so this is what's kind of interesting and I want to pause on the brain conversation and go back to obesity for just a moment what we see in obesity and the animal model studies have shown us is there is an increase in the cb1 receptor density in fat cells now we know an individual's when they gain weights when they when they transition from lean to overweight to obese there is a there's a linear increase in the amount of inflammation that they have in their dipper sites so it's not yet known if the increase in the receptor density of the cb1 receptor in fat cells is a cause or a compensatory shift once you know there's a lot of inflammation within and among the fat cells and individuals that are overweight so data is still pending we don't really know exactly what's the chicken or the egg here but scientists have figured out that in the context of Alzheimer's that this increased cb1 receptor throughout different parts of the brain may be a compensatory means to reduce inflammation in the brain okay now other tissues and brain regions that you may be of importance you know to this conversation and contact is the hippocampus and the amygdala the hippocampus which is Greek for seahorse it's a part of the brain where we form a lot of memories it's also a part of the brain that's very susceptible to stress induced memory changes you know you people that are very stressed out there's a lot of cortisol that can affect the hippocampus and the amygdala is where we have a lot of emotional responses that are stored and initiated there so a lot of people that are abused that have been raped or physically abused or you know mentally abused or they're very flighty have been in bad situations and then get a really you know like a panic or stress response that can be a hyperactive amygdala and this is why I say people you know and I've experienced the benefits from a psychological standpoint taking you know phyto cannabinoids taking CBD oil and I've noticed that it calms the mood it has a natural anxiety effect that's because of probably this one-two punch with this this high concentration of cb1 receptors within the hippocampus and the amygdala okay so anxiety sleep things like that you know and we talked about the cerebellum and basal ganglia with movement epilepsy seizures even multiple sclerosis there's a lot of research being conducted on using cannabinoids because of the high concentration of the cannabinoid receptors in those brain regions now here's where things get really interesting again going back to anxiety is in the cortex and the prefrontal cortex there's a high concentration of the cannabinoid receptors and that may have to do with again mood again feelings of anxiety things like that so if we're constantly worried if we're thinking and judging and you know adding a lot of you know preconceived notions about who we are as people things like that that are developed in the cortex that can affect mood and create can create anxiety and so this is where ever HAP's supplementing with endocannabinoids whether it's derived from hemp or derived from cannabis can be helpful here's what's really fascinating that I did not know and I think you might find this particularly interesting is when you take cannabis or cannabinoids or say of phyto cannabinoid or something from THC along those lines the CBD cannabidiol is what CBD stands for doesn't directly stimulate the cb1 receptor what it is it prevents or increases this that the amount of time that on your own endogenous endocannabinoids called Ananda mite is present which is crazy so again we think that cannabidiol or CBD would stimulate this receptor but what it does is it actually increases the half-life so to speak where the amount of available and nanda bide which i think is fascinating so for now that's what i've learned about the different receptors different receptor types you know it's a complex intricate system what i can tell you in closing is pharmaceutical companies are investing a lot of money into you know various synthetic agonist or CB one or cb2 receptor antagonist depending upon the tissue specificity so it's a really fascinating conversation fascinating narrative there is some some gender differences here where women tend to have a higher prevalence of polymorphisms involved in the cb1 receptor and distribution so this is going to be just kind of an overview exploratory video to give you a better insight and idea and give you more references and resources that'll link below two papers that really help me to better understand like what's all the hype around CBD is it real is it not is there any science is there not you know all that and let me tell you i've been blown away like this could be a whole video series and we might do that to talk about this system and i will close with links below i make no money off this but net is a show sponsor i use our product it enhances my sleep i use it instead of drinking alcohol i like their 750 milligram tincture i do 1 ml under the tongue at night before bed it's a phenomenal product and they do have this natural skin balm that works really well also as a skin as a skin that works really well also as a sex lubricant no kidding my wife and i have experimented with it it doesn't sting her it's great it's like natural like the real deal so i'm links are below to that i hope this video gave you a little bit of an idea and better understanding into the different you know resources and contexts and applications for what CBD might be helpful one thing that i forgot to mention was that in the context of cancer and appetite CBD and affecting these receptors has been studied in the context of nausea and anti vomiting so that's another application if you're having a hard time holding food down if you're trying to put on muscle and eat a lot maybe you could benefit from taking CBD or stimulating this system in some manner so as always I'm grateful that you watched all the way through I hope you enjoyed this video hit that like button if you did and we'll catch you in a future episode down the road appreciate your doing in", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see you next week", "apBV6tDFXLc": "my name is Scott Vaughn Hill do you do you use I do yeah yeah I use it for inflammation for a lot of my anxiety and issues like that I'm in a high-stress position so you know nice to just be able to be more even killed through the day my daughter's actually has ADHD so we use a CBD Tincher put a little few drops in the morning in her chocolate milk and she's good to go so yeah yeah so I'm all about it I'm all for it yeah yeah I was a riddling kid so and I I don't want to go that route because I don't want to you know I felt very zombified a lot of my energy and my creativity was kind of squashed you know and I just hate to do that because she's that vibrant lively being that I just don't want to you know dull down with with any kind of medication so the CBD has been working good along with a lot of patients and yeah my mother as well has had really amazing success with using CBD to regulate our blood sugar so we've got around about 60 milligrams of CBD oil a day so great success there yeah it's it's an amazing amazing discovery that's been here forever that you know gladly we're finally finding some uses for it and you know really acceptance for", "AinA_wKFQe4": "hello CBD fans it's Brad from hemp remedies wwm pyramides calm also have remedies on Facebook you can look for me personally on Instagram I don't have a business channel yet however I have my own a moist person videos on there most importantly guys if you are watching this video please take a second to like and subscribe to the channel I'm constantly doing product video product demo videos and when I do when I launch a video you'll get an email notification that way you'll have first dibs at the products when they come in today I am so excited I finally got in my company's DVD saw this is hemp remedies reliefs of what makes this sub different than the majority of the other sobs on the market is the other sobs made by the big manufacturers have about fifty milligrams sometimes 100 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar now those are excellent products I sold many of them so I always say in my videos I was one of the first in the industry I've been in the business since 2013 prior to that I had a medical marijuana company so I've been around for a long time I have also been the sole CBD provider to numerous patient groups so I've have a lot of interaction with people and how the products work the sobs that were on the market prior to this fifty maybe a hundred milligrams of CBD many great products they were all made with the same starting oil all of these manufacturers used the same starting oil to make their products that was imported in from the Netherlands it's quality oil guys non-gmo organic pesticide free organically grown I've seen I used to sell it by the kilo I've seen labs on every single batch while the stalk and stem oil is great oil what you're not getting is the terpenoid profiles minor cannabinoid profiles as well that you find in the flower of the plant and that's because importation rules would not allow them to use the flower so everything was made with the stalk in stem oil which again same CBD and the stalkin stem is the same CVD that's in the flower you just didn't get that big minor turpenoid or minor cannabinoid and turpenoid profiles that you would find in flower oil so you don't get the entourage effect in Turkey an interplay this is my new Saab I am starting it out at five I have it at 500 and 1000 milligrams of CBD in a two ounce jar way stronger way more much more CBD in these products than you would find in the other manufacturers and it's true whole plant so that means that the stalk and stem what I was still used which is excellent Oriole it has all of the fats and healthy oils that you find in the plant that's very good for you but it's also got oil from the flower as well so you get the terpene or clay you get all the terpenes in there the minor cannabinoids much more relief much higher quality product so I'm very excited about this and to bring those guys to you it's going to be on the website now I am waiting for labels to be finalized and shipped to me until then I will be shipping it out without labels with a CoA stating what's in the product right from the lab yeah very excited about those guys I also have a texture that's in a 2 ounce bottle that's whole plant it's got no glycerin Zoar any type of additives to it it's in a coconut oil base the flavorings natural orange made from distilled oranges and I also have them lavender from distilled lavender plants so everything is all-natural the textures go 500 milligrams all the way up to 5000 and I have a vioient made the same way it's in a coconut oil base so there's no polyethylene glycol and a vegetable glycerin all natural flavors from either distilled oranges or lavender so I'm excited about that that should be on the website in the next couple of days and of course I made the world's first legal CBD CBD dad back in 2014 called early I have that out right now at 800 milligrams per gram or 1 ml serving whole plant pesticide free organically grew and just like all the other products and I have the new wax crumble got a sample of that right here this is just mind-blowing stuff it's a true wax crumble from whole plant oil CBD on this and batch was 94% 940 milligrams of CBD and a gram so with that being said I want to thank you guys for your time make sure you like the page the YouTube channel subscribe to it I would be ultra grateful if you shared any of these videos on your Facebook page Facebook is not allowing me to run sponsor two ads again so that's super appreciated and keep your eyes peeled for my next video", "og8Rkkkwa7c": "[Music] thank you very much what a great pleasure it is to be here in Zoomers Studios I'm actually a Zoomer so it's kind of fun to be here with some boomers I think as well so welcome I'm gonna talk a little bit about medical cannabis edibles topicals and oils oh my right eye there's a lot of information there so much information so that actually as of today's date there are over 360,000 people that have accessed medical cannabis in Canada 360,000 have applied for medical documents so very exciting times in terms of research in this area so I do speak at engagements in the industry and I'm compensated for that but today I'm also compensated for my talk I'm going to talk a little bit about the view from here so I'm a student of cannabis I learned from my patients that as well as the the sheer volume of patients that I do see my background is really actually an addiction and mental health I've kind of fallen into the track of prescribing medical cannabis to my patients and I've done this for about just over six years so from addiction to mental health the face of my patients have changed primarily to a 55-plus because people are seeking medical cannabis to help manage their pain what I do believe is that addiction is not a moral failure I believe that stigma is a barrier to care for not only for people living with addiction but also for people trying to seek care for medical cannabis I'm wondering from a number of you here and online audience may have had difficulty accessing cannabis through their physicians not really understanding or not knowing how to prescribe we always look at the risk versus benefit of all the medicines we prescribe in cannabis being one of those and then always clinical research is hugely important in innovation and improving care for patients and this is something that I'm very interested in so we're gonna talk a little bit about the medical cannabis basics and I understand that there was some talk prior to about actually delving into endocannabinoids system and I'll talk very briefly about that obviously questions of safety I'm always grilled by my colleagues all the time what the heck are you doing there's no not enough evidence and I say fight me we have lots of evidence that supports what we do in our practice we look at every case by case and again research and innovation and looking forward to to future research so this is a very brief diagram here on really the timeline of medical cannabis this is not a new drug would you agree this is not a new drug this has been around for millennia and quoting dr. Zach Walsh who is a psychologist out in BC who works a lot with substance use PTSD he calls this an ancient and gentle medication so when we start to look at the history we can look back to 1000 BC where there was a pharmacopoeia on on the list of different types of different ways of using medical cannabis over a hundred written recipes for before particular ailment we look at a Chinese physician who operated on his patients using a cannabis and wine now we call that a saturday-night and Gimli but no we don't but it's it's really I'm very thankful for research and anesthesia in in this 21st century but we fast-forward to 1964 where dr. Ravi McCollum who is still practicing as a bench scientist he discovered that actually there was a molecule called THC and then fast forward to the 90s where we discovered that we actually have receptors in our body for cannabis and we make our own endocannabinoids so the basics as I've alluded to the endocannabinoids system is always within us all we are born with the system that helps us maintain balance as we modulate pain mood sleep as well as our immune system so when we look at the receptors in our body cb1 receptors are for THC those are primarily on our nervous system cb2 receptors are pretty much everywhere else but heavily involved within our immune system so I always say the dose is the poison when legalization happened how many people's hair started on fire oh my god legal cannabis what are we going to do people are gonna be running down the streets intoxicated well that hasn't really happened actually when we start to look at the stats and I actually just pulled them up today age groups that we were really concerned about youth actually has gone down in numbers the numbers have not changed to our 18 to 25 years so but who's using more cannabis ice guys what's great here right so when we talk about the THC it is intoxicating but again the dose is the poison generally most of my patients are using less than 20 milligrams a day in a 24-hour period dependent on what their what I see them for in my patients that are trying to describe from opiates we have the ability to use cannabis as a substitution it's not it doesn't work a hundred percent for everybody but again I always say my patients fall into a bell curve the people in the middle generally are doing well we do prescribe all kinds of medications over-the-counter but this it's the tails it's the people that may be too sensitive to THC or the people that it doesn't really work very well so those are the people that I'm very interested in and then of course CBD so cannabidiol which is the non intoxicating form of cannabis I don't say it's not psychoactive in the sense that it doesn't make you high it does work in your brain but it doesn't cause intoxication and it activates many systems especially our immune system so what's the difference between medical and recreational consumers so most of the medical patients that I see are generally cannabis naive and we we educate them they generally are consuming medicine cannabis to help them reduce harmful medicines or medicines that they're really that they're taking too much of primarily around opiates and benzodiazepines and as dr. Khan was alluding to we worry about our elder population using benzodiazepines and I've had a lot of success actually tapering people off so most patients that are using medically are over the age of 50 the challenge with many patients my oldest patient is 98 years old her 72 year old friend brought her to my health center rolled her in on her wheelchair and she was very excited to try this new medicine the challenges she doesn't have internet access you cannot access medical cannabis at your local pharmacy and most of my patients have a relationship with their pharmacist of course there's limited access and of course that medicine is taxed recreationally patients generally when you look when you look at our rec market so in Manitoba we have I think 30 recreational stores I cannot tell you how many times I've had patients come in and they bring in their bottles that their grandkids have bought them and say I don't know about this stuff I need to learn about it 7 out of 10 people that are showing up at a recreational market in Manitoba are looking for medical so we don't track them the average age is generally 19 plus patients or people can access it easily same-day access it's definitely taxed but the challenges for patients that are actually trying to access something same-day you're looking at a 50% markup so always it's really about safety so and that's where I get pushed a lot so I really look at the whole patient what a novel approach right we look at substances that are used in the in in populations of people and as dr. Khan was talking we worry about substance use misuse in our elder population but when we look at really this really look at the stats alcohol is actually the biggest bad actor when we look at addiction rates 76% of the population over the age of 18 is using alcohol but 20% addiction rate you look at opiates while we know we're in an opiate crisis we are losing people left right and center one person every two hours in Canada dies of an opioid overdose I don't want to take part in that in terms of over prescribing and prescribing appropriately and then we look at cannabis cannabis really you're looking at a nine percent risk for addiction but I always look at those patients that come to me that are overusing cannabis they're medicating something and with my addictions hat it's generally trauma pain pain comes in all kinds of packages we can have bone pain we can have arthritis pain we can also have emotional pain existential pain and then of course tobacco we know that that's not good to use and obviously in patients that are smoking cannabis some patients will actually or some people will actually mix tobacco and cannabis and shouldn't do that so driving we always want to look at harms and benefits obviously of cannabis so in terms of inhalation if you're going to inhale cannabis we recommend vaporization and I know there's people's again here starts on fire when we talk about vaping but I'll talk about that very quickly obviously patients that are you have underlying cardiac history we worry about patients that are using high THC in that population so people that have arrhythmias afib people that are on blood thinners that can sometimes work in the same pathway as cannabis and as well one I always say I have nine pay nine patients and 6,500 patients that I've provided access to cannabis nine have had side-effects seven oh it's diarrhea is the is the main one so two actually had underlying mental health issues and we're overusing THC and then of course dry mouth of course we all know benefits for CBD primarily in terms of the anti-inflammatory effects as well as an antispasmodic and then we talked about substitution potential for opiates other considerations we talked about vaping vaping is we talk about vitamin e acetate that's been added to a lot of these liquid carts cannabis vapes and those have been done in the illicit market that is not in in the illicit market so in your legal market vaporization generally refers to those vape carts as well as dried flower in a little machine that you can vaporize we worry about the illicit market as well in terms of pesticides cannabinoid contact most people that are in the illicit market are using only high THC and then as well education for patients is really important because patients a lot of patients are cannabis naive and they're they they just don't have a hot clue as to how they should dose and I've had a couple of patients come in and say well my granddaughter brought me these these oils and I took too much of this and I ended up sleeping for 12 hours so you have to worry you have to worry about them so case by case what is the best way for cannabis to use cannabis for me so as I said the patients may be accessing the illicit market patients that have chronic non-cancer pain primarily my arthritis patients are using it as substitution in Manitoba they're accessing it through the recreational markets and it's mostly people over 50 that are that are trying to access for medical most patients are looking for high CBD and they don't want to get high there's a lot of negotiation as to using THC in those populations and a lot of people have misinformation dr. Google is not my friend so and obviously be worried about adverse events so so many variety of cannabis products out there dry flower oils soft gels gel caps vape pens edibles infused beverages what do you know how are you gonna take all this stuff so it's really a very stepwise approach pardon me so for topicals anybody recognize those chubby fingers they're out chain so topicals work very nicely for patients we know that we've got this skin and we've got three layers we need to get through pardon me so we have to have a good understanding of what type of topical will actually permeate the skin this is a model of inflammation pardon me so this is a very complex diagram of inflammation and how our endocannabinoid system works to help reduce that inflammation it works in a very complex manner initially that inflammation is acute but as you go forward with that inflammation if it's not arrested at that point it develops into a chronic inflammatory process thank you so we worry about people developing chronic inflammatory issues especially with skin rashes as it relates to people living with psoriatic arthritis any of the autoimmune arthritis we we don't want to get into a chronic situation and I've had very good success with topicals for patients living with psoriasis so allergies with topicals so out in the market in the legal market there's various forms of topicals and they're just starting to come out in the market but I have many patients that come in with some very nasty smelling tubs of stuff they have made themselves and there could be an active component of cannabis this is a topical cannabis that's not been cooked or activated and that is the rash so it's always good to do a test site when you're using topicals so as I said the absorption rate it does not cross the blood-brain barrier so you're not gonna get high if you apply a topical using caution with open areas especially if there's THC it takes about 30 to 60 minutes for that to take effect and it can last anywhere from 4 to 12 hours I have many patients that will use this on joints on their back and have had very good success so these aren't your COCOMs brownies so if your granny okay I don't know how many times I've had patients come in and talk about somebody made them inedible and then they had a bad experience I actually had one patient go to the hospital emergency department because he had taken in edibles somebody had made and he thought oh this isn't working right so he's like 45 minutes this is not working it takes another one and then at about an hour yeah he was on that ride for about eight hours and didn't couldn't get off right so you have to be very careful we worry about that for the simple fact that I could drop your blood pressure so this is why I worry in in populations of people they're living with high blood pressure and they take their medication this medicine can affect your blood pressure and I have patients that have actually come off their blood pressure medications because of cannabis right so you have to be cautious if you are taking medications you should talk to your doctor about if cannabis is good for you but again the formulations are endless oil based generally is is the go-to in terms of cannabis oils they come in many formulations high THC THC and CBD and and primarily CBD there's different ratios there's there are some strain specific oils available however few and far between there's a few companies that are doing that so far capsules are another option for patients that don't like to take oil the oil can be very messy and difficult to dose for patients that have arthritis in their hands you're gonna start to see more in the recreational market I know that a number of the license holders are not kind of going down the candies chocolate Mart route but for patients that may not want to take a full dose they could have a candy and use maybe half of it wrap it up put it away chocolate again can you only have one piece of chocolate so you have to really watch the dosing the dosing I think will be anywhere from 1 to 10 milligrams of THC and there will be many formulations with CBD if ever you're in a recreational situation and you're thinking about using cannabis please use both together always have CBD with it because that quite often will help push the THC off the receptors so you're not getting as much of an effect so again with absorption and ingestion as I kind of alluded to please wait please wait if you haven't had any effect after 90 minutes then of course by all means go ahead and try another dose but it can affect dosing especially in patients living with perhaps diabetes that may have a really slow gut or gastroparesis it can take somewhere to 2 to 4 hours my friends that are on the Sheik and Facebook website they're there a group of women that are supporting each other I think there's 4,000 of them out there they always talk about having a small fatty snack so cannabis likes fat it works best in our bodies if patients are having difficulty they're saying it's and really not working I always say have a little have something like a small fatty snack to help that absorb faster for you so this is just an overview this is a table that I give all my patients and it's just an overview of what's of how can how you can use cannabis what I'm actually missing on this one and we're not going to talk about that today is suppositories for our patients that are not able to take anything by mouth that that don't want to smoke and especially for our patients living with GI problems so ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease women living with endometriosis can use that as well but really this is just an overview of what I've just spoken about and then dosing so high CBD is generally my rule of thumb I go from 20 to 60 milligrams a day for patients to start them and then add in THC as needed it is really dose dependent on affordability and for all of you that are on whoever is on medical cannabis we have to really look at the price point for patients a lot of patients say oh my gosh I wish I could take more but they can't afford it cannabis naive patients on opiate opioids so I can speak to a particular case two gentlemen that I'm caring for now one is on both are on high-dose opiates this gentleman was on I think 120 equivalents morphine and in six weeks he's come off all of that using medical cannabis and so high CBD 200 milligrams a day plus about 40 milligrams of THC and I think within the next so he's still having withdrawal from that but he said he can't believe it because he actually doesn't have pain he's just really going through withdrawal so he's done really well and he has degenerative disc disease and arthritis in his back so again looking at anxiety versus depression I have a lot of patients that will come in and say oh my gosh I'm so anxious and I'm smoking so much cannabis they're taking way too much THC THC can actually be it's counterintuitive too much THC can actually make your anxiety worse so I generally will encourage those patients to use high CBD and lower low percentage THC as well in depression patients will have a little bit more THC for activation and always with anybody that you're considering cannabis or trying it even recreationally please go low and slow if you take away anything from today low low low and increase your dose every one to three days so research and innovation so this is kind of where I'm very excited and I'm so impressed with the Arthritis society and the support they've given to research and innovation we have evidence on the horizon so we know the there's shortage of reso research as well because of restrictions through Health Canada I think to date there's 200 research licenses out there I would love to be able to do research in my practice but I can't because we can't dispense cannabis on our site so you have to get a special dispensation to do that there's thousands of papers out there that really support cannabis as an antispasmodic as an anti-inflammatory and an analgesic we start to look at anti-cancer and sedate of effects as well which again is very exciting patients perspectives are key so when I say I'm a student I learn everyday from my patients that come to see me about using medical cannabis we learn together and patients become allies in our research so we know that 63% this is a paper from 2014 over 290 patients were they had a questionnaire done and 63% were using cannabis to substitute for prescription drug 30% for opiates 16% for benzodiazepines 25% for alcohol and tobacco at 12% which is fascinating because in my practice we see patients stop especially with high high CBD patients actually will lose the craving for alcohol and other substances which is fascinating and very interesting especially for patients that are living with crystal meth and cocaine addiction this lady is a very cool lady I don't know if you've anybody read the Newark Times this was just this pot six months ago one of the researchers associated with this study is actually from Calgary this lady is a very happy lady she has a genetic deletion that deletes her brakes for making her own THC pretty cool eh so she's really happy they call her blissed-out but interestingly she's covered in scars she's 71 years old she's probably 72 now she lives in Scotland covered in scars she she feels no pain so she had a baby she said it felt like it was tickling her she broke her wrist she had surgery didn't require any medication postoperatively in in her family there are people that have similar genetic deletions but not to the extent that she has so when you start thinking about that as development and this is within her endocannabinoid system that she has that deletion so we start thinking about that hmm could we create a medicine that will not be harmful that will not cause us to have addiction and could we do that so she's a very exciting person and she's very happy so this is great the other thing when we talk about topicals and again this is not really arthritis base but cannabis compound could be a weapon to fight against superbugs we worry about antibiotic we antibiotics and overuse and antibiotic stewardship is something that we as physicians have undertaken after we've written tons of prescriptions for it now we have to kind of hold back so this was actually in a mouse model where they applied topical cannabidiol and mrs a so methicillin-resistant Staph aureus gone we have two patients in our practice right now that have had topical cannabidiol and especially in a lady that had a below knee amputation and had a wound that would not heal it's completely healed applying cannabidiol and then in another gentleman that had peripheral vascular disease so he had lots of swelling in his feet and subsequent callus his legs are clearing up as well so topical cannabidiol is something that we're very interested in and so going forward patients and physicians are learning together this is so important and so we appreciate I appreciate when patients can be honest and forthright and tell me what they're doing to manage their pain as dr. Khan was talking about substance use and elder population it's really quite interesting when we do a drug screen in those populations about what people are actually using so I'm in a very privileged place when we talk about addiction and mental health because people tell me things and now with this I actually have something that can help them I have another tool in my belt it's not the panacea it's not the the unicorn it is another tool that we must do more research with so today what I'd like you to think about is really about if you're using cannabis and how how you would like to take that obviously ingestion is the best when you're looking at more than one affected joint particularly with arthritis topical may be the best for a localized area again start low and go slow we don't want you to run into trouble or running down the street without any clothes on we don't want that to happen either and the biggest issue really is accessibility and affordability accessibility and affordability I cannot stress enough so in terms of lobbying Health Canada to provide safe access for patients to have relationships with their pharmacy to have medication reviews with their pharmacist as it relates to using cannabis as well insurance companies to be able to cover it document your successes and your challenges when you're using cannabis I want to hear about it your physician will want to hear about it it's important because we're all doing research we're all students as it as it relates to medical cannabis and we're learning so much about this amazing plant and that is it okay we have some online questions and I think you've actually touched on some of the things that that people want to know sure more about so the first question can CBD cause liver problems is it safe to take with methotrexate hmm okay so you have to really look at the pathways so we talked about pathways let go through our liver we have many of them methotrexate generally has been safe but we always want to follow that patient obviously closely we talked about there's been just a paper released on the possibility that CBD may cause liver toxicity it really some people will have elevated liver enzymes but the people that I've seen I haven't seen that happen so it may be something that is a one-off but it's not something that I've seen okay here's something you did touch on cannabis is so expensive are there more affordable ways to access medical cannabis well I don't want you to go to jail so that would be stealing it so no no I I think it's so challenging for many patients there is the ability to grow cannabis under the medical regimen but that I always kind of say you know there's challenges with that in itself because patients aren't able to test their cannabis for me as a physician I really want to know what they're taking the license holders will have certificate of analysis and so we look at that certificate we can say is this working for you we can look at the terpene profile the cannabinoid profile where as in in the growing market we don't we don't see that so until our insurance companies get on board until we decide that we're not going to tax this medicine we're kind of stuck with what we have and again something you touched on how do I know what dose to start at right so I always say to my patients we start everybody on the same I generally do will do a group education with four patients and I'll say okay everybody today is gonna start off in the same I start generally at ten milligrams morning and afternoon of CBD and then if patients are having trouble sleeping I'll use a combination of THC and CBD formulations in a one full syringe can be anywhere from 10 milligrams of THC and 15 of CBD I start them off on 0.1 ml so it really is about 1 to 2 milligrams one milligram of THC so everybody starts off in the same when I see them back at their next appointment everybody will be on something different so start low go slow ok is it safe to take cannabis with my arthritis medication well it depends on what arthritis medication you're taking so patients that are taking arthritis medications and those are generally DMARDs so disease modifying agents biologics i generally and over-the-counter so how many patients with arthritis take way more ibuprofen than they should tylenol then they should right so people are taking mid foals so what's worse so when I start prescribing that cannabis to those patients Jen only the first thing to go is over-the-counter and then I let them have that conversation with their rheumatologist about medicines we don't want any damage to happen to people's joints but we just don't have enough evidence to say no problems stop so we get them to continue okay and another question about an interaction with CBD and what about blood thinners so we worry about this that pathway and so patients may be on blood thinners that we monitor on a regular basis like warfarin so it would be just like taking another medication it does follow that similar pathway and I believe it's three a four and two three a six pathway cytochrome p450 we have to really watch the blood counts for those patients on warfarin for the patients that are taking the non monitored again we monitor them and we we tell them there is a possibility that this may be competing and it's really about being being watchful okay can medical cannabis help increase a person's appetite and lead to weight gain so yeah for sure I guess and that's really about how are you using it and so yes there are some patients that may gain weight but actually what I see is the opposite and specific real THC strains so THC v is something that we look at as a potentially novel drug to help people lose weight and we're looking at at that in our patients living with diabetes patients living with diabetes generally I have a number of patients and I'm thinking about one man in particular he reduced he kept having lows I'm here like what the heck is going on this is when I first started and actually he was able to reduce his insulin requirements by 50% because of this HCV as well as the cannabidiol so there's definitely potential in our patients living with diabetes to help drive that sugar back in the cell so one of the things that I always tell my patients if you have diabetes I want you to make sure that you're monitoring your Sugar's Monday Wednesday Friday and to ensure that you're not having lows because we may have to adjust medication okay we may need an accountant for this one can I claim medical cannabis on my taxes like other medications yes you can yes you can so I always tell patients so if they've been accessing the REC store and they're going well it's just easier to do that and I say well you can't write off a case of beer you're not going to write off your cannabis so if you're truly using this medically come into the medical program and then we adjust we adjust them and then they can actually put that towards their taxes oh and here's a good one can I travel to the US with medical cannabis I have to stop my treatment unless you want to go to jail so it's really challenging and actually I'd really love for our Snowbird associations to to really lobby the government for this there's a number of legal markets in this in the States and I have patients that have actually changed their destination to actually go to a place where it's legal so there are ways that we can there's synthetic illegal it's illegal federally they're federally but in this state they can also but traveling with cannot no no no you cannot but patients have changed their destinations so that they can actually buy it they're there and there are synthetic forms of cannabis which can be very challenging for patients because the it's very strong so they sometimes will use that dependent but for the most part they they're kind of stuck what if my doctor won't talk to me about cannabis you can ask them for a referral and if not come and see me yeah it's you have to find a prescribing doctor it's challenging because physicians all physicians across Canada are allowed to write a medical document for cannabis if they tell you that it's not allowed it's just because they're not comfortable to do that so it would be the patient if the physician is not willing to prescribe or refer then it's going to be the patient seeking help themselves yeah and a lot of the licensed producers or the medical cannabis they they have doctors on call yeah they do for sure okay what if CBD and THC have little effect on me that's an excellent question I was just talking about you know the the bell curve so I'm very interested in the people that are very sensitive and the people that you could give them a whole bottle of it and it doesn't work so when I talk about new research we're talking about really precision medicine pharmacogenomics the genetic expression of your endocannabinoid system and all the variants because you guys are all stars in the sky some of you might belong to constellations so it's it's the research is coming and so we're gonna get to the point where we're precisely able to prescribe specifically for you so okay research ok we can now open it up to our studio audience anyone I fans're all the questions and and what's your name please my name is Brenda I'm wondering for example like I'm assuming you shouldn't drive if you're taking this stuff and I'm assuming what if you're looking after grandchildren I'm talking about taking it for a medical reason like are you going to be okay who is doing that and looking after grandchildren well friend it depends on what you're taking right so if you're using high CBD no intoxication if you're adding so I have patients that will take 60 milligrams of CBD and add in maybe 2 milligrams of THC right and so that is the CBD is really buffering the intoxicating effects of the THC you're still get getting the opiate sparing ability from the THC but no intoxication so can you drive yeah if you're not intoxicated the rule of thumb is and again the low-risk use guidelines are available as well but if you feel intoxicated don't drive if you're if you're taking THC and CBD at night for sleep generally you should feel fine in the morning unless you've taken too much and then you need to check yourself you shouldn't say at night so when you were sleeping does it have the effect in the daytime of no pain or you have to be taking it to have the no pain so mostly patients are taking CBD during the day ok most of my patients are retired so they're not having to worry about THC during the day but most that use THC THC during the day are taking such small amounts with such a good CBD buffer that they they're fine okay thank you anyone else okay thank you so much [Applause] [Music] you", "9nBimiqnPnU": "hey guys welcome to my channel my name is valerie and today i thought i would do a little chat about cbd and review some products from a company called bluebird botanicals so if you're interested in that stick around i wanted to start this video with a brief description of what cbd is in case anybody needs a little background information cbd is the abbreviation for cannabidiol which is the second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis cannabis is an umbrella term for a plant family that includes both marijuana and hemp the main differences between marijuana and hemp is that marijuana contains high levels of thc hemp contains higher levels of cbd so the products we'll be talking about in this video today are cbd that is derived from hint the farm bill of 2018 basically legalized cbd that is derived from hemp and contains less than 0.3 percent thc cbd can help with things like anxiety insomnia it can help with pain relief and a whole bunch of other ailments i mostly use it for feelings of anxiousness and nervousness so let's talk a little bit about this brand bluebird botanicals when i first started researching cbd something i heard over and over again was make sure you check out the company that you're getting your cbd from especially if you're doing something like tinctures or gummies or pills you're ingesting the product so you want to make sure that the company is doing everything they can to keep their consumers safe so i did a lot of research about a lot of different brands and this one kept popping up and it checked off all of the boxes that i was looking for in a cbd brand according to their website bluebird botanicals is a family-owned business that has been around since 2012. their products are vegan and cruelty free and grown in the u.s they are certified by the u.s hemp authority and they are also a certified b corporation they use the co2 extraction method to get the cbd out of the hemp plant they also do third party lab testing and most of their products come with a certificate of analysis their website has a batch database all of their products will have a batch number and also a qr code and you can scan that and it will take you right to the batch database to look up the certificate analysis on that particular product the certificate of analysis will tell you things like the potency and also whether any toxins or chemicals were detected so it's really great information like i said for the the products that you're going to be putting into your body okay so let's talk a little bit about these products i wanted to very lightly dipped my toe into cbd when i first started so bluebird botanicals has a cbd isolate that is thc free it comes in a little one ounce bottle which retails for 79.95 however i found coupon codes and they have sales all the time on their website so i actually got this 50 off which made it not so bad a serving size is approximately 0.5 milliliters and that contains 25 milligrams of cbd i decided to start at 10 milligrams about 0.25 milliliters just to test it out and see what i noticed on it i didn't notice any changes at the 0.25 milliliters or about 10 milligrams i tried that for a few days and then i decided to up it to the serving suggestion which is the 0.5 milliliters or 25 milligrams of cbd so this is something that you're not going to notice an immediate effect with it's more of a gradual thing so the first time that i noticed it was working i was laying in this bed reading a book and i reached over to the bedside table to grab a full glass of water and i fumbled it and the water went everywhere it went behind the bedside table it soaked a um a power strip it soaked a power strip down there completely slipped it went all over my phone so i get up i go get a towel i come back i clean it all up i get another glass of water i sit back down in bed and i start reading my book again like a few seconds later mid paragraph i stopped reading and i was like holy [ __ ] this stuff is working because prior to being on cbd if that had happened it would have been a total [ __ ] show i would have freaked out i would have been terrified that i was going to get electrocuted by that soaked power strip i would have been worried that my phone was completely destroyed a pain in the ass now i have to move the dresser and get the water out behind it i definitely would have cussed which i did not do and i was like oh my god this stuff is really working i was almost shocked so anyway i was really happy with it um i actually finished the bottle so i went back to bluebird botanicals website because now i was interested in trying a full spectrum cbd to see if there was something to this entourage effect so the entourage effect is a term that's used to describe a bunch of different cannabinoids working together to enhance the effectiveness of the cbd so i picked up this bottle from bluebird from bluebird botanicals of their organic cbd oil it's a one ounce bottle that retails for 49.95 again i was able to find a coupon code and get it for 50 off so this one is a full spectrum cbd oil which means it's not thc free but it's still legal it's under the 0.3 percent amount one thing to keep in mind about full spectrum is that it has terpenes terpenes are what gives hemp the aroma that distinct aroma and also flavor so this one tastes very different from the thc free the thc free you basically only taste the carrier oil that they put it with which is mct oil and i think also i don't know if there's coconut oil in it or not but it's very un it's not offensive at all this one's pretty strong so i usually hold them under my tongue for about 30 seconds and then swallow it i tried this one for about two weeks and i didn't i didn't really notice it working as well as the thc free which i thought was really weird because i thought the entourage effect was going to be like 10 times better and it really wasn't for me so i ended up going back to the thc free and i bought this two ounce bottle that they offer around the time that i went to buy more cbd bluebird botanicals was offering a 70 off sale on their cbd lotion so i kind of thought why not so the two lotions that i got are 3.4 fluid ounces and they retail for 39.96 like i said it was 70 off so they were about 12 a bottle so i picked this one up it's the hemp silk softening and beautifying lotion i like to put lotion on my hands and feet in the winter right before bed so the um lotion that i was using prior to this was an aromatherapy lavender lotion that was supposed to help you relax and go to sleep at night so they tell you to rub it vigorously between your hands and then take a few deep breaths you know to help calm yourself before bed so i guess i was in the habit of that so i put this stuff on did that took a big breath let me warn you if you don't like the smell of hemp or pot or um if you're not used to it this will knock you on your ass i was not prepared for this i thought it would be like a a pretty lotion smell it's not it smells like hemp which is it's okay if you're used to it or even if you like it but for me it was a little bit too strong right before bed i've used it a few times it does help with moisturization so if you like the smell um i didn't really notice any effects as far as the cbd was concerned the other lotion i picked up is the cbd sport lotion i got this one more as like a little stocking stuffer for my husband for christmas because he is a very active guy and he was having some trouble with his elbow so i thought maybe this might help so he gave me his review on it that i will pass along to you and he says that it's sort of like taking an aspirin you have a lessening of the pain or a slight relief from the pain after applying the lotion to the area that you are having trouble with it also has wild mint which kind of hides that really strong hemp flavor so those are all of the products that i've purchased from bluebird botanicals i just want to say if you haven't tried cbd and you are having feelings of anxiousness nervousness this stuff has been life-changing for me i am so much calmer on this stuff one benefit that i've noticed is that i sleep a little deeper at night i'm a very light sleeper and i've noticed since i've started taking this that i don't wake up as many times during the night i also tend to get uh agitated i guess irritated i don't know when like people tap their feet or tap their fingers or my husband is a fidgeter and i am constantly you know when we're in the couch when we're in the couch when we're on the couch watching tv or something i'm constantly like stop stop stop moving stop whatever and he says i'm not doing that as much i hadn't even realized that that was just another benefit he told me just a couple days ago that i was not i guess nitpicking on little repetitive things like that so hey good yay anyway i highly recommend trying out cbd because if you are not an anxious overall nervous person you can't imagine how much calmer you can be on this stuff it's really done wonders for me so hopefully you found some good information in this video i'll link all these products down below just in case anybody's interested in looking at them they're not affiliate links or anything like that it's just links to bloopers websites so i hope you guys enjoyed this video i hope you have a great rest of your day thanks bye", "6zXyFJJ8KSk": "buyer beware that was the message this week from the Tarrant County District Attorney regarding CBD oil it is illegal in Texas except for certain medical conditions with the doctor's recommendation stores though are still selling it but will it show up on a drug test David Schecter verifies have you heard of CBD oil it's growing in popularity as a natural way to treat epileptic seizures and more broadly anxiety and insomnia the issue is how close CBD is scientifically to marijuana verified fast facts marijuana is rich in the compound THC which gets you high CBD is not marijuana but it still has a tiny bit of THC in it which has some people wondering can CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test for answers I'm looking at what the law says and I'm reaching out to one of the largest lab testing companies in America quest Diagnostics maybe you've peed in their cup dr. berry sample is the director of science and technology and yes that's really his name can the use of CBD oil cause you to fail a drug test CBD itself on our test would not be confused with either THC or THC metabolite number one so analytically we can clearly differentiate the two substances so you've passed last year with the 2018 farm bill Congress permitted the interstate commerce of hemp products like CBD that contain not more than 0.3 percent THC a very low level doctor sample is saying that amount of THC is so low that a test won't pick it up case closed right wrong as a product CBD oil is not regulated in the United States that means the government is not ensuring the level of THC remains low and in fact research in the Journal of the American Medical Association tested a variety of CBD oils and found 43% had more THC in them then labeled doctor sample says that's a big problem if somebody is using a CBD oil product that contains residual THC in it they very likely could test positive on a urine drug test not because of the CBD itself but because of a contaminant that is in that oil so CBD should not cause you to fail a drug test but in reality it could if you've got something you want verified send me an email [Music]", "Y87yxZsDQTs": "hello everybody and welcome back your burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's video if you like the video please don't forget to give

right into the subject today we are talking about cbd oil and how it potentially can help you in your weight loss journey cbd oil is the hot new thing in healthcare in general really people use it to treat anything from stomach ailments to anxiety all the way up sometimes to cancer treatments so we're not going to talk about any other uses of cbd oil other than how it may help you lose weight this is a weight loss channel after all so to do so we are going to look at two specific studies and we're gonna use the white board so we're gonna look at two studies one on mice or rats and the other is a study in humans so this first one is a 2011 study using mice and what the researchers did was they treated mice with cbd oil and they found that the mice that were treated with cbd oil had a significant decrease in their body weight after treatment the rationale that the researchers gave was there's a cb2 receptor and cb2 antagonists lead often to appetite suppression so these rats were eating less because the cbd oil was an antagonist to the cb2 receptor and it caused the rats to eat less therefore they lost weight so if we talk about this in humans while a human study has not been done yet we can surmise that potentially the same effect would happen in humans a lot of people believe that cbd oil is an appetite suppressant now if you think about marijuana marijuana and cbd oil are two completely different things there's thc in marijuana marijuana often causes hunger and that's a pretty common uh thing out there you know getting the munchies when you when you uh are doing marijuana so that does not happen when you do cbd oil there's no thc in cbd oil so cbd oil potentially could cause you to have less of an appetite therefore eat less and then lose weight research study number two this was done on humans and it was done five years later we're talking about a 2016 study now and we're talking about the activation of browning in white fat cells so they so humans this time were treated with cbd oil now there's two types of fat white fat and that's the fat that we typically think of like if you grab a hold of of your love handle and you've got a love handle there and that's white fat brown fat is a different type of fat so what we're trying to do is get the white fat to turn into brown fat it's called the browning of white cells white fat cells so what the reason we want that is brown fat is oftentimes termed as good fat brown fat is what keeps you warm it it undergoes a very high level of thermogenesis or it burns a lot of energy based on how big it is so it's often thought of as a treatment for obesity because of how much energy it can burn relative to its size so the more brown fat we have relative to white fat the more energy we're going to burn and the more weight loss we can expect so this wasn't a particular weight loss study it was a study seeing how cbd oil reacted to white fat cells and if it could cause this browning effect which it did so there's two studies there again one in rats so we've gotta make sure that we understand this was in a human trial and then an actual human trial and with two different effects we're looking at two different processes appetite suppression and then actually the changing of the white cell the browning of the white fat cell so i particularly i we don't use cbd oil we don't use cbd oil in our clinics we don't use that for treatment as of now the reason more research is needed this is just not enough to give us enough information saying that it's actually going to be a weight loss aid more research is coming out it seems like monthly we're reading new things about cbd oil and its effects but it's not there yet so we don't use it quite yet but it looks promising alright i hope this was

now until next time stay happy stay healthy i will catch everyone in the next video", "179z2Tt9Rsk": "hi everybody and welcome back it is Sunday and it is the day where I start to try in his crust and sort of go through my life with chronic pain basically it's as I said before this isn't going to be easy for me to talk about because it's one of those things everybody is different everybody's pain is different everybody feels pain differently and everybody corpse with pain differently and everybody has different injuries so this is kinda why I have never really sort of delved into it because I don't want to be sitting here and you know sorta feeling like I'm teaching somebody out to sew cakes because that isn't that isn't what this is about this is just about my experiences for you know what I've been going through for years the things I've learned and the things that just may help somebody somewhere along the line so I have had three spine operations the scar on the back of my neck from my last operation was supposed to be like that big he is like that big I smell I'm not really supposed to melt at that to be quite honest but the problem was I was you losing use of my right hand and arm and that was only gonna get worse so the new resurgence said you know we've got to operate on it the issue also is I have two prolapsed discs in my neck so he couldn't do anything about that so it was like you know we need to fix this issue the disc issue belongs to a different surgeon so I went ahead got the operation done came out of it and really struggled really struggled with my recovery basically and I think that was in the November and then in the February I ended up going to my GP and asking her to put me into physio which she did and that is when I realized I was trying we're way too hard to get back to because in my head I always thought I was going to be I was going to be cured basically that operation was going to make me the person that was before and at this point I still believe that so everything I was doing was to get me back to this point of being the person I was before and when I went to the physio she explained I was doing way too much and I decided to buy a Fitbit so I bought a Fitbit and I was seeing my physio weekly so I put my Fitbit on and was tracking 10,000 steps it nearly killed me I mean I was in so much bed it was unbelievable and then when I got to her she was just like oh hang on a minute 3,000 is more than enough from where you are so we set it to 3,000 then in a few weeks it went to 5,000 and then we reached a compromise where it was 10,000 so sorry 7000 not 10,000 7000 so even now I track to 7000 and the reason for buying the Fitbit wasn't to make sure I do those steps every day it was to stop me doing more than the step count because when I did more than the step count that is when the pain flare-ups hit okay so that was kind of where I started my Instagram and then then I ended up still struggling with pain because of the disk pain I had the nerves on my neck burnt out that was horrific if you've ever had that done that took like three to six months to settle down and and now what I didn't know at the time I only found out that the bloody operate DAWs was that you nerves actually grow back who knew I didn't know nobody told me and guess whose nerves grew back within the mine so I was back to square one so really that's like the early days of it that's all gone done and dusted and what happened is it was round about May last year I was in a really bad place a really bad place and this is when it starts coming to helping you know this isn't just about chronic pain because this is this will hit home with so many other people last year in May I was in a really really bad place and what was happening was the things I achieve in life fitted on that fingernail okay the things I couldn't do in life fill the whole room and that that was just weighing me down I just it just got me down every single day I couldn't cope with that at all and when you look at that that translates into real life so if it's like work-life balance we've got a busy job and the job is taking up this much your life and the things you want to do have to be squeezed into this much said they same with moms and busy lives you know if your whole day and week and months and years revolve around your child you home you clean in your everything and you have that much time for yourself it's the same thing and these feelings of being overwhelmed or in a bad place come from that so for me I was I knew I was struggling mentally struggling badly so I went back to my GP and asked her to put me back into pain clinic and at this point in time I was taking gabapentin which were these so that's got paint in there and I was taking three of these a day so that's 900 milligrams and I was also taking naproxen twice a day so that's kind of as much as I would let the GP give me because I just wasn't prepared to go down this line I've been on tramadol which is what I was on in April and men because it just it just doesn't do anything for me it makes me sleep it makes me tired it makes me feel Rottie it just I don't have a life when I take it so that's the medication I was taking at that point in time and my GP put me back into sort of the pain clinic but it had all changed from when I first started going and what happens without pain clinic is you have to see a musculoskeletal specialist and she decides which service you need to get the best results basically when I saw the specialist that was when the next bomb shell dropped so I managed to get my point it was just before we gone on holiday and I went to see her she was absolutely lovely she did two Lords of tests and everything and then she dropped the bombshell and said you've got spinal cord compression and I was like sorry what what you're talking about and she explained what that was and explained that I would probably start losing the feeling in my fingers and my toes and if if something really you know jolted me I could potentially you know end up being paralyzed from the waist down off from the neck down rather not the waist down I mean you just don't need to hear those things do you and then she carried on and explained that you know this wasn't gonna get any better it was just gonna get worse so I can't yeah I was kind of like I'm gonna mean it I felt bad your father just feeling even worse now anyway she wanted me to have an MRI we did that and because of the way the scarring is on the back of my neck it is very dangerous to reopen that scar you know that's why I haven't had the disks fixed basically they'd have to go in through the front of my neck and yeah that was where we left it it was kind of like when I got the MRI done it should be extend to the the spinal cord compression so extreme sports are out for me that's very you know that's okay but where we got to was I had to really be careful what I was doing and I still do have to be really careful what I'm doing and she also taught me that she was going to put me with what was called spine of it because fine fit deal with people that need to learn to live with their injuries now suddenly that is the other bombshell that dropped because I'm still living in hope that I'm going to have my life back now she's just telling me I am happening girl so that was a huge huge meltdown for me in 2018 went into spine fit my consultant was brilliant he taught me that taking gabon Penton was okay but it really I'm not taking enough medication to control my pain but then my argument was that taking tramadol you know the normal tramadol that you GP hands out is it just kills me I can't function on it I can't do anything on it I'm a triple een I can't take so now we are scuppered with me just having to call on the minimum pain medication basically so it was kind of Corp on the minimum and have some kind of life or go to tramadol and just be asleep most of the time and that just isn't an option for me because that would that would send me even further down this black hole so we went through the spine fit thing I worked with my spine click consultant we did range movement stretches all of those things but basically we talked about coping mechanisms and he was very very clear on this coping mechanism if in a day on a scale I could I could do 10 things okay so that that's where we started so if you look at things like washing up that might be like half and hoovering might be another half you had to decide what the numbers were in these boxes you were going to pile up in a day but the boxes couldn't sort of go over ten if you like and exercise for me at that point was it really an eight and a nine so if I did some exercise I'm kind of like that's about as much as I can do so we adopted this approach but to be quite honest that approach didn't really work very well with me it didn't I just kept going over it my pain kept flaring up and it just it just didn't work it was - it just didn't gel with me now everybody's different that approach probably worked for so many other people but it didn't work for me and it wasn't until I started following a guy on Instagram called Darren Cattell and Darren has this thing called meetup which is basically it's everything you do that isn't time to exercise so everything like washing I am in hoovering stairs running up and down stairs cups of tea hanging washed out bring what the whole thing but that is what he was talking about and then what you have is you have that um so untimed exercise the general day-to-day stuff and then you have time to exercise where you got for walks when you do that do that you walk your dog hey your cat here your hamster here you know that is non timed exercise and then suddenly the penny dropped it was like right I get what I'm doing wrong here now and as soon as I understood this neat approach where it was in a day if I need to do all the housework and everything else and be running around doing all of these other things like walking the dog I haven't going down by the way [ __ ] Tom Walker Hampstead got the shops you know pour some letters well I can't do that and then do some timed exercise so if I want to do some timed exercise where I walk around the lake I go for a swim I go for a bike ride whatever I put that first and then non timed activities like the iron in the hoovering the walk in the dog house that is separate and then the balance becomes this is much bigger so I have to reduce this or if I'm doing a lot around the house this is much bigger so the exercise goes out the window so suddenly when I adopted this approach this everything I can do fits on a fingernail and everything I can't do fills a room started to shift balance and then the balance was I started getting back some of my life and it was like okay I'm getting there so we come to the end of 2018 come into 2019 and I have a absolutely massive meltdown again with pain flare-up after pain flare-up of the pain Farrell and I started taking the tramadol that the doctors give to everybody and I I made a decision then I was going to have to take it full time because I just couldn't caught with where it was at mentally or physically so but then I thought I wonder if I could just take half tramadol would that be enough he can't actually take half a trauma dog by the way I can promise you I've tried it it doesn't work then I started looking at well is this such a thing as a slower release trauma doll can I take that would that work is there such a thing and you know what lo and behold there is such a thing the GPS don't tell you about it but there is such a thing and this is it okay let me just see if I can this is slow released Ramadhan okay now I must be the only person to know about this at this I don't know whether this is five times the cost of the stuff they hand out on a daily basis I don't know but that is what I take I'm supposed to take two of these a day but I don't you only take one or take one on a morning so I take one of them on a morning I still take two naproxen and then I can take paracetamol on top of that the reason I have to do this is because I suffer two kinds of pain us of a nerve pain and a supports called mechanical pain which is like the disk parts or two types of pain so I need an anti-inflammatory which is the naproxen so if you if you are sort of struggling with pain and you're on tramadol talk to G P about these because these don't make me tired they don't make me feel groggy they don't change my mood they don't do any of that don't do any of it then I got a message from a girl who who were followed and she told me about CBD oil now I'd already used the CBD oil from Holland and Barrett and I didn't read it at all I was just like for being there ah but apparently not all CBD oils are created equally and here you go this is what I've been using so this is it this is from a company called dragonfly you'll see it comes in three different strains 3% 5% 11% now I have actually bought two bottles myself for this so you know don't run away with the idea I'm trying to sell you this cuz I'm not what I was using was this one so I bought two bottles of this last year which was the five percent and what I do on a on and time I take it to get me to sleep which it will help you sleep I'm not I can do say that categorically if you've got problems asleep and it will obviously because I've been giving grain the eleven percent one to knock him out when you struggle to sleep and it makes him sleep like a baby it's pretty girl so that's what I've been using so what I do now is I only take one trauma doll and then at nighttime I take the five percent CBD oil which is this one so just but the thing with CBD oil is be careful it's not all created equally not all CBD oil is the same a woman that I follow on Instagram spared a fortune for some and it did absolutely nothing absolutely nothing I've bought it from Holland about it did absolutely nothing so make sure if you're gonna buy it you've got somebody who has been using it for a while and they can prove to you that it works so I've bought two bottles of the five percent myself the Lydia follow put me into a competition on dragonfly and I warned three poles I'm like happy days and then dragonfly offered to gift me it so there I thought why not I use this all the time so what I've been doing because I've got the three percent which are worn and got gifted being using this through the day when I'm struggling and then back to the five percent on the night so that is how I have been managing my pain and since May last year because I'm taking slow-release tramadol this and the CBD on completely changed my life around completely and they actually came out of pain management in I think it was September October last year and the reason for that is because I managed to get back to my exercise again which we talked about in the other video where I do a tract exercise mileage per month and three sets so that is how I have managed to control my pain and have managed to get back on my feet and I've managed to turn my life around and when I say I've turned my life around I I know that sounds like [ __ ] I'm just I can hear myself say it I promise you it's not it is I have really half time my life around I mean I if you I wish to God I don't videos like video diaries of how I felt in 2018 to how I feel now and the things that I couldn't do then that I can do now and when I've started to Train and obviously that has built of my strength as well you know as all that was all of this helps but for me it was the combination of changing my pain medication and standing my ground with my GP and saying look I mean I really had to stand my ground with her and say you know this slow-release tramadol i want to give it a go and she's saying you know no it's not for long-term pain but my argument with to that was well you keep giving it to me and offering at me every single time I come in the other tramadol not this one and the other part of it is in three months time if if she doesn't let me try this we're going to be sat having a conversation where I am clinically depressed and now we've got a problem where she has to help me with depression and manage my pain and then it's kind of like well how do I get out of that how do we get my life back from that and that conversation with my GP I had to really dig deep and say look you tell me that isn't gonna work long-term and I'll listen to you prove it to me but she couldn't prove it so she managed to let me sort of have a trial of it and say if your spine fit consult and agrees with this approach then I'll back you and him but you have to have his back in to do this and I am just so pleased I stood my ground because it was the best change for me to to actually go down that route and change my pain medication with the introduction of taking CBD on now the other thing is I'll just point is right out now I don't have any other underlying health issue so I don't have any issues with my heart I don't have any issues anywhere else that all issues I have as managing my pain and the issues I have obviously with what's going on in my neck but I don't have any underlying health issues at all so if if I could take my head off and put somebody else's head on at quite a fit body I'd be like yeah I'm super fit I'm cool um I'm done so that is it look I don't want this to go on and on and on its own for 20 minutes now so I'm gonna leave this here but I'm gonna jump back into this again but from the next one will be about how I manage my exercise and how I manage daily tasks around the house and things like that I just wanted to put this video out there so that you you get to know me a little bit better and you understand why I probably makes other decisions I do like why I do a fridge meal of the week well the answer to that is if I ever pay and flare up it's easy for Graeme to just come in and pick that meal up and finish it off you know why put more stress on myself remember that everything I can do is here and everything I can't do is in a room if you start doing some of these little things like fridge meal of the week or usually slow cooker more or break tasks down which I'll go into later these are the things that free up time and and believe me ignore the free up time because I've spent the last two years do with it okay okay I can prove it to you it does work so if you you know busy at work busy mom just busy then you know keep watching and you know I'll I'll do some more of these videos but I will delve into how I manage to free up my time and stop putting pressure on myself so that I give myself time back and giving myself time back to rest and to collect my thoughts was probably the biggest breakthrough in my recovery because I just never ever once kind of put myself first and I needed to do that to get better basically so they go if you got this far thank you very much for watching if you do have any questions please drop them below and Noor this video is out of what this is about but eventually it will come back to you know why I chose to slimming world how I exercise how I'll manage my day how I'll manage my pain and how it all comes together and I am I am a hundred percent sure somewhere in the line along my line this will really help you if you are struggling for time anyway thank you for watching and have a great Sunday everybody and I will catch up with you back on Wednesday Wednesday's video is going to be one join two gunman is three meals I think it is so if you look into save money that is going to be Wednesday's video", "J5Bg8lhwn6I": "good day ladies and gentlemen I want to talk about a product that someone told me about it's called C B D pain cream this is basically a hemp oil you can purchase this online or at your local head shop this one that I got here this is one that I found locally here in Austin but it is basically this stuff is really good anti-inflammatory it's what I was told so I had I've torn my rotator cuff and I also have plantar fasciitis really bad on my foot here so I didn't want to I'm not going to gross you out with my rotator cuff showing you applying it on there but I will show you how I apply it on my foot but you just do the same thing on your shoulder or wherever that wherever your your hurts so wherever you have inflammation I also started trying I started rubbing this on my my knees I've got a little bit of I don't know if it's arthritis or what but I've had some some pain in my knees joints and after I run or hike I'll rub this on there and I mean it's amazing how well this stuff really works after about two or three days of putting it on my torn rotator cuff I mean the pain has has subsided you know tremendously and it really I really feel like it's healing much faster so anyway it you know I was a little skeptical at first but I really have to say this stuff is pretty impressive so here's the information on the back as you can see you put a small amount and I'll show you an example and you put it about every four to six hours and I've been doing it like every four hours on my torn rotator cuff because that that pain has been more intense but on my leg or on my I ain't with my heel is where have my plantar fasciitis I've just been putting on that on there like twice a day once in the morning in the months at night and that's really helped I mean I can't I can't I can't explain why but it I'm pretty impressed with the results so here's a here's information on air so basically like I said it's a simple oil it doesn't have any THC in it or anything like that so it's not this isn't something that's like you're putting marijuana into your body or anything like that it's just the actual oil and they make this kind of a lotion so let's let me show you the product okay so here it is here's the cream and you just basically remove the top all right and it's got a little you can see I've been using it so so you just get to the area in the sunlight there and you just squirt a little bit on there like that and then you just rub it in rub it in it all around there get the back I like to eat a whole ankle all right and then like I said if it's your rotator cuff do the same thing on your shoulder so I do this I do it on my shoulder probably probably like four times a day so you basically put it on there like that let it let it dry you know let it sit there for a little bit alright that's what I do I let it sit there for a little bit before I put my sock back on or I put my shirt back on or anything like that and then you know give it time give it a chance to kind of soak in and it'll feel a little tingly but not much you know it's not like dicks or anything like that or it's like strong but or icy hot or bengay but it does have a little bit the tingle to it you kind of feel it it working in there and it's about this this bottle that I got here 150 milligrams and I think this cost me like 20 $24 the looks there's quite a bit in here so the way I've been using it initiative last me probably a good month using it everyday so anyway great product again this is a you see who this is true to dub so green roads is the name of this company that manufactured this and it's the hundred fifty milligrams of CBD CBD pain cream anyway highly recommend it I've had great experience with it and I think it's a great alternative to taking Tylenol or Advil or Aleve I think I try not to take that stuff because it's really hard on your your liver and your kidneys and stuff like that and I think this is just a healthier way to do it I also take two metric or tumeric I don't know if I ever say that right but I take that as well and that has helped out a lot too and it's also very kind of a healthy alternative but I'll take about two those two two pills a day like one in the morning and one at night sometimes I'll just take one anyway the combination of tumeric and this is a great combination so anyway that's my my take on this - thumbs up", "m3UGmhUWhmI": "medical cannabi oil cannabis oil the cbd2 is to one it says or p used to one i don't know i can't believe i'm not wearing my specs so i got that p this is how the bottle looks it's uh it's with drops you know now i took this like maybe one hour back and uh one and a half or two hours back and here's what i'm noticing number one the sense of taste in your mouth it changes i took three drops sense of taste in your mouth changes number one number two i noticed that um [Music] my brain is working better when i had coffee it tasted different so sense of taste changes my brain is working much better i'm able to be a little more friendly and alert both do i feel high no i just feel a bit confident i feel a bit um you know i feel like working i feel uh a bit happy not happy but i feel a bit content like there's no low in the mood the mood is a little up so that's good um other things so this is the maybe the fourth or seventh time i'm taking cbd and just wanted to tell you what happens when you take it so you take it you don't drink anything for 15 20 minutes and you can take it in the morning and i usually take three to five drops max and um the good thing is that you have a better day than you would without it you're in a better mood than you would be without it you are more efficient than you would be without it food tastes better could be a good thing if you're having bad food it is supposed to let go of pain give you less pain this is tired and tested it is good for that let's go you don't feel that much pain with cbd um now let's talk about the negatives i think i think it could make you feel um hungry more hungry than you would without it so it's sort of like ashwagandha on that front you will definitely feel more hungry than you would feel without it and you will end up eating more than you would without it because food will taste better um you would probably consume 400 i consume on average 400 to 800 calories more than i would without cbd but i'm trying to see if i can control myself if there is something i can do to dodge that thing but that is the only negative i can think about right now other than that it's mostly positive how much does this cost i think i paid about 10 000 bucks for this bottle and i don't know it's 10 ml or 20 ml let me check i simply googled it and the first thing it showed me was a paid advertisement um this is 66 thc what and 33 cvd it says 9 700 bucks for this another about 600 2 000 bucks for getting a prescription you're looking at about 10 500 odd to get cbd um if you're thinking it's expensive i don't think it's expensive because i've used it six times or eight times and somebody else has used it 10 12 times so and it's still right on the top it's easy to use it's uh it's legal now if you get a prescription everything is legal and they give you a prescription it's pretty straightforward so you can simply google this i think it's called cbd online or something like that they're not paying me anything for it nobody pays me anything dude so yeah that was a quick review of cbd um i will do more of this so i can do better review i don't know it has thc by the way dsc is supposed to make you feel high i feel a little better but i don't know if i'm high man i smoke joints that's completely different now other things i've tried is ashwagandha which is quite similar to this it does make you very hungry more hungry than cbd would make you maybe because it's a bigger dose and second thing i've tried is modafinil i've done two reviews of that um cbd does not help you read it does not make you faster it just makes you more aware and in the moment um i didn't do this review for the longest time because i thought i'll do it so well and all that but i feel a job done is better than a job not done like imperfect is better than just being perfect also i was waiting for a day but i looked good and then a month passed away and i still don't look good but i'm still uploading it because somebody has to", "nhOzQWWsWt4": "[Music] hi I'm Manuel Trevino the executive chef of by Chloe and we're here today to make an A to C V de cookie just one of my favorite friends giving treats it has a little CBD in it to get everybody in the festive mood and ready to have a great time so to start we're gonna go with a little bit of vegan margarine and to this margarine that's when we want to add our CBD oil and to that we're gonna add our sugars so here we have brown sugar and cane sugar start slowly at first we start at a high speed everything's just gonna end up on the walls great so what you're looking for here is a nice well blended product to this we're gonna add our dry our dry consists of flour cornstarch baking soda and a little bit of salt mixing everything together building up from there to about medium speed at that point your cookie mixture will look like wet sand now for the wet ingredients we're just gonna put a little water and a little vanilla extract now we want to mix this as well starting slow building up till everything is well incorporated in the mixture looks fluffy so then I'm mixtures nice well incorporated and fluffy so we'll start with some chocolate chips mix the chocolate chips just - they're all mixed in and incorporated off the bowl now we'll go with the pecans you just want to run it slow until it's all incorporated just a couple turns will do that's good now we do pretzels these are little salted pretzels that we love to use the salt is nice it gives you a nice contrast of the sweetness of the cookie marshmallows these are vegan marshmallows and last but not least potato chips so the potato chips are gonna crush themselves inside so we just fold them in I'll let the machine do the work now we're doing this at the slowest speed possible and that's it we'll take the cookie dough right out of the bowl and so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna grab small handfuls and just form them and then almost into a patty shape almost like little pucks and you lay them on a sheet pan and then we'll bake them in a low oven we bake these at 320 degrees you really don't want to bake anything with CBD in it higher than 320 degrees because you'll lose those wonderful effects that it has so we bake these at 320 degrees seven minutes on one side we'll rotate the tray and bake it seven minutes on the other so they're nice and even so everything kind of melts the marshmallow Browns a little bit you see the pretzel sticking out there chocolate chips are nice and gooey and it's just an overall fun cookie [Music]", "29hyb2rrrgo": "and Marley how do you like your treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "J4wIX9obTbw": "[Music] foreign [Music] recently late actor ifan khan's wife made an appeal to legalize cbd oil in india her appeal witnessed some criticism the recent controversy about the use of

insight in children with post-traumatic stress disorder it also reduces psychotic symptoms associated with conditions such as scisophernia as well as epilepsy is cbd oil helpful in treating cancer there is not enough scientific evidence to prove that cbd oil can safely and effectively treat cancer or not however cbd can help elevate symptoms related to cancer and side effects of chemotherapy such as pain nausea vomiting etc however a study from the european journal of pain showed that cbd applied on the skin could help lower pain and inflammation due to arthritis cbd inhibits inflammatory

isn't hard to do so if you want to give the gift of relaxation here's what you'll need baking soda corn starch Epsom salt and citric acid these are your dry ingredients you'll also need essential oil coconut oil CBD infused oil bath bomb molds water and food coloring I mix the wet ingredients first starting with the coconut oil it's a solid at room temperature so I put it in the microwave for a few seconds and then I added it to a mason jar with the rest of the wet ingredients [Music] I used two types of essential oil here peppermint and eucalyptus [Music] one thing to keep in mind is that the color of the CBD oil will influence the final product so my first batch was very yellow I used less CBD oil and more food coloring in my second batch and I ended up with a nice light blue shade if you care about the color of the final product just make sure to use enough food coloring to counteract the yellow from the CBD oil it's time to mix the dry ingredients when citric acid and baking soda meet water they undergo a chemical reaction and that's what you're seeing when the bath bomb is fizzing up and making bubbles the cornstarch slows down the chemical reaction so you can actually control how long your bath bomb fizzes just by playing with the ratio between these dry ingredients I'll leave tips on how to do this below the video this step isn't hard but it does require patience slowly mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and when I say slowly I really do mean just a few drops at a time you don't want the dry ingredients to start to react if the mixture starts to get really fizzy you're going a little too fast when you're done the mixture should feel like damp sand now it's time to pack this mixture into the molds as quickly as possible press the mixture into the mold firmly you'll want to slightly overfill each one so that when you press them together there isn't a gap between the two halves [Music] these will be dry in a few hours but I recommend leaving them overnight removing the top half is easy sometimes the bottom half comes right off but if it doesn't just tap the metal a few times and try again this whole process involved about 15 minutes of actual work you do have to factor in drying time but this is a great option for inexpensive gifts that can easily be made in batches if you're trying to tackle several gifts at the same time if you choose to add CVD supposedly there are anti-inflammatory benefits but with any wellness trend you should do your own research to see if it's something you're into you can find more information about

basics lesson or you can simply purchase 8 ounces of comfrey infused oil which is what we need for our lesson today that's 8 ounces why comfrey comfrey contains a LAN toing which encourages rapid cell regeneration for this reason your comfrey sad that we're going to make here it's going to help wounds heal quickly the oil is also very moisturizing and will even help heal bruises so let's make our staff as with all herbal remedies you can make them in a variety of ways with a variety of materials but most often these days a salve is made with an herbal infused vegetable based oil like this comfrey leaf in olive oil infused in olive oil like we made in a previous lesson combined with beeswax beeswax allows the oils that are liquid at room temperature to harden I happen to have these neat little one-ounce pieces that I have for the herbal medicine making kit on learning herbs calm but you can simply break off an ounce off a larger brick of wax or if you have wax shavings it doesn't matter as long as by weight you have it on slacks and that's the magic formula the magic formula is 1 ounce of wax by weight to 1 cup of oil by volume ok that's 8 ounces as a cup okay so 1 to 1 easy to so when you make yourself you know how much you're going to end up with so in this case we have a cup of oil along with a bit more liquid when the salve amount I'm going to India when the wax melts so we have to prepare our containers take that into account so I have some containers here also from the herbal kit I've got 4 1 ounce tins I've got a couple of 2 ounce containers these might be a little more than 2 ounces actually might be 4 ounces but but in any case whatever it is always make sure I have ample containers when I start even if I'm not sure I kind of overdo it just because there's you know you don't want to end up with hot salve material and not enough containers to fill it with so I always have make sure I have enough containers so I need to prep those before I start and we're also going to use some lavender essential oil ok it smells wonderful and it also has wonderful healing properties in itself so we'll see how that's used so let's get making our SAFF now first I get out my double boiler and I put a little water in the bottom of the double boiler and get it simmering and then I put the top right on there like that now you don't have to use a double boiler you can also use any old medium sized saucepan and but what if you do use a soft span just make sure that your heats on low because you don't want to risk scorching the wax or the oil so a saucepan is fine I just happen to have one of these I got this at a thrift store locally for like 5 bucks so if you find one of these awesome but you don't need this piece of equipment you can use a regular saucepan so don't let this from stop you from making your salve okay alright so and then we simply add our gotta beeswax to the pot there and it is going to melt and now this is salve cam a view from above you see the wax melting starting to melt and melting a little more so my 1 ounce by weight of wax has melted and I take my 1 cup by volume of herbal infused oil and I pour it on in weird what just happened is that I just poured some room temperature oil in hot wax and the oil solidified a little bit or the wax solidified rather so what's going to happen now is I'm just going to leave it on the stove longer until it once again completely melts and you can simply stir it a bit as it's going along to help it out alright our SAP mixture has completely liquefied behind this here see that and I am just going to pour it back into our Pyrex container our measuring cup because it has a nice spout on it so now you see our finished salve liquid here okay this is what we're going to pour into our containers right now we have to do it quickly because it's kind of hardened as you see it's starting to already on the edge here what you want to do for essential oil is put in about two drops per quarter ounce in this case that comes out to about a teaspoon actually about sixty four drops so I have that measured in there and I just want to mix that around that's my lavender essential oil here you can also add just a few drops an alternative is to as you're pouring these in your containers I have to start doing that so it doesn't harden on me an alternative is that you can simply put in a few drops or more depending on how much scent you like in your sap like this as you're doing it as you're pouring it you could do like one two two four but I already put it in so I'm just going to keep pouring so if you noticed I have my jars open ready to go so we have to be quick about it and if you ever do this and you notice a lot of your salve hardens I like to pour it out in small batches if you notice that that you can just swap it back in the in the your pan and remelt it so you're not you're not in dire straits if you don't okay and there's a wee bit more in here and I could easily pour that another small tin I don't want to get a huge jar full I'm only going to have a little bit in it but I'll Rimmel Tam innit and put it in another little container but like I said I always have extra encase because you know I guess I've done it enough for him like oh no where's another container I need another container so what we're going to do now while we watch this I guess these jars right here the jars are a little larger than I thought they were but that's why it's good to know your sizes huh so anyway we're going to hang out for a second as our poured salve hardens and now you see it continuing to harden here like on the bottom do the different color so that's hardening and there we have it see this once the large jar is still solidifying but the ones in the tins because they're smaller has finished so I can just put the lids on them and these containers by the way are available in the supply section of Mountain Rose herbs as well so and then you can also then put a pretty label on it like such as these this is from our herbal kit on learning herbs I'm not going to put them on it because it's not a right salve mixture but just gives you an idea that that you what you can do to decorate them really easy to make labels you can get any Avery labels these are the one I think the 1.67 in diameter labels and you can get a template they often have templates you can download let's say in word and you can drag and drop artwork and write pretty you know put pretty pictures in it and write what the SAB is and print them right out and stick them right on your nice tins if you've liked that sort of thing or you can just get a little blank label and write on it handwriting too and then we'll put the cap on this one and it'll harden up real soon so there you have it your finished herbal SAVs store your finish Savin your herbal cabinet for later use for longer storage you can also place it in your refrigerator staff making is endless and there are many reasons to make it and many herbs to try for oil making if you want to try making your comfort with fresh concrete you can check out our video on herb mentor com thanks so much and have fun making yourself Oh", "QHHFSnBi_Rk": "Are you shopping online for CBD and coming across\u00a0\u00a0 hemp oil products and asking yourself\u00a0\nif this is the right product? Hi everyone, I\u2019m Emily, and today I\u2019m going to\u00a0\ntalk to you guys about the difference between\u00a0\u00a0 hemp oil and CBD Oil because they\u2019re\u00a0\nnot the same, and it\u2019s CRUCIAL to\u00a0\u00a0 understand the difference between the two\u00a0\nso you don\u2019t purchase the wrong product. So what is hemp oil? Hemp oil, which you can find a lot of on Amazon,\u00a0\u00a0 is hemp seed oil even though the term hemp\u00a0\noil is essentially considered CBD oil.\u00a0\u00a0 Hemp seed oil should not be mistaken with\u00a0\nCBD oil in any way because hemp seed oil\u00a0\u00a0 doesn\u2019t contain any cannabinoids or the other\u00a0\nbeneficial compounds found in CBD extracts.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, they are both from hemp, but they are\u00a0\nextracted from DIFFERENT PARTS of the plant. Hemp seed oil, which is usually sold under\u00a0\nthe term hemp oil, is derived from hemp,\u00a0\u00a0 just like CBD, but it\u2019s derived from the crushing\u00a0\nof seeds through cold press technology, which is\u00a0\u00a0 essentially crushing hemp seeds to squeeze out\u00a0\nthe oil inside of them. The oil taken from the\u00a0\u00a0 seeds of hemp is a nutritional supplement\u00a0\nas it\u2019s rich in omega fatty acids, fiber. Just to be clear, hemp seed oil, which\u00a0\nis advertised as hemp oil on products,\u00a0\u00a0 does not contain ANY cannabinoids, terpenes,\u00a0\u00a0 or flavonoids found in CBD products and doesn\u2019t\u00a0\nproduce ANYWHERE close to the effects of CBD. CBD oil or, in general, all CBD products, on\u00a0\nthe other hand, are also from the hemp plant,\u00a0\u00a0 but CBD is extracted from the flower and\u00a0\u00a0 leaves of hemp where the real beneficial\u00a0\ncompounds are found that you\u2019re looking for. The flower of hemp contains a\u00a0\nwide variety of cannabinoids,\u00a0\u00a0 terpenes, and flavonoids which are found in\u00a0\nFull Spectrum and Broad Spectrum CBD products. CBD is the cannabinoid that interacts\u00a0\nwith our endogenous receptors\u00a0\u00a0 and Endocannabinoid System,\u00a0\nwhich produces mood regulation,\u00a0\u00a0 improved sleep cycles, immune support,\u00a0\noverall health and wellness, and more. To summarize, if you want\u00a0\nCBD oil, don\u2019t buy hemp oil\u00a0\u00a0 unless it clearly states in the supplement\u00a0\nfacts or ingredients that it contains CBD. They are both extracted from hemp but different\u00a0\nparts of the plant, as I mentioned. If you go on\u00a0\u00a0 Amazon, you\u2019ll find many hemp oil products saying\u00a0\nit contains ridiculous amounts of milligrams\u00a0\u00a0 of hemp extract ranging from 5,000mg to even\u00a0\n100,000mg that are selling for less than $20. If you\u2019re trying to buy CBD oil,\u00a0\u00a0 then stay away from those products. CBD oil on the\u00a0\nother hand ranges from $25 for a 250mg tincture\u00a0\u00a0 to $200 for a 3,000mg tincture and even more\u00a0\ndepending on the potency of the product. Thank you for tuning into this video, and\u00a0\nI hope this video clearly explained the\u00a0\u00a0 difference between hemp oil and CBD oil.

Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and today we're going to talk about the indica raw hemp 3% the indica raw hemp 3% has 300 milligrams of full-spectrum supercritical co2 extracted him inside each bottle the bottle is 10 milliliters and has about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper full which is about one milligram of CBD per drop if you are one to stay up to date on all of the latest in the hemp industry make sure you like and subscribe to our Channel the indica story is actually really cool this is the very first brand to sell hemp products online they actually controlled the entire product from the little bitty seed until you get the bottle they have a little over two thousand acres at the time of this recording all in Northern Europe Denmark area when you order your product because it is both in Europe and in the US and headquarters in California it takes about three days like I got mine just in under three days from the time that I placed my order online until the time that I got it in my house so they're really really on target with their shipping times too another really great thing about the indica raw hemp number three or three percent is that it includes both CBD and CBD a so the difference between the two are mainly the biggest difference is the CBD a is the non-heated the non decarboxylated oh say that one really fast and so you're getting slightly different benefits because you get to have both CBD a and CBD both of them are great for inflammation anxiety and things of that nature but the fact is you're you're getting both of them in this particular product so that helps to aid in the entourage effect so each bottle is 10 milliliters it only has one flavor and that is natural it is very natural and like I said one drop is about one milligram and a full dropper is about thirty milligrams it comes with a non marked glass dropper and you'll notice that it's very dark it's a very very dark full-spectrum product for me I normally don't take thirty full milligrams of CBD although I did do it at night and it was amazing to help me sleep so during the day I generally take about a quarter of a dropper because I am not good enough to count those drops underneath my tongue so let's try it indica uses a hemp seed oil as its carrying base and it is non-gmo it is organic and it is created or manufactured in a GMP certified facility that means every single time you take this product every single time you buy this product you know exactly what you're going to get it is a very high quality product with consistent results from their test which by the way they do a really good job of showing you and giving you access to their tests so on the side of the box you'll see a little bitty UPC code and on the back is actually digits that are stamped on there with it looks like a date and a four digit code that was a little confusing to me at first honestly when I went in to type in the batch number but basically it's the last four digits that you need for the batch it's also on the side of the bottle so if we stand it up and then turn it you're gonna see that same those same dates and four digits in order to find the test results you have to go to their website and there is a tab on the far right where it's quality control and then what you do is you search for they give it to you in like 50 batch numbers so you have to go into your drop down to about your 50 range and then find it let's dive a little deeper into the test results so something that indica does really really really well is they tell you everything probably even more than most people want to know you're gonna get the microbial reports you're gonna see how they tested for pesticides which by the way both of those tested non-deductible non-detectable and then they show you the different terpenes as well as cannabinoids inside their product so something that I definitely wanted to make sure that you are aware of that indica did is this is called indica raw hemp 3 for 3 percent if you look at the test results you will actually find that it's actually a little bit more than 3 percent of the total concentration it's like 3.3 percent and I know that that's not a ton of a difference however in an age where everyone's trying to round up and sell you more I really appreciated the fact that these guys were like hey it's just 3% even though they're giving you more than that and so that just kind of spoke volumes to me about the corporate culture and what they're trying to offer their consumers so you're gonna notice that it's got a very nice packaging it's a pretty heavy Winkle blue if you've seen some movies not quoting any on the outside it's very clear and easy to read and you're gonna see that it's 3% this is actually labeled a little bit differently than products in the US which are usually labeled as per dropper full of milligrams of CBD or the total amount of CBD in the bottle this is labeled as a percentage of the entire bottle which is it was a little confusing to me as an American consumer but once I started digging into it it actually made a whole bunch of sense it does have one milligram of CBD per dropper so you know if you're taking a half a dropper that's about 15 drops or about 15 milligrams of CBD so when you get it you're gonna notice that on both of them it does have the batch number but it also talks about all of the different products that are inside of it and so you can see that they actually have omegas in it and they it is using a hip seed oil as the carrier base okay so now let's actually talk about taking this product the first thing that you're going to notice when you open it up is it has a very pungent smell like you don't even have to get it that close to smell you can smell it from here it's very strong very earthy flavored and I actually smell kind of a bunch of pine needles almost and that's actually due to the terpenes terpenes inside the canvas planter what gives it its flavor and this one tests really high for limonene which is the same turkey and that's found in lemons but believe it or not it's also found in pine needles which is something I learned while doing this review and so it made a whole bunch of sense to me that I finally like that's why I smell pine needles it is very very strong and the flavor does stay with you so definitely keep that in mind when you are considering purchasing this product however I want you to tell I wanted to tell you that the first time I used it I used 15 drops which is about a half a dropper full about 15 milligrams of CBD I took it and within 30 minutes I fell asleep and guess what ladies and gentlemen I stayed asleep the whole night which is basically a miracle so this is very very very effective I didn't need to take it the next day because I didn't really hurt and so I found myself just supplementing with this as I needed throughout the day which sometimes it was never sometimes it was in the middle of the day like when I was ready to pull my hair out and then I would again I wouldn't have to even take a full dropper full a half a dropper or even a quarter of a dropper was enough to take the anxiety away and help me to get focused and get a whole bunch of stuff done actually this just happened I was working on something and I got really really stressed out so I took a quarter of a dropper which is about seven or eight drops and I lost complete track of time and I was almost late to my daughter's piano lessons because I was so focused so this stuff is very effective albeit it is also very very very strongly flavored so now let's get down to the Nitty Gritty when you go to purchase the indica raw hemp 3 you'll notice that the value of it's actually pretty good it's a very I can they consider this a moderate strength with about 30 milligrams of CBD per dropper I consider this more a little bit on the higher strength dose a higher concentration it does come in a 10 milliliter size bottle which is a little slower but it is very effective so cost per milligram it's very very very reasonably priced and you'll really appreciate that you'll also notice that it's it works like a little bit goes a long way it's very very very effective at what it does to help reduce anxiety reduce residual pain and to help you sleep and so you don't need as much which helps to maybe cushion the purchase price just a bit the one thing that you definitely definitely want to keep in mind is that this stuff is strong flavored like it's strong and so if flavor profiles definitely get to you if that's something that you can't get over even with a little bit of water you might still taste it keep that in mind with this indica rub but oh my gosh it's not like you're sitting here taking this as your dessert you're taking this because you're seeking relief from anxiety or you're taking this to help you sleep or maybe some relief from inflammation so if you take it with that in mind like I'm not taking this because it tastes good I'm taking it because it freakin works then just take it and then go chase it with your cake okay and then you'll definitely love the indica or all three before we go remember that this indica raw hemp 3% has one milligram of CBD per dropper or about thirty milligrams of CBD per dropper full it does have about 2.2 percent THC which is the legal limit in Europe and you can get it both in Europe and in the u.s. it is strongly flavored so keep that in mind but it is such an effective product and the price point is so easy for you to get into in my opinion it's really worth your it's worth your time and your investment to try this product out let me know if you've tried it I for one love it I definitely will be keeping this around my house it is very effective it works it does taste strong but I actually I really appreciate how little I have to take to get all of the benefits from the CBD and I also appreciate the fact that it isn't that expensive to to procure if you will I'd love to know what your thoughts are if you've tried it and if you want to learn even more about all of the different hip products on the market make sure you like and

remind you of before we get into this video is that you are beautiful inside and out um greetings from the swirly couch my name is caitlyn michelle and today we are here to discuss ima so i experienced eczema as a baby and into my late teen years i was actually born with eczema and i can fully relate to the struggles of not only just the skin condition but also the emotional struggles that came with having um experience having experienced a skin condition and you know i noticed growing up i was very insecure i didn't feel comfortable you know putting myself out there you know meeting new people and even just speaking i was just so nervous because i was worried of what were people thinking of my face or my arms that were rashed out and red and you know my face that was you know covered in a rash and super dry and so for me growing up dealing with eczema at a really young age first of all they're already very limited treatment options and the prescription treatment options that were available um there were age restrictions on so given that i was a baby with eczema you can't just put anything on a baby's skin or even a young child under the age of five so for me i really struggled with finding treatment options that really helped my skin was so sensitive that i could only use specific kind of soap i couldn't use anything scented like i really had a lot of limitations in my skin care you know so if you're watching this i'm sure you or someone close to you is dealing with eczema and i just want you to know that you're not alone and that you are beautiful inside and out and that relief is totally possible and to allow yourself to be open to that possibility of relief and confidence in your own skin again so like i said relief is totally possible when i was growing up there were very limited treatment options and i was so young at the time that any of the prescription treatment options i wasn't a candidate for and i also lived in a family of six people so by the time i was of age to be a candidate for any of those medicines and those treatment options they were not affordable for my family and so therefore that was just not a treatment option that was available to me and now back in the 90s um when i was a baby um just a wee little taut um there were very limited treatment options which is why it's a beautiful time to be alive where we have so many different treatment options available to us so as much as there are many different treatment options available nowadays not all treatment options are the same not all treatment options are sustainable nor are all treatment options affordable which is why today i want to talk about cbd in the use of treating eczema as cbd can be an affordable non-prescription option that can help to manage the symptoms of the condition while also helping to improve your quality of life cbd can really help in the treatment of the condition by providing relief not only from the inflammation because eczema is an inflammatory response and cbd helps to treat the inflammation there was a study done in 2014 that had proven that cbd triggers an anti-inflammatory response in the cells of our body so when we're utilizing cbd we're working with something that is directly affecting the cells of our body it's not trying to just treat the symptoms but it's going more to the root of what's happening and treating the source of inflammation there which in my own personal opinion i feel that can be where we really start to notice drastic changes because we're working on a root basis rather than just working to treat the symptoms that we're experiencing so there's many different methods of how you can utilize cbd to treat eczema and you can just kind of test them out and see which one aligns most with you so you can utilize ingestion where you like take a tincture or you take a capsule of cbd and that helps to work from an internal place to manage the any internal information inflammation that you may be experiencing there's also the method of topical use where you can use like a cbd soap or a cbd face mask or even like a cbd salve and those are ways that can directly help to nourish and soothe the skin externally and when you partner that with the internal addition of the cbd that can really help to be working from an internal as well as an external place to manage the condition i'm very thankful that i did outgrow the condition however i do still experience symptoms of very sensitive skin as a result for people who have outgrown the condition it is common to still experience very sensitive skin afterwards so therefore we do also have to be mindful of what we put on our skin to find products that align with us and products that are free of contaminants free of irritants and any pesticides one thing to note is that not all cbd products are equal and not all cbd products are pure some may contain trace amounts of pesticides or irritants or contaminants which is why it's very important to get your cbd from a company that has their cbd third party tested because cbd is not regulated by the fda or by the government and therefore it can legally be sold with any of those pesticides or irritants in the cbd product and yeah like we don't need that on our skin so it's super important to make sure that you're using a third party tested cbd product which is why i only trust thought cloud for my skin because thought cloud is 100 vegan they are organically grown as well as they are lab tested to ensure purity and ensure that there are no contaminants or irritants within the products that you are putting on your precious skin so my loves if you are looking to see if cbd might be a treatment option that aligns with you and you are looking to try something new um you can use my code key at checkout and you can save some money as my darling you", "dAHKGKmSxtE": "hello James granny here from internet B's Unicom and I'm back at it again with the hem videos in today's video I'll be going back to its firm in the last video I showed you out on the field what the hemp looks like in this video we'll be going into the shed and showing you what the hemp looks like inside the shed and exactly how you dry out the hemp plant and turn it into a product that you can sell to the end customer I'll be showing you all of that in this video this is the third video in this series in the earlier two videos I showed you out in the field and just explained here about the business ideas behind hemp and I linked up them to videos below this video so that you can check it out if you haven't checked them out yet but yeah this is something that I'm really interested in at the moment I'm learning as much as possible about hemp and all of the future possibilities there is with this plant and build businesses around it because I think there's gonna be so many opportunities to build businesses in this industry in the future and that's why I'm spending so much time learning about it and I'm sharing with you what I learned here so I hope that you're joining us if you are enjoying this series give it a thumbs up so that I know that you like these types of videos but what I'm gonna do now is just flick over and show you some of the footage that I shot while on aids farm and you can learn for yourself exactly how the hemp is dried out and the end products that are made out of us [Music] so hope to be the moisture yeah you know but now that's that's our stuff that was hand picked hang home here about on just on this side here if I win acres worth ham polka and it took four lads a full week that coat is and hang it up now it's good quality stuff but it's it's tough know that I'd like to be getting properly dry it into it will air dry but now with the wet weather it is so Coco Chanel cocoa that's you really it's the drawing is the biggest problem with this whole crop but you need to be able to try that and in order to deserve it now as long as there's it was it was fully dried it is taking in a bit of moisture but it's not it's not doing any damage yes if if I seen air a little bit of mold in a guitar I'd be getting worried but but it's it is fine it is it is okay it's good and what would you do if there was mold bits in it do you fool them I wanna know yeah I want you can have it only spread yeah you know it's not too bad now it's okay yeah there's only very neighbors what a hint they're like you're looking at getting over over five around five hundred kilos all to actually pop that leaf leaf and flower you know so it's that and that's where you're you're you're cannabinoids air is going to be on that but you know that's where your hemp oil yeah but you'll get seed as well this was harvested early which will still have seed because I have males and you're not going to get to weed out there with males okay like I wouldn't buy I wouldn't bother buying family I seen unless that you knew that you're a percentage of CBD was going to be say anywhere from twelve fifteen twenty percent CBD and this is this is going to be anywhere from probably about three percent up to well we got her tested at eight percent which is very very good but I'd usually say anywhere from 3% to 5% okay can you explain the difference between CBD percentage and THC percentage well the THC is your tetrahydrocannabinol and we can only pick varieties that are going to be below zero point two percent THC th is what gets you high yeah cannabis that you'd buy on the street would be anywhere from 10 percent up to thirty percent being that super skull okay and what TAC is only 0.2% and it can only be a maximum with 0.2% and so then therefore you'd have to smoke a telephone Paul sighs joint in about ten minutes to stand like the die of smoke inhalation before he gets thrown so it's just not possible to get stoned off this him yeah and what the other compound there is your THC or CBD yeah so your CBD is your cannabidiol and that cannabidiol then can be and it would probably be anywhere from two to five percent on this variety whereas the Rays other varieties will be much higher but we're not allowed grow those they're generally varieties that are in and the states would have been crossbred with your your cannabis was the likes of ac/dc is a variety there that will have about 15% CBD it generally correlates the to generally currently together that the higher that the tea may see generally the higher the CBD of course because we're only allowed two broads ear 0.2% that's why your CBD is down now there's certain leader coming out with new genetics that you can have zero THC and a hypersensitivity force because this is industrial hemp and you're you're generally looking at a sort of two to five percent CBD now we're using this because we can because we can Road who are allowed to grow it but really and truly in the future you need to be getting into those higher percentages to justify putting in that very expensive equipment for the extraction processes your ethanol ratio to the your co2 could be half a million a million so then you have to have high percentages to justify spending that half-million no whereas what we're doing is we're called pressing this so this this is basically blended up and into a powder and mixed with seed for to a cold press and then whatever this is whether it be 2% to 5% whatever it is that's gonna melt and in that cannabinoid or and could you briefly explain what's next with what we're seeing here so after this is hung up try it out how long does it take to dry out generally about three to four weeks to dry out so and then you want to be keeping sunlight offered if sunlight comes on to that it start to go up around and not that not that that's a huge problem but just aesthetically and you want it to be nice and green so once we have that droid will be will strip strip this off and we'll we blend it blend it down to a powder and then it's mixed with that seed put your cold pressed [Applause] so this is the best day the oil tested bottle now of the of our oil so you can see here now is the book with a seed I have a show so this is the hand seed that's that's your hem see so that's about 20 percent oil right you won't get a full 100% extraction when you go through the cold press you'll get so it takes about a kilo of this seed to make this 25 to 250 ml bottle of of oil and once you press that seed the end up with this cake so that cake is very high in fiber and high in protein so this that's that's the company that presses it for a stylish health or as they're often Ashburn and this is the it's that cake and is milled down and it's put into that package so you have a nice fine powder that you can add to your smoothies or shakes your cereal biscuits bars various different things very high in protein very high in fiber then this is your your oils then that's what's your brand minimum okay Dean Mountain Farms okay you can see you son Facebook and Instagram stop and what does most people you could be on your for and well it's I suppose salads is the big one now it's not what you call a cooking oil it doesn't like that really high heat it's a poly saturated fat so it doesn't like that real high heat you can do a bit of baking with it and things like that what is it it's used similar that you would use a grapeseed oil but it doesn't like that it's not a cooking oil like you wouldn't be frying in my head now or anything but it is it's a very it's a very healthy oil to be just using on your salads using in estos homelesses I do just take that I actually get a glass of milk and pour out two tablespoons of oil into my milk and I drink it down that way and it's a bit like a peanut milkshake like it has it has a nice nutty flavor little bit grassy push it's a more of a notary or taste and it's it's it's not five like it's not an oil no that you take off the spoon like the die-hard might do that hearted but generally I put it in ass will be exactly cool yeah put it in a smoothie added in that way because it is a really healthy oil because you're getting all of your amigas I get has the perfect balance between concerns you know of that four to one ratio Omega six to omega-3 closer has GLA which is gamma Leone gases and that Gamal ionic acid is an anti-inflammatory I hope that you've

too it concentrates in the bladder and three we know the many of these casa FL ugd have underlying it anxiety CBD also works to deal with their anxiety cats can get seizure disorders such as epilepsy can be really fit difficult to treat them with some of the conventional veterinary medications CBD is a really legitimate option it's currently being researched for its benefits and uses for animals with epilepsy number four IBD inflammatory bowel disease these cats can have chronic vomiting chronic vomiting diarrhea can be a very difficult disease to treat very limited that's all that our options offten means pretty potent corticosteroids and you know suppressive drugs camon dial has been shown to be beneficial for many of these cats you have a cat with car vomiting chronic diarrhea you should be considering his CBD number five are diabetic cats Murray is now a controlled diabetic he's controlled on diet but in part I was able to get him off of insulin because I'm actually also

CBD stands for cannabidiol and it is one of the roughly 500 compounds\nfound in the marijuana plant. CBD is perfectly legal and is actually the second most prevalent\ncompound found in cannabis. Falling short to the more\nfamous and semi-legal THC or tetrahydracannabinol. These compounds are very\nsimilar on a microscopic level. Both CBD and THC share the\nexact same molecular formula. C21H30O2. Both compounds also interact\nwith the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are found on the\nendocannabinoid system present in all mammalian species. But while THC is known for\nits psychoactive effects. - I feel like a slice of butter melting on top of a big ole' pile of flapjacks. - [Narrator] CBD acts\na little differently. Early research shows that\nit has the opposite effect on dopamine compared to THC. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with the feeling of reward\nthat you get when taking drugs like cocaine and heroine. THC causes dopamine activity to rise, but CBD seems to decrease its activity. Some researchers think\nthis raises CBDs potential for understanding and treating addiction. Early studies have shown that CBD is also fairly helpful in\ntreating anxiety, insomnia and sleeplessness and chronic pain. There's also early evidence\nthat CBD can prevent seizures and some forms of severe epilepsy. And can help normalize brain\nactivity linked to psychosis. In the last few years, its found its way onto\nmillions of people shelves and topical, ingestible,\nor oil-based forms. It's still the early\ndays for CBD, but so far, the world health organization\ndeems it pretty safe. Cannabidiol is, for now,\nlegal and potentially a pretty helpful compound\nfor a lot of people. (light music)", "s4LCzj5l69M": "[Music] have you ever wondered what exactly is meant by the phrase full spectrum cbd oil is there really any difference between a full spectrum product and say another type of cbd product let's take a look let me go ahead and remind new viewers to subscribe to the way of leaf youtube channel we deliver the industry's most accurate and up-to-date information on all things cannabis and cbd anyway back to the topic of what actually full spectrum cbd oil is it's really pretty simple cbd is just one of more than a hundred different compounds naturally found in the cannabis sativa plant a full spectrum cbd oil well contains pretty much all of these compounds a product like cbd isolate oil on the other hand contains just the cbd compound by itself after it's been filtered and fractionated off during the manufacturing process depending on what exactly you're trying to achieve full spectrum cbd oil can actually work better than a cbd isolate in fact research shows that when cannabinoids work together rather than isolated by themselves they're potentially more effective in terms of a therapeutic benefit this phenomenon is known as the entourage effect but we'll talk more about that later as far as what a full spectrum cbd oil actually contains they can include a variety of natural ingredients found in hemp and other types of cannabis these ingredients include things like phytocannabinoids essential vitamins and minerals beneficial fatty acids like omega-3s and omega-6s plant-based protein and fiber chlorophyll terpenes and flavonoids also it's important to understand that full spectrum cbd oil can come from both hemp and marijuana most of the cbd products you see for sale online and in places like gas stations and grocery stores are made from hemp that contains 0.3 thc or less full spectrum cbd oils can also be made from marijuana these oils have higher levels of thc but are only available in dispensaries in states that offer legal medical or recreational cannabis one of the most important studies relating to full spectrum cbd oil took place at the hebrew university of jerusalem in 2015. the study compared the performance of a full spectrum cannabis extract with one that contained cbd only and concluded that at least in mice the full spectrum oil was more effective for pain and inflammation in fact authors of the study claimed the whole plant cannabis extract was ideal for clinical use as compared to isolated cbd another great quote we like to use in order to describe the effectiveness of full spectrum cbd oil comes from dr ethan russo in a 2019 publication in frontiers in plant science dr russo's paper claimed that one molecule i.e cbd is unlikely to match the therapeutic potential of cannabis itself as a phytochemical factory in other words while pure cbd can be effective it appears that full spectrum cbd oil is the better option for therapeutic purposes do you have any more questions about what full spectrum cbd oil is is there anything that we left out feel free to join in the conversation by leaving a comment below also if you enjoyed this content and found it helpful don't forget to hit the

nature throughout this video however the company that I will be talking about did send me some product to try out for free but I'm not letting that influence what I'm about to say you see a lot of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to make you guys aware of that now let's start the video well so now guys welcome to a brand new video thank you for stopping by I really do appreciate it as always so the topic at hand CBD oil you've seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because it helped does help to channel out a lot more than you do think if you want to see any more of my videos and please be sure to sub to the channel and hopefully I'll see you with that next one [Music]", "qe7eDBoTj2c": "why does it feel like so many media outlets discovered CBD in the past year media including Consumer Reports descended upon the CBD space within the last year and there's a very good reason for it because CBD starts showing up everywhere it starts showing up in coffee bars and brownies and candy and things CBD is a compound found in cannabis plants including hemp and marijuana plants CBD is like a scattershot it's there's a whole bunch of different systems that it's influencing one of which is the end of cannabinoid system but lots of others as well so this is why you see something that works for anxiety potentially for pain potentially for pediatric seizures right and wide host of things because there's a wide number of different mechanisms that it divides the scientific research has lagged is particularly in the area of CBD most of the research that's been done has been on THC which is Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol and that is the primary psychoactive molecule in the plant that's responsible for feeling high more recently probably past five to ten years has there been focused on CBD or cannabidiol that's kind of the second most abundant molecule in the plant and it really came out of you know grass roots if you will of people trying it out on the ground in Colorado in other countries in England trying it out and seeing that it actually helped with pediatric epilepsy which was kind of where it got in its initial buzz one of the ways that I stayed sane honestly for the decade I tried to keep my son alive was research and so I actually had heard about cannabis for epilepsy for me when I take it it comes the anxiety or if I start to feel a headache coming on or migraine it seemed very natural that Consumer Reports wanted to step in and try to understand what is this market what are these products what are the labels say that they are are they safe are they tested do they work and how much are they and who's regulating them and that's that's where we enter into this conversation now despite promising anecdotal evidence we actually know very little about cannabidiol because there is limited research and as the chairman mentioned what we learned was a conflict between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health which prevented that research being done because it was a Schedule one drug is CBD legal so the crazy answer to that is it depends is CBD legal it depends on where you live how strange is that can you imagine not being able to buy tylenol in Ohio but you can buy it at Indiana that's that is sort of what we're talking about and we don't always understand what's the real world application like flying with CBD it seems like in a state where it's legal that you should be able to get on a plane but you may not really want to do that until it becomes federally legal what would Consumer Reports like to see happen in the CBD space to protect consumers sure so that's the most important thing that would protect consumers is clear regulatory environment alignment between the states and the federal government on all things including just the legality of possession and sales how products are manufactured how products are tested how products are sold how products are labeled and we'd also like to see more research in this space so that we the consumer has some assurance that purchasing that product will actually help treat the symptom that they're seeking my son Zack I started having seizures when he was four months old and he had had over 500,000 seizures by the time he was five and we had been through 17 pharmaceuticals he has a rare catastrophic form of early childhood epilepsy and he transitioned to hospice palliative services were you mentally preparing yourself for his death yeah I you know as a as a mom and being faced with what the situation was I and just on Facebook you know they do this memory thing that pops up and it was his EEG that was December of 2011 which was rape before we started this his EEG is of electrical scan of the brain and he was having seizure activity every 10 seconds and so you you know their little bodies and their little brains just can't keep doing that but also how can you don't quit you never quit you can't no one else is gonna fight and so at the same time of of trying to accept things the way that they were was the necessity to make sure that that didn't happen back then it was you know CBD and honey and so I gave him his first dose just in the mouth like you'd give a baby tylenol so it's a liquid he's not smoking anything and his seizures didn't start he fell asleep and two minutes pass in ten minutes pass and and his seizures didn't start and I thought you've got to be kidding me and he didn't have a seizure for 48 hours and they returned they were less frequent they were less severe but his seizures came back and so we just slowly titrate it up just like we've done for the previous decade of everything that we've dried so Zook I was almost 10 years old and incontinent and didn't know his colours and couldn't write his name and had very very poor memory so you know where he was at was he was very developmentally delayed and where is he now he is 15 years old he's toilet trained he's learning sight words so he knows his alphabet he's learning how to read he can do basic addition he's hysterical he's so funny he's so sensitive and cares about how you're feeling he's a very in a lot of ways very typical you know fifteen-year-old boy he's talking about his house he's gonna get and how I'm not gonna live with him it's just absolutely incredible it's amazing [Music] you [Music] we're here in the foothills Appalachia we're on the edge of the coal fields so we're don't have vast acres to farm we have limited acreage so we need to have a high-value crop a high-quality crop that we can grow basically for a cash crop when you talk to people who don't know anything about hemp and don't know anything about CBD how do you kind of begin to tell them about it people know that I'm growing this crop and a lot of them oh they first they automatically assume you're growing medical marijuana that's that's your first thing you have to educate people this is not medical marijuana it is it's a medical marijuana is still illegal in state of Kentucky so it isn't industrial hemp but it does produce CBD we've been primarily at the back upon the tobacco industry of course as everyone knows in decline so we've always been looking for alternatives so three years ago we actually drew our first hemp crop and and we thought this is something that could really fit in our operation and something we could produce that we would be proud to be producing that'd be Kentucky grown and like I said if you can grow something that can help a kid with epilepsy I mean that's just that's just huge it's a great feeling [Music] so when we harvest it's much like tobacco we actually go in and we hand cut it we take it and we dry it in some dryers we have here on the farm and once we dry it we actually separate the relief and bud material from the stock and that's actually a material that we have that we sell and then of course the bud material is were the CBD that and that'll go to an extractor and that's where the extraction cbda be extracted from the bud mature I feel like next year that they'll probably be more demand for him than what they're our farmers to produce what makes you say that just because of the merging markets they can't sit idle so you know next three or four years I think demand is there for in production I've covered pharmaceutical medications and over-the-counter medications and supplements for over 15 years and I have never seen any product that both has medical benefit and for very difficult to treat conditions that also may have a supplement benefit for conditions like anxiety insomnia pain and that also may be used in a recreational space is there any interest as a possible alternative or weaning mechanism for opioid addiction yes there are a number of studies that are going on that are looking at the interaction between both THC and CBD in relation to opiates and trying to see if there are some ways of curbing opiate use but not just opiates their National Institutes of Drug Abuse funded a study looking at CBD and tobacco nicotine addiction you know there's been work that's looked at cocaine addiction so all of those things I think there's potential there's theory that makes sense within this space and we'll see what happens with the research I think it's pretty exciting when I look back on that time period where I was on a lot of medications I actually had so many that my medicine cabinet was just a bunch of yellow bottles prescribed by the VA I served active duty in the Navy for four years we stepped on board the USS Harry s Truman for her maiden voyage and were the relieving battle group for the USS Cole I was injured on board the Truman actually right off the bat I tripped over the catch wire carrying roughly 180 pounds worth of tie-down chains so I basically destroyed my left knee and my lower back simultaneously when were you first prescribed opioids or opiates in 2000 when I destroyed my knee and for how long did you take them thirteen years did they work to an extent after a certain point you get moved from one type of opioid to another so I had gone from basically naproxen to tram it all to vicodin and oxy and in the end I was taking morphine tablets and for me looking back my mental state just it was like I was there but I wasn't it was just like a shell of me hi here's Veronica but she's not present she's faking it so what I made an appointment with my primary care physician at the time she actually recommended that I go out and get a card for medical marijuana and see if that was effective for me and how high did you feel I was pretty out of it for a while and that was one of the effects that I really didn't like about marijuana so I talked to some of the dispensaries about you know what can I do to kind of mitigate this feeling and they had actually suggested trying pure CBD from the hemp plant and did you feel relief immediately with the CBD I didn't really feel relief right away but I felt like after about 30 days of consistently taking it I started to feel normal again and how do you feel now today I feel alive you know I don't I don't feel like the world was coming down on top of me anymore and for me that's big I think the important thing to understand I think the hard part is the disconnect between how much is in those bottles at a dispensary or that you order online and how much is required for clinical effect now some people say I use 10 milligrams and I feel wonderful and again there's no clinical data to support that if you wanted to dose like you're seeing in the clinical trials where you actually see separation from placebo it's a lot so a few examples social anxiety 600 milligrams a day that's a lot adults with osteoarthritis of the knee or other types of pain 500 to a thousand depending on the study so I mean you're not in the tens and if you look at the bottles like some of the bottles it's like this whole bottle is 500 milligrams right it's like you're drinking that bottle in a day and that's a lot the interesting thing about one out of every four Americans has tried CBD that's according to a nationally representative survey that Consumer Reports just completed the majority of people told us CBD was effective for the problem they were trying to treat a solution to what what are they hoping to solve sure so so one of the most common reasons people have tried CBD is pain management and anxiety and insomnia [Music] I've always loved to be outside so I've always hiked and jogged and walked and running is just a great way to get outside get in the woods it's a great way to start the day feels like every day's a vacation we can get out and run before work after work you got to try to run six days a week and I had a tendinitis of my other foot and also my knee I've had a knee tendonitis and so I did the normal things rest I didn't help and then my friend that me some CBD and I didn't really intend to use it and but it was there and I you know at a couple days my tendonitis was still there and I used it and it went away immediately which was I was surprised and yeah so then I've started using it when I've had tendonitis and it seems to work and you've only used a topical ointment yes yes why haven't you tried tinctures I don't I think mostly what I've seen people use them for is anxiety and sleep disturbance which day I don't think I suffer from so I haven't really had any any I don't have any other inflammatory other than the local inflammation and that's pretty rare so you don't feel I really needed anything I'm also a little nervous a little apprehensive I I don't the topical seems like totally safe to me the ting sherry I'd like to see more information do you worry at all about trusting what's in that bottle yes yes for sure I think that at least what I've read about CBD is that's the biggest concern is what's in it who's manufacturing it where it comes from and I think with a lot of supplements when patients I've many many patients who take supplements and I tell them I think that's specially pregnant patients that's you know big risk always is that what it's what's in it things that don't have to be added to the label I think that's a scary part of supplements we wanted to do a study to really look at CBD products that were out in the market be it you know CBD oils and in containers vape oils anything really that was you know liquid CBD to see what does the market look like it and really the point is how accurately labeled by these products and in this study 70% or so of products were mislabeled some containing more CBD than was labeled in some containing less CBD that was labeled but a lot of products also contain THC or other cannabinoids in there that hadn't that weren't necessarily on the labels at all so beyond you know I'm getting less of the drug or more of the drug than I expect but I'm also getting some other things in there that I might want to be avoiding and so from a consumer standpoint it was a bit alarming I think it's very important to be a skeptic in this space especially when we're talking about this much money being spent in this space and I think it's important to you know be realistic about what we know and our approach to this and I really think bifurcating the the people that are there for medicinal use because they have an issue that can't be currently addressed with existing medications and the Wellness crowd I think we really need to differentiate those two crews and I think right now it's kind of getting blended a bit and I could see that as frustrating from the medicinal crowd because they're like hey this is we're trying to you know get this medicine or do whatever and things are getting marketed for you know more the Wellness crowd in some instances so I think it's it's pretty difficult space right now at the same time you are hopeful as a researcher and see great potential I do I do but I'm not I'm not the one that's gonna go out there and say you know it cures everything because I think it's and even seeing it in pediatric epilepsy or seeing it in anxiety it works for some and it doesn't work for and figuring that nuance out is really important but I think it's therapeutic potential is pretty wide-ranging [Music]", "luyT7sbs8IQ": "How to take Populum CBD Tinctures Step 1: Choose your dosage At Populum we

the CBD industry and my first question to you would be what is it so CBD is a compound that's found in the hemp and cannabis plants so it is got great medicinal value to it it's not marijuana it's not the THC that you find in marijuana which can lead people to becoming high so there's some controversy regarding that because people who feels like say you know what I don't want to take drugs that are gonna make me feel high or give my dog or cat drugs they're gonna make them high that's not the case at all in this this truly just has the medicinal value of that plant what are the most common questions you're getting most people are just unsure this one is education so CBD is stands for cannabidiol and that is this the easy term is CBD because it's hard to say that yeah yeah but it has great benefit yeah so in a tincture is probably one of the best ways to administer it because then you can definitely dose and make sure that you're giving the right amount based on the weight of your cat or dog but many ailments can be offset by using this anxiety being one of the most common even loss of appetite things you most commonly find with you know what it's related to but also it has some anti-cancer agents to it it actually definitely reduces tumors it's got tumor fighting agents CBD has got a great great benefit so the most important thing is if you're concerned about it it doesn't have the THC that you would find in marijuana absolutely not completely different correct right you're gonna get the benefit of the of the plant without getting the side effects because when I saw this package and I was like oh a debye it's that's kind of cool but I wasn't sure about it's a it's a play on words for sure but it's got the CBD in it and a treat form yeah and it makes it really easy because sometimes it's hard to administer an oil or a tincture because you have to really get it under the tongue in order to be effective that gets all it's really okay so trees might be easier for a dog like Zen who's a little finicky yeah absolutely and the thing to keep in mind is this stays in in the system for about 12 hours so administering it every 12 hours like a supplement is the best way to get the the effects that you would want we've helped so many people through providing this you know with dogs and cats that are in pain have HIPAA issues and just hard to move and very sick and ill and aren't eating at all what would be your message to someone who might be on the fence not sure if this is the way that they want to go what would you say to them do your research but I you know talk to someone who really knows what they're talking about I mean we have the experience in our stores and find a store that that has the great products make sure they're organic they're well sourced they're gonna be expensive that's something to keep in mind you don't want to cost save on products like this because it could be diluted and they could have other ingredients in there that aren't gonna be healthy for the dog so make sure it's pure and make sure you talk to an expert like Mike thank you thanks", "JXjL7wI0c-I": "as the popularity of CBD products continues to surge the Food and Drug Administration is taking its first step to determine how to regulate the burgeoning industry today the FDA held its first public hearing on cannabis and cannabis derived compounds and as silly X 18s Mike Valenti explains industry insiders are pushing for some guardrails for action that's the big story at 5:30 [Music] the CBD craze got a major boost in 2018 after President Donald Trump signed the farm bill removing hemp from the controlled substance list CBD based products flooded the market despite the fact that the FDA hadn't implemented any regulations that has left the industry in a state of flux it's really hampering small businesses it's really getting in the way of business that we've been doing since 2014 Adrienne Pauline ACK is the owner and executive director of bluegrass hemp oil her business and thousands of others like it have had to suspend online sales merchant processors severed their ties with CBD companies due to a lack of regulations and heightened uncertainty in the industry there's probably some leonis around the business just around who's getting into the business now and there were reasons why they're getting into the business so there's definitely some need for overall regulation with regards to the product the use of CBD as an ingredient in supplements has sparked many questions about the compound safety and officials at the FDA have expressed skepticism about its medicinal value the hearing today marks a first step in addressing those outstanding questions in Lexington Mike Valenti lex18 news", "nucmiiSL5aQ": "hello fellow Doug lovers so if you've watched my top 5 CVD oils video for humans you all know that I've been experimenting with CBD for the last couple months because I was looking for a solution to deal with my stress and it's worked out so well for me and I'm so happy that I found a natural solution to my problem and I thought you know why not try it for my dog I have a 12 year old chihuahua chichi and she's been struggling to get around more and more so I wanted something that could alleviate her pain and just you know kind of give her energy boost so I've tried a few different oils from different brands just putting a few drops in her meals twice a day and that's worked really well for her but you should definitely figure out what dosage works best for your dog but first let's explore oil options so here we go my top 5 CBD oils for dogs starting at number five just CBD ok this is number five but honestly it was really hard to order them because they just all worked really well so with just CBD you have quite a few flavor options that can appeal to your pooch they've got bacon chicken salmon and beef I personally went for bacon and I was a little tempted to try it for myself but I didn't so jess CBD offers 3 CBD strengths for their oils and at a pretty good price as well the hundred milligram bottle is at $17.99 the 250 milligrams is at $29.99 and the 500 milligrams is 49.99 Gigi's pretty small so I just went with the hundred milligram bottle and that was enough but if you're looking for the best deals on CBD oils just click on the link in the video description and honestly you'll find the best prices there next in 4th place I put Charlotte's Web there CBD oil is offered as chicken or unflavored this time I went for the unflavored because I figured it would be easier to mix with bigger variety of food again this one worked like a charm just make sure that you test and adjust the dosage when you switch from another CBD provider their oil is also from USA grown hemp and they make it really easy because they only offer two sizes they have the 30 milliliter bottle at $64.99 and at a 100 milliliter bottle for one 59.99 both sizes contains 17 milligrams of CBD and they offer a 30 day satisfaction guaranteed so if you're on the fence you know you can just try it and see if it works with your pooch with little risk in third place we have CBD FX so you might have heard of these guys they've been mentioned by vogue NBC News BuzzFeed etc they provide real high quality products and they also have a huge variety of products they're also 100% natural and organic they use the co2 extraction method and they keep their lab reports available on their websites if you have any concerns and want to have a look so in their pet range they offer three CBD oils and they basically depend on your pet size so for small dog breeds or even just animals weighing less than 20 pounds you have the 150 series at $29.99 for medium breeds there's the 300 series at $44.99 and then for the large breeds there's the 600 series for $69.99 now next on the list and second place med Tara okay first thing to mention about these guys is the price point they're the most affordable and they start at $19.99 for the 150 milligrams bottle you can also get the 300 milligram bottle for $29.99 and the 700 milligram bottle for 39.99 I think 750 is the highest I've seen which you know could be good if you have a mastiff or a Great Dane or something like that like all products in this video matera CBD oil is made in the u.s. non-gmo all natural and doesn't contain any THC which is the psychoactive element of cannabis meaning your dog will not get high and neat little thing that these guys provide also is their pet dosage calculator so you can just scroll here just input the weight of your dog and then you'll get dosage recommendations and if you're out of the u.s. matera ships internationally so you can get your hands on the CBD oil except if you're from Canada or Australia all right now for first place I put honest paws so why did I put these guys in first place well several reasons the first one is these guys only provide CBD oils for pets so that's their main focus second their products are also 100% natural non-gmo from premium grade hemp farmed in Colorado and their soy free so if your dog has soy allergies this is a really good option they also offer the 30-day money-back guarantee their website offers a ton of information on CBD for pets so it's definitely worth a read if you've got any questions or concerns okay now for the main reason why I put on his paws as my first choice is because I had to take a five-hour flight with chichi she is usually a super nervous traveler which in turn makes me super nervous but oh my god what a difference I mean I gave her some CBD before the flight and she was so calm but yet she was you know looking around kind of taking it all in but without like I could tell she was so much more at ease so that's why I put it at number one alright that is it for my top 5 CBD oils for dogs list don't forget to check out the link in the video description for the best deals for CBD oils

so far with my brand-new hem fat and the South Devon defined self that has CBD oil in them so here's um the hemp app and I'm sure you've seen it around and it heats up pretty quick and so it's pretty simple to use comes fully loaded comes with two different containers full of the oil and also a USB charger so that's pretty cool I'm sure it's much like many of the others that are out there and it's really the product that I'm testing and also here's the south and you can see it's pretty green smells okay smells a little bit medicinal but still pretty good so these came last night and we my husband and I immediately began to test them and before we started using the product we both checked in with ourselves to see where we were cautiously and physically if we had any aches or pains or anything like that going on and then we each tried by taking a couple of hits off of the that pen and I'm not exactly sure if it's supposed to be called a hit or not but we inhaled a couple times I didn't notice anything really immediately although I did feel sensations in the brain and nothing much pretty much anywhere else in the body Stephen however had more of an immediate reaction to it which doesn't surprise me because his metabolism is so much faster than mine so he immediately said wow I love this I really like the sensation of well being that I'm getting i really like that in fact he liked it so much he asked if he could sign up under me and purchase his own hemp app which is pretty fun because I knew he would want his own anyways so I'm glad he did we took care of that then i had a couple of calls to make in a conference and we had we did a mini bio meditation session and our usual things that we do and then later on what I was feeling tired but it was really too early to go to bed it was probably about 7 30 and I noticed I was yawning and feeling a little cloudy headed so I decided to try it again and I did two separate sessions where I inhaled and I obviously don't take a really big inhale but a good-sized one and learn to heat learn to hold it and then probably after the second second inhalation that is when I really noticed the sense of well-being and just being at peace and a lot more clarity and I was no longer tired so I think that was pretty awesome and and that was the end of it for that last night you", "uMjiYNWeIFk": "You can walk into a coffee shop,\na massage spa or even a doggie daycare -- and walk out with something infused with CBD. This cannabis compound, which some claim can\nhelp with pain, anxiety or other ailments, has sparked a gold...\na \u201cgreen\u201d rush in the U.S. Sales for CBD -- or cannabidiol as it\u2019s\ncalled -- are expected to grow from $1 billion to $20 billion within the next three years. But if you don\u2019t do your homework, those\nlotions or lattes could land you in deep trouble -- EVEN in places where medical or recreational\nweed is legal --- AND EVEN THOUGH the 2018 Farm Bill removed restrictions from CBD \nif it\u2019s derived from hemp plants. I mean just look at the confusion that remains\namong federal agencies: As of early July 2019, the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture says states can\u2019t block the trade of hemp plants. But if you sell CBD from those same plants\nin any health or food products, the Food and Drug Administration could technically come after you for violating interstate commerce laws. And don\u2019t even get me started \non state cannabis laws. Finding legal CBD is way \nharder than you think, so we packed our bags and headed back to school. Namely, to the University of Connecticut. In January, UConn launched the nation\u2019s\nonly college course that gives hands-on experience with growing cannabis plants. Graduate student Peter Apicella and research\ngrower Shelley Durocher showed us around their greenhouse\u2026. The stems are really purple. It's a nice tall upright plant. The leaflets are very narrow on each individual leaf. The class only grows hemp, which is like marijuana\u2019s straight-edge twin. All cannabis varieties, including hemp and\nmarijuna, fall under one species: Cannabis sativa. The main difference is marijuana makes high\nquantities of THC, tetrahydrocannabinol -- which is federally illegal. Industrial hemp, under federal law, shouldn\u2019t\ncontain more than 0.3 percent THC -- but plants aren\u2019t very good at following guidelines. So even within hemp cultivars, there's a lot\nof variation as far as the morphology of the leaves. that's where you start to see some \nof the variability and different levels of THC and CBDs. A hemp crop can start off making only CBD -- and then unwittingly turn into a \nTHC-laden field of marijuana. That\u2019s right: a hemp crop can become marijunana! And if your CBD comes from a marijuana plant,\nselling it and buying it is a federal crime. That\u2019s why under the 2018 farm bill, hemp\nfarms must submit to state or federal inspections. These mixups are created by the basic biology\nbehind THC and CBD, which are both cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are plants oils, and cannabis comes packed with \nmore than 100 versions of them Scientists suspect cannabinoids protect the\nplant from UV rays, much like sunscreen does for the human skin They think that because up to a quarter of\na cannabis plant\u2019s weight can be just cannabinoids -- and cannabinoid levels change with light exposure. You'll have more cannabinoids with more light. At the top of the plant, you'd get more cannabinoids compared to flowers\nthat are at the lower end of the plant. A cannabinoid starts out as a bit of sugar that hitchhikes around the plants\u2019 enzymes, changing its identity, bit by bit, with each ride. Eventually this wandering sugar can bum a\nride from one of two enzymes: THC-a synthase or CBD-a synthase. One ride leads to becoming THC. The other to CBD. Except in hemp, THC synthase is genetically\ndormant That\u2019s why hemp plants can make loads of\nCBD and little to no THC... ...a habit that will continue as long as the plants don\u2019t pollinate each other. When the plants DO reproduce, their traits\nmix -- and those once dormant genes can suddenly be replaced with active ones. Studies have found if two hemp plants that purely make CBD hook up, most of their offspring will be able to make THC. In fact, some of those seedlings will ONLY\nmake THC. Any biological organism is going to fluctuate\nand that's something like farmers are always and growers are always really concerned about\n-- that fluctuation. If an inspection catches marijuana in a hemp\nfield, then a whole crop could be lost. That\u2019s why UConn\u2019s cannabis class only\ngrows female hemp plants. This is a preflower and it's a very small pistil. Since it's this little tiny white hair we\nknow pretty certainly that it's a female. and they\u2019re all clones. You snip a part of a plant off you put it\nin soil with a little rooting hormone and that cutting is actually genetically identical\nto that first mother plant that you took from. And so these are all genetically identical\nto one of the mother plants we have in here. Keeping a greenhouse all-female is easy, but\nit\u2019s a different story growing hemp outdoors. Cannabis is abundant in the wild -- meaning\nan outdoor hemp field is one gust of pollen away from accidentally breeding marijuana. So before you buy, ask the store how its extracts\nwere made and if they were validated by a third-party tester. That\u2019s important because extracting CBD\nor THC from cannabis plants is essentially the same process. If your supplier does it incorrectly, your\nCBD bottle might carry a little surprise. It happens all the time. Sometimes there is CBD. A lot of times, there's not CBD. Sometimes it even contains THC in the bottle\nwhen it's not supposed to. It's really... it's a crap shoot. That\u2019s the voice of Rino Ferrarese, COO\nof the medical marijuana extractor CT Pharma, and he\u2019s tired of tainted CBD flooding the\nmarket. Under Connecticut law, their company must\nensure their products match the labels on their bottles, which they accomplish through\npharmaceutical-grade extraction. Using liquid carbon dioxide or ethanol, they can strip the cannabinoids from the plant material, in a process that's similar to distilling liquor. Add a little heat, and all of the carbon dioxide\nand ethanol evaporate away. Specific temperatures can isolate CBD and\nTHC on their own. But Rino said many CBD producers don\u2019t take\nthese necessary steps with extraction. Ok, we\u2019re back in the office. Let\u2019s recap. If you buy CBD...and it came from a hemp plant...and\nit\u2019s pure...then you\u2019re in the clear. Not quite. The FDA has prohibited the sale of CBD in\nany unapproved health products, dietary supplements or food... ...which literally means everything except for\none approved epilepsy drug is banned. The Drug Enforcement Administration also still considers CBD a schedule 1 drug unless it is in FDA-approved medicines. So why do we still see so much CBD on shelves? Well, what a lot of consumers don\u2019t realize\nis federal agencies aren\u2019t exactly on top of policing those CBD products that you see\nin a gas station or convenience store. Meanwhile, as those infractions go overlooked,\nmany states and the district have moved to decriminalize cannabis products like CBD. The result is a limbo, where hemp-derived\nCBD is mostly illicit but only if someone is watching.

muscle supplement review today's topic is going to be cannabinoid oils and kratom two compounds that are kind of like weird esoteric type things I think a lot of people are really not that familiar with so I figured I would go over them a little bit and see what the applications possibly are in bodybuilding and fitness of course now CBD oil seems to be the new craze now CBD comes from the hemp plant as we all know from the hemp plant we also get you know marijuana you know and in marijuana we have what we call CBDs or cannabinoid oils but we also have you know the THC which is the hallucinogenic aspect of marijuana which makes it appealing for a lot of people to smoke it or vape it or whatever they don't eat eat it whatever they're doing it with these days but the cannabinoids actually have medicinal properties in the sense that they create relaxation in the body they seem to be natural pain killers they help anxiety and a lot of people you know have been using these the great thing is that they now can isolate the cannabinoid oil from the THC so that you can produce a nutritional product that's free of any kind of you know drug like effects I guess you can say in the sense that you're not gonna crash your car you know using them or or be impaired now you know I I've tried several different companies have sent me different types of cannabinoid oils from the pills to a sublingual drop or a head under my tongue which did which worked but didn't really taste so great the pills worked okay Gabe Owens got a new cannabinoid product with it with a branched chain amino acid electrolyte solution with the cannabinoid powder in there and I felt that that was pretty good and but the one I felt the most was the vape pen they had these little vape pens you can vape the stuff what I felt was a relaxation it wasn't anything significant it didn't feel like I took a xanax or it didn't feel like I you know pop the pain pill or anything like that I just kind of felt like kind of at ease type of thing it's kind of esoteric but you know what I think it's really it's one of supplements cannabinoids that work better with people who were in chronic pain or discomfort so in other words it you know I don't have pain or discomfort you know my life's abruzzi all four roses no seriously I'm not living in chronic pain I would like to see you know someone who lives in some kind of disruptive pain those are the people who seem to be reporting the best results from it and I think that's really where the application is so if you have nerve pain if you have something that's you know aching you all the time headaches maybe cannabinoid oil has probably got some good applications do I think it will negatively impact bodybuilding as far as building muscle and burning fat you know so I don't think I don't think you have to worry necessarily that you're not gonna burn enough fat now if it makes you lazy you know go to the gym you know train hard yeah that's not good but I don't think the cannabinoid receptors will do anything you know as far as you know inhibiting fat loss or preventing you from putting muscle which is a good thing because as we know the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen reduce the inflammatory response to the body and that's that's not good for muscle building we want that in acute initial inflammatory response and the muscles that we train and break down so that the body knows has a signal there to help repair itself the cannabinoids don't seem to affect that inflammatory response which is good and I think that that makes it something that body bells can indeed use now when we talk about kratom okay which the chemical name and that is might rajah mean that's something is too interesting the government wanted to actually be at DEA wanted to make it a controlled one substance which would put it up there with like heroin you know and cocaine that was next it never went through they kind of stopped that bill from being passed because they said you know what we have to kind of let's let's explore this a little more before we need your put this on the controlled one substance list you know the need the knee-jerk responses the the drug companies don't want anyone releasing anything natural that could possibly compete with their opioids if they sell you know their oxycontin and oxycodone and and all the other you know percocet and Percodan they they don't want to lose any of that business so they probably put a lot of pressure on the congressmen to get this thing passed when the other side the science community side said hey you but take a look at this isn't naturally occurring substances they don't really have addictive qualities to them there you know they say that when you take kratom on a regular basis and you stop it you might get a no sniffle that's about the extent of the of the withdrawal so that to me tells me it's not addictive not severely addictive at least maybe the feeling is addictive it might be mentally addictive it's not certainly not physically addictive also one of the things that makes it you know very safe to use and as you know a lot of people wondering how that works well the cannabinoid oils we talked about bind to cannabinoid receptors this kratom actually binds to the opioid receptor so it gives pain relief it gives anxiety relief but it doesn't seem to suppress respiration which is one of the problems with the opioids if you take too much of it you know people die of heroin over those little times if you take too much you stop breathing basically this I guess kratom supplement doesn't cause the suppression of respiration it also doesn't cause the constipation that a lot of the opioids do that's another side effect that people really hate you know you take if you're on chronic opioids on a regular basis cuz you're in chronic pain whether me from back or whatever you know you can't go to the bathroom it's a terrible terrible side effect on it even if you use my five I think you're gonna have a trouble going to the bathroom so this is that this is makes kratom you know a really interesting you know possible substitution for people this is a lot you know pain addiction in this society today even in the bodybuilding world I see if there's a lot of guys addicted to painkillers and whether they're taking it because they're in pain or they're taking it because they're an emotional pain that you know that doesn't matter but the problem is when they want to stop it they can't get off it because there's physically addicted to it so severely so here's a great alternative that is naturally available and that the people not gonna have to pay hundreds and thousands of dollars a year for like they do it you know go into pain clinics and go into their doctors and pain to these oxycontin prescriptions so once again we'll create a negatively impact bodybuilding I think it might more so than the CBD oils do once again you know theoretically if you if you're over stimulating they can add the opioid receptors in the brain sometimes there's an elevation in certain like hormones that could be an elevation an estrogen a little bit sometimes there's some fluid retention and there is some constipation sometimes associated with it doesn't seem to be the case with kratom but we don't know I don't think people have been using it long enough people have been asking me their right dosage I don't really know I haven't tried it yet so nothing I need to try but I'm just saying I don't think it's been around to quantify it and that's another thing we don't really know how pure the the samples of what people are buying are is it a pure form is it cut with other stuff is it are there different you know I guess you could say percentages of product that people can get extracts that are more potent than others these are things that we still have to explore but if you are in chronic pain I'd much rather see you try kratom okay then then not or then use a percocet on a regular basis because that's going to lead down the wrong path and that's not good for bodybuilding we know that already you know also a lot of these you know like opioids like the percocet and the I guess you could save the vicodins they kill your appetite and if you can't eat on bodybuilding terms you're not going to put muscle on so it I think it's an exciting new year I think I like to see natural substances replacing drugs I think the CBD I guess you could say segments is something that that has a lot of potential there whether the government will ban it or not is is still up in the air I haven't produced a supplement with cannabinoid for my species nutrition line because I don't know where the the future that it really lies at this point I'd hate to make a product and then have them pulled off the shelf so there are supplements out there you can try it if you if you're looking for it you can just google it online believe me like I said I know Gabe has a game owned as a really good product he sent to me that I try I think it's called CBD black and it's amino acids electrolytes and CBD powder once again you can try to get these vape pens with the CBD in it and they do work to a certain degree so if you are a personality of suffering in chronic pain you might want to give it a shot I know there's a lot of body bowls with back pain out there maybe even Ronnie Coleman wants to give it a shot obviously he's been suffering tremendously in it with a lot of pain if I were him I would try to create a man to see me together maybe either with a super vape pen of this stuff but anyway I hope you guys learned a little bit about two substances that are kind of you know in the in the shadows right now but are looking to come out of the shadows I like to educate you guys keep you up-to-date for now I'm Dave Palumbo with another rx Muscle supplement review", "pmIZzHHe2G8": "five different types of CBD that you\nneed to know about any if you're looking for again five different types of CBD\nthat you need to know about if you're looking for CBD in your skincare hi my\nname is Christy and I've been treating a client's I'm a licensed professional\ntreating clients with acne hyperpigmentation and other skin\nconditions for over twelve years and now I have taken early retirement from\npractice and I'm only doing online consultations so if you're interested in\nthat there is a link below you can just find out more information to see if you\nare the right candidate so moving on we're gonna be talking about the five\ndifferent types of CBD so if you haven't caught any of our series of what we're\ntalking about beauty and skincare I do want to clarify because I only mentioned\nit in one video that CBD is not the same as hemp seed oil so the CBD is actually\nextracted from the cannabis sativa plant so there are two totally different\nthings so we're gonna be talking about the CBD as an extract in your skincare\nso the first one is CBD isolate and this is actually consisting of 99% CBD it is\nTHC which is the hallucinogenic agent free it's very consistent of most of the\nmanufacturers that use CBD in their products uses the CBD isolate and all\nother plant actives are eliminated so the next one is CBD distillate and this\none is not as concentrated it's still 80% CBD the other is rest is other minor\ncannabinoids and terpenes and all the other rest of it is plant materials and oils okay so the next one is full-spectrum\nCBD and that consists of 60% CBD and 0.3 percent THC it also is taken from the\nentire plan including the flower so it does have the plant flavinoids the it\nhas the minor cannabinoid such as CBC CBD\nand CBG as well as other phytochemicals so I do have one caveat I've read\nseveral different articles and I read some that come across that say the CBD\nisolate which is the 99% is more effective and then I also have read that\nthis full-spectrum CBD is more beneficial so there seems to be I don't\nknow if it's conflicting or they just have difference of opinion but just to\nlet you know that when you start reading literature on CBD those are some of the\nthings that you might come across so before we get into the last CBD type if\nyou're finding this information helpful please give us a thumbs up and like this\nvideo letting us know that this is the type of information that you are looking\nfor and don't forget to hit that notification bell to let you know when\nour videos come up we would love it if you would subscribe to us so now let's\nget to our last CBD type so the last one is water soluble CBD in our last video\nwe talked about the fact that the CBD is actually naturally lipophilic meaning\nthat it loves oil or oil soluble well when they make it water soluble what\nthey do is they basically shrink down the molecule so that it actually can\nmix with water but when you do or you mix anything with water it can dilute\nthe potency and in this case it can dilute the potency up to 30% so here\ncomes the pro tip when you see hemp seed extract it's more than likely hemp seed\noil and don't mistake the fact that there's only trace amounts if any of the\nCBD in hemp seed oil so it is not the same thing so now that we talked about\nthe five types of CBD we're gonna briefly talk about what skin condition\nworks best with some of these different types\nnow the links of some of these studies will be in my blog in which the blog\nlink will be in my description okay so the first one is acne so there was a\nstudy in 2014 in which they found that CVD\nactually reduces the amount of lipid that is being produced from the SIBO\nsites and that's basically the cells that create the sebum and then in study\ndone in 2016 and actually showed in addition to that it actually reduced\ninflammation in the sebocytes and inflammation throughout the skin and in\naddition to that and also they also found antimicrobial and antibacterial\nproperties which then also can help with fungus related skin diseases as well as\nacne so for those of you who have sensitive skin or dry and sensitive skin\nor just dry skin you may want to listen up to this part so they have found that\nthe full-spectrum CBD that we just talked about with its powerful\nphytochemicals and flavinoids can actually help reduce not only\ninflammation but it has the essential fatty acids that a lot of the lipid poor\nso basically dry skin is lacking it can help serve as an emollient and\na moisturizer with these essential fatty acids of antioxidants and the\nphytochemicals a lot of times the types of products that you will see the full\nspectrum CBD is in oils such as massage oils salves\nbalms lotions and creams so some of the skin conditions that are lacking a lot\nof the lipids or essential fatty acids CBDs actually has omega-6 and Gamma\nlinoleic acid which can help for those of you who have psoriasis eczema and\nsystemic sclerosis I mentioned in an earlier video that also has by\nantioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E so it can help neutralize the\nfree radicals and there was actually a study that was done that actually helped\nwound healing cells so basically helped healing of\nwounds including acne lesions so this is by no means an exhaustive list of all\nthe benefits of it and what you can do with it what skin types obviously this\nis just to better help you read the label of your skincare products because\nremember makeup is an art and skincare is a science thanks for watching and\ndon't forget to

"0FaGl2HjHEM": "hi everyone my name is Kelsey and my name is Becky and we're the star girls we're back with another video idea for a DIY Christmas week series this one is yet another one that can be really pricey online and we're gonna show you how to do it for that cheap cheap Oh actually remember we were doing that series we were getting our makeup done and then the makeup artist totally recommend this like a little bomb serum um I bought it but it was like fifty dollars why but I like really liked it when she used it on me so I was like this is solely worth it what was it for uh you can use it on your lips it's like a bomb just like the thing we're making today especially the moisturizing one and gave us what the ingredients are they're like the exactly the same as wax they are oil so if you guys haven't figured out already we are gonna show you how to make a DIY solve ourselves however you want to say it or bombs yeah so many fun words for this thing so basically these can be used to moisturize but also to soothe different problems that you might have or somebody that you want to give it to you my house so we're making a couple different kinds today one is more first skin and lavender is really good for skin and healing skin so you can use that essential oil in your salad or balm also pepper and cayenne we're using in a muscle ache balm yep and this one's right music heats up so the warmth is really nice on muscles and another ingredient you could try mixing in is peppermint because performance really cooling it helps to like soothe if you have headaches raining that's hot so you want to cool it down it's fun to play around with ingredients like that yes but let's get started with the ones that we are tackling today so our first salt is a moisturizing style and this is perfect for combating their really cold dry winters that we experienced here in Canada yes which I'm sure a lot of people out there to also experience in different parts of the world so to make this you're going to want to pick up these ingredients coconut oil shea butter some grated beeswax and avocado oil or you could just use regular olive oil and if you're planning to make this for a gift make sure you pick up a measuring cup or a container that you're only gonna use for making these types of things because the waxes and the oils can leave a permanent residue on the containers that you might not want to cook with and of course you're using a glass measuring cup as well as other glass tools because we're gonna be heating up don't use plastic add three tablespoons of grated beeswax to the measuring cup create a double boiler by adding some water into a larger pot and then placing a measuring cup or bowl inside and heating the water we used a glass measuring cup that we had just because we use this specifically for DIYs and we can place it in there and not worry about anything happening to it or melting it because it's class let the beeswax fully melts and then add half a cup of avocado oil 2 tablespoons of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil once everything is fully melted together you honestly shouldn't need to stir that much it kind of just blends nicely but you can stir it if you want take that out from your double boiler and then add in your essential oils you can use whatever essential oil that you want but if you want to use lavender that is really good for the skin and then you're gonna want to pour yourself into a giftable container we have these really cute tins we'll link you guys some options below but you can also use mason jars as a pretty standard one our second self is a heating saw and this is great for achy muscles to make this heating salv you'll need to go pick up the following coconut oil grated beeswax cayenne pepper ground ginger ground black pepper rosemary essential oil avocado oil or olive oil again start with a measuring cup in a larger pot of water add in two tablespoons of grated beeswax 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of avocado oil or olive oil 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons of ground ginger 2 teaspoons of pepper stir them all together and let them melt so next add something to strain the mixture to the top of a separate container and pour the mixture on top so we tried using a standard coffee filter at first but that didn't strain it very well it didn't seem to drip through fast enough we then had to switch to a fine fabric that we just owned for previous DIYs and that worked perfectly yeah now I've also heard that pantyhose works amazing for this make sure that they're new yeah but you could try that as well from the dollar store and here's what all the chunky ingredients looks like that we strained out you can add the container back into the hot water if you find a mixture has cooled too quickly add in 20 drops of rosemary essential oil or really whatever essential oil you want but rosemary is great for this one and pour it into your little giftable containers so to make these super cute and giftable we use an old-school label maker to write on the side of them what they're gonna do for you aches relief moisturize they won't cause a total relieve and then we wrap them with some holidays wine [Music] so to actually use these selves you just need to rub your hands in them to warm them up a little bit and you should turn into a super moisturizing consistency and then you can put it on any problem area that's like dry skin or if you have sore muscles sometimes I take out like the solid form and put it on the back of my hand and then I warm it up there and then again apply it wherever you need to yeah super easy we hope you guys enjoyed learning how to make these the best thing is that a lot of the base ingredients are similar so once you buy them in bulk you can make a ton of different versions of this make sure you guys tune in to our other videos throughout all of gift week we have so many fun ideas that are affordable and easy to do I can't you love them yes then if you like this video make sure that you give it a like if you love it make sure you sub it we'll see you next time bye guys [Music]", "llQKfQsxRqY": "there's a lot of misconceptions out there about CBD oil so let's go talk to some people and see what they know or don't know about CBD do you know what CBD oil is isn't it the oil that's found in marijuana sort of I mean it sounds familiar can you get high off of CBD oil No maybe no I don't believe so ooh CBD oil legal in all 50 states I don't know no I don't know I would I don't know no I don't think it is its CBD oil the same thing as medical marijuana no maybe no is attempt is CBD oil safe to give to kids and pets I don't know I guess I haven't research enough to know the answer to that I would definitely give it to a kid what does CBD oil do why do people take it oh not no not that I could put into words really don't know how it works I don't know it's like it takes the edge off or something I I don't know how to explain it I would say like pain relief and or stress relief but that's guessing sounds like there's still a few things that people don't know or have questions about on CBD oil so let's go talk to dr. Johnny Boden to get the answers I'm dr. Johnny Bowden I'm a board certified nutritionist and an author I think the biggest misconceptions about CBD come from its confusion with marijuana from which it is completely chemically distinct the difference between CBD orell and marijuana is not really a fair comparison it's like saying the difference between vitamin C and an apple an apple has vitamin C but there are different categories CBD is a cannabinoid there are about a hundred known cannabinoids and they exist in many different plants let me say unequivocably that you cannot repeat cannot get high on CBD if that's what you're taking it for you're going to be sorely disappointed so the endocannabinoid system is this ancient system in humans and in vertebrates that regulates all kinds of really interesting processes that people care about such as digestion and sleep and and people of reading all that research and they're interested in getting some stimulation of the system that regulates all these wonderful things and I think that's why they're interested in in CBD all that far aliens entrance into this market is very very significant and here's why they've been oil manufacturers for thirty years they know how to extract oils that are have what they're supposed to have in them and have purity and our essayed for all those things and i think their entrance into this is a very important event and makes it possible for people to try it that might have been hesitant before not knowing who's making [Music] you", "urBi1xewboE": "i'm craig henderson here at extract labs in boulder colorado i founded this company about 19 months ago originally in my basement in Arvada Colorado and then about three months later we were fortunate enough to go to move here in the boulder the original business model was to just do toll processing for heme farmers and give them back their oil I soon learned that hemp farmers don't want their oil back they just want to grow plant material and sell it so we went from being just a full processing company to a products company we started off just making tinctures and bulk isolate and then from the marijuana side of things I saw that shatter and crumble was a huge industry so I found a way to make CBD shatter and crumble so it wouldn't be limited to any one state it was a shatter crumble that could be sold across the country my background is all co2 processing that's what we primarily do here co2 processing we also do some alcohol and hydrocarbon the co2 is really what separated us from all the other CVD companies we use my Tallis that's what we started with well in my garage I started with you know a small alcohol extraction it just wasn't enough it didn't make very clean oil so once we got connected up Vitalis and got that machine now we've had for a little over a year that's really what took our business to the next level it makes a lot cleaner oil it's a lot simpler to use everything that comes out of it is just liquid gold you know alcohol is still nice for just going I slit if we need a winterized oil or a distillate or somewhere in between something they've put in our own products it's all co2 it's all from the Vitalis today we're doing about 700 pounds a week in put pounds we should be about 1,200 pounds in the next two months our goal is to be at 2,000 pounds per week in put plant material so if we put in 2,000 pounds you know a percentage of that will go to winterized oil you can also take it to distillate ice lit we have flash chromatography they can remove THC so we can make THC free distillate you know there's 120 some cannabinoids out there th C's one of them that everyone's focused on we're gonna focus on the other 119 of them I'd say our shatter and crumble is what most people would probably look at us like we I feel like we were kind of Raiders or founders of CVD shatter the top five biggest CVD companies shatter companies online or all are shatter just white-label for other people but really the body cream and muscle cream is what I feel like I'm personally most proud of it's what I use the most of just tempering the body cream or the muscle cream to get it to the right consistency using the right ingredients trying to keep it very simple if we get our hands on good industrial hemp like the cherry wine strains we have we can pull off really nice terpenes and put those in our products so our cherry wine is something we pull off in-house and then put back into our products and then we just discovered a really cool method for making a really legit water-soluble isolate or full-spectrum water-soluble haven't even released it yet but we should have really nice water soluble products in the very near future you do everything in-house we're not outsourcing really anything that I can think of everything is made here it's processed here it's shipped from here everyone feels like they're kind of part of something you know that's changing the world and I think there's that super-high passion as well as separating us from some of the other companies you know I've had other jobs in the past and they just didn't share the same vision so you're working around a whole bunch of people and they're just not on the same page here I'm working with 25 people that are literally sharing the same vision they wake up excited to the same thing as me every day so I think just the passion and the fact that we do everything in-house we're not reporting to a bunch of guys in suits that you know aren't part of what we do you know it gets scarier the more people you hire the more you start feeling like a large corporation I don't want to lose those small company that that high passion I want to get big but I don't want to lose you know what we have today so it's kind of a balancing act my biggest fear is that Big Pharma will get involved manipulate it over regulate it and change what it is today and make it to where it's impossible for people like me or other small people to get into this and then it just becomes another big pharma problem there's a lot of pharmaceutical products today that I think hopefully get pushed by the wayside they're really not that good for you they're covering up small things are causing bigger problems be nice to see in five years what cannabis can do for people I'm curious to see where that's gonna go you see how big we can get and try to keep it like I said keep that passion alive keep it um just owned by us when I stepped into CBD and him I thought I was taking a step down I thought I wasn't good enough for the marijuana side of things you know and I feel like now the hemp or the CBD side of things is gonna far outdo marijuana I think marijuana in a few years is gonna be a small niche in the realm of the cannabis industry so I feel like I really got lucky you you", "FN7gKQRqxrI": "sup y'all its mandu sampai back at you again with another vid today I'm gonna talk about the gospel that is hemp oil so I used to have really really bad skin I had perfect skin in high school and then once I got to college with all the stress of schools you know your life in my skin got really really bad and I had active acne everywhere I have I had a lot of scarring I still have some scarring but hemp oil has definitely changed that it's decreasing at a very fast rate which I am grateful for [Music] [Music] [Music] so for the last 30 days I've been using hemp oil as a cleanser and it has done Jesus's work on my skin and I know what some of y'all think and you it seems very counterintuitive however the more dehydrated your skin is the more oil it produces it's trying to save itself you know but hemp oil is perfect because it cleans the impurities Wow at the same time moisturizing your skin and by cleaning impurities it's like oil or like dissolves like so in our instance oil dissolves oil so the reason I love hemp oil is because it is on the comodo genic scale it's a zero which means it will not clog your pores so it is absolutely perfect if your acne prone another great thing is that it is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and that just helps keep yourselves healthy because they are essential fats also if you have suffer from psoriasis that's hot that's due to a deficiency in omega-6 fatty acids so that can help alleviate that also can this shoot make me it bra sadly the answer is no it does not contain THC which is the thing that makes you really happy so that's that so this is the brand I use new tevia hemp oil cold-pressed I got that from Vitamin Shoppe however I did make a mistake when I first bought it I didn't know you had to refrigerate that [ __ ] so I forgot to do that so my recommendation for you guys is once you get it and you open it and you use put it right in the French so I'm gonna do a little demo for you guys what I do is I get this is called I pour a tiny bit in my hand and it's supposed to look like oh [ __ ] beep computer foot it's supposed to look like baby poop but very liquidy like the color to me oh I don't know if you see that it smells super nutty so don't be alarmed it's supposed to smell like a tree what I do is I just rub it yep rub it all on your skin very gently and when you first do this you're gonna feel all that grime coming off when I first did it I felt little little little pebbles it felt like on my skin which is pretty gross but my skin felt really clean after that and after a week of using it my clothes Calma domes on my forehead one way it smells really cool yeah you're just gonna rub it on your skin for about a minute yes perfect so after you've rubbed your face for a good minute and you look like a greasy Pig you're gonna keep that oil on your face for an additional 15 to 30 minutes and what I like to do is I'd like to go in the shower with the steam and just let my pores open and soak all those good vital vitamins in the skin and once you're done waiting fifteen to thirty minutes you're gonna clean all that oil off with a cleanser that you that you normally use what I've been using is this new gen green tea foam cleanser it's been good so far but yeah that's what you do and that was my PSA on hemp oil if you guys end up using it and it works out for you please let me know in the comments below everyone the skin is different so what may work for me may not work for you but I found that it's definitely transformed my skin for the better peace out y'all", "bCuju7IpnQ8": "can I take CED oil for arthritis so that CBD oil has anti-inflammatory effects so it works with our own endocannabinoid system which helps to when it's working correctly it aims for homeostasis so balance within the body and it helps to mediate and regulate the inflammation response and adding CBD to the endocannabinoid system can help to flush out or sort of mediate the inflammatory chemicals that go into our bodies so that can help with the pain for osteoarthritis it can also help with rheumatoid arthritis because of the antioxidant properties of CBD oil so the antioxidant properties that refers to reducing the the effects of oxidative stress by reducing the amount of reactive oxygen species and this chemical reaction obviously

butters creams and lotions are used for a variety of medicinal reasons and today we'll be showing you how to make one of the easiest options an infused body butter body butter is a thick buttery moisturizer and when infused with cannabis will not only help with rejuvenating dry skin but will also provide relief from inflammation and pain now at its core this product recipe only needs two ingredients hemp and cocoa butter although optionally to soften the texture or to add an aroma you can include coconut oil as well as essential oils but I'll get to that in a little bit so to start you'll need to use a pound of cocoa butter for every ounce of hemp here I'm using half a pound of cocoa butter with half an ounce of buds that just finished drying I'm just leaving most of the plant intact because I'm lazy but I'd recommend chopping up the buds first so that the smaller pieces have an easier time of infusing with the butter and then adding it in after the cocoa butter melts now put it over a double boiler wait for the cocoa butter to melt [Music] and then use a spoon to submerge the temp into the butter before letting it sit for two hours be sure to top off the water in the pot if needed and now two hours later the CBD the buds are infused with the butter we'll need to take out the plant material from the butter and for that I'm using a strainer along with a coffee filter typically for consumables I'll use a cheesecloth instead of a coffee filter as they'll work much faster but because I'm going to be using the butter as a topical and not as a consumable I want to make sure that I catch all of the tiny plant particles so I went with a slower but more effective option once it's almost done I'll give it a good squeeze to get the last of the butter through and now as is this will work as a basic body butter although we still need to wait for it to cool down and solidify you can leave it for a day to solidify on its own in a cool dark place or to quicken the process I just put it in the refrigerator and a few hours later we have a solid block of infused cocoa butter because of how solid cocoa butter is when you wanna use it as is you'll need to break off a piece of it and then rub it into the skin cocoa butter has a melting point of just below the human body temperature so it will slowly melt when rubbed over the skin to make things easier you can always use something to make the pieces smaller like a cheese grate however if you want a body butter that's easier to work with then a simple solution is to mix it with coconut oil which is a lot softer and has a lower melting point of around room temperature to do this I'm using one part infused butter along with one part coconut oil and put it back on the double boiler because this does dilute the CBD content in the body butter you can use double attempt when making the butter or use the same process of combining temp with coconut oil to make an infuse coconut oil as well before mixing the two [Music] [Music] now once both have melted just give it a quick stir take it off the heat and when it's warm to the touch here's where you can also add essential oils if you want to change the aroma of the body butter I personally like the natural coconut and chocolatey scent so I left it as is but there are a lot of ways to complement these smells such as with coffee or peppermint finally storing a cool place for it to solidify and now you have a softer and quicker melting infused body butter and that's it", "tjZ-qDLeid0": "welcome back to another edition of our cannabis vlog series with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be discussing a topic that i've been thinking about quite a bit this week and that is hemp flour versus cbd extract so there's been a lot of products that have emerged recently on the market that i believe are to cater for cannabis consumers people like myself who enjoy the consumption experience now have a bit of a choice when it comes to getting our cbd that moves away from the traditional oils bombs and other topicals right i've actually got an example of both here this is hemp flower you can find this online you can find it in several shops in the uk and this is what it looks like and then this is cbd extract the example i've got here is the goods lemon drop cbd shatter which is 99 cannabidiol today i'm going to discuss the pros and cons of cbd flour okay hemp flour and cbd extract aka cbd dabs just to try and figure out which suits who you know like what is going to make this suitable for you or this suitable for you let's discuss that right here so flower pros when it comes to hemp flour you can roll this up and smoke it with your regular weed you can also roll it up in place of your regular weed you can put it into a vaporizer and all of those things make it seem very natural to cannabis consumers so for people that are already smoking weed regularly then adding cbd weed into your diet your your cannabinoid consumption isn't going to present any challenges or really feel any different you'll notice a difference in flavor indeed there are different flavor profiles in the hemp world as well but typically you may notice that it is less flavoursome than your high thc strains um but you will be able to naturally gel with it as a weed product right just looks the same there are different hemp strains with different cannabidiol content so there is actually stuff out there that will suit you as a newer consumer or someone that needs a lot of cbd for their medical conditions so you can get cbd flower up to about 20 cbd i think i've seen and this overall means that it is a really natural feeling product right so really easy to transition or to add it into our existing consumption cbd extract on the other hand really really cool to get the dosage requirements that you can get when it comes to cbd extract so you can literally take your gram and portion it up into 10 or 20 evenly sized portions and then you know exactly how much cannabidiol bearing in mind that this has 990 milligrams of cannabidiol in this pot so that makes it really super easy to uh to deal with dosing much more easily than it is to deal with dosing when it comes to hemp flour right another awesome thing about cbd extracts is the ability to imbue them with these lovely terpene profiles so this one is lemon drop and it just smells like sweet sicilian lemons and you can really play about and get some awesome terpene profiles in the cbd world another benefit to cbd extract which hits less with cbd flour unless you vaporize it is the bio availability of the vaporized compounds that you get when you dab versus the amount of cannabinoids that you get when you smoke so if you smoke something you're actually absorbing sort of 10 to 20 percent of the cannabinoids whereas when you vaporize you're absorbing 80 to 90 percent of the cannabinoids so if you put these in contrast and you smoked this and you vaporize this then you would be getting more cannabidiol from the extract right even if they had the same amount of milligrams consumed you would absorb more into your body with the vaporization so that is a really key positive point for cbd extract it's also a tried and tested method of delivery for cannabis consumption so you can either put it into a vape pen or a dab rig both consumption methods have been used for years and both of them are prized by medical patients for fast and effective cannabinoid delivery and of course it's much healthier to not burn your material if you can help it and that is why vaporizing extract is a healthier consumption method than smoking flour so we've talked about the benefits of both consumption methods but of course there are some drawbacks to both as well so i'm going to discuss that before we make our final verdict the first drawback to hemp flower and one which is always on my mind is that this still sits in a legal gray area so the law never changed to make an exception for cbd flower and people sold it and continued to sell it on the assumption that it contains little to no thc therefore is defined as heaven but the legal gray area does make it quite tricky to operate in the market with some cbd flower sellers being raided by the police in reality this is unlikely to affect you as a consumer so you don't have to worry so much consuming cbd flowers but just know that that distinction doesn't exist in the law another drawback to consuming only hemp flour versus consuming the extract is that you're not going to have an idea of the accurate dosage like you would if you took another consumption method when you smoke flour and particularly when i smoke flour i just grind up a few buds put it into a joint and smoke it it's a really enjoyable experience but i'm not thinking about how many cannabinoids i'm putting into my body that is something to think about for medical patients and why they might opt to consume the cbd extract instead another really key point when it comes to hemp flour is that the cannabidiol content is going to vary from batch to batch just because you smoked it once a long time ago and there was an awesome amount of cbd and doesn't mean that it will have that exact amount again and there are actually some processes where people either spray can abu dial onto the buds or they can remove the other cannabinoids to make it come down to the legal limit as well so there are some practices which you might not be aware of which might put you off when it comes to hemp flour the cannabinoids and terpenes really really nicely so that covers the drawbacks of the hemp flour so let's talk about the extract one of the things that i think is important to mention when it comes to cbd extract is often not always but often you will find that it is made from isolated compounds and broad spectrum terpenes and cannabinoids have been added right so when this is extracted to its pure form this is extracted all the way through to pure cannabidiol from hemp plants grown out in europe so they've taken away the other compounds left the cannabidiol behind and then added in the terpenes and their broad spectrum wax which is 80 cbd also offers additional minor compounds minor cannabinoids making it broad spectrum rather than isolate but it's worth thinking about that this is full spectrum right so a little bit of thc and a lot of balance of all different stuff and then this is an extract so the pure cannabidiol there is a flip side to this obviously from a medicinal perspective you know what you're getting with the cannabidiol and that's a really good thing for patients another drawback to extracts on the cbd side is that you have the potential for low quality because it's a newer industry and growing all the time there are going to be some extracts out there which don't taste as great and particularly when i got started in the world of cbd extracts i wasn't enjoying the flavor so much this year however i've been impressed with the goods flavor profile and i know there are some other awesome companies working on terpene blends and really cool stuff that you can explore so the the high quality extracts are there as well consuming extract also requires another piece of equipment so either a v8 pen or a dab rig as i mentioned with the tried and tested consumption methods however this does make it a little bit more expensive to get started and you will have to buy yourself at least an entry-level product to be able to consume the extract unless you want to just put it in with your joints but then you will be burning it and therefore wasting some of the cbd and finally the extract may feel a little bit less natural to old-school smokers i'm talking the guys and girls that have been smoking joints for 30 years haven't really tried out other consumption methods this is a newer way to consume cannabis right and it doesn't look like it did in its herbal form so it feels less natural to people that have never tried it but once you take the plunge it can be a very enjoyable experience so what is my verdict when it comes to consuming hemp flour or cbd extract which should you pick it's going to depend entirely on you and your motivations but there are clearly some benefits and some drawbacks to both i personally really like consuming the cbd dabs in the morning they're a really good start to the day but i also find myself smoking and vaping cbd flour from time to time so there are benefits to both you know it's really nice to mix them sometimes as well during the day and have a bit of both in different sessions so i find it difficult to pick i really like the flavor profiles and i really like this sort of clear-headed feeling that i get when i consume cbd extracts which is very noticeable for something that's not psychotropic both forms of consumption are entirely valid but you'll get a clearer dosage with cbd extract i'll buy both i'll have both in my medicine cabinet and i will consume both of them but i want to know what your thoughts are on the subject do you smoke hemp flour do you dab cbd extract have you tried both and what is your preference please leave your comments below and we'll be joining the discussion and as always if you've enjoyed this video hit that thumbs up it helps us grow subscribe to the channel for more and i'll be back with another video early next week thank you for watching keep talking and i'll see you on the other side [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you", "NXNPDILjQ94": "[Music] hey everybody due to YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello everybody and welcome back to your query cannabis in today's video I'm gonna be making cinnamon flavored CBD oil but first before we get into today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here and you've already subscribed don't forget to give the video a thumbs up and I really do appreciate you guys supporting our channel so today we're gonna be making a cinnamon flavored CBD oil now the first ingredient of course is going to be our hemp flour that we grew this summer and today we're going to be using our cherry wine have flour so this came in at 17.4% CBD so we'll be doing 13 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour per cup so a total of 26 grams of d carb hemp flour but and today's recipe I will be adding cherry wine shake or trim now this is just trim buzz the sugar leaves or buds that fell off during the trim bag process and these are great to add CBD a now CBD a is the raw plant material so when it's d carved it removes the a and then you just have regular old CBD that we're all familiar with CBD a has its own good properties so we are going to be adding about 4 grams of raw material on top of the D kar material and as you just heard the oven is preheated so is that 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to put it in for 30 minutes so while we're waiting for the D carve our I'm gonna gather all the materials in the magic butter machine get that all set up so we can start making our flavored CBD oil 10 grams of cherry wine trim or shake whatever you want to call it this is raw plant material that is not decarboxylated and I'll get our decarboxylated hemp flour in a minute so I did 5 grams per cup of MCT oil so the first time add that material right into the magic butter machine next I'm going to measure out two cups of MCT oil okay so that's 2 cups now I'm going to add our cinnamon now this is all-natural ground cinnamon and you really don't want to overpower it now is the cinnamon going to eliminate the plant flavor no it's definitely going to knock it down but it's not going to taste like a big red or anything like that ok and I do just about a half a spoonful and right into the machine it goes now machine has a blender and a grinder so don't have to mix it around or anything like that now I'm going to go ahead and grab our D carved hemp flour now that's 26 grams of our cherry one head flower at 17.4% cvd so and it goes I can never get all the buds into the magic butter machine without losing a couple of them ok get this out of here and that's the recipe folks and of course I will leave the recipe down in the description below we're going to plug in our magic bard machine get it ready to go all right and we are going to do 160 degrees for 4 hours so I'll see you in four hours and I'll show you the finished product okay so it's been four hours and it's time to get the product out of the magic butter machine so stereotypical magic butter machine style you know you've got to get all the plant material off the base of the blender you know nothing crazy but you don't want to lose that material or at least try the best you can to get it off you're gonna do the same thing on the container you can see in there all that plant material so it's gonna get that all out of here all right looks good now again if you're using another kitchen gadget you know it really depends how messy you want things well that's why I like the magic butter machine so we're going to get our magic butter micron filter and put that into our four cup Pyrex and dump it in you know see if we can get all that out of here again the reason why you want all this plant material is the more you can get in this micron bag the squeeze the more will you're gonna get out of it because all this plant material has got oil in it okay it looks pretty good for now we're gonna get the love gloves silicone gloves just shake it down we're going to give it to squeeze you can see all that material coming out of there all that oil coming out of there so I'm excited to give this a go I know it's gonna be great in some like chai tea stuff like that that cinnamon really holds some good flavor again it doesn't get rid of the plant taste but it definitely covers it a little bit so that's it for today guys I really hope you enjoyed this video hope you use this recipe to your advantage and before we close out the video I want to remind everybody you can find us on Instagram and Facebook now I'll leave those links in the description below along with the recipe that I use today and thank you for watching if you haven't subscribed yet please do don't

Patel where I answer your questions about medical marijuana and CBD oil now today's question comes in from Amica of Las Vegas Nevada and here's what she writes dr. Patel my eczema is out of control I've had it since I was probably 9 or 10 years old and I'm now 29 and still dealing with it my nights consist of insane scratching it's incredibly annoying I literally wake up with new scars and scabs nearly daily because of the flares when I stress it flares the most sweat triggers it too and it takes 30 minutes to get home from the gym so my eczema gets really bad in the winter time I don't have the luxury of taking hot showers I can't wear foundation and feel so embarrassed about the patches of dry flaky and inflamed skin I feel like people think I have some sort of contagious disease I've tried everything you can think of from lotions to creams even dangerous photo therapy and essential oils that are supposed to help egg them up but the eczema just keeps getting worse my dermatologist keeps prescribing steroids but they only work temporarily and I can't deal with the side effects would you recommend either CBD oil or marijuana do either of them work thanks in advance Anika Las Vegas Nevada all right Anika I imagine that having eczema must be an incredibly frustrating experience but I'm really glad that you wrote in because believe it or not there's actually research that shows that medical cannabis does help eczema now in addition to walking you through this now in addition to walking you through the medical research I'll also walk you through the results that my own patients have experienced so a human trial done back in so a human trial so a human trial done back in about the mid 2000s had patients between the ages of 2 and 70 with a top dermatitis which is otherwise known as which is otherwise known as eczema use an endocannabinoid cream over a period of six weeks now a human trial done back in the mid 2000s had it now a human trial done back in the mid 2000s had patients between the ages of 2 and 70 with with atopic dermatitis which is otherwise known as eczema use an endocannabinoid cream over a period of six weeks and here are the results that they reported so 70% saw an improvement in the following symptoms dryness excoriation which is skin picking essentially like henna fication which is which is when you develop thick leathery skin from from too much scratching and too much rubbing scaling which is flaking of the skin scaling which is flaking of the skin redness itching as well as an improvement in the quality of their sleep now thirty three point six percent of patients completely discontinued their use of topical steroids and in ten percent of patients the strength of the steroid was reduced significantly twenty percent of participants were able to stop their topical immunomodulators and 38 percent stopped using their oral antihistamines so what are some of the results that my patients have experienced well patient well patients with patches of eczema generally benefit from using cannabis topicals however patients with more extensive eczema really ultimately end up using some internal form of cannabis whether it's inhalation ingestion or using it sublingual II which is under the tongue now for some patients the cannabis completely clears up their skin and then for other patients it minimises redness flakiness itching and irritation however bear in mind that these changes don't occur overnight it may take up to two to four weeks to see the changes overall though my patients have experienced a reduction in the number of flares overall my patients have seen a reduction in the number of eczema flares that they experience now on the prescription front many patients are many of my patients now on the prescription front many of my patients are able to either eliminate or reduce the use of topical steroids topical immunomodulators and/or oral antihistamines so now on the prescription front now on the prescription front many of my now on the prescription front now on the prescription front many of my patients are able to either eliminate or reduce the use of the or reduce the use of their topical steroids topical immunomodulators in or oral antihistamines now before you go off and start you know stockpiling on cannabis topicals here's what i want to tell you you want to ensure that you don't end up reacting you don't you don't you want to ensure that you don't end up reacting to one of the other ingredients in a cannabis topical so test the product on a small area before you apply it all over and I'd also recommend that you watch out for ingredients that may exacerbate eczema and I also recommend that you watch out for ingredients that may exacerbate eczema such as parabens fragrances dyes lanolin formaldehyde etc all right so what's going alright so what's going on why is that that cannabis actually helps relieve the symptoms of eczema well it's possible that the endocannabinoid used in the in the medical study that I mentioned that it's possible that the endocannabinoid cream used in the study reduces the inflammatory response by way of the cannabinoid receptors in addition medical studies have also shown that when topical cannabinoids interact with cannabinoid receptors on the skin it significantly reduces histamine induced itch and vasodilation now just so you know histamine is a now just so you know histamine is a compound you know now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in reaction now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in reaction to go it in response to okay now just so you know histamine is a compound released by the cells in our body in response to an allergic or an inflammatory reaction and it ends up causing vaso to and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is vasodilation and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is known as vasodilation as I just mentioned which is enough and it ends up causing and it ends up causing swelling of your blood vessels which is known as a vasodilation alright

having me here today I'm very very excited my sister my late sister was diagnosed with RSD back in 2006 and I called I called one of my dearest and closest friends who's a leading neurologist in the country dealing with pain and actually with headaches and migraines and whatnot and he's in Dallas Texas by the way and he just kind of laughed and he's like yeah she's sure uh-huh well when I told him I was doing this conference 2018 go ahead 12 years he started saying oh there's some excellent research on this and so congratulations to all your organization's and the tireless work you've done to push for education and research in this area to legitimize the suffering that otherwise people looked and judged so I take my hats off to all of you for that and I'd like to thank Michelle McBride for thinking of me as to come here and share the message of what we've been doing aiyyo aiyyo Nantz Elda's which is a R&D company we've been making products for over seven years now to treat serious diseases we use that research and all the data we've been collecting on patients to then fund preclinical and clinical trials around the world through Zelda therapeutics so I've been like taking what we learned here and then trying to legitimize it in such a way with actual real research that doctors and government officials will not poopoo as not real science you're welcome and then one of our nurses we have Kellis bring wellness which is a medical practice that we started a number of years ago to Train medical professionals on understanding and working with the endocannabinoid system which is the an endogenous system within our bodies that exist that that is not taught about in medical school so can you imagine going to medical school in your physician and you put all your your studies and your work and maybe you're in your 40s and you're still paying off student loans and all of a sudden they tell you there's this entire system that's job as to as to encourage homeostasis within the systems in your body and they didn't ever bother to teach you about it so a lot of doctors saying well it doesn't exist and then the doctors that have more of the scientific bend to them and aren't just tradesmen they're the ones say I want to know and I want to learn about this so our medical professionals have been they work with patients they actually work along with your other physicians to help to accentuate the care you get so that you can have understanding of this system because it's not about the cannabis itself it's about how the cannabis works within your body and what is actually happening in its real science in its real chemistry and so I'm gonna take you on that journey now so the first thing that I want to I want to say is that and anyone that's ever heard me speak is I always start with this slide because I think it's so important because if your sources of information our Facebook we used to call them the yahoo groups but I don't even know if they exist anymore but you know Instagram or or just in general going online Twitter etc what you're gonna see is that cannabis is a panacea that it cures cancer that it cures this that it's you know you don't you throw out your other treatments I've had we have a specialty in in cancer and in particular in Pediatrics and I've had parents come to me and say that they were getting really really negative postings on their pages because they decided to go ahead and do concurrent treatments integrated treatments of chemo therapies and radiations even though these things have been shown to be very effective and when they're done in conjunction with cannabinoids people are like if you're doing cannabis you need to reject these others and that's just not true because cannabis is not in fact a panacea it is amazing amazing amazing what it's good for but it's also there's a whole lot of things that it just doesn't touch I'll give you one an example DIPG which is there's a lot of health care professionals here in the room so I think that you'll understand that this is a type of cancer that's on it's in it's at the brainstem and there are no cannabinoid receptors in the brain stem which is very good and bad in one hand you cannot overdose from cannabis a fatal excuse me you can overdose and feel like crap for a few hours and wish you were dead but anyone who's ever taken in edible can can attest to that but right but you can there's no fatal overdose because there are no receptors so you cannot flood them an overdose on that now here I'm showing you a list of conditions a wonderful resource and I understand Martin Lee was here in one of your previous conferences the founder of project CBD and at the bottom of their pages they list the medical conditions that we have really solid evidence based on it working for that doesn't mean it only works for those and it doesn't mean it's gonna work for you if that happens to be your diagnosis but this is a good starting point on that now here's a listing of state approved conditions if you live for example in in Illinois then CRPS is listed as an approved condition specifically if you happen to live in Arizona it's not if you happen so if we have very very unequal access to medicine based upon legislative decisions that are being made on what constitutes medicine in a in a viable option for patients and what doesn't so it's very important that you use your voice in your pen to contact whoever the people are that sit on your whenever your boards are whether it's a governmental board City Council County Council etc to to fight for your right to use whatever medicine that your doctor deems beneficial now in California were very fortunate that when the wording was put together for the Compassionate Use Act where we've been using cannabis successfully now in Canada in California as a medicine and not the wink wink it's a meta but a real medicine option for many many many patients if it's been left up to the discretion of the medical professional to decide if a patient can or cannot benefit potentially from cannabis so you know think about that in terms of of gabapentin neurontin let's look at neurontin it is being used off-label more than it's being used on label yet your doctor doesn't have to go to a guide on and say am I allowed to prescribe this well let me call my let me call the the legislator from my district and find out if it's okay if I prescribed the doctor gets to be the doctor in California we give them the respect of knowing more about the body than the people sitting in the government officials are now and I want to go ahead and make a now since January first our whole world has changed with regulated system here in California now that we have adult use so in the past it was required that you went to what I call a doc in the box because to me it was just kind of a swindle that you paid your thirty five to a hundred two hundred dollars and some doctor who couldn't make it as a doctor would write a prescription and say yeah write the equivalent excuse me of a recommendation and say yeah I think you'll benefit just you know usually they would send it to you before they even seen you I mean it was really kind of a scam like situation but it was how people could legally use it and and and and have the opportunity to even acquire it through a dispensary as of January 1st if you are over 21 years old and you have a federally issued government ID you can walk into any dispensary in California and buy cannabis as long as it is a in aid area where adult use is allowed I live for example out in Bodega Bay which is unincorporated Sonoma County Sonoma County has only recognized medical it did not it has not set up laws yet for the opening of any dispensaries or any kind of products that are for medical use and there are some issues I mean but then they have things like Sebastopol that has allowed for adult use in Santa Rosa that has allowed you so I mean it we really do still have to navigate through the system to either get our cards if we live in an area where we you know it's almost being penalized for living in an area that doesn't allow adult use or we can just go into any dispensary and get it now if it's in an area that does allow it the further complication though is that the products and the medicines that are available on the adult use side are not the same products that are available on the medical side so you cannot walk in as a patient without a card or without a recommendation letter and say I want to get the medical products over there they'll say sorry those are only available for the people that have those cards you only can pick from these and the adult use ones do not tend to be the products that I would necessarily recommend for most of the people that are looking to have cannabis be a medicine and not a lifestyle so we have a lot more work to do it's brand-new everything is still in a state of flux so hopefully at the end of the day we'll have more options for everybody here in California so the common symptoms obviously nobody here needs me to tell you nobody needs me to tell you what the symptoms are of this debilitating in chronic condition but it is of course the chronic intense pain that's out of proportion to the severity of the injury and that's I think the most important part is because that's like and I loved that Harry Potter thing of yes of course it's in your brain and so you know of course it's in your brain but everything that you feel is in your brain it doesn't mean that it's not legitimate and so the the cycle of pain and I you know I threw this in here I could have put in here I actually thought about putting insult instead of injury because it can be something as simple as a pinprick that does not seem like an injury it just seems like an occurrence of something an insult to your skin and then it turns into something else but you have the pain you know the injury it causes the pain then you can't sleep and then you have more stress and then you have more pain and then you have orders the injury causes more stress and then you have can't sleep and then you have more pain or is the stress what has you in a position where you're more vulnerable and you experience the injury in a way that maybe you wouldn't have if you hadn't had that stress initially that can then result in the pain in the sleep I taught a class recently on chronic pain and I spent I would say I spent about three-quarters of the talk on sleep and people like while you're talking about sleep this is a pain class and Psyche you don't sleep you're gonna hurt and whatever hurt you have is going to be magnified and like I said I mean hearing this earlier speakers I was so awed by how open-minded these particular physicians and therapists are and I'm gonna definitely be referring patients to them in the future so here is the just information that I found that I thought was very interesting this was a study that was done I believe they surveyed 11,000 people and they were looking at other what other alternative treatments they had tried for pain and you know everything from massage prayer yoga meditation I would say prayer and meditation probably are not so dissimilar yet it's interesting that you know the percentage of people that perceive them in one way or the other and then of course cannabis eighteen percent had tried of this 11,000 and here are the people who said that it actually helped to relieve their pain these are you know obviously massage has been very helpful but a problem with massage and for a lot of people is you have a massage you feel great then you get in your car and drive home and the act of driving home puts you back in the pain state so if you could just get those therapists to come to your house every day would all be good but then cannabis as you see there was an 80% said that they found some level of relief using cannabinoid therapies I mean this is amazing number I mean think about it you know what are the results of using and sense how many people are finding you know significant really with gabapentin or or you know Botox injections for just I mean how many people are really getting the results and if 80 percent can get results with this it's something that we didn't really need to give a more serious look at so here are some of the more common non-surgical treatments for CRPS and I was looking at some of these I was looking through and I'm like yep yep yep yep yep all these and that starts looking at the side effects oh my god the liver damage the kidney damage the the inability to drive a car because you're too medicated and you're you know you're drooling you're you know you're in a chair because you can't get up and walk and you have to worry about having someone support you because you're gonna tip over from having you know that fentanyl patch I mean that sort of thing I mean it's really really unfortunate that these are still the options that are available right now from the pharmaceutical industry we need to encourage them to actually do more research especially on the orphan orphan conditions that so many of us are faced with so in states now this is an interesting slide because in states where cannabis has been legalized they have shown that there has been and I can't read on this thing here but there been over 1800 less prescriptions that are being written for pain medications in those days you know everybody talks about the opioid crisis and all this and that and it's if doctors don't have any other options what are they gonna do because frankly when a patient walks into an office you go see your doctor and you're going to go for a visit and you say I've got this terrible situation I mean I'm suffering that it uh and you walk out without a piece of paper with the prescription or it was something that's been you know electronically sent over to your pharmacy you're gonna feel like oh he didn't do anything for me or she didn't do anything for me well reality is so they end up oh it didn't work will they add another drug they don't take one away they just add another and then you have people that are on 10 drugs 11 drugs 20 drugs and all these things and so they have no quality of life and yet they're suffering still just the same because you know where a lot of these things are fine if you've got acute conditions when you have chronic it just doesn't make a difference but it also has been a major major significant change in sleep drugs that are being prescribed for I'm sure that the drugs company drug companies are not thrilled that less opioids and and you know less ambien and lehre are being written for but the fact is that they are and also in depression and anxiety there's been incredible reduction in prescriptions having to be written for these conditions when you put cannabis as an option into the mix so as I said here chronic chronic pain is in fact the disease itself and that's what we're all facing here is it's a legitimate thing that has no reasonable purpose for being anymore it just is on its own and it has become the disease and with this being you know the types of areas where people will have their symptoms and their pain from CRPS this is in fact a very very high level area of showing that the cannabinoid receptors in our body that are perfectly placed to helped us to funk function excuse me help us to address these using cannabinoids okay so I want to go through here just showing you a little bit of the literature not I'm this is a tiny little look through it obviously if you want more I'm always available to to send it your way but the the National Academy of Sciences did a very very extensive study they brought in all sorts of medical professionals specialists Donald Abrams for example from UCSF who's an oncologist and integrative medicine specialist they brought in all sorts of other people to look at all the existing litter out there and all the studies that have been done now cannabis day everybody says oh there just isn't any information it is probably the most studied drug in history if you look at certain I'm trying to think of what the drug was I think it was like ambien there was like 400 studies you look at cannabis there's over 10,000 studies that have been done on it we do know what needs to what works and what doesn't work but what they found is and this group was extraordinarily conservative I disagree with quite a bit of what's in there as far as what they have discounted his research as a researcher myself I see okay you guys are splitting some hairs here it's coming it's coming from a yes but instead of a and so but the one thing that they did say that was so exciting is that cannabis does in fact work and has been proven and we can use the word proven now to be effective against chronic pain in adults it also happens to work in kids but it also in dolt that's where the studies have been done and so this is really really good news for all of us to be able to have the legitimization of this so that we can actually go to our doctors and ask for help now the this is from the European Journal that the impact factor is not quite as high on this one there were a couple of things in the study that I took issue with as far as the way that they that they showed how the receptors are actually located within the body but the reality is even with that they showed that when you use a synthetic agonist to the on the CB one sees me CB 2 that it actually gets rid of a lot of the pain that you have and a lot of the issues especially aroused onea it's amazing what it can do just by stimulating these receptors the cb2 receptors the cb2 receptors I'll get into in a minute is more closely associated with the microglial and the inflammation because it is the ones that you know if we go back to that that body where I showed the receptors they're the ones that are associated with the immune system and immune response so the fact that they were there doing work to get rid o to blot to see if we if we activate these receptors is it going to work to help the pain in CRPS and the answer is yes and then this last one here it's showing that Ananda mic levels and and amide is an endogenous cannabinoids that we all have within our bodies you know the body is an amazing thing but it didn't it doesn't have a system within it because someday that people might smoke weed you know it just doesn't work that way we have the natural it's within our body and we have endogenous cannabinoids in other words internally within our bodies we have some cb1 receptors we have cb2 receptors that we know of so far there's more work going on some people have looked at GPR 55 it turns out it's not a receptor but we have two identified endogenous cannabinoids at this point one of them is known as an and amide which comes from the Sanskrit for bliss and one of them is to AG and so these are the things within our bodies that are produced naturally you know we talked about breast milk being so important for for newborns well the one of the reasons that breast milk is so important is because it boosts the immune system because of all of the inand amide that is in the breast milk so it makes a bit so people that say oh cannabis is bad for babies they're having it from the time they're there in the womb and and they're being born it's there it's there sort of their sustenance so you know it's just a matter of demystifying it i think that'll help people along in understanding that the endogenous cannabinoids when they are activated and you have that anywhere you have a source of pain and I'll get into that diagram in a minute you have this the presence of these receptors so you have something to target you also are showing in this case where there's an injury that you have the more production of the inand amide which is the endogenous cannabinoids that I mentioned previously so that you have all these ways that is naturally the body is trying to fight it's trying to create the homeostasis or the balance within your body with the with the in Dodge cannabinoids alright so the activation of the cb1 receptors I want to show you it I want to take you through right here this is a this is showing imagine this being coming from wherever the source of the pain is and this being at your it's your spinal cord this is you know neuron one neuron two presynaptic postsynaptic so you have here that when you have the when you have the pain that occurs when you have the injury or the insult to you that occurs what happens is it then releases these in here are your little all your a lot of neurotransmitters so you have here you have the calcium ion pump and the calcium is released which then takes the neurotransmitters they end up then going as part of the actual outside membrane of the neuron they drop down this and it tells that goes down into the into the spinal cord down into the base of your spinal cord and then takes you through and it goes back up then to your brain and it repeats it and it tells you pain pain pain well the cb1 receptor here this thing that looks like a radiator this is actually the cb1 receptor that is that is when the cannabinoids are the endogenous cannabinoids like lean and amide it'll actually activate the cb1 in a healthy person it'll activate the cb1 receptor here in this case in which case what it does is it's the most fascinating thing because it's on the outside of the brain of this of the neuron it'll actually do something that's just not really heard of it's kind of like salmon swimming upstream and that is that it sends the signal back from the post to the pre and it says nope I don't accept that I don't accept that and it keeps the the neurotransmitters from being released so that you don't end up having this pain the cascade that occurs so it actually it's like nope not going to happen don't accept don't accept it the problem is so one of us when we're in Roy's severe pain in the chronic we don't have we have insufficiency within our body to tackle this which is why we have to have exogenous cannabinoids or phyto cannabinoids plant-based cannabinoids or external same way if you were vitamin C deficient you might take a supplement you might drink lots of orange juice if your vitamin d3 you'll take if you don't get enough sunlight and you don't have the ability to you might take a supplement if you think of it in terms of just using something outside the body just that normally is within the body but that you don't have enough of you'll see that it's very very it makes perfect sense why it works it's just something that activates the receptors which is what we're trying to do is what everything is about activation of receptors it's not about getting high it's not about THC doesn't get you high the activation of the cb1 receptors in your brain if you take over a therapeutic dose is what gets you high okay so let's let's be very clear the same way that if you take a therapeutic dose of anything you might feel a little bit better but you're not going to feel altered until you take too much so that's something to keep in mind with this so go a little bit further in there's there's four different ways that that cannabinoids can help to reduce pain okay all of our cells okay we have all those cells have the ability to experience pain and cause this now if you think about this as this is the epithelial cells all of our skin cells you have you know your joints you have all these different parts of your GI tract and then here is the neuron that it's descending out and here's where it sends that first signal so if we go back to that same that other slide this is I'm gonna be talking about this area here and what's happening okay so by blocking by blocking the release of the calcium ion pump and by stopping the neuro transmission from taking place we're actually to be able to reduce the pain perception because it doesn't make it to the pain perception area in your brain it's like if you know if you if a tree falls in the forest does nobody is there to hear it we'll make a sound well it's the there can be the pain but if the signal can't get to the brain you will not have the perception of that of that pain which is why having it in your head yes it is in your head that is where all pain is actually experienced well even though this all happens very very quickly and it doesn't appear that way the second way that it works is these cb2 receptors that are also on the cells and we have found that anywhere where there's an injury or there's any kind of damage or into a to a cell these cb2 receptors are present all right so you'll have something to do we have something to target on them and what they do is they reduce inflammation and they stop the microglia so I appreciated one of our previous speakers talking about the microglia and how there you know there's limited options but there is one more option in your toolbox I loved what he was saying and what the thing is but this is something to be done to be considered also when you're dealing with this now third way the in fourth way is the first thing here is you've got the mood control area of the brain where you have receptors and if you can stimulate those the THC you're gonna have more or or any of the other ones that that that stimulate the cb1 then you're going to have an increased sense of euphoria which is very important because people with with chronic pain I don't have to tell you guys the depression and the anxiety in the in the lack of motivation and all that goes right along with that is enormous and if you have the option to have something that's going to keep you in a better mood why wouldn't you without taking mood altering pharmaceuticals that have a list this long of negative side effects beyond the fact that you might be too stoned for a couple hours right and then of course this is one that I think is truly one of the most important and that's the reduction in the short-term memory because there's also the receptors within the memory control area of our brains so you know the fight-or-flight the you know chased by the tiger kind of of way of existing in the world that anyone that has chronic pain understands it's like this constant you get stuck in this loop of pain and it you do freeze with it often times but this is an opportunity to break that professor Rafael Missoula who was the first one who identified the endocannabinoid system and isolated THC and CBD is components of it and is still doing amazing research at 85 years old or 86 years old in Israel he talked about the gift of forgetting and you know sometimes we'll treat patients and I'll say after a little while say how's your pain and they'll say you know what I forgot about it for a while that is awesome that is a huge success to just have a break from constantly having the pain be the thing that you that is driving your life just so simply by having that those receptors activated we find with our veteran community and I'm curious if anybody knows have there been any increased cases of CRPS with combat vets that have gone on multiple tours over and over and over does anyone have any data or research on that I think would be interesting to look at yes hand back there right okay I would I would bet that a lot of these people are not being diagnosed with it and that the PTSD is as part of the symptom it's also if this could be the stress trigger that we talked about before from some sort of insult or explosion or damaging things that they've been experiencing and then they have this this constant recurrence of the memories and the thoughts around the incident and the injury and it go then it becomes this this this vicious cycle that they can't get out of where with that reason that PTSD is so effectively treated with cannabinoids is because it interrupts that fight-or-flight and it gives them a chance to just be at the same time increasing their mood through this euphoria by removing the negative thoughts okay so I want to look at what to look for in your medicine okay this is very important and then actually for the people in California in particular I want to stress that lab testing is now required by law yes I would say I would encourage you to take pictures of this to take it to you if you do decide to go to a dispensary or contact me you know because obviously we can take care of anybody in the state of California that it's important to understand that all cannabis is not the same when I first started working with cannabis and I came to this just so you know initially I used to be personally on I was on 26 pharmaceuticals one of them was fentanyl patch I was on neurontin I was on I mean you name it it was disgusting how many drugs I was on and so I had decided when I was going to become a grandmother for the first time that it was time to get my life back because they weren't helping with the pain that's the thing is you just add these drugs and you're still suffering so it's like why am I taking all these so I went through all the process of detoxing off of all these horrible medications and was still suffering but I was like at least I had my clear mind so that I could handle it because when you're you're in a fog from opioids and some of these other drugs it's hard to actually meditate and get on top of it and do yoga and do some of these things and we've got so much good evidence showing that that using some of these other these other tools that we have like meditation yoga etc can really really help to reduce the pain but when you're on all these medications it's hard sometimes to do that so I was looking at and then my husband who has now been sober for 29 years we had broken his back yeah and he needed and he needed to have back surgery and he refused to if it meant going on opioids because the opioids that they go on you don't ever get off of them it becomes that's what you know it's it's for acute treatment and they treat them like they're for a chronic because they have nothing else so they just throw them at you so we started investigating cannabis as an option I was very skeptical at first I mean I was one of those people that thought marijuana was a drug just like you know heroin or anything else and I was shocked my first reaction when I tried it is I was furious I was furious that it had been all these years and I've been to all these medical professionals in states where it was legal and not one of them had mentioned it as an option to me I was like how can you let me suffer and and have you know gain weight from all the drugs and all the things that I mean all the horrible side effects and and not do anything not just say you know what have you tried cannabis so we want to make sure that that is not something of faith that anybody else has to and that's when we started investigating and doing research into this so I want to tell you there are when I first started there was about there's 125 approximately what they call landrace strings now these are medicines that grew in the wild of Afghanistan and Mexico and Colombia and Hawaii and in all these different places you know if any of the old-timers like me you've got like you know Acapulco gold you know cush you know you got you know Panama red I mean these were the land race trains these are the ones that were identified very very closely and they're phenomenal medicines when used abused correctly of course I don't have anything against people using it in adult use and whatever but it's just not the same industry I'm in it's like saying you know I'm gonna make myself a salad or I'm a with a tomato or I'm a pasta chef and I'm gonna make You mayor and era I mean they both use Tomatoes but they're completely different so I you know it's it's it's stigmatized for all the wrong reasons and that's just propaganda from the government but when you look at those 125 medications because of you know the cannabis has been around and being used medicinally for over 5,000 years there's evidence of it even further back in Chinese medical texts looking at some of the treatments from some of the healers that we were using back then there's even evidence in tomes where they actually show cannabis that was buried along for their journey to the next world but back about a hundred years ago the propaganda war started in the United States that then spread throughout the world that demonized this as a is a bad thing and it's not so we're really about a hundred years behind where we could be because during that time the only people then that we're using cannabis for the most part were the people that we're using it recreationally and so they started breeding programs to increase the THC the tetrahydrocannabinol which is in fact the the part of it that's actually extremely important over seventy percent of our patients would either be suffering or not alive today if they did not have access to THC I am so against the CBD only laws they are selfish they're wrong they're ignorant and they they hurt people tremendously the problem though is all these all these different cannabis plants out there they started these breeding programs where you had all this high THC because it was just about people getting high smoking and getting high and so a lot of the other we've got n think they've identified about a hundred and twenty three I thinks the last time I looked different individual cannabinoids within the the plant itself they were being reduced you only have a hundred percent so if you have your THC up at 30 percent and everything else has to be divided between you know four to five hundred terpenes chlorophyll plant matter cellulose and other cannabinoids you're not going to have much room for other other compounds within it since we've had legalization in one form or another for the last twenty plus years now you have more breeding programs that have started to shift that and so now you have more of your CBD your cannabidiol and your CBG you know can have a gyro and some of the other compounds that within the plant that also have really important medicinal benefits that are being bred up the other thing is you can always take multiple medicines and take them together to have what you need so you know if you don't find it in one product in particular when I first started doing this there was between two and four depending on who you talk to thousand different breeds of hybrids excuse me and now there's over 12,000 so if you can't find what works for you you're just not looking yeah but the other thing is on the flip side of that is it means hope because you know one of the one of the worst thing that can happen is a patient comes to us and they are they have had or a family member of a patient has come to comes to us which is usually the case in this situation and they say I know that my mother my sister my brother my daughter whatever could benefit from this and we talked to them and they say oh I tried it and it didn't work for me well if you tried it that'd be saying you tried one pharmaceutical and that pharmaceutical didn't work for you so you're never gonna have another pharmaceutical cannabis is no different if you tried one you've tried one that's okay so we know what not to use with you so what I have on this slide here is to show you these are the the most general of the terpenoids and the terpenoids are down here towards the bottom and these are some of the cannabinoids that we have really solid evidence of them having analgesic inflammatory anti-inflammatory or some other aspect that's going to be beneficial to you so when you're looking for products and you're looking for medicine be sure to look for things and ask for things with this and if they do not know what's in the medicine ask to see the lab result and if they won't show you the lab result run go somewhere else go somewhere else very very important now just because one works for you does not mean it's it's gonna work for the person sitting next to you it's individualized medicine and so it is important that you are very proactive and understanding what's in it until you find what works for you now I'm going to just one in particular the pining you have alpha and beta pining and of course the Turpin alene also these all come from the same similar type of terpene and all a terpene is by the way is what you smell or a flavonoid that you taste from a plant that occurs in other plants besides cannabis a cannabinoid or just the ones that are only in kin so it's nothing magical about the words that's just what they're talking about there but pining in particular has have got really significant and it does synergize with the luna Lula little always like what's in lavender Vav have gone for massage and you know there'll be some lavender scent on the pillow and maybe some on a burner and immediately calms you limonene here for example comes from lemons and limes anyone that's ever been kind of down or tired you know you go ahead and you smell a lemon infused anything and it's going to be uplifting so be aware that anything in a small amount is great but the biphasic you can end up having causing the problem that you're trying to sell and thats one of the things that with the pine ends in particular because they do enhance make you hyper aware in cases for example with people with OCD and ADHD they'll use profiles of the medicine that are higher in the pine ian's because it gives them focus but anybody who's in a lot of pain you want to have your focus high but you don't want to have it so high that you're focused completely down into the pain itself so it is a bit of of trial and error just so you're aware of that and if you can work with a medical professional or somebody who acts as like a doula for you to help you to do this it can be beneficial but it's very important that you take copious notes and that you are sure of what's in it so you know what's working and what's not so how much to take this is the question and this is the this is the you know $64,000 question and frankly the answer is I won't know you know what you take may not be anything like what the next person takes but I've done though is because we have data on many thousands of patients that we've been following for many years and with with feedback we know pretty well what's working on average for people that are suffering with chronic pain alright and so the first thing that we suggest is that you use on the THC the the one that does in fact activate the cb1 and cb2 receptors that you a target dose of about 30 grams per day now depending on how you take this some people have an extraordinarily low tolerance and they use like a micro dose in the morning they might use one to two milligrams and then take the rest of it before bed or so that they sleep through most of it and they find that they sleep much more restfully and they wake up feeling better we suggest that you use either something that comes in the form of a sublingual so that you have the higher bioavailability now smoking it is the highest bioavailability but it's also the shortest lasting and it's so I only suggest the smoking for breakthrough symptoms and smoking I would say if you go for a vaporizer product or something like that make sure that they're not adding artificial terpenes that they're not using propylene glycol to thin it so that it goes through the vaporizer product it more easily make sure you're still dealing with pure product and there's a lot of really excellent devices out there for even vaporizing the flowers so that you have the full profile of the medicine when you're actually or vaporizing but it really that the bioavailability goes way way way up and then it goes way down when you take it with sublingually or ingesting it you're gonna have a much slower rise and that's how people get in trouble with edibles they'll say oh I you took it and I didn't feel it so I took more and then it all hits but it takes is like this and then it just kind of stays there for six to eight hours so you're gonna have a much longer term because you don't want you know I've had people come to me that were that we're managing their condition with smoking but I'm like how do you hold a job when every hour you have to run out to your car and get high and then you come back in smelling like you know smelling like a dorm room you know it's not an effective treatment so if you find your plus it makes you too medicated if you're not careful very very easily so it's very important that when you do take it that you take it in a form that's gonna give you a longer term and not have to turn it into your life's your lifestyle and not have to turn it into something that you have to do all day long people do not comply with medications when they have to take them three times the day the way that they do when it's two so you know if you do it in the morning and do it in the end of the day that's really gonna be most beneficial now also in the CBD the cannabinoid this is phenomenal on the other systems within your body it's a weak antagonist for the cb1 and cb2 receptors so it is not it's not like you can say oh I don't want the THC I'll just take the CBD and it'll do the same thing it will not activate the receptors in your body it works on other symptoms within your body but it also is truly one of the most phenomenal options we have as a neuro protectant and an anti-inflammatory agent in fact the federal government has a patent on CBD as a neuro protectant just as a side thing a patient of ours wife had a stroke a couple weeks ago and I said did you give her CBD and he's like oh no I didn't think of it he gave it to it he called me a couple nights ago and he's like thank you so much she's already her face is already better her speech was getting better she's responding much more quickly than she would have and you know in a perfect world every EMT would have some CBD within there in their toolkit on there so that when people do have a stroke or a seizure that they can give it to them very very quickly and hopefully save some of the other damage that's done to the destruction of the peripheral cells and then of course topicals I can't say enough good things about topicals you know just getting the relief through that and there's a nice thing about topicals in particular is you can use it as many times as you want it's not going to get you high it's just not going to I mean if it does I'm gonna take a look at maybe they're being a little bit of a placebo effect that's going on because even though you do have in your epithelial cells you do have the receptors you would have to use an enormous amount I had one patient that was using it on his scalp for precancerous lesions and he swore that he got stoned from it and you know I guess it's I guess it's a subjective thing but I've also had far far more people that have said all I know is it relieved my pain thank you thank you so if you have an option to get a good topical I would suggest it and then the last thing here is I think that we've made these points pretty well obviously it has a lot of medical benefits that I did not go into today but it's a phenomenal thing because if you think about what homeostasis is if you think about having balance within your systems and having them all being regulated properly and this is a system to regulate it and this is the this is the the medicine that can actually make that system work better it just makes perfect sense that that's actually what would work we have to have that available to everybody no matter where they live that they have options to use this medicine in the best way possible and not being legislated to them it's proven to be effective against pain and there's more to cannabis than THC and CBD you have to know about the terpenes and the other cannabinoids that are in there as well but yes we do need more research absolutely 100% and that's it thank you so the question is about the cost it's actually it's a very undemocratic medicine I'm not gonna I'm not going to lie it is there's nothing equal access and not only because of of geographic limitations but also financial limitations it is it is expensive and it is not covered by insurance the beauty of it is you can also grow your own now you're not going to grow top top top quality unless that just happens to be something you're good at but you can grow your own and make some basic tinctures and infusions and topicals out of this medicine if you need to you have the right it to grow it and make it yourself not to give it to anybody else but for your own but as far as the insurance industry Canada is is is leading the way in some ways some of the ways they're crazy and the way they're doing it but one of the things that is is they now have it the the is covered by insurance in Canada so that it's actually is available to more people and I keep hearing more and more about state changing things where you have your health savings account you can actually put money into each year and have it go towards tax deduction pre-tax dollars some places are allowing you to use those pre-tax dollars to buy it but we have a lot more to do and the problem is this is not an FDA track drug this is a nutraceutical track drug and so we're not going to I don't think ever have the kind of acceptance and coverage from the insurance industry I think what's going to happen though is they're gonna start seeing how much money they're saving from having people have access to this medicine instead of opioids and some of the other and and surgeries I mean we have a patient for example not a pain patient he actually has a pair of cellular carcinoma came to us as a 11 year old boy with you know cancer and the doctors at cedars-sinai are saying oh he needs a liver transplant and we're saying actually you can't get rid of cancer by getting rid of the organ it just doesn't work that way and sure enough the family went with the liver transplant and a year later when those same hepatic our cellular carcinoma cells were in his lungs then they came back to us and now this little boy is 14 and he's great he's going to school in fact he just played at the Rose Bowl whatever it is in in LA with Coldplay performing for a fundraiser there so there is for lots and lots of diseases and an insurance company would be nuts because the cost of giving him 125 milligrams a day of CBD and 10 milligrams a day of THC versus a liver transplant and all the supporting pharmaceuticals that are required once you have transplanted an organ it's it's just math and they'd be crazy not to go with it thank you [Applause] [Music] you", "vXi_5zGIVbw": "MONTHS, HOWEVER IT HAS ALSO BEEN STIRRING UP CONTROVERSY.  IT'S CALLED C-B-D... AND SOME CLAIM IT HAS  MEDICAL PROPERTIES...  9 ON YOUR SIDE'S KARA GANN IS DIGGING DEEPER TONIGHT, INTO THE PRODUCTS MADE  WITH C-B-D.  PRODUCTS WITH CBD  INSIDE HAVE BEEN POPPING UP EVERYWHERE, RAISING  THE QUESTION \"WHAT IS  CBD?\" SO WE TOOK THOSE QUESTIONS TO EXPERTS TO FIND OUT .  YOU CAN FIND CBD IN  JUST ABOUT ANY FORM..  OILS, SOAPS, LOTIONS,  CREAMS, BATH BOMBS,  EVEN FOOD. CBD OR SCIENTIFICALLY  CALLED \"CANNABIDIAL\" IS  ONE OF MANY  CANNABINOIDS IN THE  HEMP PLANT.  THESE PRODUCTS RECENTLY MADE THEIR  WAY ONTO STORE SHELVES AFTER  PRESIDENT TRUMP  SIGNED THE \"2018 FARM  BILL\" INTO EFFECT LAST DECEMBER.  THE BILL ULTIMATELY  ALLOWS HEMP TO BE  GROWN AS AN  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. BUT WHAT IS CBD AND IS IT SAFE? WE ASKED DR KEN SODERSTROM, AN ASSOICATE PROFESSOR  WITH THE DEPARTMENT  OF PHARMACOLOGY AND  TOXICOLOGY AT ECU'S  BRODY SCHOOL OF  MEDICINE.  \"it is a drug and like any drug it is potentially toxic and so it is something to be careful about.\"  \"the most typical way of administering CBD is by  troche in oil under the  tongue.\" BUT CAN CBD GET YOU \"HIGH\" LIKE  SMOKING MARIJUANA? \"cannibidiol will not get you  high but other things that come along with it as the oils extracted may get you high and the principal among  those is delta 9 thc.\" THC IS  THE PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOID IN THE CANNIBIS PLANT...  WHICH IN LARGE AMOUNTS IS ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL AND  MOST STATE LAWS. SO DO THESE CBD  PRODUCTS HAVE THC  INSIDE? \"...it will have some thc yes.\" CONSUMER  GRADE CBD PRODUCTS DO CONTAIN .3 PERCENT  OF THC.. HOWEVER SODERSTROM SAYS THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO QUOTE ON QUOTE \"GET YOU HIGH\" \"it may have just a trace but it will always have some  measurable amount of cannabinoids that are  psychoactive.\" THE NEXT  QUESTION MANY ARENT  SURE ABOUT IS WILL CBD PRODUCTS WITH THC  INSIDE SHOW UP ON A  DRUG TEST? WE ASKED  MICHELLE EDMUNDSON,  OWNER OF E AND S HEMP  COMPANY IN WINTERVILLE. \"we ask people to come see their doctors they go they talk to their doctors and then 90 percent of them go and  come back and the doctor says its fine and the second thing is do you have to take a drug test..\" \"so yeah it will  march right across and get into your blood stream.\" EDMUNDSON SAID INITIALLY SHE HAD HER  DOUBTS ABOUT CBD PRODUCTS.  \"I thought it was a snake  oil.\" YET AFTER SEEING POSITIVE RESULTS IN  HER HEALTH.. SHE DECIDED TO OPEN  THE SHOP.  \"I was on antidepressant medicine, no longer on any of that, don't have to take  anything to sleep any more my anxiety levels are down.\" AND MANY OF HER  CLIENTS SAY THEY TOO HAVE HAD POSITIVE  EXPERIENCES WITH IT. \"I have clients that have  fiber myalgia, arthritis,  hashimotos, lupis, rheumatoid arthrisits, osteoarthris, and the cbd oil  brings down that inflammation and helps their pain.\" ONE FATHER TELLS  ME HIM AND HIS WIFE  CREATED THEIR OWN  BRAND OF CBD OIL FOR THEIR SON WHO  SUFFERED FROM  SEIZURES.  \"knowing that we were able to do it naturally for him and do it the right way, what we feel is the right way I  honestly still emotional about it because hes thriving.\"  NOW, WALLACE SAYS HIS  SON NOAH IS SEIZURE  FREE.. THEY CREDIT THAT TO  CBD \"you know hes three  and a half and hes brilliant he has no issues and its just  an amazing experience to create something and hopefully help other people  as well.\" ANOTHER  QUESTION OF CONCERN  IS.. IS IT LEGAL? \"now its  presumably legal at the  federal level but you have regulatory agencies like the FDA contacting distributors  saying you are going too far marketing this as an effective drug.\" OILS, DROPLETS UNDER THE TONGUE, AND TOPICALS ARE ALL LEGAL  ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF  AGRICULUTURE ONLY IF THEY ARE SOLD WITHOUT  HEALTH CLAIMS. IN 2018 THE FDA  APPROVED A DRUG WITH CBD AS AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT CREATED TO  HELP CHILDREN WITH EPILEPSY.  NOW THE AG DEPARTMENT SAYS SINCE  THIS FORM OF CBD,  CALLED \"CBD ISOLATE\" , CBD IN ITS PURESTEST FORM.. IS IN THE NEW  MEDICATION.. ANY FOOD PRODUCTS  ON THE MARKET WITH THIS CBD FORM IS ILLEGAL TO SELL. THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO SENT LETTERS TO RETAIL SHOPPES, LIKE EDMUNSONS INFORMING  THEM ABOUT THE NEW REGULATIONS..  SHE SAYS SHE HAS PULLED ITEMS ITEMS WITH CBD ISOLATE OUT OF HER STORE.  tag THE FDA WILL HOST A  PUBLIC FORUM ON MAY  31ST AT THEIR WHITE OAK  CAMPUS IN WASHINGTON DC TO DISCUSS SOME OF  THESE NEW  REGULATIONS.

some feedback that we've heard from people who have used iontophoresis machines and kind of feedback from dermatologists so this week we're really excited to dive into this very trendy topic which is CBD oil we've heard from people on reddit forums and online posts and articles that people have actually been using CBD oil to help manage the symptoms of hyperhidrosis and someone said that I've worked so we're gonna dive into that today but first my embarrassing story so about four or five years ago on Christmas Eve we went to a church ceremony and it was late I was tired and I'm so ready to go and it was it was a service that I wasn't familiar with so at the very end I I just feel like it's you know everything's coming to a close and worth into the program and everyone is sitting down and people start singing and I just jump up out of my chair like ready because I expect everyone else to stand up - and they're about a thousand twelve hundred people in this church and I look around and I'm the only one standing up and I just felt this wave of anxiety and sweat I just immediately started pouring sweat everywhere around my body my hands my feet my face my underarms everywhere started sweating it was terrible so this week sweat story comes all the way down from South Carolina one state under us from a woman named Donna Donna has a really interesting story she's had two sympathectomy x' which is as we talked in an earlier episode a surgical procedure to essentially like clip sweat glands to help reduce underarm sweat she hasn't seen any success with the sympathectomy x' and so she's still desperate for a solution and unlike our previous sweat stories Donna actually hasn't tried car pay but she's really really excited about it because nothing's worked for her she's trying to everything she's had two surgical sympathectomy x' and she she just got car pay and she's thrilled to be able to try it and Donna has a really interesting story she has a lot going on in her life outside of the two sympathectomy x' that she's had and the various other prescription and OTC solutions that she's tried to help manage her hyperhidrosis her husband needs a kidney transplant and her son is going to be the donor so everyone please keep her and her family and her thoughts her daughter just got married and she really needs some support right now and she's definitely excited about the support that car pay will bring to help manage the sweat but she can use your thoughts as well so let's dive into it so first I want to dive into what CBD oil is so CBD oil is a substance that's derived from the cannabis plant and it's called cannabidiol and THC is also derived from the cannabis plant that is like that's what gets you high and everything we're not talking about that CBD doesn't get you high it doesn't have any psychoactive effects CBD oil has been really trendy recently for helping with anxiety and epilepsy and now some people are reporting sweat however it's a really new area so no one really knows much about it so most of the findings are qualitative and based on people's personal experiences so there's not a lot of scientific research if it's really new but that research is picking up and we're starting to learn more about the impacts that CBD oil can have on epilepsy anxiety inflammation and a host of other things so how would CBD oil help with hyperhidrosis and does it so some people think that the anti-inflammatory impacts of CBD oil along with the anxiety reducing benefits of this substance can help reduce the activity of the sweat glands and actually reduce the amount of sweat that's being produced by the body so that would obviously help with hyperhidrosis now what we don't know is whether that's true or not so there's no scientific evidence that actually proves any correlation between CBD oil and reduce sweat however based on online forums and some reddit posts and what some people are saying it has helped some people and they've found some success with it so we don't really know if CBD oil does help with hyperhidrosis it could for those people that do currently use it it could be placebo we don't know it could actually help but what we have heard from these people who are really all about it is that they think the anti inflammatory and anxiety reducing aspects of CBD oil help them manage their sweat and help reduce the sweat and that makes sense to a to a degree because anxiety anxiety stimulates the the sympathetic nervous system which then stimuli it's the sweat glands which produces sweat so could be possible but we can't make any conclusions before there's scientific evidence supporting it so with that thank you so much this wraps up episode 10 of carp a sweat series and please remember if you have hyperhidrosis if you sweat a lot if you're looking for a solution check out carp a we love to have the opportunity to help you manage your sweat just like it's helped us so please check it out let us know what you think we can't wait here and please submit your sweat story to me at david at carp a lotion calm i can't wait to read it thanks so much have a going", "P_qbg1CiXFI": "[Music] hello I'm Jennifer here extract flats in Boulder Colorado today we're going to talk about our cvd t-shirt I'll go over a few of our options we know it can be confusing so we're going to make this as simple as possible we have two different strengths regular extra strength three different sizes 15 30 and 60 ml and now we offer four different flavors original lemon mango and raspberry to keep it as simple as possible our regular strength options are all the same strength solution just different size bottles so you'll see increased from five hundred to a thousand to two thousand this is all 33 milligrams of CBD per ml whereas our extra strength is also you know same solution different sizes 66 milligrams of CBD per ml now I'll show you how easy it is to take our t-shirt we recommend taking 1 to 2 ml one to two times a day with each bottle every dropper as much as you can fill up it's going to be approximately one milliliter of solution or DVD match I'm going to take a half of an ml you want to take this as a sublingual which means you hold it underneath your tongue or approximately 30 seconds and they say it helps increase the absorption rate so here we go it's a little awkward for the video you and that's it all you got to do easy as taking a tincture be sure to subscribe so you can stay tuned for all of our entertaining CBD content and educational videos of course we're available by phone Zendesk or email thing Sunday if you have any other questions and you can stop by if you're in the Boulder area all right thanks for watching", "ZFOxN5w9gno": "seems like everybody's talking about we these days I hear about all the time it's legal gettin legalized in lots of different states in the United States both medicinal and recreational marijuana and now we're getting the CBD oil and CBD stuff everywhere people are taking C V D supplements people are putting it on their skin people are giving it to their pets what is the deal with this stuff we're gonna answer those questions and lots lots more hang tight we're getting into it right now have you been paying attention to skin care releases over the past year you may have noticed a huge influx of products containing CBD as an ingredient and it is estimated that it will be a 16 billion dollar industry by the year 2025 but should it be is this something that you should invest your money in first we need to decide what this stuff is and what it isn't so all hemp is cannabis but not all cannabis is hemp so hemp is something that is within the cannabis category what you're gonna see on labels is cannabis L sativa and that is the hemp plant it is a low THC version of the cannabis plant within this plant there are over 80 different cannabinoids these things that you can extract from the plant in order to get different effects so one of them is CBD one of them is THC THC is the one that gives you the psychoactive effects so when you've got hemp seed oil it has a very very low percentage of THC it actually needs to be below 0.3% in order to even be legal now what is CBD it's cannabidiol is how it's pronounced and cannabidiol will not get you high in that is not its purpose that is not what it does that's THC it's completely separate and because of that it there's no restrictions on flights you can't get arrested for having it in your car like it doesn't matter where you live in the United States it is a federal law that it is legal as long as there is that 0.3% were less of that THC in the product and products being sold on the shelves are legally they have to have less than that point three percent if they have point four percent they're considered any legal substance now because this is brand new companies are really taking advantage of the lacs rules when it comes to CBD some people are taking hemp seed oil and they're marketing it as CBD but if it just says hemp seed oil it's not CBD there's no CBD in just straight hemp seed oil and because of that you're not going to get the the alleged benefits of the CBD if you just get hemp seed oil so the biggest thing is that the CBD oils have anti-inflammatory properties so anytime you have inflammation whether it's dry skin eczema psoriasis that is supposed to be helped by CBD oil another big one is as an acne treatment because of the inflammation that occurs naturally with acne there's actually a second thing that they're studying as far as the acne treatment which is it's supposed to help control your sebum production that extra oil production so that would help people with acne as well if it were true again there just isn't a ton of research on it right now they're also saying it in certain concentrations it may have pain-killing properties similar to like a bengay kind of product and it also may have antioxidant properties that would help with fine lines and wrinkles and skin dullness it also seems to be safe for sensitive skin which is another big thing so if CBD can do all of these things it'll be magical but again the research just isn't there this is where a lot of companies have gotten into a lot of trouble because they're putting these claims on these CBD products that it can do all of these amazing things that are medical claims but these medical claims haven't been proven they had there's no scientific research behind it and as a cosmetic you can't make medical claims so people weren't claiming this is crazy I know but I mean you think about people that were reading this and thinking that this was a hundred percent true that it could treat conditions like Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease depression anxiety PTSD cancer treatment a treatment for schizophrenia for eating disorders and addiction these were real claims that companies were making about their CBD oil products and the FDA and the FTC had to step in and be like no no this is not ok and they got letters kind of cease and desist kind of letters to stop making those claims and they had to pull their products from the shelves so yes this ingredient is FDA approved but just because it's FDA approved doesn't mean it actually does anything the research just isn't there yet in 2018 the farm bill passed and what that did was it loosened regulations on hemp-based products that's why we're seeing this big boom in the market right now my husband and I went down to the Cosmoprof event down in Las Vegas and we went to well I went to a CBD base it's called a cosmetologist and that one was the most full packed people with so many questions I mean it was like wall-to-wall people there are so many brands that are looking at adding CBD to their products and my purpose for making this video is just to let you know that yes it could do lots of really great things for your skin but you also could be throwing your money down the toilet by buying them so you have to realize when you purchase something like this that it may or may not work and if you have tried CBD based products I would love to know your thoughts about your personal experiences with them down in the comments below in the collective brain of makeup awesomeness where we help each other not to buy crap and to buy things that are totally worth it please leave those thoughts because I would love to learn from you and your experiences I do have a CBD product that I'm trying from makeup revolution if there's skincare revolution line right now I haven't seen anything magical with it but I also don't have psoriasis eczema acne those things that will probably be really showing visible results if they were doing those things I'd be able to see them more than I do with my fine lines and wrinkles so let's all work together to learn more about this topic I hope that you found it helpful again anything you want to add leave it down in the comments thank you so much for watching and subscribe before you go mad love to you and I will see you in a video very very soon", "9p2UNon_dvo": "next into the den to entrepreneurs weary of one particular dragon we are worried about Peter because he's really scary oh he doesn't go for the kill but to survive in the den they'll also have to face the fire of four other dragons [Music] hello dragons my name is Michael Tkach and I'm Tim in skip and we're from Caron UK we're asking for an investment of fifty thousand pounds for 15% of our business we have the UK rights to the current portfolio products which are all made from cannabis sativa plant extract make how would you like to explain your story I am from the Czech Republic and I was working in the UK when industrial accident changed my life I damaged my arm and I lost several fingers on my hand amazing an injured surgeons transferred a tow from my foot to my hand during that times the pain was unbearable and the scarring was extensive visiting Frank from the Czech Republic brought me the car own appointment and another hemp products I started using them and their results was incredible so I like to share this experience with others and I approached current Czech Republic and brought these products to UK so we have 18 different products ranging from face cream shower gel hemp leaf tea and hemp seeds and they're all made from cannabis sativa commonly known as hemp we are vegan organic and totally legal as the products contain none of these psychoactive elements found in in cannabis but they're very high in the other elements known as cannabinoids which are currently proven to be beneficial in treating many different complaints we're passionate about cannabis sativa but we are plainly retail amateurs and we need the help of a dragon to guide us to manage our growth and fulfill our full potential thank you very much for your attention and we have some samples if you'd like to show what possible that we have the samples at the end is because I'm slightly worried if I have to take any of the samples I might make a wrong investment decision they have no suckers apical affect whatsoever yeah now they've reassured the dragons the products aren't mind-altering Tim inskipp and me Celtic arch can get on with the business of handing them out there looking for 50,000 pounds for 15% of their business selling cosmetics made with a cannabis extract but Pizza Jones is still confused about the legalities of the operation how can you convince me that this isn't a potential front for a big drug ring we have the we have EU sensitive all youth certification all the farmers are certified there's very strict law oversee these farmers what's stopping the company in Czech Republic the temptation to realize that they make a small amount of money on this but the real business behind the scenes is cannabis they grow into different blind entirely and it's it is illegal to grow different plants what Moe would make it restricted is the level of THC which is the psychoactive component of the hemp plant which it doesn't have so essentially it's legal it's not a restricted substance okay so I'm not gonna be an investor in some sort of illegal drug no absolutely not because of you're gonna go to our butter and you've given three different creams here the ones are bomb as let's bomb yeah and then these are its anointment is it all the same product sit no okay is this a cosmetic is it a medicine at the moment we marketed as the cosmetics we don't make her claims it helps people and we sell it out isn't that a major problem because a you can't tell anyone what the product does you just said it's an all-purpose hemp pointment I don't know if it's to moisturize and make my skin glow I don't know if wish to reduce pain for you know joint pain or injuries I've got this does have medical device certification in the EU in Czech Republic they have run the trials we are talking specifically about this product to get a medical device in the okay the point is that the evidence is that it does help in a very very wide range of different complaints and problems but we cannot say that we are going to cure any of this but you definitely can't say they don't have a medicines license to say that but what I'm saying is that you don't know what the products for who owns the company Karen know my friends in the Czech Republic your friends yes how much of the company do you own none none we'll check it probably nothing nothing basically our relationship is that macao developed some of the products in the Czech Republic brought them over to the UK and tell me what's your deal with this company they are my close friends so you've got to buy from them yes is there a minimum quantity of to buy no and your license with them is lost for how long - 2023 at the moment and can they terminate your contract early turn up now can I look at that agreement yes yes Tim what's your role in this business are you are you an equal share holder no I'm a minor shoulder at the moment the shareholders split how I only have 10% yeah I got a 90 and 10 I got a 60% of the company and we got another of my no shareholders which helped me on the beginning will be the start of the company and how much would they put in to help you from the beginning there was no more than 20,000 altogether I invest my owner over nearly 200,000 in in the business two hundred thousand pounds and what who's where has that been spent unwisely I did a lot of mistakes on the beginning I hired Ireland the warehouse ten and half thousand thousand square feet much big offices and hired people because I believe because I were watching the Dragons Den I want to do big it's all fall then there's Peters fault specifically no launching is for the SETI's well this is my time thank you so it's Peters that fall so he's not your favorite dragon that's good to hear so you made some mistakes in the beginning so how much would you write off of the 200,000 as a mistake [Music] a hundred thousand for sure right now you have absolutely no negotiating tools in here whatsoever on June the 3rd 2023 if you've done a cracking job you hand this business back to these guys there's nothing in here that gives you an automatic right of renewal from my point of view they will be only against themselves how they can do it without us after years well because you built their brand they've got a really really valuable asset over here why on earth were they renew mm-hmm job done market penetrated I'm not spending my time building somebody else's brand for them they won't be investing I'm out a lack of control over the future of the business has spooked Deborah Medan and it's left to KO suleiman wondering how an investor would get their money back my question mark here is the fact that you don't own the brand it's a distribution and there could be no exits yes well we believe at the moment the exit is to sell back to Karen check have you got agreement to that we are negotiate that agreement so you haven't got any grieve now look I'm not doubting the product amazing product as you say but you don't own the brand once you've created the brand the retail is what the brand I don't care about you I do wish you all the best because you're gonna make your friend rich I'm out okay touka Suleiman joined Deborah Medan in exiting over that controversial distribution contract antes Levani has some words of wisdom on the pair's plans to back up the potential benefits of the product products like this the most important thing is to show the effectiveness that it works you will need to do clinical trials and pretty much every region or territory that you launch it because it will have different licensing agencies and the cost of doing a clinical trial do you know much that costs in the UK to do a clinical trial like this about a hundred twenty thousand exactly to get them licensed will cost you a hell of a lot more you're gonna have to raise half a million pounds I'm at okay thank you okay thank you Michele Tim I'm concerned about the way that you've gone about setting this business up the hill particularly you where you've having friendships and in your home country is fantastic but what you should have done was if you had such a huge amount of money two hundred thousand pounds to invest you should have found a way to invest in the holding company in the Czech Republic I could have been potentially interested actually in something like this but ultimately you've brought a distribution agency style deal that I think isn't good enough so I'm out okay thank you Peter Jones's departure leaves Jenny Campbell as the last dragon standing is she able to see the potential for profit in a business her fellow millionaires have shunned so I mean this is a bit of a mess isn't it from where we're standing I'm sure you can see that you come into the den with a an exclusivity agreement you're halfway through and all sorts of issues on extending or minimum purchase levels how confident are you that you can renegotiate that exclusivity agreement on the book Alfie on a hundred percent confident okay so I think this is complex but I can see the belief in your eyes Mikkel and certainly you've come onboard to him with the same belief but I will make you an offer so I will offer you all of the money but because of the risk factors multiple risk factors in this deal I would want 25% of your business the garage for offer can we have a little discussion please go talk to the wall an eleventh-hour change of Fortune as Jenny Campbell backs her gut instinct with an offer but at 10% more than the entrepreneurs were offering they have a tricky decision on their hands thank you - for your offer be able to accept the offer [Applause] welcome to the cosmetic duo have given up a quarter of the company but leave the den with a 50,000 pound investment that's what we lost it I did say you shouldn't use their product before I can't wait to have a fancy yeah you'd like to meet Jenny as silly as possible it's pre share our excitement and our visions and maybe have a bottle of champagne yeah you", "hy_nWGXzV14": "welcome everyone to the second of two webinars hosted by the lung health foundation on medicinal

patient rehabilitation and approaches to treatment so i'll turn it over to you dr jason if you want to share your screen and we'll get started thanks everyone okay well thank you very much to the organizers and for having me here for the second round and for those people that were with us last week and there are a few slides which i am going to be using again in order to uh push forward some of the points that i have for the second part of the communication so um and i would really appreciate some some questions at the end of all of this so that we can generate some discussion in where this is going forward so the ideas of what i'd really like to to bring forward today is to try and get a basic understanding of the endocannabinoid system within the human body and to see what is the function of it to know what is the existing evidence regarding the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for pain and other medical purposes and of course to eventually recognize that there are potential side effects which will have subsequent contraindications for cannabis and the cannabinoids you know this is a relatively new field that we're going into despite the fact that it's a very old system and lots of it and everybody's known about cannabis but the actual science of cannabis has really only in about the past 30 years a big come forward you know cannabis was a it was a banned substance it was told it was bad and now we see that in fact there may be some areas where cannabis has great therapeutic potential and as we move forward in this idea of using natural substances and well substances that have been used recreationally for decades how to bring them into the scientific use and practice the art of using them correctly so uh my only disclosure is that i am an advisor to tetra buy a farm and they plan to start a trial we were hoping to start at the beginning of the year but with covert that's all been pushed towards the end of the year so let's look at what is medical cannabis it could be dried cannabis it could be cannabis oil um recently we're now starting to see the synthetic cannabis uh cannabinoids come into use which is more a and a a more scientific formulation which of which is pure and which we know the exact ingredients on we know that cannabis has really been used for a very very long time and for the people that have come forward we could see that it's registered registrated users have tripled over the past six years you know um chronic pain is probably the most common indication for why people use cannabis um and generally we know that people that use cannabis and people that prescribe cannabis would like to be better informed of the workings the availability the indications and the contraindications of cannabis so we do know that the the cannabis basically looks with thc and cbd and thc produces many of the psychoactive adverse effects of cannabis smoking or ingestion and cbd which is non-psychoactive um and it's usually the cbd component that is analgesic neuroprotective can be anti-convulsant anti-metic anti-spasmodic and most importantly i think is that it does definitely have anti-inflammatory properties now anti-inflammatory is is a big news of uh because we now starting to see across the spectrum that many diseases and many side effects and many consequences of whether it's cancer or cardiovascular disease has to do with inflammation if we look at something like like anorexia calcium syndrome the crp which is c-reactive protein which is a surrogate for the activity of inflammation is a very important measurement so inflammation does seem to be playing a role in very many disease processes the endocannabinoid system as we explained is a very old system and you the human type cannabinoid receptors actually were seen in invertebrate stage fish pre-fish evolution so there's endogenous which is natural human cannabinoids and these are molecules that are basically fat soluble and found in the fat and as we know the brain has got a lot of fat so this is where these molecules tend to aggregate is in the fatty nervous system and if we think about an endogenous opioid system the morphines the into the the opioid receptors and how we could use these opioid receptors to treat pain because they are naturally occurring so too with the cannabis and the endocannabinoid receptors we can use them by modulating the amount by modulating the affinity and the attachment and the activation we can use cannabis and such like substances in order to modulate those systems so i'm going to just show you that cbd-1 receptors are prime found primarily in the nervous system and cbd-2 in the immune system they have different functions actually we spoke about that earlier but they do have overlap to a wide variety and range of cannabinoids that are used therapeutically different species may have a different distribution and a different receptor sensitivity comparing for instance example a motion regulated part of a of a rat brain is more sensitive than a human's to cannabinoids so rats tend to walk along a straight line more crookedly than what humans do if they are stimulated to the same degree by by cannabinoids now this slide i'd really like you to to look in because it's a to me it's my one of my favorite slides where i have a look where are these cb 1 receptors cerebral cortex having a look that these receptors are involved in decision making in emotional behavior once again looking at the chordate nucleus and i'm looking to to show you that learning and memory is very important and does have a very important effect which is stimulated and controlled and modulated by the cannabinoids so we've got memory and learning we have a look at the pertainment once again you've got various types of learning the uh looking at the amygdaloid nuclei which is responsible for anxiety and stress emotion fear and pain and this if you have a look at anybody within terminal disease such as cancer that's where we've got large amount of anxiety stress emotion fear and pain so pain and emotion and stress really go hand in hand of one part of a circle holding hands with the next part of the circle the more pain the more emotion the more anxiety the more anxiety the more pain so they bring them together and if we could find a penis of substances like the cannabinoids in order to treat these anxieties and pain the amygdaloid is where it would be looking at the hippocampus once again memory and learning um substantia [ __ ] which is a in you know we've got reward so this is why cannabinoids do tend to have a favorable effect on people all of these neuro receptors inside the brain do play a role the last one is just to mention the the function of emesis of vomiting in the dorsal vagal complex so cannabinous we know that the two main types which is the indica and the sativa but there are a multitude of other subspecies just like we see species of different types of tea and they may look the same but they smell differently they may have a different color they may taste differently so too with the cannabinoids because it's a plant really it does vary in their different contents of how much thc how much cannabidiol cannabinoids and the various other metabolites of which are here now is in excess of a thousand different types of metabolites that one gets from cannabis itself it will be important now just to give a quick description of the pharmacokinetics of these drugs within the human body and they depend on the formulation of the drug and the root of administration and these are the standard pharmacokinetic variables that we look at the absorption distribution metabolism and elimination so looking at the absorption we know that cannabinoids are administered via inhalation and they exhibit similar pharmacokinetics to those that are administered intravenously so if you breathe in a drug and you can give it intravenously that the pharmacokinetics actually are very similar after inhalation both the plasma concentrations of cbd and thc are attained rapidly that's within three two minutes three to 10 minutes and maximum concentrations are higher relative to oral ingestion the bioavailability of thc after inhalation reportedly ranges from 10 to 35 and this is attributable to the variability both the intra and the inter subject variability in relational characteristics because maybe some person takes a bigger path takes more regular puffs um than somebody that's got smaller lungs maybe it's also got something to do in the way that drug has been administered is it with a a cigarette or a joint is it within a chamber is it within a vaporizer so these are variables which will eventually have an effect on the amount of drug that is is absorbed inhaled cbd was reported to have an average systemic bioavailability of 31 which is really almost the same as that of thc the pharmacokinetics of vaporized and smoked cannabinoids are relatively comparable now sativex which is an epiximal or an oral mucospray those inhalations undergo rapid absorption by the oral new mucosa and are hints are helpful to relieve symptoms which need immediate relief so some of these sativex they do provide immediate relief because they produce high drug concentrations relatively higher to than if somebody would ingest it so you've got an oral mucosa it's absorbed pretty directly there's no first-past effect and it goes straight into the blood now transdermal administration of cannabinoids avoids the first part effect of the metabolism but due to the highly extremely hydrophobic nature this limits the diffusion across the aqueous layers of the skin in vitro studies with human skin have determined that the permeability of cbd is to be tenfold higher than that of thc cannabinoids distribute relatively well to well vascularized organs like the lung the heart the brain and the liver with subsequent equilibration into less vascularized tissues so they you have an affinity to go for the well-vascularized tissues as we said like the heart and the lung and then after some time will equilibrate into the other tissues so that an equivalent amount and concentration is achieved throughout the body but of course the distribution may be affected by the body's size and composition as well as different disease states as well as some of the other drugs which can affect the permeability of the blood brain barrier knowing of course that chronic with chronic use cannabinoids can accumulate in the adipose tissue and then are very slowly released so half-lifes may be increased in patients that use these drugs chronically the metabolism of thc is predominantly via the liver via a cytochrome p450 or cp-450 although there are some other cryptochromes that are involved which you can see the sub-2c9 and c2c19 predominantly excreted in the feces and the urine they undergo glucorodination and this is how they get into the urine and into the feces important to note is that lipophilic thc is able actually to cross over into the placenta and is then excreted in human breast milk cbd is really metabolized primarily by the liver which we see once again but a different sub 2c19 which is also thc but it's the third most important and mainly fecal excretion although there is some urinary excretion and interestingly enough at this stage very little is known about the pharmacological activity of the metabolites of cbd which seems to be the less obnoxious of them of the thc compounds in humans the estimates of the elimination elimination half-life do vary that's important as we'll speak later why this is important but the first initial half-life four to six minutes and then a long terminal half-life of 22 hours so in a person that does not use the drug chronically there's a half-life that can last almost a day in relatively longer elimination half la is observed in those people that are chronic heavy users because as i explained they retain the drug within the adipose tissue within the fatty tissue which then is released very slowly into the bloodstream and eventually in term eliminated cbd does have slightly longer terminal half-life we can see that the average half-life following intravenous dose is about 24 plus minus 6 hours and an investigation of repeated daily continuous oral administration actually shows an elimination half-life that can go up to five days which is quite long the dose response and drug drug interaction information is unfortunately lacking this also plays a big role interpretation and understanding of clinical trials is that we don't understand if you give more drug really does that produce that effect or if you give less drug does it really produce less of an effect and there is definitely this potential for the interaction between either inhibiting or inducing the enzymes which which either break down or prevent the breakdown of the substances or also have an effect on the transporters of the drug within the human body both cannabis and tobacco smoking together induce the that p that sip 1a2 when they smoke together so this may play a role in whether the effect may be enhanced or may be reduced simply by smoking tobacco along with the with the cannabis some studies which are in vitro reported that cbd significantly inhibits the p p-glycoprotein mediated drug transport and what p-glycoprotein does is the miniature drug is transported into the cell the p-glycoprotein which is actually a resistant type of protein pumps that active substance out of the cell we've seen in many of the chemotherapeutic compounds that of adriamycin etopocite these are drugs that are strong inducers of the p-glycoprotein system and so when patients may become resistant to a drug or their cancer cells become a resistant to a drug it's due to this p-glycoprotein transplant [Music] so let's have a look at some of the effects of the the drug on the cns drowsiness alertness impairment of short-term memory and you saw where that was important when i showed it to you in the brain slowed reactions decreased motor coordination and muscle tone accuracy of psychomotor task performance so one's perception is definitely uh impaired by the combined effects of these drugs um working at various structures within the central nervous system at lower doses one can get the mild euphoria the relaxation the decreased anxiety which we once again saw with that worked out in the amygdaloid nuclei higher doses can increase anxiety and panic reactions and there have been people and this is something specifically in the elderly population where paranoia can can take place is it because the people have less fat or maybe the receptors are more sensitive and once again the dose response relationship is not quite clear in any standard group of people but we do know that at which dose we're not sure but higher doses do tend to cause what we would call in layman's turban a bad trip of course the other effects are the pain perception and i once again say perception because when speaking to these patients they would say we still feel the pain but it just isn't as important or doesn't affect me as emotionally or it doesn't have an effect on my functional status as it did when i did not take the drug but we still feel the pain of course anti-nausea and anti-metic effects by the cb1 receptors meant to increase appetite which it does in healthy volunteers unfortunately in all the trials so far been done actual appetite has not been increased but in the trial that we did to you know 2012 13 what we found was taste perception was altered and uh and also discussion which is um abnormal tastes distorted taste is is decreased so patients found that they tasted food better they wanted more of it but it didn't really have an effect on the appetite and the so-called munchies which we were all hoping patients with advanced cancer and an erector coxy would have has not unfortunately materialized now there is some reports of anti-convulsant effects with with these drugs but it's not via a cb1 receptor and i think that is important tonight on the neuromuscular system we've got antisposmotic effects and this has been well utilized in some of the drugs with spasticity and even recommended for pain and spasticity of patients that have multiple sclerosis cardiovascular effects patients get their hearts beat faster they have a better cardiac output but it also induces a myocardial oxygen need so if a patient has narrowed arteries in their heart and they suddenly need more oxygen because their heart is beating faster then they may experience angina respiratory it does increase bronchodilation and there were very many old people and i still remember this in south africa who would actually take marijuana in order to treat their asthma and but they would not take it with cigarettes it would just be pure marijuana and that would increase the decrease the airways resistance allow them to breathe the air out much easier and cope with the effects of asthma bronchial irritation and of course cannabis smoke is similar to tobacco smoke as far as irritation goes but the evidence for any obvious causing of lung cancer is lacking eyes patients get you know to dilatation probably from the heart the heart that's beating faster the blood pressure that goes up and yet again we come back to this old albatross which always seems to come back at us is what is the effect on immune function and how does it stop the immune response or the the overt immune response because as we know very often the immune response that we see in patients with cancer has been ineffective in fact with the new uh inhibitors that break checkpoint inhibitors they're turning off some of that immune function and patients are actually doing better so the old story of well you need a fever to fight an infection may not actually be true so cannabinoids do have an effect on the immune function although it's unclear exactly so those were the acute effects and let's look at some of the chronic effects cognitive changes verbal fluency learning deficits these are people that are taking high doses and can get a chronic intoxication syndrome of apathy you know we don't feel like going to school we don't feel like doing homework we don't feel like playing sport we don't feel like socializing we just feel like sitting in our room this has been one of the big problems that they found with younger users who have been using it chronically is this chronic apathetic syndrome now whether that's just as the newer generation is or whether this is in fact what was seen in many older generations when they were younger it is an entity and there is a cannabis dependent categorization on the dsm-4 and we'll go through those a little later just the chronic effects on the respiratory system is chronic inflammatory chest diseases and those into the copd the chronic obstructive airways diseases we're once again inflammation is a big role plays a big role we know that steroids whether inhaled or whether or all given orally to patients that have these inflammatory diseases do play a role and it's to in to decrease the inflammation just uh if so speaking of some effects that are specific to cbd not to thc there's reduction in the they may cause a reduction in the the in the thc associated adverse effects um specifically the psychotropic and the cardiovascular effects so that cbd may in fact counteract the effects of thc um inherently but of course cbd has been reported with fatigue and sunderlands it does you take it at night it does help people to go to sleep but chronic long-term users because they're not excreting the drug may become overtly somnolent and fatigued and of course if they use it with other medications there's limited data regarding the safety and efficacy of cannabis in the elderly population and this is because we know that in the context of the elderly this is associated comorbidity is polypharmacy there's increased cognitive vulnerability and predisposed to more severe manifestations from the drugs such as sedation we also know that the pharmacokinetic parameters are influenced by age such as reduced hepatic and renal clearance and relative decreases in body fat so some of the drug may remain active for longer periods of time and in fact i've had two patients they've both been elderly that suffered this acute toxic syndrome where they became extremely paranoid and they had a really bad trip and confused medical cannabis can be administered through different techniques and methods such as smoking vaporization and ingestion and the vaporization produces effects that are very similar to smoking but it's while reducing the exposure to the by-products of the combustion and possible carcinogens which then decrease the adverse respiratory syndromes no clear association in a number of reviews that looked at the pulmonary effect of smoking and the association between cannabis and lung cancer and the conclusion of many of these studies that there is no clear association or only a marginally statistical significant association these are the three types that we've seen specifically in canada although we don't have the draeneibinol anymore that was the oral form of the synthetic delta 9 thc nabalone sesame which is available and it's treated for severe um chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting and the nebyximals the cetavix which has been used and i will speak a little bit about this later as the adjunctive treatment for patients with symptomatic relief of spasticity with with multiple sclerosis or in neuropathic pain or in patients with advanced cancer who experience moderate or severe pain during the time that they're taking as much tolerated dose of strong opioid that they can just to go into a subject of the problem designing clinical trials is that there's no data or almost no data on the pharmacokinetics during the chronic treatment we know that there's a longer half-life and therefore at a greater risk of accumulation and the monitoring of these levels needs to be done regularly so we don't have data on that to know enough to go into a clinical trial with patients that have been using it for quite a while as well the distribution distribution between the plasma and the tissue may invalidate ordinary methods of measurement of bioavailability so the distribution is not understood the accumulation is not fully understood and we do know that the cannabidiols is an effective if it's inhibitor if it's given a qp and yet it's an inducer if used chronically of the p54 and so there's this increased risk of using an interaction with other drugs whether it's smoking or it applies mainly to the smoking cannabis but not to the pure cannabinoid treatment so there's a difference once already many people have claimed indications for therapeutic use which is a lifelong use not just an acute use and then over but more lifelong so we have to consider of course that using these drugs may cause pulmonary damage it may cause tolerance and you have to increase the dose and of course there is although it's small there is a risk of dependence the safety margin you can get somebody using the same amount of drug and yet the one person freaks out and the other person tolerates the drug just quite calmly so there's a therapeutic range that that can cure therapeutic effect that can occur within the same dose range subjective effects are noticeable within seconds or minutes when smoking cannabis whereas an accumulative effect is noted in chronic treatment so these are some of the difficulties in designing clinical trials another thought is what would actually be measured we need objective rather than just subjective need to qualify you know when you look at nausea are you nauseous yes or no how bad is the nausea is more difficult to determine even pain on the scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the worst pain and 0 is no pain where is your pain how much is your pain may be different from person a to person b so also the importance of the placebo effect requires very acu accurate measures of responses and who does the measurement of those effects we know that most patients that are taking these treatments has smoked or taken the cannabis for so long that they in fact are advocates because they say it's worked so well for them so who's going to measure those effects people that have not taken it are really what we need difficult in today's times the number of available subjects for some real indications may actually be too small for property evaluation so we do need multi-center studies where people are working together with similar types of patients standardizing who's eligible who's not eligible who gets the drug how that drug is effect is measured and whether the patient is compliant whether the family is compliant and for many potential indications cannabis would have to be supplementary to other treatments so you're treating pain you should be treating you know with opioids and you treating with a cannabis not just with the cannabis so this does play a difficult role and what will the fate be for these trials if new therapies under development suddenly come along and we have now seen new inhaler units that are going to be for non-smoked cannabinoids so how are we going to compare what what the data that we have to some of the new data that we have and and how are we going to actually better separate therapeutic and side um from the from the drugs so let me just give you a background of some of the work that i'm going to go and that's really about chronic neuropathic pain which we know affects about one to two percent of the population and patients with chronic and pain have reported using smoke cannabis to relieve pain improve sleep as well as to improve meat uh mood so what they did in this study by is they treated adults who had post traumatic or post surgical neuropathic pain to receive cannabis at full potencies either at zero percent 2.5 6 or nine point four percent for over 14 days in a crossover trial participants inhaled a single 25 milligram milligram dose through a pipe three times daily and the first five days in each cycle followed by a nine day washout period and then the daily average pain intensity was measured using an 11 point numeric rating scale they recorded the effects on moods the quality of life as well as adverse effect and they only recruited 23 patients of whom 21 completed the trial the average daily pain intensity measured on the scale was lower and it did to be significant whereas patients and this was mainly for the patients that took the higher nine point four percent dose versus the zero percent dose preparations with the intermediate potency yielded intermediate but non-significant results but also those patients taking the higher dose had improved ability to fall asleep it was easier it was faster and they had improved quality of life but no differences in mood or quality of life in the lower doses was noted and these are some others in the in the particular trial they once again compared it and what they saw was once again that the average daily pain intensity measured on this 11 point numeric rating scale was lower but and the preparations with the intermediate potency yielded intermediate results that were not significantly but no cbd was in any of the products tested there was an improvement in the quality of sleep and a significant improvement in anxiety so overall some of the components of quality of the quality of life of patients was improved very small trial only 23 patients in this randomized placebo crossover controlled crossover trial in cannabis cigarettes in neuropathic pain we see that there were 38 patients non-naive and they got different doses and they were delivered as two puffs followed by three paths followed by four paths and one hourly intervals so a different methodology but they saw that there was significant improvement in pain and pleasantness once again the perception and there was no change in the allodynia which is uh exaggerated pain or response to heat and worsening of attention learning and memory with active treatment so getting a little bit of better pain control although the perception is is the perception is altered but pain approach with decreased attention learning and memory in hiv associated neuropathic pain we know that despite management with opioids and other pain modifying techniques neuropathic pain continues to reduce the quality of life and daily function in patients that have hiv this trial was done a little bit ago to say 10 11 years ago when hiv was still very much in the news what they did as well was a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover for 34 patients they had to be refractory to at least two previous previous analgesic classes they got different variety of doses ranging from one to eight percent over five days followed by a washout period they were smoked and it was a phase two trial and what they found was that the outcome was a change in the pace a pain intensity measured on a descriptor differential differential scale from a pre-treatment baseline to the end of each treatment week and they also looked at mood and daily functioning so what they found was 46 of subjects at least had a thirty percent reduction in pain but they the clinical trial um that they conducted was only a phase two phase two trial so it was not really something that they could take forward and as well is that most side effects that they experienced were mild and limited but there were two subjects who really had bad side effects and they had to stop the drug just looking at chronic pain and this is in a it was published in 2006 looking at the different um effects efficacies of the different drugs look at opioids 58 said they got treatment relief now is 21 relief up to 6.3 so that was the improvement within minutes within hours within days and within weeks who still had pain relief after weeks two percent still had a pain relief after two weeks five percent after a few days and looking at the cannabinoids zero percent after weeks just three after days and eighty percent after hours so cannabinoids do play a role there's no doubt that they play a role just looking at the different one whether it's massage or acupuncture or biofeedback i don't like the fact that mag that cannabis has been put along all of these complementary and alternative therapies as i do feel that there is a definite scientific role for cannabis in treatment of patients with pain but we're not sure of the mechanism as yet so looking at the evidence as we see it and then not many studies because of health canada restrictions a lot of legal non-inhaled product is available and will be available which is now available there's extensive anecdotal experience from patients worldwide but we still feel that the cot has been put ahead of the horse the large proportion of patients who are using medical cannabis um are benefiting but it may be potential hot potentially harmful it by uninformed use it's definitely it can be intentionally and harmful and we need to know what works for which disease what doses how is it best taken in what are the other safety concerns before it can be put forward as a true standard tested treatment we don't know the dose is it 2.5 is it 2.7 is it 9 is it 3 to 5 drops which is the most common use and it's remembering of course that what you see on some of the labels is not what you find in the actual product and i remember so i think it was last year that they health canada soup and all the marijuana stores and found that many of these bottles had the wrong labels and there was an infestation of parasites so we have to know what we're looking at and we have to be sure that it's a standard treatment for a standard disease can one drive well not after four hours is what's recommended and if you smoke or if you if you eat it or take it in by mouth not after six hours one can have a euphoria which can last that long addiction cannabis is about nine percent compared with cigarette which is 32 percent addiction addiction rate alcohol of 15 hero and 23 and cocaine 17 was just interesting to see that heroin is less than cigarettes so you can get an ex experience a a nicotine-like withdrawal once stopping the cannabis is it for people that have smoked nicotine and cannabis together or is it as true as what it says we're not quite sure and you need to be alert that you can have a cannabis use disorder um that can occur under circumstances similar to opioids spoken about the fact that at this stage there's no formal proof that smoking cannabis induces cancer so in summary cannabis is a plant we need a lot more research it's about what we think where the opioid puppy was 50 years ago it's not snake oil it doesn't work for everything some diseases and some symptoms it may work and for some it may work better we've got to look at the young people and the the chronically ill and the the older people not only mentally ill but all the people who have volume distribution problems um try not to smoke rather take the oil and if you're going to go on a trial let's start the trials that start low and go slow but please advise people to participate in the clinical trials so that we can move this forward thank you very much thank you dr jason um i'll just remind people to submit their questions at the bottom of the screen you can just go to the icon saying q a we do have a couple of questions that have come in dr chason um and one thing i i thought we'd start with is um and you did mention this on your slide you were talking um what i'm wondering if you could speak a little more about is um the key priorities for researchers right now like in the short term and you did touch on it but i thought we'd start with that maybe just talk a little bit about that you know when you look at them things that's a good question because i thought about that quite a lot and when i've looked at some of the trials because i've had many patients that have smoked cannabis and they all do seem to do a little bit better but when i've asked myself what is it that they're doing better about yes maybe their pains a little bit better and maybe they they smell the food better and they enjoy their food a little bit better and maybe they're not as anxious as what they were before they started smoking the cannabis and maybe they're not as nauseous as they were before they started smoking the cannabis and maybe they could breathe a little bit easier now that they started smoking the cannabis so it's working across all of those symptoms not just on one symptom so i think what we should be measuring is as the patients regards his own quality of life along all not only this the symptoms sphere but the emotional sphere the spiritual sphere because there are many people that found with the ultimate perception that they are they they're spiritual their soul feeling goes up as well and you know we cannot consider that a human being is just flesh and bones there's a mind and there's a body and there's a there's another aspect which is probably also playing a role and those kind of uh measurements need to be incorporated in order for us to find really how this struck is working oh very good thank you um so one of the questions that came in from a participant um can you comment on brain cell damage and thc so this is obviously gone on you know because it's fat soluble and because it's uh you know because because the cannabis does really go into the brain now we know that i don't know the exact number but millions of brain cells die off every minute so having a an external drug going into the brain and sitting there and however it's affecting that metabolism must have an effect you know i know that they've pushed hard to say that there's definite to brain cell damage but i haven't found any equivocal proof that that acute use of of cannabis causes acute brain cell damage we know that once a brain cell is dead it is dead it doesn't regenerate so they the is that if there is going to be enhanced death then we would expect that you know that the deterioration would be more rapid i've not yet found that people that take the cannabis have an increased incidence of dementia which is something that i would have liked to see but it may start happening remember of course that people did not volunteer that they're taking the cannabis so many people may have taken the cannabis and now presented with dementia but we don't yet have that association okay thank you thank you for that a couple more questions have come in so um how can we compare or discuss dosage is it by trial and effect i think that's what it is we have to standardize the right dose um medicinal cannabis is difficult to standardize the dose synthetic cannabinoids um as we you know i mean it's it's very much like taking the poppy plant and saying well we're going to make morphine out of this and we'll give you one poppy plant and you can have two and you can have three whereas if you synthesize and get a morphine standard and then you can compare the same doses of morphine with different people so too tears with cannabis and i think i do believe that that's the way that it will go scientifically that the the synthetic cannabinoids which are pure firstly and you know what's the constituent of it and you can reliably reproduce the exact amount of dose that is the way that we will eventually find out what is the correct dose for the correct patient okay perfect another question from a participant some family doctors will not prescribe so if patients need to or just want to buy commercially versus with a prescription how do patients ensure that their source is reliable this is a problem that helps canada have you know um it is there are doctors that don't want to scrub and we're hoping that these seminars will actually show them that they should on the other hand i do know many clinics that just prescribe you know you need to go there and you will be given the drug um i've never been to one of those clinics but i do know that they're all available and they are physicians and one would hope that the if there would be any problems that the patients would be able to go back to those physicians and say this is the effect that i had are you helping me to monitor it are you trying to help me with it or are you just handing it out so um i think that a lot of the pain clinics will be doing that because as i said the majority of it is pain but i think the value of of the cannabis is a lot more than the pain i'm of the belief that you're treating the whole person with a cannabis and so you should be looking at the whole person not just measuring the pain or the nausea the vomiting but how does that person find themselves within the in their family are they feeling that they they've still got a role is there meaning in living or not you know are you making a contribution to society that gives you meaning smoking cannabis may change that alteration from somebody feeling that they you know that they that they're a victim and they could become a victor about changing that they've got meaning in their life so measuring measurement of the effect of cannabis is not so straightforward okay very good um so another question and this is specific to something you mentioned in your presentation why did the neuropathic pain studies use thc rather than cbd okay so that remember that was taken a long time ago i think that part in the past year a few years realized that's not only cbd as i said i think there's about 1600 different components that they're discovering but at that stage that was what they were looking at they were looking more at the thc than what the cbd is yeah okay and i would do that study again with cbd in order to see what the results were and remember it was just very small just like less than 30 patients okay very good a couple more questions still before prescribing cannabis for a patient do you require the patient to sign a cannabis agreement and if yes can you share your agreement i mean maybe there's a template out there already but um they're asking specifically what you do i i've never i've never had a patient sign an agreement there may be patients that are on other kind of heavier drugs where you know that they do sign an agreement i know some of the opioid dependent patients sign this agreement if they take the methadone you know it the dependency is really so it's really negligible compared to you know even just a cigarette or alcohol so i've i've never had a patient that's become physiologically dependent perhaps psychologically dependent uh when which i think is probably more of a problem than actual physical dependency so no i've never had a patient sign an agreement okay um we have time for just a couple of more questions it's almost five to one so just a couple more questions dr jason uh can you comment on psychosis and thc so not not a direct question very very very real very real watch out for the people over 65. the the the the people with a you know with with very little body fat they may be chronically ill have never been exposed to drugs or you know any type of alterations or have a history of dependency or a history of psychiatric illnesses or history of having or even the patients having mild delirium those are the patients i would not give the structure i have seen little old ladies almost jump off buildings i've had two patients that are you know i wouldn't i won't do it again i saw it twice and i won't do it again so that it's very very real and when prescribing it watch out for the elderly frail person okay um someone asked about complaints around intestinal colic um is is that a common side effect or they didn't really specify in the question what they're asking is how common i haven't seen that written and i haven't had any patients telling me they've had that i wonder why it would okay but thank you i don't know about that thanks for addressing that um you mentioned variables but is there a recommended maximum daily dose that's probably hard to say we don't know though we don't know i would be very scared to go above the 9.4 percent though okay okay i'll i'll leave it uh to this being the last question is there a true cbd only option and if so does it also produce you know what else i saw in advert actually come through one of my emails the other day that is a true cbd option that's now available in in canada i don't know it it's it's hemp hemp is what cbd is and it's a pure hemp is it going to work i would hope it's going to work you don't need a you don't need a prescription for it that's what that what this advert said to me um but i think that i think that there is an amount of therapeutic validity for the thc as well so whether it's just cbd but once again the psychosis that it you have to be careful you've got to be careful history or there's any slight dementia or any previous reaction to some of these psychoactive drugs no ways don't do it okay very good um so we are approaching the um the end time so we're close to one o'clock i just want to say to participants thank you for joining and asking questions today um it's great to have you and thank you dr chason for your presentation and taking time to be with us we are sending a survey out to participants after this so those of you who are um who have registered and participated you'll get a short survey if you could just give us your feedback and if and let us know if there are any other topics along this area that you might be interested in so you'll see that shortly in your email so thank you everybody and uh we'll um end it there thanks very much thank you very much everybody i enjoyed being with you all i didn't see you but i enjoyed it okay thanks a lot bye", "WonzWlgPwJA": "[Music] Nihao everybody thank you for tuning in to mis TV today be sure to hit like and subscribe it's today we're gonna cover a new slightly unorthodox but very popular aspect of vaping C B D what is CB d now CBD which is an abbreviation of canna video is a completely legal non psychoactive extract taken from the larger cannabis plant now unlike the illegal yet far more popular tetrahydrocannabinol or THC CBD has had all psychoactive compounds stripped away from it meaning it has all of the shall we say physical effects of the plant without any of the mental effects of traditional cannabis now people have been using cannabis and cannabis derived medicines for years to treat many different symptoms however many are a little bit nervous about engaging with the devil's lettuce due to elements such as it illegality the sometimes complicated nature of procuring it wherever you are obviously you should be doing that because it's illegal and also the slightly nerve inducing or paranoiac aspects of it that many people do suffer from when trying to use it as a medicine now traditional THC operates on the body's cb1 receptors many of which are located in the brain CBD is a little different CBD operates on the body's cb2 receptors which are located primarily in the body's inflammatory system meaning that the effects of the substance are entirely physical and whilst not straying into language that I cannot use all of its effects are going to be those which operate on your body's inflammatory system so if you find you are having issues that involve inflammation CBD can be a very powerful compound now as you're probably aware by this point you are watching this video after all CBD is growing in popularity at a rapid pace here in brighton and hove alone we already have CBD specialist or CBD products told from help senses CBD dispensaries even cafes and kitchens which specialize in CBD infused cannabis and other foods containing CBD but you're here because you're interested in vaping now what would be the benefits of vaping it there are some when vaping CBD it enters the bloodstream far quicker than when ingesting it orally or using it as a topical balm this immediate and strong onset of effect can provide a lot of its users with a greater sense of control over the symptoms that they are choosing to treat with it and generally speaking when people vape it they can be very confident in the fact that they have a very determined idea of exactly what their dosages and when and how they're going to apply it now if you've chosen to vape CBD there are a couple avenues you can take some of which are related to ease of use other ones about more precise dosage and control of dosage now the easiest thing that you can do would be to purchase something like one of these ten mil pre-mixed CBD infused e-liquid by us here at mist the e-liquid clocking in at a hundred milligrams which is a fairly reasonably strong dose one that you'll certainly get the chance to feel and a great way to experiment with the subject with the substance without having to worry about it being too strong too weak anything like that using something like this all you would need to do is purchase yourself a simple mouth to lung kit or some kind of POD system and then like usual just go about filling it the way that you normally would no complication to it and those strangeness and like usual just pop it in the side and fill up to about the top of your window I do specify the use of a mouth to lung machine like this because the majority of pre-mixed CBD II liquids are going to be very PG heavy they're rarely very thick however there are as an alternative we would recommend these these are what we refer to as CBD booster shots these are effectively CBD top-ups all you would need to be doing is getting an empty tank popping in something like two to four to six droplets of this substance in there and then just filling it the rest of the way with your favorite eliquid these booster shots generally are going to be a little bit pricier than the pre-mixed ones but this is because they are going to last you these are far stronger coming in 500 milligram and a thousand milligrams spectively you will need to be adding this by the droplet now don't worry about getting nervous about measurements here on our website just type in CBD calculator we have a very simple to use robust system that will take a few details from you like how much CBD do you have let's say 10 mils of it how strong is it let's say 500 milligrams grant how big is your tank probably a 2 mil tank if you bought it in the UK and then what's your preferred daily dosage and then you just type that in hit the button that will instantly tell you how many drops of CBD booster to add to your tank so as to infuse it and infuse your favorite a liquid with your daily dosage now there are a couple different varieties of CBD that are used in a liquid and the mist range uses a particular one known as full-spectrum CBD as opposed to the previous industry standard of CBD isolate CBD isolate is painstakingly extracted from the plant and it's an extremely pure process they just take the absolutely necessary CBD from the plan the CBD we use here at mist is referred to as full-spectrum CBD full-spectrum as a post isolate takes everything it legally can from the plant so as to give you the most possible good in your substance we hope we've given you some good explanation as to the ease of vaping CBD today if you would like some more info please come on down to any of our retail locations for a good in-depth chat about your personal circumstance and how CBD could be of help to you we have a lot of customers who just come to a solely for CBD and CBD expertise so please don't hesitate to check us out be sure to hit like and subscribe because with the cooler end of the year approaching we've got some pretty fun vids come not satisfied", "Hu0iwsk6qEU": "hey guys welcome back to sunflower health foods my name is Gabriel and today we're gonna be talking about CBD oil alright guys as you can see we have a pretty big selection in our store of CBD oils now you might be wondering why would I want to take a CBD oil so simony has a couple different benefits some of the benefits include helping with chronic pain insomnia stress and nausea also it helps with cognitive function and brain health so some of those CBD products that we carry in our store come in different forms and have different purposes we have foils soft gels and then we also have the creams which are topical so one of my personal favorites of the oils that we sell in our store also a customer favorite is this oil here by a straight hem they are super pure company based out of Colorado and everything they do is super clean there's no additives or anything else just CBD in him so the straight hemp oil does use the whole plant extract meaning it does have that little bit of THC but for those of you that are looking for one that is THC free we do have a selection of those down here they are all by garden of live which is another super clean brand but just no THC in there they only use the stem of the hemp plant moving on to the soft gels we do have a pretty big selection on those as well one being the urban brand now they also make a super super clean product very pure no additives and some of them they do have a couple of blends with tumeric and other things but for the most part super clean super pure moving on to the creams now if you have a localized pain these are perfect for taking that away very very fast no mess if you don't like take anything internally just topical put it right on the spot get rid of the pain so for that we do have one buy straight hemp the same brand I was telling you about earlier another super pure product there's a couple different essential oils in there with the hemp and CBD just help kind of get rid of that information in pain another softgel is won by garden of life the same grand I was talking about earlier there's their soft gel as well as their oil with both THC free so you don't have to worry about any of that they do have a couple different blends here with their soft gels there's one for relaxing sleep inflammatory response so if any of those interests do we do up those as well so if you're looking for something without the THC that's a great choice for you then we have the South so if you have a localized pain that you're trying to get rid of them the could be arthritis it could just be tennis elbow any type of pain put it on the spot it's gone within four or five minutes of applying it for those of you looking for a less concentrated version of the Sun we do offer the lotion so if it's a large-scale area it's a lot easier to apply that directly to the spot CBD provides

more than knowledgeable staff will be happy to help you find a product that suits you", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment below if you've got your own opinions bye", "kmYgH54FaCk": "hey everyone Ashton here with yogi approved and today I'm going to share with you my experience using CVD MD bath bombs let's check out what makes this product so unique bath bombs are all the rage when it comes to self care from the aromatherapy to the relaxation for your body and the soothing calming benefits for your mind also just the excuse to get you in the bathtub but when we add CBD to our bath bombs it takes that element of relaxation to a whole new level now for those of you who are unclear or maybe new to what CBD is let's break it down really fast so CBD is derived from the hemp plant and it is not psychoactive it does not contain any THC and it does not get you high but it does incorporate the therapeutic and relaxing elements of the hemp plant so when we put CBD together in a bath bomb it's just going to increase and boost the overall benefits of taking a bath to begin with up until CBD box I typically just used Epsom salt baths and while they were relaxing I didn't feel those long-term effects so what I noticed with these CBD bath bombs is that I feel the achiness and the soreness of my body melt away in the tub I'm not saying it's a cure-all but I am saying I can feel the difference and my favorite part about using these bath bombs is when I get out so after I'm done with my bath I still feel so relaxed and I'm able to sleep better I also noticed that I wake up feeling less sore which is really amazing to start my day on that note another part that I love about the CBD MD bath bombs is the aromatherapy they have six cents none of them disappoint my favorite is the standard lavender which is their relaxed scent and this aroma just fills the space it fills the tub and you can enjoy this scent throughout your bath each of these bath bombs contains 100 milligrams of broad-spectrum organic CBD CBD MD states that these bath bombs are safe for any skin type because they use natural coloring and no artificial ingredients or preservatives one important thing to note is that they do use food coloring for this color so if you have any sensitivities to that that's something to be aware of also some of these since due tint the water which is kind of fun but none of them have actually stained the bathtub what I respect about CBM D is that they are third-party tested meaning that their CBD is tested for quality and safety by a third party source finally for the amount of CBD that you're getting in each bath bomb this is a really great price point and even more of a value if you opt for their variety pack if you're interested in learning more about these CBD MD bath bombs or learning more about CBD itself you can click on the links below or read the full article review thank you so much for joining me and I'll see you next time", "WekMGzxRPig": "hi I'm dr. Dani Gordon and welcome to\ndr. Dani TV and this is the Cannabis wellness show where I talk about all\nthings cannabis and CBD I'm a medical doctor and I specialize in something\ncalled integrated medicine which is\nevidence-based natural medicine and in cannabis medicine and I've treated\nthousands of patients with medical cannabis in CBD over the years and this\nis where I share all of that knowledge with you so in this episode today we're\ngoing to be talking about CBD used for chronic pain so how can CBD help chronic\npain conditions what kind of chronic pain conditions it helps with and which\nones it may not be so helpful with and then we're going to talk about how to\nactually use CBD and the experiences I've had using high CBD types of hemp in\nmedical cannabis with my patients with chronic pain so this is a question I get\nasked all of the time in facebook groups by email and of course with my patients\nis they really want to try to use CBD and usually in an oil forms of CBD oil\nfor their chronic pain now there's some CBD oils that you can get\nover-the-counter in some countries that are from hemp and they don't have any\nTHC in it or less than 0.2 percent THC so basically none and then there's the\nmedical cannabis that really has high high high CBD low THC but does it a\nlittle bit of detectable THC in it let's say 1% THC so in my medical practice in\nCanada where medical cannabis is legal I use a lot of very high CBD very low THC\noils to help patients with chronic pain now chronic pain it's a just a huge\nbroad area of medicine because there's so many areas where pain can come from\npain can come from the nervous system being injured and come from the nerves\ncalled neuropathic pain or nerve pain it can come from inflammation so if someone\nwho has an autoimmune disease or they have arthritis from just wear and tear\nthey can all get different types of pain and you have pain in the nerve endings\nand you have pain in the body and then you have pain that starts in the brain\nthat's again something called central pain so with all of these different\ntypes of pain actually one of the most important systems in our body to manage\npain is our own cannabis system in our body our endocannabinoids system so what\nthis means is that when we are facing pain whether it's chronic pain or acute\npain there's molecules in our body there's\nchemicals our body makes to help fight that pain and our body makes cannabis\nlike compounds cannabis like molecules called endocannabinoids it helps to\nreally regulate our pain perception how we kind of perceive pain and also how\npain really changes the brain over time so a really common question I get is you\nknow what should I do when I've already tried CBD from somewhere over the\ncounter from a hemp store for example for my chronic pain and it didn't do\nanything does that mean that cannabis medicine in general and CBD in general\nit just can't help me the answer is usually no usually the answer is that it\nprobably can be helpful somewhat but it really depends on the type of CBD the\nconcentration of CBD it's different for every person in every pain condition and\na lot of other factors like was it a full spectrum cannabis medicine product\nwith lots of different chemicals in it besides the CBD or was a just CBD\nwithout anything else like a CBD islip what I find with a lot of chronic pain\nconditions is because CBD actually interacts with our own cannabis system\nin our own bodies called the endocannabinoid system it doesn't\nactually turn pain off directly like a painkiller for example what it does\ninstead is it down regulates our perception of pain and the kind of tones\nour our nervous system so to speak so it can help with chronic pain over a period\nof time but often times it might take weeks or months to see in effect and it\ndoesn't cure chronic pain so you have to keep taking it so what can happen with a\nlot of people is they start taking a very small amount of CS CBD oil and they\ndon't really see much difference if anything oftentimes they have to use a\ndifferent dose a different product or sometimes adding a tiny bit of THC\nso using in Canada for example where this is legal a strain of cannabis oil\nthat has a tiny bit of THC and still very very high amount of CBD actually\nworks better for chronic pain in many cases because it actually binds directly\nto some of the the pain receptors using the THC and then the CBD makes the THC\nwork even better even at these tiny little doses so normally even at those\ntiny doses of THC people don't normally feel impaired or high so a lot of times\npeople think that CBD oil is going to work directly for their chronic pain but\nagain because CBD actually doesn't bind to either one of the cannabis like\nreceptors in our body the cb1 or the CBT receptor like THC does it works in a\nmore kind of overall toning capacity like a lot of herbal medicines it's all\nabout really toning the nervous system and this is where CBD can be helpful\nover time there's also still so much we don't know about CBD and about the\ncannabis plant in general we're really only at the beginning of our scientific\nunderstanding and this is really I mean I mean when I say the beginning I mean I\nread the most up-to-date cutting-edge research every week on this topic and\nI'm still feeling like you know we're really at the beginning so that being\nsaid how can you actually use CBD if you have chronic pain well one way that you\ncan use it is you can help use it to help decrease the anxiety that comes\nwith chronic pain because what happens when you have chronic pain is in the\nback of your mind even though your brain gets used to having chronic pain it\ntakes up so much bandwidth in your brain so much mental and brain energy to\nbasically dampen the pain signals so you can just go about your life and not feel\nlike you're in constant trauma that over time it can cause a lot of brain anxiety\nand it can cause a lot of fatigue so what I find seem to be helpful with when\nsomeone has chronic pain one of the ways there's many but one of the ways is\nhelping to decrease the brain anxiety levels so basically it helps kind of\ncalm their brain down which dampens the fight-or-flight response or you know the\ndanger response system in the brain and that also dampens pain signals and it\nalso dampens our pain perception because when you have chronic\nyour nervous system is on edge all of the time it's like you're caught in this\nfight or flight running away from a saber-toothed tiger cycle all of the\ntime and everything is heightened so your awareness of everything of sounds\nof smells of bright lights and of pain everything gets amplified so basically\nit just helps kind of calm everything down a notch and even in itself that's\nreally helpful with chronic pain sufferers another way that can actually\nhelp chronic pain is if the chronic pain has an inflammation component so that's\nactually most types of chronic pain even indirectly if you have nerve pain\nsometimes there's an inflammation component as well so what CBD does in\nanimal models we know and we think in humans although we need really bigger\nresearch studies to say exactly how this works but it's probably very similar to\nwhat we're seeing in animal models is that CBD actually works on inflammation\nthrough a number of different pathways in the body so it can shut down\ninflammation in some pathways so if pain is coming from inflammation CBD used\ndaily over time may help reduce inflammation and that kind of pain as\nwell another factor in many forms of chronic pain even if you didn't start\nout this way is the longer the pain goes on the nervous system tries to adapt to\nthe pain and basically your own endocannabinoid system in your other\npain control systems they get out of whack they just don't work as well and\nthey kind of reach this new baseline this new kind of dysregulated baseline\nof I'm okay but actually the nervous system is really just regulated so this\nis where CBD may be able to help again because it may be able to help rebalance\nthe endocannabinoids system when it's gotten out of whack so the last thing\nthat I'm just gonna mention is okay what types of chronic pain do I see enjoy\ntreat with medical cannabis and high CBD strains especially so I see quite a\nvariety of chronic pain conditions one of the really interesting things that\nI've noticed in my clinical work with patients and this is not something\nthat's really in the published literature yet is after someone's\nreceived chemotherapy for cancer in many cases they use different drugs that\nreally affect numbness and tingling and burning sensations of burning pain\nthe hands and the feet and this is kind of a neuropathic or nerve type of pain\nthat specifically people get after a lot of chemo therapies especially the breast\ncancer chemotherapy regimens and what I've found is when patients use CBD oil\nafter they finish their chemo and they keep using it their pain their burning\npain in their hands and their tingling pain in their hands and their feet tend\nto tend to go away a lot quicker then I would say on average so it may be really\na place specifically receiveed II show some promise there's some animal studies\non that type of pain specifically using CBD and we need more research to say\nexactly how it works in humans but it's really promising another type of pain\nthat I treat is fibromyalgia I also treat arthritis pain and pain that's\nassociated with a lot of other chronic diseases so I'm gonna talk about each of\nthose in another video specifically but in general I think for chronic pain CBD\nholds a lot of promise especially when it's combined with other\nchemicals in the cannabis plant and potentially with other herbals and other\nmedications so if you like this video please subscribe to our Channel and

doctor Gundry podcast on this program we never shy away from controversial topics and today is no exception my guest Jenny sanssouci and I will be discussing the healing properties of cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms jenny is a health coach wellness blogger and the author of the new book the rebels apothecary a practical guide to the healing magic of cannabis CBD and mushrooms now she became an expert on these ancient remedies after her father was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer as it turns out something that was once considered taboo was key in helping her dad so she's here today to tell you how you can use these plants and fungi safely Jenny welcome to the program thanks so much for having me well this is gonna be fun so can you start by telling our listeners about why and how you got interested in mushrooms and cannabis sure yeah well in 2017 Thanksgiving 2017 my dad was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer as you said and that moment was a real before-and-after moment in my life if anyone you know has been diagnosed with cancer and knows someone diagnosed with cancer you know that hearing that information just completely changes your life in one instant so as soon as he got diagnosed I knew that I wanted to help in whatever way I could whether that was with nutrition or supplements or you know cooking for him or finding remedies that could work for him plant-based remedies anything that I could you know could get my hands on I wanted to I wanted to try to find for him and I had been working in the wellness world for many years and I had some connections with functional medicine doctors and people in the wellness arena and so I had this arsenal of people to reach out to and ask you know what are the things that I should look into when it comes to helping someone with not only treating the cancer but really helping with the chemotherapy side-effects in the immune system because I knew that I didn't know much about chemo or cancer at the time but I did know that that chemo can really affect the immune system and people can not tolerate it sometimes because their immune system is so weakened so I just thought you know what can I do to help my dad and I just went full force into the research and cannabis and medicinal mushrooms were the two things I kept hearing about over and over again and once I started to dive into the research there it was really really promising so that's that's the route we decided to go on so just so that everybody understands your dad was getting chemotherapy and so you're not going to come on and say you my dad never got chemotherapy all he did was have a joint and chew on a mushroom you know in fact in fact my dad was definitely sure that he wanted to go the traditional chemotherapy route for treating his cancer and I was not about to try to you know get him to do otherwise I'm not a doctor so I was not gonna I wasn't gonna go there but I knew that I could support him with some home remedies and we you know we talked to his oncologist and we got his oncologist on board with all the different things we were trying and he said you know I don't know if this is gonna help but it probably won't hurt so go ahead and we'll just keep monitoring his progress so he has the you know the chemotherapy regimen at the hospital and then we've had our our home regimen that we've been doing on the side you know that's actually great to hear because I work with a lot of cancer patients as well and so many of their their oncologists tell them no you know you may not do alternative therapies during this chemotherapy you know how dare you don't even come near this stuff it will hurt your chances so tell me actually tell us about that process how'd you how'd you find an oncologist that lets you do this number one yeah that's a really good point because I hear that from so many people that their oncologist said no absolutely not don't try cannabis you know medicinal marijuana CBD mushrooms and they say maybe it will hurt or they just don't have enough information about it to be able to say it's okay and luckily for us we we were paired with an oncologist who was open-minded to it he definitely did not recommend that we do it and he said you know this may not do anything but I'm not gonna tell you know so he didn't we were really lucky in that sense because a lot of oncologist don't do that so what I always tell people to do is when they speak to their oncologist about potentially using home remedies and their oncologist says no maybe you'll agree with this I always say what's the exact reason why they're saying no is there something specific to your condition maybe there is maybe there is a drug interaction maybe there is something very specific to you and you shouldn't use these home remedies or you know if not like maybe ask me on college if you on college us if you could try it for one cycle you know until your next scan and see if everything is still okay you know if there's not a specific reason to you maybe maybe they'd be willing to just let you see how it goes for one cycle so what made you tell us about the your research that said you know we need to look into cannabis and CBD and medicinal mushrooms what brought that to the forefront well one of the things that happened really early on when my dad first got diagnosed is he watched a documentary about medical marijuana and it was and he had just recorded it because he thought it looked interesting he wasn't even interested in it for himself he just wanted to watch it and it was all about cancer patients that were using medical cannabis and having really good results you know not only with their cancer but with their with their side effects of their chemo and so he his ears perked up at that immediately and at the same time CBD was just starting to emerge and one of my friends said hey just look into CBD and cancer and see what you find and I started researching that and I found so many stories of people who were using medical cannabis and CBD who have cancer and were experiencing relief and then I started to look into studies I went to a medical cannabis conference I started to get in touch with medical cannabis doctors and ask them what their experience had been and I just went straight down the rabbit hole and I I was you know I was really impressed by what I found in medical cannabis and then with the mushrooms I had already known that medicinal mushrooms could be helpful for the immune system that was something that was already in my consciousness but I didn't know a lot about them and when I started to go down the route the route of researching mushrooms I found so much information there is about medicinal mushrooms being used in cancer hospitals and other parts of the world and people using it to help their immune systems know is really really interesting okay so explain to people as if they don't know the difference may hopefully most people know so what's the difference between cannabis CBD and medicinal mushrooms and our medicinal mushrooms different than magic mushrooms yeah so cannabis CBD is part of the cannabis plant it's a compound within the cannabis plant and it's a compound that doesn't get you high so THC is the compound that most people are familiar with inside the cannabis plant that does get you high so they're two different molecules that are both within the same plant the mushrooms the medicinal mushrooms all the ones that my dad is taking and most of the ones that I write about in the book are completely non psychedelic so there's you know when people think about mushrooms they usually think of grocery-store mushrooms like button mushrooms portabellos Khomeini's or magic mushrooms that are going to take you on it on a trip there's another class of mushrooms that's considered medicinal mushrooms which is their edible and you know you can consume them and they have medicinal properties but they're not psychedelic gotcha and you want for the listeners you want to name some of those medicinal mushrooms yeah yeah some of the the ones that that I cover in the book and that my dad has been taking everyday chaga mushroom reishi turkey tail is a big one that's one of the first ones that we got him started on shitake is a wonderful actually a really great one for right now - because it's shitake has been shown to be antiviral so that's a really interesting one to look at lion's mane and cordyceps and maitake I believe those are those are all the all the ones and then I do I do cover magic mushrooms a little bit in the book too because there's some really interesting things going on in the search with with psilocybin which is a compound inside magic mushrooms but that's not the main thing that that we've been focusing on but it's definitely an interesting one to pay attention to all right so you keep bringing up the immune system with mushrooms in terms of medical marijuana and CBD where where's the benefit that with this in in cancer patients sure yeah with the immune system with the cannabis what we had found with our research into cannabis is that THC and CBD both have properties that have been shown to kill tumors and and slow tumor growth and they can help with the immune system there's not enough research there yet because they can't do clinical trials on cannabis because of the legality so this is a lot of preliminary research and anecdotal stories so that's with cannabis with the mushrooms all of the mushrooms that I just mentioned aside from magic mushrooms but all the medicinal mushrooms that I mentioned have been shown to have immune system modulating properties so they don't necessarily stimulate the immune system or you know dampen the immune system they balance the immune system so they're they're considered adaptogens so they can just help keep your immune system in balance and all of them are really powerful for you know keeping that immune system strong yeah we I have a patient who oh I think he's now 10 years out from stage 4 pancreatic cancer and he we treated him basically with a raw food diet and a lot of mushroom extracts particularly coleus turkey tail and he's like I say knock on wood he's cancer-free now for 10 years and it's amazing now so I'm a huge supporter you know using plant-based therapy in cancer so and I'm you know again I've seen it with my own eyes and and and written about it in my books so can any of these I know that when you have chemotherapy it's not exactly the most wonderful trip so and a lot of patients complain of pain of GI upset of sleep of energy loss anxiety what's the deal with these compounds with that yeah well the cannabis my dad the cannabis that my dad has been taking in a lot of other cancer patients also take this it's a very highly concentrated cannabis oil that comes in a little plastic syringe and you eat these small droplets of this cannabis oil tiny tiny droplets the size of a grain of rice and that can give you around 50 milligrams of THC and 50 milligrams of CBD if you have a one to one ratio product in one drop so that's a very high dose for people that don't know about 10 milligrams of THC is considered a recreational dose that someone may you know use to get high so 50 milligrams is a really really high amount so you have to really start slowly with that kind of medical cannabis product but what my dad has found with that it is really really taken away his nausea completely he's barely ever had nausea and it's two and a half years in now he's hardly had any nausea his appetite came back as soon as he started taking this cannabis oil which a lot of cancer patients I'm sure you know they completely lose their appetite they lose so much weight and that really contributes to them feeling sicker and sicker as time goes on because they're not able to nourish themselves so that was amazing right off the bat he started to be able to eat full meals again and feel really well and then he sleeps great because he takes a higher dose at night he doesn't like to take a higher dose during the day because he still wants to get things done and not feel too you know impaired by the THC but at night he's okay taking a little bit more and he has slept well the entire time so I think that has been the main that's helped ease his side effects from chemotherapy and then I believe that the mushrooms are what's keeping his immune system strong so he hasn't been weakened by the chemo got you so your book is trying to remove the the drug stigma of cannabis and mushrooms why is that important to you well yeah you know when III quit drinking and quit using all drugs back in 2007 so it's been for me I swore off cannabis and mushrooms back then and alcohol and you know I used cannabis and mushrooms in college recreationally and I never thought of them as medicine I never would have even had a reason to think of it as medicine and so for me that part is really important because my perception of all of this has completely changed throughout my research and I've done so much research now into you know the prohibition of cannabis and you know the legalization of psychedelic mushrooms and it is just it has always been focused around patients and I mean of course there's people that that want to use it recreationally but there has been so much focus throughout the years on you know getting these plants to patients who really who really need to find relief and I didn't realize that before so it's really important to me to try to help to shift that perception to see how these can be medicinal for people and that it's not just about getting high or or going on a mushroom trip it's it's so much more than that so you mentioned that the dose is is enough to get you high what if what if you don't want this effect how do you avoid it yeah so if you're using these in the in the book I do talk about a lot of different wellness wellness topics and not just cancer so for cancer patients specifically if you do want to take the THC and use that medicinally and not feel the high you're just gonna want to work up really really slowly a tiny tiny tiny amounts of THC for most people two milligrams of THC is the the threshold if you go above two milligrams you kind of start to feel those those intoxicating effects if you start a little bit lower and move up you know every few days a couple more milligrams and just monitor how you're feeling that can be a really helpful way if you don't want to feel it at all I would take a high CBD product with little to no THC in it and that will you know give you the medicinal effects of the CBD without without having the THC but they do work better together so if you have a little bit of each in there they boost each other up so if you can tolerate a little bit of THC for the medicinal effects that's great but you don't have to you know and if you're not using it for for your cancer journey and you're using it more for wellness then you can absolutely just take a high CBD product with very small trace amounts of THC okay so let's get away from cancer for a minute and let's talk about wellness so give us your take it's the thoughts or the book on why these may promote wellness how do they pronoun promote wellness and let's go from there sure well one of the things that I found right off the bat through my research for my dad was all these different ways that it might be able to help me to which is you know a totally different realm of why I use them versus why my dad using them but for CBD in particular some of the the main things people use it for our pain sleep and anxiety those are probably the top three and I personally found help with sleep right away and the interesting thing with sleep anxiety and pain is that a lot of times when people can't sleep it's because of anxiety or pain either they they have some painful part of their body and they can't sleep because of that or racing thoughts having having those anxious feelings during the night not being able to sleep so using the CBD can take away the thing that is keeping you from sleeping and help you sleep deeper which is what I experience because I can have anxiety when I'm trying to fall asleep and before I started on CBD I would frequently you know take a long time to fall asleep and then wake up a lot during the night with racing thoughts and when I started the CBD I was really - just sleep better so that was that was awesome and as far as the pain goes there was another kind of before-and-after moment that my dad experienced with CBD which was before he got on the medical marijuana train he was just taking CBD that's all we had access to at the time and what he noticed right off the bat was that his joint pain went away just from taking the CBD he was taking CBD capsules and he said I don't even need to take advil anymore he used to have all this joint pain walking up and down the stairs he's been an athlete his whole life so he says all these aches and pains and he was like I'm I'm impressed by that and he's not one of those people that just gets on the bandwagon quickly you know so he that was really impressive so the pain sleep and anxiety are three things that CBD can be amazing for so let's I have a lot of patients who have tried CBD primarily for sleep and for pain and I would say that just as a general rule 50% of them seem to respond and 50% of them don't and of the people who respond what's been fascinating to me is half the people particularly with pain respond to the topical CBD but don't to the oral and the other half they respond to the oral but not to the topical so help me understand this what's going on sure well yeah a base level of why people respond to it differently is because we all have an endocannabinoid system as I'm sure you know in our body that responds and reacts with the cannabis directly so and everyone has their own dr. Ethan Russo who's a cannabis researcher he he calls it the endocannabinoid tone that we all have this baseline tone kind of like everybody has a different digestive system you know your gut flora is going to be different than mine you have a different endocannabinoid system than me so you may have different levels of natural cannabinoids which we make in our body in your system than I do so the cannabis will well and CBD in particular will kind of raise those love raise the levels of the natural cannabinoids that we have in our system so if someone has a lower amount versus a higher amount they're gonna respond differently which is why dosing can be really tricky and is really really personal with CBD dosing and method of delivery like you said some people will respond to a topical some to a tincture it's all gonna really be based on the person's individual endocannabinoid system so let's talk about dosing and how do you know what you're getting obviously marijuana and CBD are legal here in California and we've we've got these shops almost on every street corner now and how how do you figure out okay well is this stuff legit this stuff came from hemp this actually came from the marijuana plant some people argue no no you got to have marijuana base CBDs hemp CBDs no good come on help us sort this out yeah well you're you're lucky to be in California because I really think California especially at the license dispensaries have have have it figured out in a really wonderful way I wish that all dispensaries could be like the ones that I've visited in California and that's because they have a very wide array of ratios of product ratios out in California with different levels of CBD to THC that you can pick from and choose your your ratio because like I said if the more THC in a product the more you're gonna feel those intoxicating effects and so you know you can have a ratio of eight to one CBD to THC or twenty to one and you can try all these different ratios to see what works for you so I think that's wonderful but to answer your question the most important thing right now when you're looking for a product especially a CBD product that's not from a dispensary because those are unregulated you want to make sure you find you had they have a third-party lab test so that's to show that the amount of CBD that they say is in the product is actually on the lab test so if it says 25 milligrams per serving you want to say see that on the lab as well and you want to make sure that it's negative for heavy metals pesticides residual solvents that could have come through the processing because CBD like I said is totally unregulated right now it's really important to get those lab tests if you do get it from a licensed dispensary they have stricter regulations with the kind of products they're able to sell so you're probably better off that way but even if you're getting it from a dispensary you may want to ask and see the lab test to make sure what what you're getting is really what it says on the label so if I'm on my road trip and I stop at the gas station and they've got CBD oil at the checkout counter which I've seen that's probably not the one I want to buy for sure yeah you really want to do your research and make sure the company is is doing like I said those third-party lab tests meaning someone else is doing the lab tests it's not affiliated with the company so they can't you know make it up and it's and you want to make sure that they're using safe practices and then just answer your question about the hemp versus marijuana right now it's all legal terms so hemp hemp face CBD versus marijuana based CBD is basically just about the amount of THC and other cannabinoids which are other compounds within the cannabis plant that are in the product so if it's hemp hemp face CBD it's basically just very very minimal THC it was going to be in that plant that was grown for that CBD and if it's marijuana based CBD it basically just means that in that plant there was a higher level of THC and this is all you know these numbers are are just kind of you know the numbers that they're using to differentiate these plants but it's all the same comes from the same plant at the end of the day now bring us up to date the DEA once classified this substance as really nasty stuff where do we stand where do we stand with the DEA and where do we stand with the FDA with these substances well right now cannabis is still a schedule 1 drug federally so I hope that that will change I don't know for sure when it will I mean people predict that that will change within the next couple of years CBD in as of 2018 became legal federally which is why you see the CBD boom everywhere so CBD from hemp which just means point three percent THC or less is federally illegal anything more you have to get from a licensed dispensary which will be different in every state some states have Medical dispensaries only which you're gonna need a medical card in order to access those products and so you have to go to a doctor get approved for a medical marijuana card and then you can go to a dispensary some states have recreational or adult use dispensaries which is usually twenty-one plus and right now it just varies from state to state so things are changing everyday my hope is that it will become federally legal soon all right I'm going to throw you a something out of left field what do you know about black urine disease so I have a very good friend and I won't mention his name who ran a company that was really big into CBD and kind of put their whole careers into that and was working very hard with the FDA to get FDA approval for CBD and you probably know that the FAA does not approve so yeah yeah and interestingly enough and I did not know this because he said I'm sure you've heard a black urine disease and he said no I I haven't he says well it turns out that too much CBD can actually affect the same receptors in the liver that tylenol hits acetaminophen and can actually poison the liver and it was discovered because some very heavy CBD users notice their urine was turning dark like they hepatitis and it got the name black urine disease and he tells me and I'm not I haven't talked to the FDA about this that the FDA is worried that big-time CVD use and I don't know the dose may potentially damage the liver and that's why they put the brakes on this but but look it up it's fascinating yeah you know I have seen some things talking about CBD damaging the liver because of studies that they did in my surahs' and from what I could gather from these studies the amount of CBD they had to give these rats was was huge like thousands and thousands and thousands of milligrams of CBD like what it would what it would equal with a human it seemed very very I got huge stretch to me but I will look that up and see see what the what they're saying about black hair and disease that sounds pretty scary and you probably couldn't afford to take that much right so let's get back to that is there is there evidence is there at least anecdotal reports about the amount of CBD that you have to use to be effective you mentioned that everybody's endo cab enoyed systems different so what what what should people look for why do they try what do you recommend yeah as far as dosing I mean I've heard from doctors that practice with with cannabis medicine that some patients do well on five milligrams of CBD and some people do well on 500 milligrams of CBD depending on their condition so it's really really different but what I can say is a starting point for CBD you want to start really low and take it by itself and monitor how you feel you know every 15 minutes like do you feel anything different do you feel you're more relaxed do you feel any relief of pain do you feel any relief of anxiety or whatever it is that you're trying to find relief from and pay really close attention and only take more if you feel no nothing if you feel nothing take a little bit more you could start with like five milligrams even something really small and see if you feel anything if not you know around fifteen to twenty five milligrams is a standard dose for people for many people a standard kind of wellness dose and then if you're having a high amount of pain or anxiety you may need to take you may need to take a little bit more and just kind of move up until you find the relief that you're looking for or switch products if it's if it's not working for you or methods of delivery there like you said before you know topicals work really well for some people for people for pain for anxiety a lot of people like to take the tincture under the tongue because that works usually within 15 minutes or so and you can really measure your dose drop by drop so I would suggest starting with it with a sublingual tincture because that that's how you can really really get a measured dose and say okay I took it's this exact amount where some of the other methods you can't always know exactly how much you're taking okay so we talked about anxiety pain sleep and you use the buzzword the wellness dose of CBD so again help me experimentally anecdotally where does CBD fit in a wellness regimen sure well like I said before we all have this endocannabinoids system in our body that CBD works directly with and we have our own molecules inside our body that work with this same system that CBD can help to regulate those those molecules and they affect things like you know pain sleep the immune system anxiety depression mood they have they have so many things that this endocannabinoids system affects it really keeps you in homeostasis or keeps you in balance so taking CBD as a daily tonic is kind of you know tonify z-- your endocannabinoids system and can keep things in balance many people just find that taking it you know a day as a daily thing whether it's at night or during the day depending how you respond can just make you overall you know feel more balanced got you okay interesting dr. McCullen and I have talked about CBD for sleep when we've been on each other's podcast and we back years ago now did 20 milligrams of CBD sublingual before bed and tracked our sleep with an aura ring which I'm holding up on camera and quite frankly neither of us found any effect on our sleep and as I recall I won't put words in his mouth he even tried it with THC and also found no effect for him or me so we both kind of stopped doing it but you're right maybe our endo cab annoyed system is so phenomenally balanced and I hope it is that maybe we would not see that effect so that yeah or the other part is that sometimes taking certain amounts of CBD or THC can be more wake promoting for some people and especially taking a little bit too much THC can kind of make you have those racing thoughts or can cause anxiety for some people so that yeah I know this it is so so personal and some people will say I take CBD it makes me more focused and awake and some people say they take it and it makes them fall asleep so it's yeah it's an experimental journey alright so I'm sure everybody wants to know because you're a rebel apothecary in' should we be regulating these substances what's the best approach to regulating them if they should be regulated yeah I mean I really think that some of the licensed dispensaries in California are doing a really good job with with the way that they are providing their products I think that cannabis products with THC should be most likely just allowed in licensed dispensaries but I do think it should be federally legal I do think that people that wants access to cannabis medicine should be able to have access to it I don't think it should just be you know sold at gas stations and have these low quality products on the market I think that there should be should be staying third party lab testing for all cannabis products and all CBD products I do think they should be regulated in a way where they have to you know contain exactly what they say on the label so yeah I do I do think it should be legal federally and just as long as as long as the regulations are in place to keep people safe so we're not going to pull up to the gas station and get a six-pack of beer and a brownie to go I would say make your own brownies at home which there are some recipes AHA I knew I could get a plug in for you there you know with the magic mushrooms and legality and regulation they're the predictions that are happening for those are that they'll be legal within therapeutic settings because they are researching them for depression and even you know comparing them to SSRI depression drugs and seeing you know how they affect people so I think that those mushrooms which are currently illegal as well will will be available for use in therapy and I don't think those should just be you know available a gas station either those should be you know closely monitored yeah Mike Michael Pollan ism has made uh I think a very strong point that there is good increasing evidence that there is some bona fide medical use for these I think particularly in depression and yeah we need and you you know you argue for this that we need to look at this as another federally regulated license use of these products for specific reasons all right yeah absolutely and I think you're right and maybe you talk about that the use of these products kind of in your own home is probably at least in our state of understanding not a great idea this should be taken with a practice professional in a setting in a controlled setting what say you I say if we're talking about psychedelic mushrooms I would definitely recommend that people don't just try it alone whether it's with a trained therapist or someone who has a lot of experience guiding people through these types of sessions I definitely think that having having guidances is the way to go yeah I had a personal experience in college where I one of my members in my singing group dropped acid and decided to we were on the third floor of our dorm and he threw up open the windows and decided he was going to fly and luckily I grabbed him by his belt and pulled him back in this is a true story so I firmly believe from personal experience that this should be done in a guided setting yes yes if you take a little bit too much of a psychedelic compound you mean it can take you to places that you aren't ready to go by yourself so definitely right in 30 including the ground from a third-story window yeah all right well Jenny this has been great thanks so much for joining me and where do they find out about you your book your work first of all thank you so much for having me this has been just such a great conversation and I'm glad you have so much personal experience with the topic too that makes it really enjoyable to talk about so thank you my book is called the rebels apothecary so you can buy that anywhere where books are sold except right now we can't go into bookstores so online you can find that my blog is healthy crush calm and you can find me also on Instagram Jenny sanssouci healthy crush dot-com I'm sure there's a story what's the crush well the healthy cards I've actually been writing there since 2008 so I've been blogging about wellness and personal development topics for quite a long time and the healthy crush just kind of popped into my mind the tagline is a love affair with living well okay the way the way I've always felt about you know finding out about new wellness topics and getting excited about them and very very good very good okay it's time for our audience question Sandra Liliana on Facebook asks is keto diet safe for people with heart conditions believe it or not I do use my version of the ketogenic diet for my patients with heart disease who have also for instance diabetes as a co-founding factor and as a cause of their heart disease the key and my ketogenic diet is you got to eat about 80 percent of your calories from fat but that fat shouldn't be ribeye steaks it should be fats from avocados and for you people who are watching I have avocado socks on today and they should be from olive oil and the more olive oil macadamia nuts you eat macadamia nut oil sesame oil the better and the key of a ketogenic diet is to really severely limit your carbohydrates to really leaves and vegetables that are going to carry olive oil and avocados into your mouth that's totally different than a paleo or carnivore keto diet where the vast majority of the foods you're gonna eat our heavy cheese's heavy meats heavy fats you know three bottles of cream every day that's not what I use for my heart disease patients so you got to be careful in the term keto diet there's a good way to do keto and there's a bad way to do keto particularly for heart disease so that's a great question Sandra and thank you very much all right Jenny thank you again and good luck with the book and best wishes to your father how's he doing by the way he's doing fantastic I've actually been quarantined up here with him for the last six weeks and he has felt so good the whole time we keep saying we forget that he has cancer he's been off of chemo now for the past three months I'm just cuz he's been doing so well that his oncologist said why don't we give you a break and his blood markers are in the normal range his tumors have all been stable so we're happy hey very good very good all right keep up the good work great thank you so much thanks for having me take care and now it's time for the review of the week following my most recent episode ANCOVA 19 we Dobrin Ellie jr. on YouTube wrote thank you dr. Gundry clear info without fear and hype well thank you that was concise and we're trying to give you the up to date information without I put out the fear because as you know I'm dr. Gundry and I'm always looking out for you so see you next week thanks for the review before you go I just wanted to remind you that you can find the show on itunes google play stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts because i'm dr Gundry and i'm always looking out for you [Music]", "3EwjJtrdols": "I love it when you guys write in with your own questions concerning your own health and wellness one recently came in asking the relationship between taking CBD oil in its potential negative effects on the liver now I want to start out by saying that commonly it takes an average of 17 years for a subject matter in health and medicine to be initially investigated and then for it to be ultimately implemented in modern day medical practice 17 years that's amazing now I understand that CBD oil is a hot trending topic right now especially over the last five years and ultimately the answer to this question may be we don't know yet there are some negative studies and they're also also some positive studies and also be advised that the media has been known to root misreport research on cannabis a recent article came out in Forbes magazine where the scientific author stated that CBD oil taken orally might be just as dangerous as alcohol or taking acetaminophen these substances have safe daily recommended amounts that may not harm the liver but while alcohols abuse is well-known an acetaminophen toxicity has replaced viral hepatitis as the most common cause of acute liver failure in the u.s. CBD has very little abuse potential because it is non-intoxicating so its users have no incentive to approach similar levels say as alcohol and the same author begrudgingly conceded that there is research on the positives of CBD he brought up a study showing that cannabis users have a significant dose-dependent reduction in the odds of developing each of the four major stages of alcoholic liver disease CBD oil regulates 50 genes the key word here is regulate CBD works to regulate the rest of the body and help it to calm to homeostasis CBD actually has over 80 mechanisms of action generally speaking therapeutics CBD oil doses range from 0.5 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to 20 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day so one study in mice use significantly higher doses of CBD than what is typically taken for therapeutic benefits in humans the study in Forbes magazine to put that into perspective that would be over 1300 milligrams of CBD per day and adult Wayne a hundred and fifty pounds that is much higher than the typical daily dose of casual CBD oil users most people stick somewhere in the range of 10 to 80 milligrams per day with slightly higher doses for insomnia certain therapeutic effects and flare-ups the few studies prefer performed on how CBD affects the liver are a little conflicting and not entirely clear in one study ten percent of the subjects developed higher liver enzymes they actually had to stop using the CBD oil for this reason while other research suggests that CBD oil can actually improve liver function as determined by these studies CBD is metabolized by the liver people with non alcoholic liver disease are encouraged to limit any over-the-counter medications to avoid stressing the liver including CBD oil CBD significantly attenuated or lessens the alcohol feeding induced increase in liver enzymes in one study liver inflammation and oxidative nitrate of stress CBD treatment also attenuated or lessened the respiratory burst of white blood cells isolated from chronic alcohol fed mice and from humans and decrease the alcohol induced increase liver triglycerides and fat droplet accumulate in the liver furthermore CBD impacted alcohol induced hepatic metabolic dysregulation and fatty accumulation by restoring changes in the liver thus CBD in this study the authors concluded may actually have therapeutic potential in the treatment of alcoholic liver diseases associated with inflammation oxidative stress and fatty accumulation in the liver in another study ischemia or reperfusion they looked at and it's a pivotal mechanism of liver damage after liver transplantation or liver surgery in this study CBD significantly reduced the extent of liver inflammation oxidative nitrate of stress and cell death and also attenuated the bacterial endotoxin trib triggered activation and inflammatory markers of the all-important kupffer cells in the liver these protective effects were preserved in the liver in this study thus the authors concluded CBD may represent a novel protective strategy against reperfusion injury by attenuating key inflammatory pathways and oxidative nitrate of tissue injury now we do know that some metabolites of CBD oil inhibit phase 2 detoxification pathways in the liver which theoretically can cause a problem because if you have phase 1 detoxing and pushing off those toxins 2 phase 2 and phase 2 is inhibited you get the buildup of potentially more toxic chemicals in the bloodstream the major cellular event in the development and progression of liver fibrosis is the activation of what's called the liver stellate cells in one research articles the authors proposed that CBD by selectively inducing death of activated cells represents a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis word of advice all CBD oil is not created equally a recent report by the cannabis testing lab can a safe to the California's Bureau of cannabis control BCC for example stated that somewhere between 69 and 80% of CBD products failed to make the label claims so is CBD harmful for the liver we may not know yet we need to perform more studies there's no

on you say hello have you had a good day I'm glad you look happy yeah are you watching that some YouTube some Katy Perry huh Chu Jam rock out girl okay I've got a project that I'm working on you guys saw Priscilla's like DIY vanity that we did with the IKEA table and all that the ring lights great for what it's for but it doesn't quite work with her doing the makeup and stuff so I'm doing something different here I ordered this mirror isn't that cool it's a big old mirror good sized mirror and then I got these lights too and it has a dimmer switch on it stuff in there LED lights so we're gonna try this on this and this should give her exactly what she's looking for then I'll show you guys the finished product okay here's the finished product what do you think sweet right look at that Priscilla's Mir I got the lights put on there and they kind of make like a border thing I know they sell like some Hollywood lights that you can get for it to that are little fancier looking but this will work better for Priscilla making video so but it's that that's her little phone stand for when she's doing her live feed and then this is the switch over here I just like stuck it to the mirror she can't turn on check that out and it's adjustable so bright that's cool right she's all set up ready to go I like this better for what she's doing the only reason is because this needs to be closer to her just because of the way the Facebook live works but other than that awesome the light ring I still love it just not for this setup so but if you guys want to link for any I'll put a link for this if you're interested it's great for doing video doing like the talking head stuff and then I'll put a link for that mirror and the light strip that I got off of Amazon down in the video description if you want to make your own little vanity I think it's awesome it works great are you being a tyrant your head no say no way [Music] multitasking pots pans of brazilian lipstick mama you're so excited aren't you work from home I said nice peaceful work environment I kind of feel like this whole vlog has been one big eye why the sponsor buy lipstick mama and fathering onto some merch well I mean it's things we're doing it is things we're doing it's our life so let's talk autism so those are vocal stems that she's doing or yelling as a vocalist then a little bit of frustration maybe she seems to get kind of frustrated this time of night it's just like a daily thing for her and then the clapping that's also stimming audible stim would be what sense is that I think [Music] that's why she does it not necessarily mad about anything I think she's a little overwhelmed just with the day in general but it's every day it doesn't matter what we do doesn't matter when we get out of house as a matter we stay home while they doesn't matter she goes as a fool or doesn't physical activity no physical activity it seems like it's every single afternoon so you guys haven't asked us a lot in the comments about CBD oil and we did start CBD oil and we did stop CBD oil for a full week in every single day that she was on it this was works like we had meltdown every single day yeah and it was way more violent than this she didn't sleep well the entire week so it's not it's not been great and it just didn't work for us you know I don't want it I don't want to I think you should give it at least a week you know we might have stopped it a little bit a little bit earlier than we should have yeah we're tearing out I was crying because we don't want to see her like that I mean we just don't want to we don't want to put her through that for more trials you know and it's just not something we're willing to do we did get a good CBD oil it was a it was actually a pretty high-end to see the oil but we didn't want to you know we're saying they wanted us to try it and then talk about it so you know of course I don't want to bash the company by any means I don't think it's a problem of their product at all just different things work differently with with different people you know I have a guilt melatonin we've been asked by melatonin for sleeping melatonin does not work at all for her it doesn't even touch her I mean it's she'll be up all night I guess where we're at right now is working we might need to work on this that she's experiencing in the afternoon so I'm gonna go sit with her and see what I can't calm her down some yeah is that the same thing that we do for the meltdowns when I sit down with her like that it tends to calm her down just to kind of help her a little bit so we're gonna do that so just so you guys know we did try the CBD oh yeah we chose we're very hopeful hopeful that it would work and it just didn't you know that the two things we were looking to reduce was aggression and anxiety and and both of those things I think actually were amplified by that which is not abnormal we've seen stories of that before where it has an adverse effect a totally opposite effect of what it should have I'm gonna help her a little bit all those summers doing a pretty good job helping you have all your things you okay good okay you need help I'll help you this is how it goes this is how we have to do it Abby shovels it in yeah we got a I'm gonna slow her down I mean too far away from me I gotta move your blood sugar [Laughter] here's the vial wait here's chillin okay guys fork down take a break take a break take a break put your fork down which fork down finished on what you got don't you finish chewing this is really hard for us to eat because we have to stop her after every large bite she takes one bite okay put it down they break good job now wait they should what drink no show me trick there you go same thing with a beverage okay okay okay okay this is so good I'm glad you like it you don't drink it all once doing good okay take a break drink you got extreme let's do first chill good job I mean eat what do you what do you know let's drink that's great no you don't one drink what do you want eat what go down you'll get a napkin okay go get it happen job you wait your face might be face there you go nice job so that's pretty much how every meal goes we had to slow her down we have to cut her food for obviously which allows her to eat faster than any of us but then we have to slow her down the whole time nice job you doing great slowly but surely we'll get to where she can eat on her own and she's taking breaks on her own and we may have to start a protocol an eating protocol with that don't you think so that's what we were talking to Brandi about was some kind of okay a mealtime protocol is to keep sending candy and grabbing packages so we're hoping that's in one of these packages but we don't have Isaiah here so we had to improvise so we have Isaiah version 2.0 complete with button-down shirt and everything [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] slinky says life doesn't have to be

arthritis pain it's made with our proven pain relief formula and boosted with high quality raw hemp oil the screen provides relief when you need it the most and both of these creams are from a company I get called diamond CBD and I'll link down below the website but to be honest with you I started out with the higher strength one the 1500 milligrams and it knocked my socks off with pain you guys I mean I get joint pain and every joint specifically my hands my knees my back my neck and yeah it's crazy I get a lot of pain from being and chronic pain from fibromyalgia and with my arthritis in my my right hip and my lower lumbar which is my lower back it gets irritating so I put on a little dollop of this and I'm not sure if these both have the same ingredients but they might be very similar but let's talk about the thousand milligram one because that'd be a good place to start out they do make 500 milligram ones as well and this one right here is on sale right now plus if you sign on to their website and sign up if you're a teen or years or older because these are THC free CBD creams then you get 35% off I'll link down that coupon code - I believe it's welcome in all capital letters and then the numbers three and five but don't quote me on that but um yeah the ingredients in these and this is why I like them the first ingredient Halong coffee break delicious venti iced decaf nonfat latte with three stevia's and extra light ice that's my drink of choice industrial hemp cannabidiol or CBD menthol purified water we've got alcohol mineral oil we've got stearic acid we've got glycerol aloe vera powder another alcohol EDTA we got la Vera gel some things I don't know how to pronounce some other things we've got camper which is a good cooling agent we got tea tree oil that's another good cooling agent for the joints and muscles in vitamin E and there's a couple of ingredients all packed in there and I'll link it all down below for you guys THC free lab tested made in the United States of America made with industrial hemp non GMO like I mentioned and no pesticides and thousand dollar grand one is great and it says for the instructions to not apply more than four times a day massage is not necessary just apply it to the skin smells nice and soothing it's really nice and creamy it stays in there but be careful when you open the jar I've already done one application on my hands but as you can see I'm just using a little gulps worth I'm gonna put it in the areas that hurt the most and we're gonna rub that in for some relief pain relief and then I'll let you guys know what I thought about this side of a 10 star but yeah if you're just trying out I'd say if you have pretty extreme pain like myself like a 9 out of 10 10 to the 10 on your worst days I would go with the high strength 1500 milligrams because that's just like the best option and it's worth the price I believe right now it was normally it's a little pricey 199.99 for the 1500 milligram illustrate the milligrams strength one I can't dog forgive me and it's on sale right now for a hundred and $9.99 and then this one right here I believe is normally a hundred and something and it's on sale for $60 and I'm not sure if that thirty five percent off coupon on top probably applies do you get it for even better deal my I stocked up and got two of these since they were on sell for sixty they were sold out like I might have mentioned on the 1500 milligrams they have these back in stock but if you're just looking for something more affordable and you're just like I got a pain here in there thousand is more enough you guys so what am I gonna rate these on a 10 star being 10 plus and 0 the worst luck job well I'm going to give him a solid 10 a 10 they're both amazing I mean the 1500 milligram I was like wow this is the most soothing moisturizing effective cvd cream for my joints and my muscles that i've experienced and then i was like they're out of stock so I'll try the thousand milligrams got to these and I've had it for a few days and I am not disappointed I'm literally just gonna stick with a thousand milligram one is perfect for me so I just want to talk about that 10 10 star rating for sure on both of those products from diamond CBD company CBD oil biotech and they have a website as well I believe maybe it's not listed on here not sure but they are out of Fort Lauderdale Florida that's where they're distributed so check out this CBD cream and you won't be disappointed and sorry I'm a little not too energetic today I have another chronic migraine I'm trying to figure my way around these if you guys have any suggestions out there or any treatment plans that work for y'all on chronic migraines related to whatever you can think of please let me know I'm looking into doing some neck exercises not just like that but some pole bar in kind of exercises at the gym I'm sitting across from my dream right now I was gonna go in but wasn't feeling so good today I got sick again going off a new medication I started a couple months ago that's been giving me a lot of nausea and migraines and so it's giving me more Naja and more migraines going off of it there you go on pharmaceutical drugs people hmm that's why I love CBD it's all-natural no side effects going off it for a while no side effects getting on it it's just a beneficial plant so just bear with me while I'm making my videos here lately but if you have any suggestions like I said on treatment plans for migraines please comment down below I'm desperate for anything natural but yeah the guy at the GNC in town here the other week said he used to suffer from chronic migraines and he pumps it up at their gym y'all do do or do it funny huh he wasn't like that and I wasn't like that with him but um basically he said to do like the polling Robo kind of motion ones towards the chest ones up above the head and if you can do it with your lower or your upper back ones behind pulling up like that machines and that'll strengthen the muscles in the neck which connect up to the head which go to the blood flow which can cause migraines or not migraines depending on if you strength those muscles so I'm definitely gonna look into that I want to make some updated garden videos before the garden has to be kind of harvested here at the end of the summer and I'm seeing a lot of videos pop up on YouTube about plants that can be grown in productively and survive through fall time so I'm gonna look into that some videos for you guys on that and other than that I'm just thinking to take it easy with my migraines my nausea the next hour long and just get it through this with my CBD and my supplements and I'll make a video here soon on the supplements I take there are people going out to their cars and I feel like a nerve because I might youtuber and people don't know who I'm talking to I could care less what people think but I don't really have much else to say if you guys have any suggestions for videos besides reviews if you want to see I know one of you mentioned a comment if you want to see what I eat in a day overall ideas I can post a video on that I could make videos on grocery hauls if you guys want to see exactly what I buy the grocery store that's healthy low-fat options is a vegetarian and yeah I can do a view on my new supplement regiment because I did start a new CBD capsule that is CBD isolate from diamond CBD website as well as where I got these two creams from and they have 5-htp which is a natural supplement for the brain for anxiety and mood disorders and I've been trying that out as a supplement itself so I thought why not get a CBD capsule to replace my other CD CBD capsules I'm almost out of and try the one with a 5-htp add it into it kill two birds with one stone and also I am taking l-theanine but I can make a video on that I started some ginkgo which is a plant that's been around for centuries since prehistoric times basically it's good for brain functioning so I'm trying that for memory and my migraines trying to think what else I started in vitamin D I started a caffeine supplement despite what doctors say they don't know everything every body like body of your body is different and I started a supplement that is all-natural I can show you guys in a video one day when I'm home that contains yerba monta in it which is a good caffeinated natural drink from the yerba mate a plant and it also has natural caffeine from green coffee beans I believe it is and a little bit of rhodiola rosa in it for some energy and it's all good combination to do treatment for my ADHD because I am no longer on adderall I was on that for a month or two it didn't work for me and the alternative to adderall the non-stimulant pharmaceutical medication for ADHD is just too many side effects not good for you and I'd rather take the Supplemental form in life the natural approach if I can so I'm gonna sign off and I have a lot of great videos coming up just bear with me on my migraines my nausea I'm trying my best to pump through these migraines last nine months a bang basically every day all day and I'm doing my gosh dang best so thanks for bearing with me and sorry if I haven't been very my usual energetic self you guys I know you guys like that part of the Adrian Naturals channel and if we have anyone new out there that wants to join the Adrian the naturals family please do I am just over seven hundred and twenty five subscribers and when I make it to a thousand I'm going to do an herb big contest giveaway and I'm

just a little drop here and there in a tincture bottle I have but I can clean out from a CBD tincture I had I like to be reusable but minimalistic at the same time if that makes sense so okay guys I'm feeling a little better and I'm waiting for my mom to come out so I'm gonna finish my coffee okay guys this was Adrian the naturalist and this was a little review slash chat vlog with me I'm the parking lot this morning on some CBD oil biotech thousand milligrams CBD cream as well as their 1500 milligrams CBD cream okay bye guys [Music]", "WOTXvwksUAU": "hello everyone today we're going to be making lotion we're going to be taking you through it step by step the first step that we're going to do is we're going to fill our sink full of very strong bleach water everything no matter if it's clean will actually pre wash it so everything goes in there with dawn antibacterial detergent and bleach everything gets bleached you want to put out paper towels and you want to put everything out on those to dry um then it doesn't matter if they completely Drive it's good to let them drip good then you will take ninety one percent alcohol hang on in a spray bottle and you will then spray everything down and dry it with paper towels the alcohol makes contact with the water and it causes you to be able to get every bit of water out of your containers and then you want to set those not under a ceiling fan and in a clean sanitary area on top of your paper towels until you're ready to use them and it's sort of good if you can do this ahead of time and leave time for evaporation okay here is an example we've just washed this pot it has a residue of water in it and we've added alcohol see it doesn't have the shiny appearance of any moisture the alcohol causes the water to be completely removed all right then we're going to set our jars out and I've got a little clip showing you exactly how to take care of your jars okay I have my jars here fresh from the plastic bag I made sure that I had alcohol with my hands we keep 91% alcohol in a spray bottle now I'm going to get over the top of them and I'm going to spray them then we'll let that evaporate and then these jars are ready for the lotion to be added all right and then after we've taken care of our jars let them set over there and and evaporate then we're going to measure it by our oils all of your hard all will go in a double boiler and be melted all of your liquid oils that means they're liquid now they don't have to be melted will be measured and put into another container of the sanitary containers every time you touch something that is not sanitary you must rewatch your hands and we alcohol your hands okay all right so you will put your liquid oils in one container you'll put your hard in a double boiler if you're using stearic acid and I know you'll be using emulsifying wax you'll put those together into a pot those don't have to go into a double boiler but if you overheat them they burn if you if you let them cool down to cool before you add them to your lotion you just have little knobs of stearic acid and emulsifying wax floating all through your lotion so they have to be warm and melted when they go in your oils for emulsification all right so the first thing you will do get your liquids all in one poll your hard oils and your stearic acid emulsifying wax on the stove double boiler dereck acid in a pot and your massa fine wax in a good thick stainless steel maybe copper bottom pot those you will hate gently slowly because we don't want to diminish their values for skin by overheating them and while that's happening you're going to measure up your glycerin and vitamin e your preservative in separate little containers and any other ingredients that's needed I will be adding a recipe for the I'll be adding a recipe ingredients at the end of the video right now we're going to talk about safety safety safety we must keep our hands clean there's two rules of thumb put on gloves but then when I put on gloves and I touch my face I don't feel it I forget that I've done it I don't realize so I just keep scrubbing my hands and alcohol in my hands in bleach water and don't dish detergent is how I wash and then alcohol and using paper towels constantly through the process because if bacteria is in your oils and lotion when you put your preservative in there it's not it's already got something it's got to fight right there so we want to make sure that there's no bacteria or germs goes into our product so another example of that is when you have a brand new bottle of olive oil that's what you want to use to make lotion not one that you poured back some into when you were measuring to make soap you want to have a brand new block of shea butter brand new contain our cocoa butter if you're using it you want all your liquids to be fresh bottles that have not been opened and possibly poured back into or there are 3/4 of the way down you want fresh intake oils that you're just opening up we cannot have bacteria when we're working with lotion everything is sanitary as possible as fresh as possible is the way to go all right ok so now we're going to get to the process of mixing it all together but I do want to talk to you about your water when you're bowling your water your water has to boil for at least 20 minutes if there's going to be a vibration during that process so you want to put way more than what you need to boiling so that you'll have the right amount when you get ready to measure and even in the pot when you're measuring it into your lotion pot and you're going to make lotion I always put a little bit extra because once you put it in you just see the steam coming up carrying your water away so because of evaporation I always add just a little extra to my water pot all right let's start making lotion okay so now we are measuring the water into a bowl sitting on a scale and we're measuring out how much we need our bowl will not hold all of it if you can see the steam from evaporation occurring as we speak so that means water is dissipating from our Bowl as we're adding it so get that to a flat ounce so that's 40 point one will throw the point one in for our extra so we write down 40 so now we'll dump that into the ocean making pot set it back on our scale and so now we have 80 in our pot and we need how much 160 160 so as you can see she is measuring 240 and by doing a flat amount it's just easier to do on a calculator so she's going to go up to 40 each time there she goes she's going to write down 40 I'm going to add 40 to the calculator because we can't clean this because it's my phone so now we have 120 all right so we needed 20 30 40 50 60 so we need 40 exactly more and then we're going to put in two extra ounces for evaporation okay so 42 more - yep 42 and that's because we're using a large batch if you are using a small batch you would add less extra all right we have our melted oils they are warm we have our liquid oils they are room temperature we have our vitamin E and our glycerin and our two preservatives that I use we have our water over here in the water pot and we're ready to go okay the first thing I'm going to add is my hot oils being careful I've kept these on low on the stove on warm excuse me once I got to melt it to being sure checking with a thermometer not to get them too hot so that I don't diminish their skin print properties then the next thing is our room temperature oils if you're doing a liquid oil only recipe you need to heat these oils but because the water is warm or hot and the oils are hot there was no need to heat these oils alright now we'll need the stearic acid I've kept get on the stove on low excuse me warm once I got them melted because it goes back to a hard state in seconds all right you'll pour that in and there goes lotion sit it back over there on the stove but off of a hot I jump and turn that off now if we look now we have little floaties of oil floating on the top of our surface see those sometimes you have to add more emulsifying wax then you originally thought you would need if that happens you just add a little bit of time until you get it fully emulsified but you also have to process this with your stick blender for a good period of time and so it was time to be watching and waiting for unsupportive five or unmod okay now we wait we're going to wait and as this cools we're going to keep an eye on the temperature but as this cools we will watch this for temperature and we want to get it down to 160 degrees for our essential oils and 140 degrees before our preservative goes in now I'm using unrefined organic shea butter and unrefined organic cocoa butter sometimes you will have things that will float to the top like little husk particles and things of that sort so this is a good time to get those out as well so as I'm watching for the temperature I will watch for things like that as well okay guys I'm going to bring you in it might be difficult for you to see but there is some floating oil cocoa butter particularly is one that's very difficult to work with for full of most of vocation okay so I've added one ounce of stearic acid and see how it goes back to a solid very easy I think let me pull this back now okay right there it's going back to a solid so you have to be really cautious with this once you ain't but you can't overheat it it burns I like to definitely have my stick blender on it when I'm putting it in to a already made lotion for the bulk of it not to go flat to the bottom set that on an off I've added an extra ounce if you're doing much smaller batches of course it would be much smaller amount all right we will measure our temperature again we're well under 160 so we could add our essential oils at this point right here is 140 and we're sitting right on it we're not going over so we're ready to put our preservative in so I'm going to go ahead and do that step okay so now we're going to add our vitamin E and glycerin after the temperature has been brought down some and I just like to not put it in when it's super hot and I use paraben and formaldehyde free preservative I try to keep things as natural as possible so jarm prevention because I'm not using what's considered a full broad-spectrum preservative trying to go more natural I'm not not using a preservative I'm just not using one that is acid rain to most of us and that's me pacifically I break out okay now I'm going to add my essential oils okay we're under 160 and now we're going to add our essential oils I'm using tumeric in this one so it's going to turn my lotion yellow being very cautious with how much tumeric you use if you use it giving things a thorough beating with your stick blender did you see that last little drop that fell out of my dish all right giving everything a thorough blending is very important okay so now we're going to fill our pour our pour spouts okay I bought these from a you can get these from Amazon I forget where I bought these and then somebody told me you can get them from Amazon um I like to use something with a handle that I can hang on the side because I'm going to fill this and then hand this over to b2b take it from that side so it won't drip on our clean dishes over there alright and for for us to start filling our containers over on the other table but then I can just hang that and it's waiting on me for when I'm ready to refill more so there you go don't leave any in there because it'll start thickening okay so we're tilting slowly bringing it back to level and going all the way to the fill line okay now to prepare our lids we're going to prepare our lids on a clean surface that has been bleached and alcohol and dried with paper towels fresh paper towels just opened up the plastic off of the roll cleanliness is next to germ free lotion mm-hmm all right so we're going to get them like that we're going to take our pump bottle and we're going to miss them just like that and then we're going to set them to let that evaporate an air dry okay here is our beautiful creams all laid out and ready to go these will sit overnight here on the table don't add the lids if you add the lids Moisture will come up and get on the bottom of the lid and then fall down on top of your jar and you'll have a water layer so they need to sit overnight until room temperature and then you add your lids alcohol your jars and add your labels all of these jars are four ounce jars I don't make bigger than four ounce jars because I use a more natural preservative if you want to use a broad-spectrum preservative then you can do larger jars okay I got just a little bit of the cream from the bottom of the container this is my night cream so this is heavier than my day cream of course 100% natural when it comes to know preserve I mean no preservatives that are full broad-spectrum with formaldehyde and parabens and no Vaseline petroleum fillers 100% oil that kind of thing okay so this is our heavy cream it'll take a little bit to soak in it'll lay on the skin just for a few minutes before it soaks in because it's meant for really dry skin I also make a day cream I'm going to give you the recipe for the day cream okay we are on wholesalesuppliesplus.com this is their batch calculator I'm hoping this video comes out good off of my screen I'm going to print the recipe and also add that clip to the actual just of the paper so if you can't read this we will add that in a moment so I talked to you the fact that we were going to do the day cream recipe so when you first get on the page this is the wholesalesuppliesplus.com you will add the the name of your recipe so this is day cream okay then we want to add our ingredients and we have shea butter coconut all those get melted olive oil can go in without being melted as long as you have melted oils you're adding in so at room temperature olive oil we have our water then our vitamin E and our glycerine our stearic acid our emulsified wax our preservative that goes in at a hundred and forty degrees so I wrote preservative 140 and essential oils that go in at one hundred and sixty degrees so I wrote essential oils one hundred and sixty just as a reminder for y'all guys and then we have here it shows you though that we have managed to put in enough numbers to make it all the way to a hundred you can add notes as into what essential oils you added or any of the cooking or tips so that you who excuse me to remember all right so we have our shea butter at 4% this is a light day cream you would increase the oils and decrease the water to make this a heavier lotion so we have 4% shea butter we have 2% coconut oil and we have 2% olive oil well let's say you'd like to add avocado right avocado right here and take a point from your olive oil since it's a liquid oil and add it right here so then you'd have 1% avocado and 1% olive oil on your water it's 75 point 4 excuse me 75 point four so the reason we do that is because on our vitamin E we have point three and our glycerine we have point three that equals up under the ounces category at being point three on your scales now if you would like to decrease the vitamin E or increase the glycerin or vice versa you would make sure you put your point in or you're going to end up with a whole one percent which is too much do your point here change it and then just decrease or add to the point four on the water remember we are adding slightly more water whoo excuse me slightly more water than it's called for because of evaporation just a little bit all right so then we're going on down to our stearic acid we're at 2% and our emulsifying wax we're at 9% now let me discuss that with you every company has a different percentage of emulsifying wax required to emulsified oils so I buy mine from Soper's choice if I use cocoa butter sometimes I have to increase it to 10% so but I know that I have seen on I think Brambleberry an emulsifying wax that it only required I think four percent to emulsify oils so you know yeah I might be wrong oh that it's been a long time but I do know that different companies have different you know how much is required to be used to emulsify your oils remember your step to wait and watch for floating oils to rise to the top that did not get emulsified blend well in case you didn't blend well good enough the first place if it happens again that they float up add more emulsifying wax while it is hot your preservative one percent I do not know of a preservative out there that requires more than 1% and some of them only require a half a percent but you will find a lot of wishy-washy answers as to how much preservative you can you should use on a particular price they'll say well it depends on your recipe it depends on your recipe I found that 1% always makes me happy and always takes care of everything alright on essential oils 160 I have put this in at 4% 4% is safe for everybody but children I pregnant women so if you wish to use 2% it's considered safe for children and for women depending of course then 2 on the type of essential oil you use if you add peppermint of course we're not going to put that on babies or fragile skin or you know blah blah blah especially you know 4% peppermint would be too much too you've got to limit that that's just too much of a irritate a skin irritant same thing you don't put citrus essentials in here lemongrass is not a citrus my favorite ones is rosemary lemongrass lavender and tea tree that's my favorite ones in lotion and I add more lavender than I do lemongrass I just a little bit of lemongrass and because lemongrass is over what overwhelming rosemary is about a middle of the road it's not as not as weak in scent as lavender when it comes to sticking in your lotion but it's no strong live aggress lemongrass is very overwhelming and will overtake the smell of your soap tea tea tree can only be put in at 1% in a lotion because that's all that's safe if a person rubs it over their entire body and a lotion is meant to rub on the entire body and even if you're selling it as a facial lotion people might rub it all over them so stick to 1% unless you want to put warnings on your labels all right so 1% is all that safe for tea tree for something you're going to rub all over your body ok so we've got 4 percent 1 percent 9 percent 2 percent point 3 point 3 7 point 4 - 2 & 4 now if we wanted to make this a night cream a heavier cream we would double the oils and reduce the water air we could also double the vitamin E double the glycerin but the rest of this would pretty much stay the same ok but this here now and on this on your lavender at 4% you can add a touch more lavender it's one of the most benign essential oils even if you're doing 2% you can go over a little bit you know with lavender okay so anyway so now how do we get these things to work because if I sit and take out my batch size volume and hit calculate look at all the zeros well let's say you want to make a 4 ounce tester bottle hit 4 and hit calculate and then you're gonna want to do it in grams because it's so tiny okay so there you can do a 4 ounce tester jar all right well let's say you want to do 25 for hours jars that would be a hundred ounces and you click calculate and there you go we've got 4 ounces of shea butter 2 ounces of coconut oil 2 ounces of olive oil seventy five point four ounces of water point three ounces of vitamin E and glycerine two ounces of stearic acid nine ounces of emulsifying wax one ounce of preservative and 4 ounces of essential all so there you go that's how you do it that's how you do it now uh-huh so now let's just take that and let's print it let me see there's a button for that print recipe and we got everything here where does the prop print this page it's not easy you got to go through a couple steps and hit print and there you go all right now if you just want to do you know four four ounce jars four eight twelve sixteen you could do 16 ounces calculate you see you just tell it how much you want debt what if you want to do this in pounds mark it over here in pounds but now it's gonna do 16 pounds you say and then there it is but I like the fact that you can look at it how much it needs to be how much you need announces pounds milliliters and Gramps because sometimes like let's do this here 100 oh I've lost my screen let's say I'm doing 56 ounces let's see if we can get some barriers calculate okay two point six nine well I'm just gonna bump it up to two point seven you see six 675 ounces I'm still on pounds point fifty-eight well I'm going to do point six you know I just I just try to even it out to what the scale would do when it's just too much of a variance then I look at the grams and I do grams for that one okay so there you go we'll put that back on ounces back on 100 I'm gonna hit calculate and there you go there's our recipe and I'm gonna take and and scan this for you and let you look at it", "1ywDAataO2A": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we're going to be talking about how to make cbd oil with hemp seed oil and maybe some of the common misconceptions that go along with hemp seed oil but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support so folks if you are new here to the channel we are a hemp farm and today we will be using our own hemp flour this particular strain that we will be using is biox we also have cherry one which we also like to make oil with biox berry and other strains available on our website so if you guys are looking into making cbd oil and you need some hemp flour go ahead and check out the links in the description below we can ship to pretty much all 50 states so folks let's talk about the common misconception with hemp seed oil and how to use it to make cbd oil so some folks see hemp oil or hemp seed oil and they think that it has cbd in it and it really has zero cannabinoids in it there really is nothing in it other than the value of the oil from the hemp seed itself so there's really no cannabinoids in it today we have some hemp seed oil that was cold pressed it's organic it's good stuff and we're going to be using 16 ounces of that oil now you can use eight ounces we're going to make a larger batch today we're also going to be using 28 grams of cbd hemp flour you can use more so this is one ounce it's a very standard recipe 16 ounces of oil to one ounce of flour you can use two ounces of flour to 16 ounces of oil as well today we're not gonna be making a super strong batch but if you are looking for a more potent oil i suggest doing two ounces to two cups and i'll leave that recipe in the description of the video as well but we will be using our biox strain from our farm that we grew here again guys if you are interested go ahead and check out the links in the description below now the first thing you're going to do is you're going to decarb your flower obviously if you purchase it from us it's already going to be in a one ounce measured bag and you go ahead and put it in your d card box now today we're going to be using our magic butter d card box you can use a pyrex dish with a cover but it needs to be covered and you're going to put it in the oven at 250 for 30 minutes that really activates all the cannabinoids in the hemp flour to really get that cbd to transfer into the oil also what you will be needing is obviously a magic butter machine but you will need once the oil is done you're going to need a filter and a silicone glove this is to squeeze out the remaining oil from the flowers into your jar or whatever you're going to put it in for use and again folks you will need a hemp seed oil 16 ounces you can use eight ounces as well so you can use eight ounces of oil with one ounce of flour if you want the potency but not as much oil i don't really recommend that for the magic butter machine i really recommend 16 ounces of oil the machine doesn't really do well with only eight ounces of oil that's just my take on it you can use the magic butter machine with eight ounces of oil i believe they say you can but that's just not how we make it here on the farm so folks let's get into making cbd oil with our hemp seed oil with our magic butter machine okay folks so the cbd hemp flour is out of the oven looking good and here's our biox flour so what we're going to do is this is obviously one ounce that we already pre-measured and we're going to go ahead and not spill it so we're going to put the first handful in and then we're going to gently put it into the magic butter machine i always end up spilling it hopefully today we're all good so there's that then we've already put some in here this is eight ounces we already did one but for just for viewing purposes we already put one in the machine so you're gonna go ahead open this guy up and in it goes pretty easy again there's 16 ounces of hemp seed oil in here okay so the next thing you're going to do you're going to take the machine you are going to put it on so i've already plugged it in and what we're going to be doing is a tincture i know on the machine it says one hour for oil i just don't like the one hour recipe i like to give it enough time to really absorb into the oil so what we're going to do is we're going to select our temperature which will be 160 degrees we're going to select the four hour button and that is it so we will see you guys in four hours and let the machine do the work okay folks it's been uh four hours and the oil just went off so now all we're going to do is we're going to collect the oil it's really not much different than using mct or olive oil pretty pretty much the same you really can't tell the difference until you taste it um it's just not a much of a difference as far as like you know texture or anything like that what it looks like so this is what we're going to do we're just going to scrape off all the edges so all this is is just a flower that's kind of gotten on the edges from the blender of the magic butter machine pretty common nothing to be worried about all right so then what you're going to do is your initial pour you're going to go ahead and pour it right in now i'm using a uh pyrex uh dish i really like to use this then you can just transfer it uh over to wherever you're gonna store it most people supposed to store it in a mason jar or like a squeeze bottle or something like that so first you're just gonna take your glove get that initial squeeze pretty easy all right so now what we're going to do is get all the plant material that you can see down here let me move this so i can show you guys what it looks like down in there pretty normal um it's just a bunch of plant material what that does is it kind of holds on to a lot of oil and so that's why the glove comes in real handy you could just discard this and you know not get that extra little bit of oil it's it's not unheard of um but a lot of people like to go and get that little extra oil now everything's clean in there we put it off to the side we take the glove and go ahead and squeeze that material that was in the magic butter machine pretty easy all right and that's it so here is your cbd oil uh for you to put in a mason jar any container it doesn't matter but should be good for a while and uh you know people ask a lot about potency you know the hemp flour plays a role the cooking plays a role decarbing plays a role there's so many factors that potency really can't be calculated unless it's done in a lab so that's what i tell a lot of people so if you're watching this video and you're thinking what's the potency you really have to get it lab tested this particular batch will not be lab tested um so we won't know uh what the milligrams are for this particular batch but it nonetheless it's cbd and you know that there is cbd in it because you put cbd hemp flowers in there but that is all i have for you guys today if you guys are interested in the hemp flower we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below guys have questions feel free to leave a comment always reach out via instagram facebook or email um but that is all for today i hope you all stay happy healthy and i will see you in another video", "dt2zPOQNNWw": "the use of topical or creams in the tree simple non-invasive safe way to add another option to your conservative

Check it out. This is what when you have stage four pancreatic cancer all my tribe mates. Here they are. A Missouri man fighting cancer says his rights were violated when police searched his hospital room after they suspected he might have marijuana. And his Facebook Live video went viral. Hi guys. We got a call saying there was marijuana in the room. [Police Officer 2] I smelled marijuana whenever I walked in the room. OK. [Patient} And there is no way they could smell it, doc, 'cause I don't smoke it, I don't have, I don't ever use a ground-up plant. It's an oil that I use in a capsule. OK. So there's no smoking it. I take it like a pill. Well no, we have not found anything, but he's got another bag that he's Do you guys, just from a legal standpoint, do you have probable cause to search his stuff? Do you have the right to search his stuff, or do you need a warrant for that? No, we have the right, he's on private property. Frustrated that officers were looking through his final days' belongings, which reportedly included THC and CBD capsules, the man defended himself by mentioning the state had recently legalized medical marijuana. Medically, in Missouri, it's really legal now. They just haven't finished the paperwork. [Police Officer} OK, well, then, it's still not legal. But I don't have time to read through that. Shhhhh. Man, what would you do? Tell me what you'd do. If that was your only, I'm not in that situation, so I'm not gonna play the what-if games. You've never said you'd do anything to save your life? You'd do anything to save your life. Marijuana is saving your life? If you had five kids, it's the only choice I got to live. Ultimately, cops found nothing and no citations were issued. But did they do the right thing? Oh my gosh. Oh my God. How many police officers were, I know! I'll ask you, because in your world, obviously, you deal with a lot of criminal offenses. And, I mean I, it's hard to watch because We have this thing called the United States Constitution, and every state has a constitution. Two separate constitutions, we have the federal and the state. The Fourth Amendment protects against illegal searches and seizures, OK? You have a reasonable right to expect that you're gonna be, to your privacy. That nobody's gonna come in and look at your stuff. And first of all, they've got nothing better to do than to pick on a poor cancer patient? (audience applauds) You know? In a hospital, yet. First of all, they had no search warrant. It could be an argument made, you know, there is no expectation of privacy because he's in a room where people are coming and going, they're going through his bags, they're going through his suit coat. They're opening things. They have no right to do that without a search warrant. However, I did read that he consented. You consent, then everything's off the table. You know, yes, you can search his bag, yes, you can, then it's, they can. Well, let's just even theoretically say this is a Stage four pancreatic cancer patient, and people know the very grim statistics. This is such a deadly disease. Less than three percent survival after five years. Let's just say he had a joint in the backpack, it's hard for me to see this happen and take place because there are plenty of other things out there that deserve the attention of police officers, and I don't know (applause) what situation the police were put in here, but also, to me, how does the hospital deal with this? Because, it seemed like a physician came in there and said, wait a minute, what are you all doing here? I think she asked if they had probable cause. Yes, she did. And they needed a warrant. To get a warrant, you need probable cause. All they had was a phone call from somebody saying, I smelt it. Well, I walk through my hotel lobby and I smell it all day long! (audience laughs) I walk down the streets of LA, Hollywood Boulevard, I smell it all day long, you know? Yeah. But to walk in and invade this man's privacy, Again, what would they do here? That's actually a really good point because I do feel like he raised this amendment two that was passed the preceding November in Missouri, that was for allowing medical marijuana. So in this changing landscape, where so many states are now passing marijuana regulations that have outstripped the ability of the state to even regulate them, and who gets what, how is there even a case there? Like, how do you even adjudicate something like that? They shouldn't even have responded, you know. And obviously they didn't find anything. They were looking for marijuana, and they didn't find it. So there is no case, you know. The question is now, you know, sue them for invading your privacy. I mean, you just, can you imagine being in a hospital room and having, like the SWAT team come in looking for your marijuana, my marijuana? Really? You know, I could see if it was something bigger and better, like, you know, maybe he had heroin. I mean, that would be outrageous if he was having, you know, that in a hospital room. It's marijuana, and it is now legal in that state, is my understanding. Really?", "4XIx3Ld47Ek": "I welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber scriber welcome back thank you so much for joining so today we're gonna be doing THC infused lip balm so this stuff is really really nice and what's really great is you put it on your lips and you're always doing this during the day so you are getting your THC and not in high doses and you can reapply it any time that you like and you can make it in any flavor that you like any sense that you like you can add essential oils for other benefits that you may like to add to it and it's fairly straightforward simple recipe so without a further ado I'll get started alright so the ingredients that you're going to need is all first of all your THC infused coconut oil so I did a small infusion here if you want to know how to learn how to do a small infusion I have a video on that you can check that out and so we're going to need two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil we're going to need two tablespoons of beeswax pellets and you can get these at any health food store or you can order them online and you want to make sure that you get 100% pure beeswax and food grade because it's gonna go on your lips so anything that you get you always want to make sure it's food grade we're gonna be using two tablespoons of shea butter and again you want to make sure you're using 100% pure shea butter now if you want to add a little bit of tinted coloring you can use some food coloring but literally like a half the drop or drop because that's gonna stain your lip and you lip balms generally are for color you can use a slight bit of tint so you can use like an oil-based color or you can use powders or you can use mica powders if you've got those on hand for you could add essential oils or benefits whatever benefits that you'd like you can add in some essential oils or for our fragrance and then for flavor if you like you can add in a little bit of your favorite flavoring and again you want to you guys this is candy flavoring which and you want to use a very small amount so that's our ingredients for that we're gonna need for our lip balm now what we're going to put it in is I got these from all this stuff from the dollar store so I picked up these little tiny jars these are probably a little bit too small but can't be too fussy these I got in a travel kit these are actually the perfect size and they came with a few other few other bottles that you've gotten your travel kit so if you make other lotions or leave some things you've got those in there as well if you'd like and it has the two sides is a smaller one and the slightly bigger one which is really handy or the other is if you want a lip balm - what I did is I just bought a package they came to in a package of some no-name lip balm and you're just gonna twist it up what I did was I put it in the freezer first these are nice because this one will come these come right out screw right out and then you just want to gently remove that and then you can use to use something sharp to pull out the rest of it the other thing is being difficult just take a little piece of paper towel with something sharp here and stuff it in then you can just go around and clean it and there you go then just screw it back in you take it all the way down and we can fill it up and then you've got a tube then what you can do is you just peel off the label there you go now you've got an empty lip balm too so that's everything that we need to get started oh sorry and what we're gonna be cooking is a French press and we're gonna be doing it in boiling water on a pot so you want to get a pot of boiling water going you just want to fill up enough water that's going to just cover the your oil you don't want to go too high otherwise your French press is gonna Bop around in the water and can fall over so just enough water that's gonna cover your oil all right so it's pretty straightforward we're gonna put everything into the French press pour in your can of your can of oil I'm so used to working with can of butter use your can of oil your shave and then our two tablespoons of beeswax pellets our beeswax pellets and have your essential oil you can add in two to three drops and if you want to add some flavor I'm gonna add a little Mangal I figure orange mango is gonna be used I you picked orange essential oil because it's brightening so I thought that would be nice for lips brightening your lips giving some plumpness to them and brightening them up and I thought orange mango would be a nice flavor and it also goes well with the coconut does you have a slight coconut flavor from your oil and we're gonna add in the 1/2 a teaspoon a lecithin and I said less instant it's really good for your skin it's good for you as well as it's gonna help to emulsify and bind everything together lecithin is optional you don't have to use it as well as essential oils or the flavoring you don't have to use it you could just go straight oh natural oh I don't know how well that would taste good it tastes very coconut and canta canta canta butter ish we've got everything in there and we're just gonna put the lid on you want to put it just above you don't want it to sit on top you want to keep it just above your mix your your lip balm mixture and then we're gonna place it in our water then you want to place your French press in the water you want to have just enough water to come above your lip balm mixture you don't want to go too high because otherwise the French pass well bobble around and it'll fall over see and you want to keep the plunger I said above it look just slip that into the water it's gonna simmer for half an hour and when we get up back we'll fill it will fill up the tubes and the containers and get it set up and try it out and about every five or ten minutes you just want to come along and cut it and just do the plunger up and down just to kind of keep move things around or you can just take it off and just put use a spoon or spatula to mix things up already so our lip balm has been simmering here for a half an hour I just took the lid off of it and what you want to do is turn your heat off but what still leave it in the pot here and what you want to do is you just want to whisk it binding everything together you want to do it in the hot water because it does solidify very quickly so you want to keep it warm let it sit and let the air bubbles come out of it and then we're gonna get ready to pour so if you're using a little lip balm tube the easiest way to do it is to get a funnel that's right in the top and just pour it in and just keep an eye you just want to come up to the do your top of your funnel overflows just throw a little bit back in we can clean up the rest later just when I just a touch more what just to come over the little screw up and that's why I do it in in a little bowl here so that we can collect anything that pours over those we don't waste anything so I'm gonna just let that set up and we'll clean up the sides in a minute so that's a lip balm then very easy obviously for a container just pour it in so we're just gonna let these set up it's always I say it solidifies very quickly you can already see on the sides it's already solidifying and on the bottom so you're gonna let those just sit for about probably about a half hour to an hour until they completely sit or you can put them in the refrigerator actually with the lip balm you can just use the if you've got the French press still you can just pour it in you don't really need to use the funnel but if you're having difficulty then you can it's actually easier without the funnel you just want to fill it up - right about there so our lip balm is all set up now and it's firmed up in the container he looks just like store-bought lip balm I've got that in them in the container and then the one in the tube so it works just like chop stick let's see now let's try it and see what it feels like so my first time making it so wow that's nice damn oh you gotta try this out of this is really really nice alright so I hope you give it a try and let me know if you liked it if you do give it a try if you've got any comments or any questions please don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'd love to hear from you and I think that's all I've got for today I hope you look forward to more videos to come and thank you so much for joining me you have a great day [Music]", "02Ucs3V1U-k": "what is going on guys welcome on in we're gonna bring you another carrier oil 101 serious video but first my name is dancey bearded my subscribers they call me the trust and teacher for all things beard related and today I'm gonna cover the highly requested hemp seed oil video I'm gonna tell you where it comes from the history behind it the benefits for your beard and skin underneath your beard and importantly if I recommend it to you guys but also include some companies that are using this and I want to make this clear hemp seed oil is totally different than CBD oil and I'll cover CBD oil on a future video probably in the near future actually but they are two totally different things and make sure you watch the whole video I have some really important points and some misconceptions that clear up is specifically with hemp seed oil [Music] where where does the ingredient hemp seed oil come from that is in some of your beard products well it is likely from the country of Canada all the way up to estimate some 90% of the hemp seed oil in the United States is from our neighbors to the north Canada we'll get into the reasons why on the history portion because that is really important for this topic and for hemp seed oil but one important thing to know is hemp seed oil does come from the cannabis plant when we look at where it is cannabis but it is a totally different strain than the cannabis plant that people use recreationally to smoke a totally different thing this is not a plant that you could smoke to have THC or to get high from it it is completely separate even though when you see hemp lotion and all these other things they usually advertise with the green marijuana leaf they are two totally different plants in strains so I don't to make sure that's clear because that misconception is gonna be very important as we talk about everything else about this ingredient history as a history teacher I love diving deep into this segment for any ingredient or really any topic period but the history behind hemp seed oil is loaded and interesting first off over 8,000 years ago hemp seed oil was first used by the ancient Chinese and that is important because you can find tons and tons of stuff dating back to probably ten thousand years ago of people using hemp for clothing for paper for all sorts of different things but the actual seeds being cold-pressed and creating oil was done by the ancient Chinese in about 6000 BCE now they used in three ways they used it for their skin their hair but they also ingested it they thought it would improve their immune system they thought it made them healthier all those things that may or may not be legit that's for a different channel different time but this is about the hair in the skin and the Chinese were the first to use now this goes all the way through Europe this goes through the history all the way back then to more recent history in the u.s. in 1937 there was a really misinformed tax law that pretty much halted all hemp production in the United States whether it was for the drug whether it was for hemp seed oil whether was from hemp oil or anything to do with that plant whether it had THC or not and again guys THC is the psychoactive ingredient that gets people high when they smoke it when they make any kind of drug product out of it right now they have edibles they have everything you can imagine well this is a totally different strain but the tax loss still impacted it so still to this day hemp seed production in the United States has greatly been hurt compared to countries like Canada or France or anywhere else in the world that is producing this ingredient and we'll see in a second if it is a great ingredient or not and whether the US should look at their misconceptions with that law the impact of that law and even the way that we market and advertise any product that has to do with hemp I think this is a loaded thing but it's gonna be really important here so the history loaded one but we could kind of make sense of this ingredient why it's used or why it's not used in some of our favorite companies benefits we see companies using this ingredient in our beard oils and beard products so what are the benefits refresh revive and strengthen flatout this is an absolutely amazing ingredient one of the best I've ever used in research and I am loving it more and more as I use more and as I look more into it it is referred to as a freak of nature it is the most unsaturated fat oil in the plant kingdom it is called the most perfectly balanced oil there is unplanted earth it is thin it absorbs quickly and on the co-manage Enic scale so check out that video if you haven't it comes in at a zero meaning no matter what your skin type is oily dry no matter what your hair type is straight curly course it will not clog your pores or do any damage to your hair it is a heavily nourishing oil that is going to both help your hair and your skin it is full of vitamins minerals fatty acids antioxidants everything we want and it is the second most packed protein rich oil on planet Earth that is amazing with the proteins that we see in there and the fatty acids it is gonna promote healthy hair growth and to help you grow your hair faster and stronger by stimulating the blood flow at the base of your hairs there is truly no downfall to this ingredient and it's something that I would love to see in more companies providing us with hemp seed oil it is really known as one of those just wonders of the plant world and it does so many great things for our skin and for our hair hemp seed oil I could go on for a much longer time and bore you guys about the benefits just know that it is absolutely amazing and is a one-of-a-kind oil truly one-of-a-kind recommend do I recommend this ingredient when you're checking the labels on your beard products after my rants on the benefits portion of this of course I recommend this it is very unfortunate that a misconception is the reason that we do not have this readily available in the United States and a lot of the companies that we love that could really benefit from this ingredient are not using it I really really hope to address misconceptions on this channel and change opinions with facts science and just good old common sense and I think this video is a perfect example of that there are terrible misconceptions that have been put on by the government but also by advertisers and also just by people that are not looking into what they're talking about and they hear the name hemp and they just assume that it is something negative that something that's gonna get you high that is just not the case this is great for our beard hair and even better for the skin underneath it and it's something that I really hope companies are paying attention to and play with in the ingredients to make this more accessible to help out those beards that we see and that we love so yes I strongly recommend it three companies that I love that use this we have luxurious bastard husky and royal beardsman I cannot find a bunch more that I actually use on a regular basis that have hemp seed oil and I was actually disappointed to see that a lot of these other ones that we cover I could make a list forever I Argan jojoba sweet almond fractionated coconut oil every company checks those box off check check check check when it gets down to hemp seed oil very few those are really the only three if you know another company that you love that uses hemp seed oil boom please drop it in a comment down below question will leave you guys with what did you learn in this video I know there's something about hemp seed oil that you are not aware of I don't care for your company I don't care if you're a consumer I don't care if you're a scientist there's likely something in here unless it's your field of study that you did not know before watching this video I know I sure did when I dove

today's video I am doing a video request a couple of you guys have asked me in my comments and also on my other social media accounts to do a video on CBD because I talked a lot about it so you guys kind of want to need to talk about what CBD is how I use it and the products that I use so I'm going to do that today I'm sure you could tell by the title of this video but if you found this video helpful be sure to give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss my future videos so what is CBD CBD just stands for cannabidiol which is a strain of a cannabinoid and cannabinoids are just chemical compounds that share the same structure as THC aka what's found in marijuana now I'm not a scientist or chemist or anything of that nature I actually failed chemistry in high school so the way that my brain understands it is that there's THC and then there's CBD now THC is obviously what's found in marijuana it's the psycho active part of marijuana that gets you high and then CBD on the other hand doesn't get you high so it's non psychoactive and it's used more for pain management and mental health problems nowadays in 2018 THC is finally being used for medical purposes in many many states finally it's used for cancer patients patients with neurological conditions they've actually done studies that THC in combination with CBD together they actually inhibit tumor growth and they decrease the proliferation of cancer cells so they stop cancer cells from growing this is a whole other topic for a whole other day I'm such a strong supporter of the legalization of marijuana I just can't really wrap my mind around the fact that medical marijuana is still illegal in some states and it's been illegal for all these years and even though it's legal like medical marijuana right now is legal in my state but it's so freakin hard to get it like you have to have really really like horrible diagnosis to get it and I just can't wrap my mind behind the fact that it could also help people with conditions like you know anxiety depression more like minor conditions not that those are minor conditions they're awful but um I don't know I feel like it should just be more readily available for more patients and more people and especially since like I work in the healthcare field so I see many many patients on a daily basis that would probably benefit from medical marijuana and not only that but like doctors push prescription medications so much and prescription medications are more deadly and more addictive than marijuana is or CBD or anything and I'm just wondering why we're pushing drugs to people that could potentially kill them when marijuana has never killed anyone I'm just saying that's a whole other topic for a whole other day like in my opinion everything can be abused alcohol can be abused sex can be abused food can be abused through overeating like like everything can be abused but yet all those things are still legal anyways with CBD you can get the health benefits of marijuana without actually getting high maybe you don't like getting high maybe you get drug tested for your job maybe I don't know there are a lot of possibilities in which a person does not want to smoke marijuana but with CBD you don't have to get high it's an all-natural substance that you can benefit from without getting high now CBD is great because it is completely 100% legal in all 50 states and you don't have to find a drug dealer when you're in pain so that's good news right so all of us have cannabinoid receptors in our brain and in our nerves so when we take CBD it binds with those receptors and helps us deal with chronic pain or anxiety or depression or whatever the case may be now I know I talked about in videos before I have a lot of chronic pain issues and a lot of my subscribers are subscribed to me because you also have the same issues I have vulvodynia so I have chronic vaginal pain internal and external I have chronic back pain which I'm actually going to an orthopedic surgeon in like two weeks to go get evaluated I have chronic neck pain I have chronic pelvic pain I have a lot of issues like clearly something is not working right in my body I also have social anxiety general anxiety and depression so I have a lot of not only physical pain but also I have a lot of mental health issues as well so this is kind of what got me into CBD yes I used to smoke marijuana all the time before that was in my like wild community college days now I worked six days a week you know I have stuff to do when I get home it's just not practical for me to like sit around and get high every single day so that's kind of how I discovered CBD now multiple studies have been done about CBD being addictive and studies actually found that CBD is not addictive at all and it's actually less addictive than marijuana and I know a lot of people with will argue with me on the fact that marijuana is not addictive but honestly a lot of things can be mentally addictive if it's in the hands of the wrong person or the wrong personality do I think marijuana is addictive no but it's just like anything else in life like you can become addicted to food you can become addicted to alcohol you can become addicted to sex and even though those things we don't see as addictive they become addictive when you are in the wrong mindset if that makes any sense at all so CBD is found to not be addictive at all even when you have that like addictive personality or mindset it's actually shown to not be addictive at all so that's fun now I'm not gonna sit here and say you know CBD is a miracle product it cured my pain I'm just saying it does help me take the edge off a little bit let me just kind of quickly explain exactly what pain the CBD helps me with it helps me with my back pain it helps me with my neck pain it helps me with my anxiety and if I'm having internal vaginal pain it helps me with that the external skin pain and irritation it doesn't help it all with and it doesn't completely take my pain away but it does help reduce my pain level so it's not like you're gonna take you know a couple drops of CBD and all of a sudden you're gonna go out and live your life and everything's gonna be great it just kind of helps take that edge off so it gets me to a point where I can get up out of bed I can clean my room I can go to work I can do things and function with my pain if that makes sense and because CBD binds to the receptors in the brain it also helps with things like mental health so I do notice when I'm really anxious I'll take CBD and it helps take the edge off to the point where like I'm not gonna have a panic attack but I'm still nervous just not as nervous as I was before make sense with my depression it doesn't help me I know some people with depression say they take CVD and it helps them for me personally I haven't noticed a difference with my depression but yeah anyways I'm gonna show you the products that I use and why I like to use them and anything that I mentioned in this video will be linked in the description box down below so make sure you check that out so first I'm going to talk about CBD oil because this is the most popular you know method of taking CBD so most people take CBD and a little tincture like this come on there we go so a lot of people take CBD and a little tincture like this there are a million brands on the market that sell CBD and tinctures like this so this one is by the brand foria foria is actually um a brand that sells CBD products for women with vaginal pain so that's cool shoutout to them so this one has 21 milligrams of CBD per 0.5 milliliters um this I will say I have a very strong tolerance for CBD and for anything really um I know it's weird because I'm like such a tiny person but I have a very very very very high tolerance for pretty much everything so I have to take a lot of CBD for it to work for me so other people you might take you know a half milliliter of this and you notice the effects but for me I have to take a lot of CBD and unfortunately that's just something that you have to play around with and find your tolerance if you take it and don't notice a difference take some more until you notice a difference so unfortunately for me I'm like this with literally everything I have a very very high tolerance for any kind of like supplement herb medication anything you name it I have a very high tolerance so I could take a lot so I usually will take like two droppers full this like a full-size one milliliter dropper I'll take two of them until I notice a difference this is the most popular method of CBD you just I just take it fill up the dropper uh-huh I just dripped it all over my mouth that was a really bad demonstration I put it under my tongue and then I just kind of like let it sit there for a minute and then swallow it that's how I ingest it so this is probably the most popular method I've tried many many many different CBD tinctures and honestly can't find the best one so if you have a suggestion let me know now I will mention that forea has this lubricant called awaken which has CBD in it and it's really expensive for this tiny bottle so I've only used it like twice did I notice a difference maybe a slight difference but I still have pain with sex so I don't know I just have issues but I did once you mention this because a lot of women really really like this and they also are coming out with suppositories that you can put like inside your vagina for internal pain and I'm really excited to try those they also have ones if you live in a state where marijuana is legal they also have suppositories that I've THC in them so I don't know if you can order those online or where you get them but this brand does make THC and CBD suppositories for vaginal pain so yeah not just vaginal pain but like pelvic pain as well so oh the least common way of ingesting CBD and probably my favorite method is smoking it now this is CBD it's not marijuana it actually has like the most trace amount of THC in it that it's completely legal in all 50 states to purchase so it looks like this so this is just pure CBD flour now I smoked this just like would with marijuana I basically just grind it up put it in a bowl and I smoke it now this is my favorite way of ingesting CBD because I feel like it takes effect faster and I feel like it's stronger than just using the oil so I feel like when I smoke it I'm getting the effects within like 20 minutes compared to like an a half hour to an hour with the oil tincture and I feel like since I'm smoking an entire bowl I'm probably getting in more milligrams of CBD then I would if I was just taking the oil so I get this from a company called tweedle farms like I said I'll leave everything linked below it's completely legal in all 50 states to order online it looks like marijuana it even comes with a little slip in the package when you buy it that says like this may look like marijuana but it's actually not and it has like this big scientific explanation as to why it's not marijuana in case like someone thinks you're transporting drugs through the mail or something honestly I find it to be cheaper to just buy the flower then the tinctures honestly the oral like the tinctures are like a hundred dollars and this was I want to say forty five dollars and I've had this for almost two months now this bag so it does last me a lot longer than the oil and it's cheaper now they also make CBD products like this this is a vape pen it's falling out this is a vape pen from CBD luxe and it's called be calm so this one has essential oils in it it's CBD coconut oil lavender chamomile and valerian oil so this is just you just I think I used it all up almost and it tastes like essential oils but this I don't find it helps me with my pain but it helps me with my anxiety it helps me relax so I just wanted to show you that there are like vape pens out there vaporizers there are different ways of ingesting CBD last but not least I wanted to show you this guy this is by the brand sagely it's their CBD and tumeric pills so you can also get CBD in pill form so tumeric I take every single day as a supplement I take the Gaia I think that's how you say it supplements I take it every single day for inflammation because tumeric is really good at controlling inflammation so any kind of like back pain neck pain pelvic pain that I have it does help with that this guy has CBD and tumeric combined so this has 10 milligrams of CBD per capsule so usually like this morning what I did I was in a hurry to go to work so I took two of these and I took um one milliliter of the oil so that was like 40 50 60 milligrams of CBD and that helped me like get through work this morning so I just wanted to show you that they also make capsules there are many many brands that make capsules if you're not a fan of the oil or if you're not a fan of smoking it but the capsules are also really expensive so if you're someone like me where unfortunately you need a large amount of CBD in order to feel something it can get really freakin pricey they also make things like creams that have CBD in this is the sagely CBD cream it's like a lotion that has CDD in it this is just like the little sample packet that they sent me but they have options like that in case you wanted to like rub it on your neck or your back they also make like CBD coconut oil which I really want to try I for skin irritation I know some women tell me you know with their vaginal pain if they have like skin pain they put the CBD oil on their skin and it helps with me I haven't noticed it notice the difference with that so you just kind of have to see what works best for you through trial and error and yeah I think I covered everything that you guys were asking if you have any other questions comments suggestions concerns leave them down below don't forget to give this video a thumbs up and I will see you in my next video bye guys", "llUiZVO0TEE": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be making CBD infused coconut oil using a double boiler hem there are multiple ways to make diffuse oils and today we'll be going with one of the most common ways the double boiler method which is an easy and effective way to infuse health into the oil note that this method works with all oils and not just coconut oil olive oil vegetable oil grapeseed oil they all work so depending on what you're using it for you can substitute the oil you want to infuse so here you want to start out with a quarter of an ounce of buds or trim per cup of oil of course trim will not be as potent as buds so if you're using trim you can add more if you want the oil to be stronger or if you want it to be less potent then trim is a good choice as always I recommend using decarboxylated hemp to get the maximum amount of potency however here today I'm feeling lazy so I'm just going to add them directly into the oil and let it decarboxylate while it's being infused all I need to do is grind the pound then mixed with the oil in a bowl that can fit on top of a pot inside the pot I'll add about 3 cups of water this will vary based on the size of the pot you're using but you'll need to add enough water so that it doesn't completely evaporate after two hours of simmering but not so much that it'll touch the bottom of the bowl you want the bowl to be heated by the steam of the water and not the water itself for a consistent temperature I'll then put the pot on the stove let it boil and then turn down the heat so that it's slowly simmering and finally place the bowl on top of the pot the bull should fit in such a way that almost no steam is escaping from the pot although there should be enough pressure from the steam that a little will constantly escape the steam will consistently heat the oil up to 212 degrees a perfect low heat that will infuse a CBD in with the oil and not so hot that it will burn off any of the CBD if you saw my video on making butter note that both this double boiler method as was directly simmering in the water method are interchangeable when infusing I like this method more when working with oils because other than coconut oil most oils won't turn solid when cooled which makes it harder to separate from water so although this method will have a stronger flavor since there's no water to remove some of the terpenes and chlorophyll which gives flavor it is a lot easier to produce I stir it a little bit from time to time and let it sit for about two hours to properly decarboxylate and infuse now that the oil is infused you'll want to let it sit for a while before straining it since a lot of the oils are stuck to the plant material you'll want to make sure the oil is not hot to the touch because after filtering it through a cheesecloth you'll want to squeeze out all the remaining oil from the plant material to get every last drop and that's it the oil is now ready for use and you're storing the oil be sure to keep it in refrigerator or freeze it if you want to store it for long-term use", "4IvfaBg_3Kk": "oh my gosh i think this is the salve that i tried of 70s as well this is my favorite this stuff is so good first of all check out the packaging like so cute adorbs and i love that they use like a bamboo or a wooden lid and rather than straight plastic oh my gosh okay i'm ripping this baby open to try check this out it smells so good first of all save that puppy it smells so good", "S0S4bMrmj-I": "- This is my very first\nshipment of CBD oil. (upbeat music) Good morning y'all, rough morning. I honestly was not planning\nto pick up the camera until I was feeling a little better, but something adorable happened. Harlow, while you are adorable, I'm actually not talking about you. I managed to make it downstairs, and I found this from Judd. This is gorgeous. Got a sailboat, a pink sunset, wow. This is so touching, it says, the card says, with you,\nlife is an adventure, happy Valentine's Day. And he wrote the sweetest most amazing... I'm not gonna share what he\nwrote 'cause it was personal, but you know this is\nnot typically like Judd, the romantic gesture, so I know he put a lot\nof thought into this and, I've got a great man. Alright I have made it to my destination. I need the heating pad, I\nneed my nausea to go down. I will see y'all in a bit. Hey Harlow, you wanna be snuggled, and your nose is like right in my armpit. Well y'all I am feeling a bit better. Harlow actually slept on our\nbed all night last night. Usually she'll get up after awhile 'cause she gets too hot, but I woke up and she was happily\nlaying between Judd and I. She was actually kind of invading Judd's space and like pushing him, so that Judd starting\ncoming into my space. But we made it work. Anyways I've got a\nphysical therapy session and the PT should be here any minute now. And then I'm going to\ntry something new today. Alright I had my physical\ntherapy, it went well. The first thing he asked me is, \"Do you have your AFO's yet?\" And I said no, but my appointment, I'm not sure if I told y'all yet, is Friday to get my AFO's and my joint braces from Hanger Clinic. So, looking forward to that. Anyways as a Valentine's Day treat, I am making Judd some pulled pork, one of his favorite things. The last time I tried to make pulled pork, it went not so great. I cooked it on high instead of low, so the pork really didn't shred well, but I think this one's\nready to be shredded. Oh my goodness, yes, it's\nshredding beautifully. Okay so the secret is to\ncook it on low for six hours instead of high for three hours, ta-dah! Alrighty, so I shredded it up, I put some of this sauce in it, and I actually have a\nrecipe to share with y'all 'cause I was like if I mess this up again, I wanna blame it on a recipe. So I put a link to it in the description, and then I added some Sticky\nFingers Carolina Sweet, and I think he's gonna love it. Alrighty y'all, I said I\nwas trying something new, and here it is. This is my very first shipment of CBD oil. So I've been talking with my\ndoctors about my chronic pain, and we are always looking for new ways to improve my quality of life, and to help me manage my pain, and it had been suggested\nto me to try CBD oil. And if you wanna learn about\nmy pain management plans and past discussions of this, I would check out my\npain management playlist. So originally, I was\nopposed to trying CBD oil because I was worried it\nwould lower my blood pressure, and I already have problems with that. I have to take medications\nto keep my blood pressure up, but I think that was just me\nnot knowing much about CBD oil. Some people it doesn't do anything to BP, some people it goes up, down. We don't know exactly how\nit's going to affect me, but I talked to my pain\nmanagement doctor about it, and he thinks it's at least\na try 'cause many people have had a lot of success with CBD oil, and if it helps me, how\nwonderful would that be, especially since it is natural. Now I did a fair amount\nof research on CBD oil before deciding to do it, and before deciding which company\nI was gonna purchase from, and one of the first\nthings I learned is that many people have very strong opinions on which company is the\nbest to purchase from. And what I think will be\ntrue in this instance, is that every brand can\naffect everyone differently, and you really need to do a little bit of trial and error to see\nwhat works best for you. So the company I decided to go with first is one that a fellow EDS blogger uses, her name is Christina Dougherty, and this company is called Theramu. And if it works well for her, I felt confident in giving it a try to see if it works well for me. Now CBD oil may do nothing for me, I know a lot of people\nhave success with it, but I have spoken with some people who said it really didn't do much. Or it did very little that it\njust wasn't worth the cost. So I am moving forward with\nthis, cautiously optimistic. I really, really want it to work, but I'm not going to get my\nhopes unrealistically high. I like my saying of cautious optimism. If this one really doesn't\ndo anything for me, like I said, different brands\nmay affect you differently, so I will probably try\nat least one more time with a different brand. I was looking at Lazarus\nor Bluebird Botanicals, those look good 'cause they\nhave third party testing on their products, but anyways, this is what I have right now. So this is... It just came in this box, this\ndoesn't fit in our mailbox so they delivered it\nto the leasing office. It was fine, it came with my receipt, and this pretty stuff that looks like, I don't know hamsters would use it, or like birds for nests, whatever. Packaging I guess and\nit came with this box. Now it's open because I\ndid try it last night, I put a drop on my skin first because, you know me, I'm\nprone to allergic reactions, and after awhile, nothing\nhappened with the drop on my skin, so I put one drop under\nmy tongue and went to bed, and I was totally fine. I wanted to try it first last night because, well, that's when it came in, but also Judd was home,\ntoday he's working. And so you open it up,\nand here is the oil. It was facing the right\nway when I first opened it. And I got the Theramu Calm Pro. Which I think just means it's a higher strength\nthan their original. And it is mango flavor,\nand 100% pure hemp extract. Sublingual dietary supplement. 750 milligrams pure hemp extract. And this is one ounce. Supplemental facts, serving\nper container, about 120. Serving size is five drops. So I get one drop under my tongue. The dose would be five. Other ingredients, pure Emu oil, organic mango extract, it's gluten free. Directions say shake well before use as pure ingredients naturally separate. Place five drops under\nthe tongue subliminally. Up to three times a day or as recommended by your\nhealthcare practitioner. Hold under tongue for 20\nseconds before swallowing. Store at room temperature. Does not contain THC. So yes, I'm using CBD oil,\nthere's no THC component which is the component\nthat makes people stoned. And this is legal in all 50 states. If you wanna know about\nprices for this specifically, just check out their website, I'll link it in the description. That's kind of what I worry\nabout, it being cost-prohibitive 'cause it is kind of pricey, and depending on how much\nI need it, but we'll see. I don't even know if it's gonna work yet and some people say it has\nto get into your system, so it takes awhile to\nstart seeing affects, or it works right away. I didn't notice any difference\nyesterday from my one drop, but, oh I forgot to shake it. So we're gonna shake it up. Alright, I got my drops. I'm gonna like open my mouth and use this while y'all are watching me okay. So here we go. And then I leave it under my\ntongue for like 20 seconds. You really can't taste anything, it doesn't really taste\nlike anything to me. Maybe like a hint of mango, but... Has it been 20 seconds yet? Okay I left it for like 30 seconds 'cause I wanted to be safe. But there we go, we shall\nsee how it affects me. No difference yet. (laughs) But I will keep y'all updated\non my journey with CBD oil, I am really, really hoping and praying it will be a good resource\nfor me, but time will tell. Hi y'all, I've made it into bed. I honestly do not feel a\ndifference with the CBD oil. However my pulse is giving\nme lots of issues tonight. Generally my heart rate is 110, 120, 130, so still tachycardic, yes\nmy pulse gives me issues, but it looks like my baseline. Not tonight, I am up in the 160's and Harlow alerted to me twice today, one syncopy I was able to prevent, by laying down and elevating my feet, the other one I couldn't even prevent it, so, I mean I'm okay. Harlow alerted, I was in a safe place, but (sighs) my pulse is bad tonight. And it started to get worse like two hours after I took the CBD oil, but I don't feel the CBD\noil is making my pulse worse because I was having issues\nwith it this morning. And just the nature of the beast I guess. With the CBD oil, I talked to Judd, and kind of our game plan, is that I'm going to finish\nthe bottle from Theramu. The current bottle I have,\nI'm gonna take five drops in the morning and five drops at night. I watched the video. I edited the volume a little bit, and I think I put way more\nthan five drops in my mouth. It's kind of hard to tell, but anyways, I'm going to take it in\nthe morning and at night until the bottle finishes. If I don't see any difference with it, then I will try another brand and I've decided I'll\ntry Lazarus Naturals. And you know I wanna\nreally give it a good try, I'm really hoping it can help me. Also, if y'all have\nbeen watching the news, I'm sure you know that something really tragic happened in Florida. There was a shooting at a high school and it happened in Parkland, which is several hours South from here, but, gosh, it's hard to\nknow exactly what to say when these things happen. It's heartbreaking and\nwe feel it, I'm sure, all through Florida and\nthrough this nation, and my prayers are with everyone affected. Snuggling Harlow close to me tonight. She's also very attached to me because I'm not feeling\nwell with my pulse. I'm actually gonna be running\nan extra liter tonight to hopefully help with it\nso when I wake up tomorrow I'm hopefully not struggling as much. Anyways, I'm going to bed, so with that I'll say goodnight, and thanks for joining\nus on our adventure. (upbeat music)", "2VCDFUeC3Ow": "hey everyone and welcome to hemp in a pan today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills [Music] so if you're looking for a great discreet and portable way to consume CBD then you've come to the right place because today we'll be showing you how to make CBD pills we'll start first with making CBD infused coconut oil to fill the capsules coconut oil works well for this because it solidifies at room temperature so that the pills are more stable when transporting around and because of their high saturated fat content they'll infuse well with the CBD I used a quarter of an ounce of medicinal hemp per cup of oil you can add more or less to this recipe depending on how potent you want the pills to be but I found that a fourth of an ounce is a good starting point for most people we'll start first with grinding of the hemp and then decarboxylated in the oven at 250 degrees for about 30 minutes now that the hemp is nice and toasty you'll want to place it in a bowl with the coconut oil place it on top of a pot of boiling water and then use this double boiler technique to infuse the hemp with the coconut oil you'll want to let this boil for at a minimum an hour and preferably two to three hours to make sure that as much of the CBD is infused in the oil as possible now you want to take it out the heat and let it sit for about half an hour to let it cool down not so cool that it solidifies to room temperature but not so hot that I'll burn to the touch strain everything through a cheesecloth [Music] [Music] squeeze as much of the oil out as possible and now we're ready to place them in the capsules you'll probably need to wait another 15 minutes or longer for the oil to cool down just a bit more the melting point for the gelatin capsules are around 90 to 95 degrees because it has to dissolve at below the human body temperature of 98 degrees so you'll have a range of around 75 to 90 degrees to work with since once you're below 75 degrees then the infused CBD coconut oil will start to solidify we now need a few supplies for this part starting with the capsules I found that the zero zero sized capsules are a good compromise between size and ease of use if you want a smaller capsules you can go down to the size zero which is easier to swallow but harder to fill I don't recommend anything smaller than a size zero as they're just really hard to work with you'll also need a way to fill the capsules most food-grade syringes work well and the ones with the needle tips or a tapered deep reach will make it easier to fill the capsules accurately now there's a ton of capsule pill holders on the market to help hold the capsules in place to fill it quicker and to automatically cap each pill afterwards but if you're not making that many pills you can always make a simple one with a small cardboard box and a drill which is what I'm doing now now that I finished drilling in the holes for the capsules I placed each inside as you can see well the hole i accidentally drilled too large so i'll just skip that one now I just used a syringe to fill each capsule cap the maus and that's it [Music] for long-term storage I definitely recommend keeping them in the fridge as warmer climates will keep the coconut oil from solidifying and here's what they look like once solid", "jWXqzj_TP0Y": "cbd oil was marketed as skin care products for everything from acne to wrinkles in any case is any advantage possible let's get into some facts about cbd oil and skin care what is cbd oil cbd otherwise called cannabinoids is a non-intoxicating component of marijuana or hemp plants cbd is removed as a powder and is normally blended in with oil like olive hemp or coconut all of which improve application and viability hence the name cbd oil cbd oil and skincare won't get you high because it doesn't have the mind-altering properties of marijuana's thc content it's extracted from the blossoms and leaves of the hemp plant whose thc's are standingly low it's important to realize that cbd is not the same thing as hemp seed oil which is another great ingredient for the skin the two are regularly advertised interchangeably however cbd always concentrated in cannabidiol and hemp seed oil only contains trace amounts of cannabidiol if any research has established that acne is an inflammatory condition albeit different components trigger acne we realize that anything you apply to the skin can decrease the irritation and help relieve skin this is where cbd comes in as some suggest it's likely to noticeably lessen breakouts especially acne related redness numerous studies have demonstrated that cbd oil has mitigating benefits when applied to the skin this makes cbd a solid ingredient for acne prone skin while it's calming benefits help responsive skin look and feel good research also shows that cbd can possibly decrease excess sebum oil production possibly due to its balancing effect on the flow of skin's oil however most researchers contemplating cbd conclude that the more definitive logical examinations are expected to affirm these underlying results since it originates from a plant it's not surprised that cbd oil has antioxidant properties the antioxidants in cbd topical use helps lessen the visible signs of aging by neutralizing free radical damage and decreasing the appearance of inflammation cbd anti-aging creams noticeably reduce issues like wrinkles skin dullness and reddy skin tone another advantage of cbd oils that has been found to have huge alleviating properties its

advantages in addition to cbd's suggested advantages for anxiety stress and chronic pain it may also be helpful for treating acne numerous cbd skincare items may be seen as great choices as they can hydrate the skin and for store maturing a huge assortment of products are available past the typical lotions in medicine you can buy cbd shower bath additives or other relaxation products all of which can make utilizing cbd simpler like with different types of cbd there are a few disadvantages to be aware of for instance bioavailability and ingestion speed can defer like of oral cbd topical cbd isn't the most ideal choice if you want to absorb as much cbd as possible absorption rates aren't great and it could require some investment for the cbd to arrive at top concentration using these products can be inconvenient and in the case you're not used to utilizing skin care bombs and other topical products becoming accustomed to rubbing a cbd treatment gel or ointment into your skin could feel unnatural and inconvenient some topical cbd products can move to other people like with other topical meds it's possible for topical cbd products to transfer to your partner as well as your children through skin contact thus it's essential to be cautious while applying topical cbd well everyone we hope you enjoyed today's video if you're looking for cbd oil broad spectrum that is on our

CBD oil that i've been taking my lazarus naturals and it's a high potency it says to take a whole milliliter which contains 50 milligrams of CBD oil however i only take about three drops and the most I've ever taken is about seven drops I'm not a physician and I'm not a scientist this is just my personal experience and what I have personally found online about CBD oil I found that for anxiety pain and general health two point five milligrams up to twenty milligrams is often recommended so if I take three drops of that oil that's just four point eight milligrams there's a very small amount and yet it was actually really effective I was so pleased to find out that it was actually just enough for me to not be constantly anxious irritated oh my gosh I don't feel good inside my kitchen because there are dishes everywhere - okay there's that was left out of course you have a little bit of mess they were just taller Bulgin taking CBD oil was like little drops of grace so I started taking CBD oil while I was pregnant I actually went to a health care provider with midwives and there were actually multiple midwives at this practice and I took the opportunity to meet various ones of them during my pregnancy during my last pregnancy and I asked each of them when I would then I would say you know what do you think about CBD oil I would also ask what kind of medication is recommended for postpartum anxiety you know is that different than for postpartum depression and all of these things are so important to think about while you're pregnant and you might not have an experience of pee Mads during your pregnancy but you might and you might not have that experience postpartum but you might and so thinking through these things before you get to that point where you're like I can't take this anymore and you don't know what to do thinking through it beforehand is so important I highly recommend that during my pregnancy I was feeling just the anxiety kind of like building up for me it's not been typically like a depression thing but it's like stress it's like not normal and you know yourself and you know if this is not typical I'm a really optimistic person but when I start feeling like I might have a panic attack because I'm worried about XYZ I know that's not normal that is hormones and that is the effect of pregnancy that is the effect of postpartum sleep deprivation and it needs to be addressed for my own well-being self-care is so important and if you're looking at this video and you're thinking okay I'm not feeling great you know maybe you're in the middle of your pregnancy and you're like I just want to kill my husband or I'm just getting angry all the time this is not like me or I can't take my other kid to the park because I am so stressed out those are kinds of things that you may be on the fence as far as do I need medication or is there something natural that I can take this this little thing even just a little bit I can notice the difference there was another website that said therapeutic reactions are in full swing within 20 to 30 minutes and the effects tend to last anywhere between four to six hours that was extremely true for me if I take three drops of CBD oil and this is zero percent THC it's not from a marijuana plant it's from hemp plant and it's very well reviewed I found it on a website that reviews lots of them this one is actually one of the least expensive that was on this like top ten website oh I'll go ahead and link to it below if I take it just out three drops I can tell the difference in like twenty to thirty minutes so what it means though if if it's between four to six hours and that's true for me to like I can tell that it's wearing off after about four hours I start kind of feeling the way that I was again and that doesn't mean that while you're awake you're probably going to take it about every four to six hours being pregnant I was waking up during the night and I was feeling not good you know intrusive thoughts sometimes especially like an early postpartum that sleep deprivation is huge on me it's a it has a big effect on you and different people respond to sleep deprivation in different ways but that is a very big concern so if I woke up in the middle of the night then I'll just take three drops again then and you're probably curious how you take it so I'll just do that right now you just shake the bottle gently a little bit and then since you're if you're only taking like a few drops you don't need to have much in the thing but you just get really close and put it under your tongue you drop this under your tongue and then you don't want to drink your water or eat your food like right after I loop I usually just let it sort of sit there in my mouth for about two minutes before I drink more water staying hydrated is also key but taking care of yourself is so important so I mean my experience and like I said this is just anecdotal you need to talk to your own care provider to make a decision but my choice was hey this is legal where I live if you have concerns about that there are videos and websites that talk about your state and what you're allowed to buy and use this took the edge off for me to the point where I did not feel anymore like hey I might need to take a drug that's prescribed to me and that's a much more involved process as far as breastfeeding and taking CBD oil I equate it to caffeine consumption and breastfeeding if you're consuming a cup of coffee each day you don't need to be concerned about that making a baby wired there are some people who firmly believe that their babies are super sensitive to caffeine as well as other things and that's person to person you're going to get different experiences obviously you're going to want to do your due diligence and make sure that you get an oil that is pure and that is you know refined correctly it's like well reviewed everything and I think that if you're gonna try something this is worth looking at I'm very importantly I'm healthy mentally and I'm taking the time for self-care in doing what I need to do to make sure I'm well rested my anxiety levels are kept at bay and I'm taking care of myself leaving myself nutritious foods because otherwise I can't take care of my kids the way I need to and that gives the thing for you to I just encourage you to take care of yourself mama and whether you're a pregnant mama or whether you are you know trying to conceive or whether you have a new little baby you have to take care of your stuff we have to take care of ourselves in order to take good care of our kids so I hope this video helps this is just one person's experience I highly recommend it based on my experience and I hope that you talk to your doctor my wife about it and I hope that you have a really good experience with European meds or your anxiety whatever you're looking at this video for so I hope that helps and I would love for you to subscribe to see more videos like it maybe some videos about my miscarriages about my birth experiences I'd love for you to join me and watching those videos so I hope you subscribe and I'll see you later", "CT_cTHJPQCs": "we are sorted a group of mates who have your back when it comes to all things food from cooking battles to gadget review and as the worker and cookbook challenges to a midweek meal Pat's app crack your eggs we uncover the tools that will help us all cook and eat smarter join a community where everything we do starts with you hello I'm Jamie this is Mike welcome to fridge today we taste essence CBB food and drink products to see you know it's a trend worth taking seriously and do they actually taste really good so many of you have requested that we try some CBD food products so we've got our chefs Ben and James here we've got our normals Jamie and Baz to give a conflicting perhaps different side of the argument and we're going to see whether we think CBD and food have a place in synergy together in the world [Music] ok see what we're talking about today whoa smile so first off very very important that we make it clear that we are not researchers nor are we in the medical profession what we do like to do is eat first off what is CBD marijuana CBD is a compound found in the canvas plant it can be using several different ways including vaping teachers capsules and edibles it's what we're talking about today unlike its close relative THC which I'm not going to tell you the full name CBD is completely non psychoactive this allows us to benefit from the many health properties of the cannabis plant without the negative side effects of getting high this is one of the highest rated CBD oils that you can get in the UK it's made in the UK or the UK but before we begin anything pop three drops under your tongue hold it for 30 to 60 seconds and swallow Grassi very earthy mm-hmm it's got actually got a slight burn to it floral it's like the grass poppy it's got like a a spicy back note to a hoppy flavor it's not terrible it's just very safe very savoury this is how this is marketed it may reduce anxiety and depression improve sleep reduce seizures in people with epilepsy soothe pain and information and improve heart health board claims a lot of players have tried this before with the idea thing it's you've got quite useful for anxiety and so on but actually I couldn't get in the habit of using it regularly enjoy I actually asked one of my friends who I know uses it to give us a quick summary of why he uses it and he said I've been using CBD oil for the last six months to help me manage my anxiety and insomnia I often get anxious being in crowded places so I'll often have a few drops about half an hour before doing these activities it comes me down very quickly and slows my mind down I also use it if I wake up in the middle of the night and I can't switch my brain off I think it's good to use infrequently I try and only use it a couple of times a month that is interesting right to have such a cause-and-effect mmm is I I'm surprised that it's that direct John hasn't a guess in how much that bottle cost I'm going to throw thirty pounds okay I was gonna say like more like eight pounds 4495 oh well very clear when you tasted it earlier you didn't like the taste let's see if we can find a way to get the same benefits through something yummy dip the cloth [Music] these are CBB Zen bears CBD gummies with the guaranteed 5 milligrams of CBD per pair each pot contains 100 pairs giving you a total 500 milligrams of CBD it's all about natural delicious fruit flavors with no sugar or sweeteners so the highest searched CBD term on Google difficult to find recommended dosages online the guys who provided the oil recommended we go on body weight so for people your body weight you're looking to consume around 18 milligrams both a THC free you will not get high you will not suffer those side effects they do both contain CBD now I'm gonna try a little let the red one a yellow one mine tastes like a gummy bear it's a lemony it does not taste like CBD does not quite CBD yeah right now how not per mange really I really expected that to taste like fruit but that tastes a lot like the CBD oil sweet gummy fruity it certainly hasn't got any of that flavor that we were having from the oil it's a much less experience than having the CBD straight but it doesn't like their nostrils [Music] CBD gummies treat yourself to an extremely chilled out Valentine's Day eight gummies in each pack eight sweet kisses of calm each gummy heart contains two milligrams of CDD scent match to the fragrant Tahoe og cannabis strain that must mean something to someone somewhere they don't taste amazing but again like I probably would never attribute that term CBD their hearts are much sweeter mmm but still not I mean love hearts are the first to go - can any picker mix oh no no way totally with you then Oh Percy pig oh absolutely not no no Harry by Friday oh wow I didn't expect that oh I mean that looks more like is aimed at kids now edible cannabis weird it's giving off the whole subculture of being high and stoned and applying that to the branding of a product that does none of that hmm they are playing to that market and misleading I should imagine this is a good thing looks a bit more more a bit more medical how much do you think the gummy love hearts are eight gummy hearts they can't be more than copy a quid by the four pounds because you're bonkers yeah five or six quid love heart gummies are $8.99 for that packet hmm okay and the CBD Zen bears there are a hundred in that thirty-five forty quid I reckon there's fifty quest probably forty quid hmmm oh yeah tenner 39 pounds 95 pence is 500 milligrams of CBD it's exact same as the oil the good thing about them is that they're it's a lot easier to apply a dosage well I don't know how much oil I had but I thought I had a drop he watched me pour half a dropper down my throat amazing how much packaging changes your mind because if those who come in that then I'd be I'd be all over there maybe like this is no good but because of that plus the price you see my quite a good idea ready for another yeah Oh stressed you not with these little delights luxury chocolates with a whopping 5 milligrams of CBD each four chocolates in each box perfect for sharing 100% legal for a guiltless experience they cannot get you high only chill you out if you say after eight months as in though yeah it's in like an eighth of an ounce Oh see this is a ha ha ha yeah I like that I'm already pre-empting that the price is on par with luxury chocolates we'll see about the quality please copy our bad mm-hmm making a gooey middle oh I was expecting like a truffle it's not unpleasant if I had that ended up in Canada I wouldn't be offenders because it tastes like I drank heaven for chocolate you know the little chocolate footballs or chocolate coins you got a Christmas in netting it tastes like cardboard chocolate lime in yeah I'm disappointed by that there's no minutes not right it's the myth right Trey you pay chocolate with a cream in his hand again they've gone down the cannabis room it actually plays off that negative stigma doesn't it yeah and I like I don't find that cool personally if the benefits of CBD work for me I'll actually be personally embarrassed to get out of product like that yeah to pay off drug culture yeah dare I ask the price would you want to take a guess or 20 quid 20 quid oh yeah I'm in 16 full pound a 16-9 pounds ninety-nine oh wow you can still keep them we're getting a bit sillier now have a lift what oh my goodness okay what Christmas pudding this is a CBD Christmas the most festive way to get a hit of the glorious green to delicious only to sell at Christmas time handmade pudding infused with CBD and cannabis terpenes don't worry it's 100% legal and cannot get too high it might make you feel chills out low do you have any brandy I'm not providing anything I'm not even bothering you no because come on like who's eating this well apparently we are yeah [Music] but I do like a good Christmas pudding I'm not sure that's a good Christmas pudding no it's the kind of thing that someone would have got old little Johnny's a STONER why don't we get him listeners without heating up Oh garnish it with Holly flambe and 70 brandy butter it just tastes like fruit it's like guys that it's a pretty good as just as bad as any other fruitcake I think I've still six tip of the air the oil yeah I'm still sticking with the oil happy holidays yeah there are studies showing that CBD loses its potency once heated to above 200 degrees Fahrenheit this is not by any means a bad fruitcake I just I'm not sure I see the point I'm not sure this would be the vehicle in which if I wanted CBD I would take it it is an odd thing but its novelty again isn't it how much how much for the PUD ten pounds twelve Robin I want to say ten pounds fiver three pounds ninety-nine yes hmm I'm quite young surprised at how cheap they is well the recommended retail price is $9.99 it's because it's not Christmas boy slightly different this one right there so that whoa look at the color of that this is cannabis sativa Jim cannabis sativa is herbaceous flowering plant from Asia it's been cultivated throughout recorded history of the source of industrial fiber seed oil food recreation religious and spiritual moods and medicine each part of the plant is harvested differently depending on the purpose of its use this has been infused with cannabis sativa to have a taste see what you think not my favorite did but it tastes like gin alright it's not home okay crafted in Amsterdam for massive cannabis plant on the front of it so this is completely different in the there are no CBD benefits this is the other way round this is marketing purely cannabis as a selling point fine fine I mean it's a perfectly suitable botanical I wonder what they put in it that gives it that green tinge food coloring probably it's 40% it's a property it's a proper gin it tastes nice and it's a nice tasting too you know yeah I think yeah you have to work our ways that you can market yourself out there and by adding the botanicals of cannabis I think it does it so I can see how on the shelf in Amsterdam this would stand out would you put it on your alcohol shop I would yeah I'm good it's interesting that's a talking point that's it people would ask questions about it Oh does it and you go no yeah Oh could I get no you can't other than the whopping great big leaf and the association that cropped up recently there's nothing novel about hemp it's been around forever in rope-making and clothes making and paper making and all sorts there's nothing new about it it's just the craze now they're latching on to this doesn't offend me as long as doesn't cost a fortune how much do you think it costs for the bottom 25 hours bang in the middle 30 pounds $29.99 just what you pay for a nice bottle of gin so in summary CBD food the crossover what your thoughts CBD is not necessary and food and food is not necessary see we do see videos of supplement boom and you can choose to have as an oil or I think it's quite a good idea to put in something like gummies so you can regulate it a lot and it's more enjoyable I can definitely see it having a place I don't necessarily think that we're there yet like so many people feel they have to play off the legality of cannabis and it's naughty and you shouldn't be having it but it's okay because we put in a Christmas pudding for you I think the market needs more education about the benefits of CBD and then that can be celebrated and there's actually a CBD brownie recipe in our brand new cookbook to the beat yeah we fuse music and food we've got loads of playlist loads of recipes it looks amazing if you'd like to get a hold of it I'll click the link in the description can I do

for you to play whilst you cook so go and grab it now at sorted Club and now a blooper so what CBD products have you already heard of fish CBD fish how would get a fish no okay", "uZzpi7JWy00": "hey guys welcome back to our channel today is just me erica and i'm doing a wash day routine and for today's wash day routine i'm adding an element that is highly effective and that is cbd now just a little quick watered down lesson about cbd um in the past few years i feel like cbd has become more mainstream i think it's because a lot of people are doing their research on the benefits of cbd and i just wanted to say this cbd doesn't get you high it's the thc that gets you high and there is no thc in the um cbd products that i'm using but this is just i'm not going to go into the whole uh a whole lesson on cbd or like in depth about cbd you guys can research it for yourself because that's not what this video is about i am just showing you the benefits of it in hair care and a lot of hair care brands are starting to incorporate cbd in their products which is why i'm doing this video and the hair care brand that i used was the brand hemps and i've been a fan of pimps for a while um i used their lotion their body lotion and all of their products smell really really good but recently they introduced their cbd haircare line and i really wanted to try it out and they did have like travel size options on their site so i did get the travel size option of each product which is actually amazing because if i don't like the product it's not like i'm wasting a lot of it um so i did get the trial size and um even their full size is very affordable i was really impressed with their line because a is affordable like even the big size and b their uh cbd product line is very thorough like it comes with a shampoo a scalp oil a conditioner hair mask and a leave-in so i'm just going to go through this wash routine and let you guys in on the benefits of cbd so i started off with the cbd moisture hit ultra hydrating herbal shampoo and this has 45 milligrams of cbd so the cbd that hemp uses the hair care brand um the one they use is cbd isolate meaning there is nothing added to it now the shampoo or the product line itself isn't odorless and that's because they added eucalyptus and tea tree oil to their products and that's just to add to the benefits especially for the scalp and cbd is amazing for the hair and scalp because it is loaded with vitamins and levels of collagen and keratin so you are getting the effects of a protein treatment cbd is known to strengthen the hair so my thoughts on this uh shampoo immediately when i used it i felt a cooling sensation on my scalp it felt so good and i definitely think it was the tea tree oil working to cleanse the scalp that's why i felt that cooling sensation and the shampoo itself wasn't anything special as far as when it comes to moisturizing um it just felt like any regular shampoo but it definitely wasn't bad it didn't dry out my hair or anything but um yeah as far as i definitely felt more you know the scalp area but as far as moisturizing nothing really wowing but yeah it wasn't too bad and after the shampoo i used the cbd royal treatment ultra hydrating herbal scalp serum which also has 45 milligrams of cbd and again all these products have eucalyptus oil and tea tree oil in them so not only do they smell amazing but these two oils work together with cbd to care for its scalp tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil helps soothe the scalp cbd kind of comes in and gets to the root of the problem and reduces inflammation in the scalp so if you are suffering from dry itchy scalp um if you have eczema cyborg dermatitis um cbd oil infused products are i feel like they're recommended if you have any of those problems but again do your research so my notes on the scalp serum like this stuff is the real deal um if you don't get or if you want anything from this product line i would say get this even in travel size it's a good size and it's super affordable yeah my itchy scalp went away just like that and that combined with the shampoo was a definite game changer so i would say this product is definitely something you want to add to your hair routine and you don't have to get like the whole product line you can just use this like by itself or you know in addition to the regular shampoos that you use but yeah if you have dry itchy scalp definitely get this alright so next in rotation was the cbd on one conditioner ultra hydrating herbal conditioner cbd also contains loads of fatty acids and amino acids and if you guys don't know those both kind of lock in moisture and combat dryness in the hair and again with this conditioner kind of like the shampoo i didn't really notice a difference in moisturization or moisturizing um like i said it didn't really obviously make my hair dry but it wasn't again wasn't anything like too special i did feel like again it was more of a scalp thing like this focusing more on the scalp but yeah i'm probably going to be feeling like the cooling sensation for the rest of the week all right so next up is the mask and i'm so excited that they included a mask in their collection because a lot of collections don't really add masks in and i used the cbd masquerade party instant ultra hydrating herbal hair mask and that contained 40 milligrams of cbd also all these products and all hemps products contain 100 pure natural hemp seed oil and this is another strengthening aspect of the cbd collection hemp seed oil just fills in the weak part of the hair with strengthening benefits and i just left this on my hair for about 30 40 minutes just so that my hair can get the strength it deserves um i am i think i want to say i'm 10 months post relaxer so um yeah i just need my hair to be built for it tough because the two textures i don't need them like breaking off all right so after rinsing that out the next stage is to add the leave-in and i am a leave-in conditioner snob i think it's because i have my my top five favorite leave-in conditioners so anytime i use a new one it has to live up to the height and i know what i want out of a leave-in conditioner and the main quality needs to be in its ability to detangle so i'll let y'all know in a second how i feel about this one but it is called the um cbd seeing is believe in ultra hydrating conditioning mist now this product is supposed to help hydrate detangle and control frizz but i will say after using it i really really wasn't a fan again like i said earlier i am 10 months post relaxer it's time for me to get a new relaxer to get another relaxer and my new growth is just all over the place so i can really tell how good a product's detangling aspect is you know because of my you know new growth and this one just didn't really impress me that much i think if i was at the beginning stage of my relaxer it would be okay because it wasn't terrible at detangling it just wasn't it didn't live up to the height or you know my standards of detangling so yeah during the middle of my um my detangling stage i just switched over to my oi all-in-one hair milk and the difference was like night and day i love that detangler again that's one of my top five retailers so i just switched over to that and it was like easy breezy detangling and the rest of the routine just went flew by it went by fast so also i did go on hips website to see if this detangler had any type of uh heat protectant in it and it didn't say so i was kind of iffy about that because again after i detangle i blow dry so um yeah i switched over to the oil all my hair milk and that has a heat protectant in it um so yeah i don't think this detangler has heat protection so just a little side note but again it's not bad but i just won't be reaching for this again so yeah all right so i did finish my routine i just blow dry my hair and i also flat ironed it um so here are my notes on the collection so i did feel like the collection did what it was supposed to do my hair feels like i just got a protein treatment um i haven't had a protein treatment in a while so it was kind of again it was kind of needed because i am getting a relaxer soon so i want my hair to be a little bit you know not in its weak stage and with all the protein benefits that come with using cbd i can see why my hair feels like it just got a protein treatment my scalp also feels clean um no more itchiness and also usually after i finish my wash my blow dry or in flat iron stage i usually have like little flakes on the edge of my hairline i didn't have any of that i feel like it did its job again in the scalp department and in the strengthening department but as far as moisturizing um all the products that hydrating in the title so i don't know me like i said didn't make my hair feel dry so it was hydrated yeah you guys let me know if you guys use cbd oil in your hair products um i know some people like to add like drops of cbd oil and their shampoo you could do that but hair care lines are starting to come out with cbd infused hair products um this line again does not have thc in it you're not gonna get high and yeah it's also paraben free and gluten free yeah i feel like the real winner of this collection was the scalp serum and like i said you guys need to go get that like i will continue to use that and like massaging my hair i will definitely use it after the shampoo kind of how i did it in my routine um but yeah my scalp just felt clean and like you could just feel the cooling sensation it's just a good feeling overall so again let me know if you guys use cbd if it's not in hair care if you use it in skincare let me know um yeah thank you guys for watching and we will see you guys next week bye [Music] you", "N3Yw3dtj6Pc": "hey guys so today's video is gonna be me talking through my experience using CBD oil I've been using it for about a month now so I thought it was about time I share my experience with you guys and yet share if there's been any benefits for my skin so the CBD oil that I've been using is by Zen CBD I picked this up in Planet organic so any of you guys given the UK or live in London then CBD is stocked in Planet organic and yeah and you can pick this up I think the reason I picked this up is because it was firstly a really good price it would being discounted from I think 30 pounds to 20 pounds and I say a good price that it's still super expensive but yeah I went in there and actually spoke to a sales consultants and they taught me through the different options I'm I explained of what I wanted to use it for I liked the fact that I hadn't ever used cbz or before so they recommended this one it's a fairly low strength I think it's between 3 to 5 percent obviously it determines how much you use I've been using 1 to 2 sprays I started with one spray and I've built up to two so yeah this is the one that I've been using like with other supplements I think it's really beneficial to actually speak to somebody who actually sells the product or is experienced in using the product just because they'll be able to give you like an honest opinion or an honest review on which of those sort of things actually work which kind of brands might be more suitable for what you need them for so yeah like I said I started on a low percentage and that's what I've been using I know that you can build this up but for me I just wanted to start with yeah the lowest strength and just see how that worked for me first so the potential benefits because obviously there's a reason I wanted to try this in the first place I had read so many positive reviews on how this had really been able to help people manage day-to-day stress anxiety and a ton of other really great health benefits for me I've noticed such a huge correlation between my acne flaring up and like my emotional well-being like how much stress I'm under so I really wanted to find something that could help me yeah just manage the day-to-day stresses of life lots of people have reported that they've been able to lower inflammation that they've been able to regulate sebum production and tons of other really great things to your skin as well so yeah I wanted to give this a test see if it actually works and that's exactly what I've done for the last month so the lady that's we this in the shop instructed me to spray once two sprays underneath my tongue and hold it there for sixty seconds and that is exactly what I've been doing I haven't actually applied this topically to my skin because oil is for me really a clogging I know that some people have like miraculous results and are able to clear their skin using things like the oil cleansing method I've tried that but it just does nothing for my skin it just does not work it just makes me produce more oil it makes me feel really greasy and honestly I just I just know it doesn't work for me so if you want to apply this directly to your skin and see if there's any benefits for you then please come and report back because I'm just not going to put myself ones of that experiment but I'd love to know from you guys if that has helped your acne and yeah if you've seen any improvements in your skin so the first thing that I wanted to mention that I've seen as a result of using CBD oil is that my digestion has definitely improved now if you've been following my channel or you'd follow me over on Instagram then you will know that my digestive health has definitely been something that's been playing up since about November last year I've had all kinds of things going on from IBS to a chronic acid reflux and yeah I've just found that using CBD oil has really minimized any flare-ups I've had of those things like for example my acid reflux was really bothering me every single day all day from about January the first all the way through till the end of kind of April and it's no coincidence I've started using CBD oil and I've been able to just relax about it a bit more and I'm not saying it's completely gone please believe me it hasn't it isn't a miracle but it's definitely helped like I don't feel like I'm dealing with it all day every day it kind of comes in waves sometimes but yeah that has been the most exciting benefit I found of using CBD oil and yeah quite excited to see if I continued to use it and what will happen I've also noticed that my severe bloating which I get at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon every single day until I eat dinner and yeah it just continues to get worse and worse so that has definitely been something that's improved to I've also been kind of monitoring why I've been eating I keep a acne diary so I wanted to kind of when I'm breaking out the sort of things I'm eating how I'm feeling all the sort of things that could be tribute to a break out and I've noticed as well because I've been monitoring my in there as well that this is actually reduced as well since using CBD and again yeah it might be a coincidence but I really believed that actually the stress I put myself under about my health has reduced because of using CBD oil this is also really exciting because lots and lots and lots of studies have been done on acne and digestive health and they definitely have found correlations between the two so if you're somebody that struggles with your digestive health and you also struggle with breaking out then this could be a really really exciting thing for you to try and could potentially really heal up your skin another positive side effect I had for about a week was I started to have really great sleep like I was sleeping super quickly fall into a deep sleep and I felt very well rested when I woke up I wish I could say that this lasted throughout the whole month but honestly it didn't I feel like after the first month it sorry after the first month after the first week it kind of just sort of subsided and I just went back to my usual sleeping pattern I haven't slept really badly or anything I don't find that it's really kind of like given me that feeling before sleep where I just yet feel completely knocked out and just really well rested however lots of other people have said that this is an absolute miracle worker when it comes to insomnia and really bad sleeping patterns so if that's you then potentially you could give this a go potentially maybe I need to use a higher dose so I need to take it slightly further in the evening towards bed I've been taking it just after I've eaten probably like 15 minutes after I've eaten so that you're digesting the CBD oil with food I think actually on the bottle it says between meals and let me just check yeah it does actually say on the bottle to defy spray in between meals for best effects spray under tongue so potentially I could have taken this nearer towards bed as opposed to nearer towards dinner and maybe that would have helped me with my sleep better so the next thing the big thing for me that I really wanted to see some help with was reducing anxiety and just reducing like how you handle day-to-day stress so for me this is definitely the biggest one I've been wondering this very very carefully and I know lots of people have said that this is like amazing and has really helped them I honestly believe for the first few weeks it was most definitely helping I felt really well rested like I said and yeah just fell I don't know a little bit more able to cope with certain things and I just wasn't kind of like I don't know letting stress take over my life however for the last few weeks I just don't think that has been the case I would love to say that this has been like again a miracle-worker maybe I need to be taking a higher strength I don't know but yeah I haven't found that this is like miraculously help me manage stress and like I said at the beginning of this video if you're taking this because of stress it's also because you really want to reduce the amount of acne flare-ups you pads for me I've definitely noticed I've been breaking out around my jawline and around my kind of ears with the more kind of deep cystic spots so I haven't noticed a big improvement in CBD oil and my skin today I'm actually feeling like I'm really happy with my skin but this week hasn't been great but it's also worth noting that lots of things that help your skin that you take internally don't just work overnight and that is the case for like supplements that's the case for things like I keep saying that's the case for the pill nothing works within like a month usually so potentially if I take this for longer which I really plan to do to see if there are any additional benefits I think the three-month mark is really a good indication about whether something can really work for your skin however I also tried things for three months and they've absolutely not worked I'm looking at you best your book so yeah if you feel like something's actually making your skin worse than probably best to stop I've tried tons of other things that help me reduce my stress and my acne as well so I think the biggest trial for me was coffee like I am a coffee addict guys I know it can increase anxiety I stick to one cup a day but it really is something I look forward to and I love but last year I actually tried to give it up for two weeks and it was very very difficult guys I've actually filmed an entire blog looking at me quitting coffee the benefits I might have had in my anxiety in my skin and in fact our link it on screen now somewhere around here so go and check it out let me know what you think and I will see you over there I don't know if it tastes that nice I mean really no it doesn't taste like coffee that's for sure hmm just tasted", "fb1OozadUtY": "[Music] James and Florian survival Network and today I'm going to teach you how to make an awesome healing salve now the first step in a good healing salve is to infuse the herbs into your oil and you can do this two different ways one you can put it in a jar and have the herbs in it shake it hmm a couple times a day for about three to four weeks well me I'm too impatient for that route so I'm doing the double boiler method so what we what we have here is a double boiler and you don't necessarily have to have a double boiler it can be as easy as setting up a pot with a bowl on top just make sure that whatever bowl you're using on the top is not aluminum so this huming sad we're gonna make today does awesome its you can use it for cuts bruises poison ivy skin irritations I've had friends who've used it on boils cold sores I even have a friend who just had surgery on his hand and he massages it into his hand every night so now oil you can use anything from an olive oil to an almond oil you could also use a coconut oil but as you can see it's a little bit different consistency it's also got a melting point of about 76 degrees so it doesn't do as well in hot weather you have to play with the beeswax make sure a little bit before figuring it out so today I'm gonna use olive oil and we're gonna use two cups now what you want to make sure of is that your double boiler is at a very low temperature you get it up to a boiling and then set it to low because you don't want to deep fryers our first ingredient is echinacea you're going to use one teaspoon of echinacea root now my kinesia stimulates the immune system it also has antifungal and antibacterial properties the second ingredient we're going to use is two tablespoons of comfrey leaf now comfrey speeds the healing of wounds and skin conditions it's recommended for external use because it contains a liver toxic alkaloid which the plant uses to fight off herbivore insects our third ingredient is two tablespoons of plantain leaf now this you're probably ripping out of your yard as we speak it's a weed not to be confused with the pedantic banana but it is it helps to stop bleeding and it has drying properties you can actually use it as a pulse tiss to pull slivers out our next ingredient is a tablespoon of calendula flowers now this is the most one of the most popular herbs to help with cradle cap and diaper rash it's a very mellow herb so it's safe with children it has anti-inflammatory antiviral and it's an immunostimulant next is a teaspoon of yarrow flowers which actually naturally grows here in Central Oregon now it also helps to stop bleeding that's an anti-inflammatory and astringent and aids and healing wounds and our last ingredient is rosemary leaf now rosemary stimulates your immune system increases circulation fights inflammation bacteria and fungi not only that when you're cooking with it it just smells good now what we're gonna do is we're gonna let this double boil for approximately three three and a half hours now take note of what the color of the olive oil was when I poured it in and then check out what it's gonna look like when we pour it out all right so our herbs have been infusing them all up in our olive oil for about three and a half hours and what I've done here is I've got a big measuring cup along with a strainer and then I've cut some cheesecloth so we're gonna lay that cheesecloth down in there and we're gonna take this and because this is a double boiler and there's still water inside of it I've wrapped the handle with the towel so that we don't get any water into our appointment so now what we do pour it through the cheesecloth and the strainer let that seep through get all that oil down there in that the cheesecloth and then we're going to take this twist it up and get all that goodness out of there now I suggest letting your oil cool for a while before you do this because this can be painful I've done it when it's hot and it's not any fun once we get all that goodness out of there we're gonna just discard our herbs now comfrey one of the ingredients actually in this little packet will help the decomposition of your compost pile so if you want throw the herbs in your compost pile it'll just help so now what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to clean this out to get the residual herbs out and then we're gonna put it back on the stove and heat it back up so we'll be back in just two Jim all right so we put the oil back in the double boiler and now we're going to use a quarter cup of beeswax I you can buy it in chunks and and shred it yourself but I prefer to buy the past deals because I'm kind of lazy so I'd rather not sit there and grown a cheese shredder and shred for a long time so anyway we're putting the beeswax into the warm oil and then we're just gonna keep stirring until it all melts and as you can see it does not take long these little pest deals know quite quickly very quickly you turn the burner off so as you can see they've already melted so now what we're gonna do is we're going to take this back over and pour grab my towel pour this back into whatever you're going to use to pour into your containers and their cable so while that's cooling for a minute I want to talk containers because you don't necessarily have to go out and buy containers like I do shallow charts work well if you have an awesome best friend like I do she saves you baby jars these work awesome as well you can reuse old lotion containers just clean them out reuse them back stick containers if you want something on the go and then your kids have paints once the paints are out clean them up and use them for little travel guys backpacks whatever school bags in fact if I can get my son to acknowledge me a bruh what do you call this say one more time loud okay boo-boo juice and he has a little thing of it in his backpack so as we're letting this cool we're gonna add a little vitamin E oil to it and that's gonna help with the preservation you only need about a half a teaspoon I'm gonna stir that in oh and for those of you die hard Todd fans out there I'm not replacing them he's not gone in fact he's my cameraman say hi Todd all right so no worries he will be back all right so we've stirred the vitamin E oil into that and now we're going to pour into our containers make sure to leave a little headspace in your containers don't fill them up to the to the brim now this yields obviously since you're using a cup of olive oil it's gonna yield about two cups so there you have it now you're going to let those sit solidify up and here is what you get with the finished product obviously we use a ton of it but that is what you're gonna get with the finished product nice aunt Minn or any wounds or troubles that you may have thanks for watching [Music]", "wccMu4QJJkI": "hey it's Aneesa and what's better than one product that's gonna help you with your aches and pains how about two and that's what you get in this unique package first you get this massage roller and this is great for rolling on your tired and sore muscles and it really gets in there but what I love is with this package you get a 1 ounce bottle of CBDs break now when you couple this with the massage roller it's your one-two punch to knock out muscle knots and tension now this is an isolate which means that 99% CBD now this is topical only so please don't ingest it and if that wasn't enough they've infused this with lavender which has great aromatherapy properties now one thing I want to point out you can use the massage role or with or without the spray and it's great for pre and post workouts but what I really love is our super low price you can spend as much as $60 for the spray alone you're not gonna pay anywhere near that for both products we have a super deal and these aren't gonna last long so head on over the site and grab a set today", "UcA5DE9tGEc": "my name is C and this is my CBD story [Music] I've smoked CDD I've used salt but my preference is definitely the tinctures and I love putting it in tea cuz I'm obsessed with tea I don't use it every day when I started using it I was using it every day I was going through a time when I was having panic attacks a lot and my anxiety was so bad I wasn't really leaving the house and I wasn't able to do anything so I found that to be able to actually live like go to work show up to things even go buy groceries I felt like I I needed something and so it really saved me during that time now I pretty much use it on an as-needed basis so I find that sometimes I will go through moments when I'm super anxious and I will be using it everyday I'm right now though is not one of those times [Music]", "3Xx_0UCuUVQ": "hey everybody alex here from uncanny wellness and today I want to talk to you about a subject near and dear to my heart that's CBD and coffee so any of you that have been following uncanny wellness knows that back in 2018 we pivoted to focus specifically on the specialty coffee industry and we make products now that are designed for CBD to be infused into any coffee beverage but really any beverage for that matter with Juice smoothies teas cocktails anything like that but really specialty coffee has been our main market and so one of the questions that I get asked all the time is about the CBD and coffee interaction what happens does it do anything how are you supposed to feel if it's working and don't think just cancel each other out so many people think that you know the CBD chills you out and relaxes you and the caffeine gets you going and gets you all amped up and ready for the day so what happens when you put the two together really what happens is something beautiful let me explain one of the things that caffeine does is it binds with your brains adenosine receptors adenosine is normally responsible for preparing your body for sleep so you know it's something that grows throughout the day and increases your desire for sleep so when you drink coffee the caffeine then goes and binds with that adenosine receptor preventing your own adenosine from connecting there and thereby preventing that drowsiness from kicking into gear when caffeine binds to that demoscene receptor actually the opposite occurs where your neuron activity is increased and adrenaline is released and that's why you feel energetic and aware and awake so that sensation that we all know and love from a nice cup of coffee that really just gets you up and makes you ready to take on the day that is adrenaline kicking in unfortunately there are some negative side effects that can be experienced with that increase in adrenaline so you may know that adrenaline is responsible for that fight-or-flight response it's your sympathetic nervous system kicking into gear for people that might be sensitive to caffeine or that mages have had a few too many cups throughout the day that can induce a sense of jitteriness or edginess that could be very uncomfortable luckily one of the many things that CBD does within the body is to stimulate your serotonin receptors which produces a bit of a calming anti-anxiety sensation thereby counteracts the effects of that negative fight-or-flight response caused by the adrenaline and the caffeine and you can still get the awareness and the focus of the caffeine the mental clarity but that CBD can cut down on the jittery edginess that it can sometimes induce so that's just a very little glimpse into the science behind why CBD and coffee or CBD and caffeine work well together and in summary it's really because the caffeine and coffee puts your body into a bit of a fight-or-flight response and the CBD actually has anti-anxiety effects to calm that sensation out another reason that CBD and coffee go so well together is a little bit more cultural or habitual so many people turn to coffee and espresso based drinks throughout the day to keep them going it's part of their daily ritual and something that they can't imagine living without really when you think about it caffeine and coffee is one of humanity's favorite drugs if not the most favorite and so what better place to slip something that's so good for you into your daily routine adding CBD into your coffee or any drink that you otherwise regularly consume is just such an easy and simple way to do something really beneficial for yourself without having to create a new routine or a new regimen it's the same thing as if you're already taking a bunch of capsules or supplements if you just add a CBD supplement to your routine you're not changing anything you're not creating new habits you're just incorporating that into something that you're already doing and at the end of the day the best type of CBD product is one that you're gonna actually take it should of course work but that means that anything that you're already consuming if you can just slip in CBD to that regimen is going to make it all that much easier for you and then from another perspective just looking at specialty coffee and cafe industry and all those spaces we're already starting to see a bit more of a customizable option appear on the menus where it's not just coffees anymore there's things like tumeric lattes matcha lattes you can add collagen plant-based milks and all these different things to fine-tune the exact experience that you're looking for CBD is no exception it's really just another superfood that can give the user consuming that beverage certain types of benefits that they're looking for the final note I'll make about CBD and coffee is this most of the CBD out there is in oil form as in tinctures and vapes and creams and things like that and the oil is fine for those applications but as soon as you swallow CBD oil into the stomach the absorption rate or the bioavailability really gets called into question and unfortunately CBD oil itself has very very low absorption rates we're talking 1020 percent so if you think you're taking a 20 milligram dose you might actually only be getting 2 milligrams absorbance to your body and so if you're going to be doing CBD coffee drinks or CBD any type of drink it needs to be in some form that is converted for full absorption in the stomach so it needs to be increased bioavailability and a lot of what that looks like is water soluble so at uncanny we specialize in water soluble CBD because it is designed for mixing into drinks effectively and also being effectively absorbed in the stomach so that's all for this video to sum it up real quick for you CBD and caffeine they actually balance each other out so you still get the upbeat energetic effects but you're not going to be anxious and feeling overwhelmed the CBD cuts out on those negative side effects of the caffeine and as far as you as a person that's putting it into your drink just make sure that you're using the right type of CBD so you can absorb the full dose please subscribe to the channel if you enjoy this of course like the video share it with a friend and I will see you beautiful people next time take care", "9Csv9T5bUhM": "[Music] hemp oil hemp seed oil CBD oil there are lots of terms being thrown out there but what exactly

sometimes also be called CBD hemp oil hemp oil can be derived from the stocks flowers and leaves of the hemp plant it contains high level of CBD and should contain nearly no THC meaning you can get all the benefits of CBD without the psychoactive effects of THC on the other hand hemp oil derived from the marijuana plant will most likely contain a dose of THC along with the CBD compounds meaning it will produce some psychoactive effects this THC content might be enough to get you high hemp oil press from a marijuana plant should be clearly labeled as containing THC if you don't see anything on the label make sure you ask before you purchase hemp seed oil is made from yoga stick see it's pressed from a hemp plant since only the seeds are used hemp seed oil contains no CBD and will not get

something super fun one of the things that I love to do when I'm in training camp and I'm sore for recovery is take a nice hot absent so bad just kind of wraps up my entire day so I thought why not wrap it up and instead of just epson salt bath let's do CVD bath bombs so I'm gonna be using my sponsor CBD CBD distillery and they have this product that is a CBD isolate powder and so what CBD is great for is is a plethora of things so many things but when we're including it in our bath bomb it is going to absorb into our skin and it's gonna help make it helps reduce stress it helps reduce anxiety it helps reduce inflammation it helps with your small eggs in the bruising in the joints so a lot of benefits for athletes or even somebody that is just super busy all day on their feet or he didn't you only have to be physically active you can be mentally active because CBD helps with anxiety it helps with depression so it helps with all sorts of stuff so we got the CBD and then you're gonna need some essential oils essential oils also help with determining what kind of mood you want to be in so if you want it to help you know brighten your spirits and invigorate you you can use sense like orange and maybe some flowery scents and rose up if you want things to relax you you can use things like lavender and cedar what if you want things to help invigorate you you can use sense like spearmint and eucalyptus so the sense that I'm using today gonna be eucalyptus because I just love the fresh smell of it lemon because again it is just a fresh smell um and I think it just ties everything together and adds just a bit of summer Flair and then lavender because the majority of the time when I'm doing bath bombs at the very end of my day and I need something to help lined me down so the lavender does exactly that and then we have all these dry ingredients and wet ingredients so I'm just going to get into it and let you know the exact amount of each thing that you need so here we are and we are going to use the CB distillery I split powder and I use about half of this product so I use half of this product and then we have three tablespoons of Epsom salt Epsom salt is also an anti-inflammatory and it helps with your muscle aches and strains and then we have 1/4 cup of citric acid okay and then we're gonna have 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of baking soda not baking powder baking soda okay so that's all the dry ingredients also I have these very pretty shimmery mica powders and it doesn't stain your bathtub but it does add some color to the water and also to the bath bomb which I love because color can also you know affect your mood and so I'm gonna mix this really pretty green color and this pretty blue color cuz my favorite color is turquoise and I think it will be just very calm and relaxing so we have that and then we have our wet ingredients which is just almond oil and that's just super moisturizing and will help create the right consistency that we need for the bath palms and then so with the with the almond boy oh we're going to use one tablespoon and then we're going to use a half tablespoon of water and then with the with the eucalypt with all of these essential oils we're just going to use I like to get to really smell so I do like three drops of each all right so now that you have all the ingredients let's get started you have to start by mixing all the dry ingredients so here we go half a cup of baking soda 1/4 cup of corn starch 1/4 cup of citric acid and three tablespoons of Epsom salt all right and for the magic ingredient Seaview distillery I flit powder and I've already done a batch of these and I so I use the other half so I'm gonna just pour the rest of it into here all right now for the shimmer oh so pretty I just love shimmer so this color right here is the sky blue and I just ordered these off of Amazon and it came with a bunch of different variety colors so I'm not gonna use the whole thing because my I don't want it to over for wordpower the bath bomb so I just use about not even I think I use about a quarter of the powder and you use about a quarter of this powder oh so pretty alright so now we have all of our dry ingredients and we're gonna mix it so we're mixing it up and it's such a pretty color all the other powers make sure you get it nice and mixed up some people like to grind up the epson salt if you're like bigger chunks got some salt just so that it's easier to break down when you're taking a bath but if you're taking a bath in pretty hot water in a milk pretty fast so now I have a very pretty light blue tart turquoisey color and so my dry ingredients are all mixed up I'm just going to set that aside and put together are my wet ingredients so and I have this little baby spoon that you get from coal stoves after you try the samples so we have the it's a tablespoon of almond oil and you can use any type of oil you can use coconut oil you can use castor oil you can use a Coco oil whatever kind of oil you like and then we got a half a tablespoon of water now once you start doing mix it into your dry ingredients and you feel like the consistency isn't right you can always add more oil and water so here we are I have lavender and I'm going to do a two for party foul alright so three to four drops of lavender one two three what what okay and then we're gonna do some lemon mmm one two three it's so crazy how smells for me anyways bring memories back like certain smells remind me of Thailand de Flor whoops certain smells like eucalyptus remind me of eucalyptus always reminds me of weight cutting because I always liked that smell - to keep me focused and keep me invigorated while I'm cutting weight because it cutting weight can sometimes be quite stressful so I liked using eucalyptus to kind of keep my mind fresh and sharp alright let's bring back our wedding or dry ingredients and we're just gonna slowly pour this in - in and mix so you'll see a little bit of the dry ingredients start to bubble up because of the baking soda and that's exactly what's gonna happen when you put it into the bath and so with the bath bombs there's all different kind of sized molds but I would get the biggest mold that you can find because I mean my bathtub was super huge and you want to have enough ingredients for for it to be effective so you just pour and mix see it bubble up a little bit that's okay and you'll start to feel the powder get a little thicker alright here's the last bit of it and then we mix and mix and mix it so again the consistency should be like damp sand and once you have the right consistency you can go ahead and start filling up your mold your mold here is that is that right your mold the your mold yeah so some people they like to put like flowers some people like to put oatmeal um you like to mix it with milk some people like to put big chunks of lotion in the middle you can put us up like if you're making this for your friend or something you can put like a cute little surprise in the middle I don't know get creative all right so I got my consistency and I'm gonna go ahead and feel yeah so so when you pick it up you should be able to smash it and it will stick together so if you can smash it ahead and it sticks together that's the right consistency okay and I'm going to use my big mold in the in the and the molds that I got I got three different kinds so that the big mold is basically four baths and then the medium mold or for pedicures and then the small molds are firm miniatures so you just go ahead and fill it up feel a fill fill fill it up okay so once you feel that we're gonna Pat it down nice and tight hey gosh is such a pretty color okay so I Pat it down nice and tight one side okay and then you're gonna go ahead and do that to the other side fill it up Pat it down fill it up pat it down okay so now that they're both the both sides are filled up what I like to do is I just like to overfill it on both sides and then you smash them together so then when you smash all together you're just gonna turn turn turn turn turn and just keep turning it until you hear them grinding together and you have to give your bath bombs 24 hours to dry okay so if you have like if you want to double this ingredient or something if you have a group of people you want to make this for just you know double the ingredients but be careful when you're taking these out of the mold let her try for 24 hours so here's what the mold looks like and so I let it dry for 24 hours and then when you're done and I actually I like to put mine in the refrigerator just helps helps it dry up so now I'm gonna have some extra left over so I'm gonna put it in my pedicure one and again I'm just gonna I don't know maybe is this do I have enough powder left no let's do the manicure one see some when you take it out it is already pretty hardened so you can definitely take it out of the mold and set it aside to dry for 24 hours but if you're only making a couple I would just leave them in the mold okay so now we're going to the manicure one so this is perfect for like for me because I was wrestling yesterday and I dislocated my ring finger on my left hand and it hurts so bad and I didn't even bother to look down at it I already knew it was out and so I just snapped it back into place and that's probably what would have happened anyways if I waited any longer it probably would have start swelling so I snapped it back into place and it seemed fine but when I got home it started to swell and even today I don't know if you can tell but it's swollen this is my finger it's swollen so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use one of these bath bombs just for my hand and let my hands soak so that it pulls some of that inflammation out and helps reduce the swelling of my finger so anytime you're swollen up anytime like if you heat and cold or are really good so but for for instances like this you need heat so you can circulate get new blood circulating into that I went a bit too long but we're almost finished anyways so I got my bath mold set together and then I just did a little manicure one so that's enough and I have just a little bit left so when you're done putting in the mold and you want to use a mold for more you just get a tap the edges and then carefully take the top off and again carefully turn it over and then it should just pop out and it'll be a perfectly smooth remember guys give it 24 hours to dry and then what I did was I wrapped them up with some tissue paper I put some cute like confetti in there and put a little cute tag on there and I'm gonna give them to some of my teammates as gifts because we all beat each other up on a daily basis so it's only fair that I them something to help with their recovery I hope you guys enjoyed it remember I use CB distillery isolate powder for this CBD bath bomb if you'd like to try it all the ingredients are down below and if there's anything else that you think would be interesting for us to do as a fighter mom slash wife let me know in the comments below I hope you guys have a lovely day and enjoy your CBD bath bombs one

concerns around the use of medical marijuana to manage chronic pain as dr. Dean Drazen is associate medical director for care and treatment centers dr. drowsiness thank you so much for being here today thanks for having me so Ken marijuana be used to treat or to manage chronic pain chronic pain is one of the number of diagnoses that are acceptable for a physician to prescribe or to authorize use of medical marijuana we hear a lot now about CBD as an alternative so is that a viable option CBD in the scientific study seemed to have some good pain relieving properties and that was very exciting initially because CBD in and of itself is not associated with addiction however in real life as we see there's a lot of CBD products on the market I'm not hearing patients getting great pain relief from CBD it also has some all CBD preparations also have at least a trace amount of THC which may be a concern for some patients so what are your other concerns with marijuana being used as a chronic pain treatment well in the context with with in which I treat chronic pain which is patients who have a substance use disorder as well as a chronic pain condition part of our aim is to calm down the part of the brain that's involved in the substance use disorder marijuana use is not going to allow that part of the brain to calm down like we want it to in order for them to get good recovery excellent I see so what solutions might you offer to alleviate the current opioid epidemic in terms of marijuana and using it to manage chronic pain well I think that for people who have an opioid use disorder that using alternative methods of treating their chronic pain acupuncture massage hydro therapy physical therapy yoga meditation all of these are harmless all of these will allow the part of the brain that processes chronic pain to calm down and allow the part of the brain that is involved with addiction to calm down and get to its baseline state medical marijuana really does not have a place in the treatment of chronic pain particularly in a patient with a substance use disorder and that touches on my next question is there any concern about swapping out one addictive substance for another in this treatment yes there's no question that marijuana has its own addiction liability associated with it and certainly for somebody who has a substance use disorder again we want to allow that part of the brain to heal without stimulating it with a different substance and what alternative chronic pain treatments exist that don't involve opioid medications or marijuana well as I mentioned there's many alternative treatments acupuncture massage physical therapy hydrotherapy as I mentioned previously but in combination layering these treatments and individualizing them for one patient that's the way to go and if there's one takeaway you want people watching this to walk away with what is that I think that the most important thing to understand is that most effective relief from chronic pain involves a minimum of drugs and a maximum of alternative therapies excellent doctor drowsiness thank you so much for being here thanks for having me and if you're interested in learning more you can visit Karen org", "asdYl4NQqTs": ">> IT IS A SOFT GEL.

two-part video I'm gonna go through it fast and just make sure you check the pot nose which is our new descriptions that we're calling them in the box below alright let's get started so we're gonna start out with our magical butter machine shout out to add magical butter calm and all my pop peeps who have got theirs make sure you get out your magical butter machine whether you're using the first version or the second version today I have deep heart in my deep car box 7 7 grams of CBD I'm gonna put the notes in the bottom this is Charlotte's Web in Orange POTUS and like I said it is 7 grams I am using 2 cups of coconut oil it is a refined press it was the only thing I had in a house you know how I am I just use what I'm gonna use so make sure you soften or liquefy that before putting it into the magic butter machine I'm also going to be using a raw honey you're gonna see the second part of that video I have soy lecithin and I'm gonna be using I believe a tablespoon of that so the first part of this video is infusing the coconut oil if you pot peeps have never seen the video for coconut oil I did one a while ago but I'm gonna do a new one right now so this first part is the coconut oil so let's get into it let's take out the car CBD and if you are in a legal state and using THC that is fine as well I will leave instructions and the pipe notes below on how to decarbonise you have not seen it and just make sure you go now I'm gonna go ahead and pour in the two cups I'm also gonna put a range in the cotton notes below if you want to make more due to the time the video I only need a little bit of CBD honey because the video and we're gonna go ahead and get that swing left the time going and I believe I'm only using one tablespoon which is 15 MLS remember you use soy lecithin you can use a sunflower less of ten any less the ten is fine you use it because you want to keep the chemicals bond together you do not want them to break down so it keeps it together and then we're going to go ahead we have our coconut oil we have soy lecithin and we have our bud so we're gonna go ahead and put the head of that magical butter machine on then you can go ahead and plug that up alright you hear the beat pop beeps we're gonna go and take that temperature to 160 and we got it at that 160 and we're gonna go ahead and push to two hours for butter all right pop peeps

the oil back in then we're gonna take two cups of honey we're at this point anything you have and I am measuring with a one cup it's extremely small but I need two cups of honey and this is easy to sit down and just squeeze there will be variations to this if you're making more I will put the measurements but this one is if you are doing 7 grams you are to use 2 cups honey after you got your two cups of honey let's go back to the temperature 160 and then we're gonna hit this quick clean the wind because you just want a quick zap to put it all together all right pot peeps after that quick

you're following me on IG Facebook Twitter and all of my social media and this was CBD infused honey [Music] [Music]", "pf7uWK-slHQ": "[Music] hi it's Madame ruffle studios and welcome to cannabase ik's today we're making a cannabis infused pain relief topical this episode of canna basics is brought to you by the roughhouse studios smoke shop save 10% on vaporizers raw rowing papers and accessories and much more with the code canna basics a truffle studios.com let's get started here's what you're gonna need you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol we're putting is about 1215 milliliters you also need some fresh cannabis flowers we're using about 50 grams of fresh harvested flowers you need some fresh to ruffle hours commonly called hells bells about to medium flowers [Music] you also need some rue de also known as common room it's an aromatic herbal plant you need about 15 grams of that and you're also going to need some camphor tablets you need six quarter ounce squares or one and a half blocks camphor tablets are available at pharmacies and also online if you'd like to learn where to get these ingredients and to see the full written recipe please check out our blog site for free on the link in description or here on the screen it'll also be helpful if you have a mortar and pestle and also have large mason jar with a lid now the first step is going to be to manicure and to chop your fresh cannabis I like to destem the buds and use the fresh soft flower portion of the buds and the smaller leaves some pain relief strains that would be excellent for this is Charlotte's Web and Harlequin among many others [Music] using a chef's knife to chop the cannabis makes it very easy to chop the marijuana into very small bits you want to stop short of chopping the cannabis into a pace so it's still easy to collect it from the cutting board and once you have a choppa scoop it all up and put it into the large sealable jar I find that a 64-ounce wide mouth mason jar is perfect for the amount of cannabis that we're using in this recipe today next we would do the same thing that we did with the cannabis to the Rue de plana rue de otherwise known as common rule or herb of grace is an ornamental plant and herb which is recommended by the person who provided this classic home remedy recipe it's used as an arthritis pain reliever much like the cannabis remove the large stems if you want and then chop the root of fine once you have it chopped we're going to put it into the jar with the rest of the canvas next up we need to mash our doctoral or hels belles flour into a paste but first gently press out any of the water that may be collecting with a paper towel a datura is a poisonous plant so do not ingest this or get it into your eyes however the FDA has recognized the medicinal uses of the torah' recently because of the presence of certain chemical compounds now find it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for arthritis pain general aches and pains and in muscles and joints and other general topical useless and to answer this inevitable question in advance

"alright time for your questions honest answers Carol writes in hi Pat I'm having difficulty with the issue of marijuana and CBD oil my daughter and I have gotten into disagreements over the issue I've always known marijuana to be a bad illegal immoral thing yet with the illegal legalization of it in more and more States it's harder and harder to argue against it I know little about its non high version CBD but because I related to marijuana I think it's bad is it a compromise as a Christian to accept CBD as alternative medicine I must confess I'm not an expert on any of it because I've never used marijuana and these people are clean mine I smoked it but I didn't inhale that's baloney marijuana really does bad things to you it has strong effect on your lungs and other parts of your body I know it's being legalized and people say well smoking pot is good for you I think and what I understand if they purify this CBD oil it doesn't really have any marijuana effects in it and it could be good for things and I know marijuana is being used to treat certain extreme cases of cancer etc so I can't give you the medical diagnosis of it but I do think if it's pure that CBD oil doesn't have any marijuana in it so it's it's it's beneficial I think all right thank you for watching make sure you download our CBN app from the description below have an amazing day", "N53s-b_TX34": "in today's episode of how to not get high with cannabis we're exposed CBD to THC ratios in video 1 we talked about hemp CBD products and in video 3 we taught you how to find your minimum effective dose of THC but if we're really trying to use cannabis as medicine then we want to be using both CBD and THC together and I'm video about hemp CBD products we mentioned that ideally you want to be looking for those full spectrum or whole plant extracts that had at least trace amounts of THC as they've been shown to be more effective than CBD isolates and this is because of a concept in cannabis called the entourage effect the entourage effect theorized is that all of the compounds in cannabis cannabinoids terpenes flavonoids and more all work best when used together enhancing one another's effects to maximize therapeutic benefits when it comes to using cannabis as medicine choosing a CBD to THC ratio will have a big impact on the level of intoxication or high that you'll experience if you recall from our hemp CBD video THC is a cannabinoid that binds to endocannabinoid system receptors primarily found in our brain and our central nervous system which is why it can create intoxicating experiences while CBD is a cannabinoid that slows the breakdown of our bodies on it naturally produced endocannabinoids so that we can use more of them but when THD is consumed with CBD CBD is actually able to buy our receptors as well and it changes their shape weakening team C's ability to bind to those receptors and ultimately impacting how how you feel when used together DVD can reduce the negative side effects of THC such as paranoia anxiety elevated heart rate memory loss and sluggishness while THC can enhance the therapeutic benefit of CBD this is really important information for patients who need the therapeutic properties that THC has to offer but don't want to feel high and if you are someone who enjoys using THC recreationally keep this in mind if you ever do get uncomfortably high CBD can help reduce those effects for you so what's this look like in practice well if you walk into a dispensary you'll probably see products labeled a sativa indica and hybrid but this doesn't tell you anything about the CBD to THC ratio you'll likely need to ask your bud tender about which products offer the CBD to THC ratio that you're interested in this is known as a cannabinoid profile and all cannabis products fall into three general categories CBD dominant balanced and THC dominant generally speaking if you're not looking to get high then you should be looking for a CBD dominant or balanced cannabis product although it's important to note that cannabis affects everyone differently and depending on your condition and dosing a THC dominant product may be an effective medicine for you without producing a high if you want more information on that look at video three on how to find your minimum effective dose of THC you can typically find CBD to THC ratios such as one two one two one one two two or even ten to one or twenty to one when shopping be aware that DVD dominant products are still relatively new most cannabis strains have been bred to be THC dominant but as new research is emerging on the benefits of more balanced and CBD dominant strains this is changing so be sure to ask your bud tender to direct you to the CBD dominant products offered in your dispensary now if you have no experience with THC and are particularly concerned about getting high then starting with the highest ratio of CBD the THC available is definitely the way to go many medical patients have reported that using a twenty to one ratio of CBD to THC has been helpful for their symptoms without leaving them feeling high at all but even with this ratio you're still going to want to start low and go slow paying attention to how many milligrams of THC is in the dose that you're consuming for more tips on how to get started dosing with THC check out video 3 from this series on how to find your minimum effective dose if this ratio doesn't work for you you can start increasing your ratio of THC again starting low and going slow this may feel tedious and perhaps even expensive as you explore new products but just keep in mind that as long as you're careful with your math you can always combine products to find your own perfect CBD the THC ratio on the flipside if you are already experienced with THC and you're looking for a product that will help give you the relief that you're seeking while still remaining alert and productive during the day then you may want to start with a little bit higher THC ratio perhaps two to one or even one to one parts CBD to THC know that your perfect ratio may change based on the symptoms that you're dealing with for example I found that a one to one ratio of CBD to THC does wonders for my migraines while still allowing me to work but if I'm struggling with back pain a two-to-one ratio a CVD the THC allows me to keep a clear head either way always be sure to track your dose and the effects that you feel this is really important for either recreating or avoiding experiences in the future for

I'll see you next time", "uhqe6XRPRDM": "hi guys welcome to a produce TV within a video today in partnership with CBD star are we making CBD brownies so to make the CBD brownies we're gonna be using a little something called a TVB so this is already saved but says can be in the form of normal weed or you've got your CBD which is this guy here and we've got you can be here so we're gonna add this at the end of the recipe to get the best effects so first of all you give a grind up your CBD and then you're gonna use it in a herbal vaporizer such as tax-free fine things are the best because you can fit a lot of CBD in there and once that's all thanked essentially just empty your bowl until you get a good amount like that and then so when a lot of people use their CBD in their urban vaporizers they tend to throw away what's left but you can still use this so good think about it you can actually eat it as it is so after you faint it you can eat this if you want it's not going to taste the best so we get an experiment and mix in some brownies so you will need 185 grams of unsalted butter 185 grams of dark chocolate or milk chocolate or any fancy dark chocolate it tastes better yes better of the two 85 grams of plain flour 40 grams of cocoa powder three large eggs and 275 grams of caster sugar and as much anything bitter times will allow you to take so first off we're going to mount our and chocolate and go from there so 185 grams of chocolate and 185 grams of butter yep okay so we're going to put the chocolate in the microwave have for about a minute but keep thinking out about every 10 seconds just to check how it's doing it might take a bit longer than that depending on the microwave just keep on a low setting yeah don't want to burn the truck there okay so once you've melted the chocolate we are weighing out the butter and hundred eggs five grams of butter as well and that goes into another Bowl to know so now we've got the melted butter and then onto chocolate we're going to preheat the oven to 180 degrees 160 from a fan oven so now we're going to mix the chocolate and melted butter together and then ena for a number of a mini or two and then leave that to cool until it's at room temperature one of the things we might receive anything oh we could do cupcakes cookies waffles pancakes you could even make your own chocolate bar essentially anything that involves butter so you can do full course meal and do some lamb shanks some mashed potato well see very much potato nice so now we're gonna line the bowl so it's just so the browning doesn't stick to the bottom anyway so now you're square or rectangle a little bit this we can use to actually butter up there [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're going to do the dry ingredients so you got your flour and cocoa powder your so and you're sure that I often beaten the roads how long does that take specifically to work well it depends on the potency so it all comes down to how much you're gonna put on top but usually the time is in rhythm so half an hour up to two hours so I feel after half an hour to us so it's the same as when you're fading the CBD or when you've got under the drug towns so it will know you out you've been it's relaxed nice got light so if we need 85 grams of flour so now we're just gonna stick this into the bowl get rid of any lumps that are in here so who's even going to help law benefits other so why do you seek deem a leave sort of back pain and a lot of people use it for going to sleep at night so more or less for people veterans or crank pain always having trouble to sleep at night it's gonna help with that now we do need the cocoa powder about 50 grams if you're a poor dane use this evening sorry most of the dry ingredients done now that's what you say as well okay so now we've just broken up some chocolate we're just gonna add some in there for a bit of different texture because it's delicious but obviously you can add anything you want to it's completely optional what you added at this point yeah let's just check those in there yep so next we break in free eggs I'm not as I can't break eggs yeah we need 275 grams of caster sugar that is to go in with the eggs cool yeah it'll weigh down so it's going to make 5 grams of sugar yeah all right now we're going to mix all the egg and sugar together with a whisk for about six to eight minutes yes and you want to whisk it until it's quite pale color joke just show this yes prepay or something yeah that should be good to go cool so what's next so now we're gonna mix in the melted butter and chocolate into the Moosey mixture so we're gonna fold it in to try and keep as much air in there as we can [Music] you don't want to stir it's gonna get rid of the air right joke yeah that's why you're gonna fold it in this way that's it so obviously today we're going to eat TBD but yeah there's lies on the ways you can have CVD what are all the other ways so you've got the flat form which is in that jar there yeah and then you've also got oils so you've got the under the tongue drops you've got the both liquids and you've also got might faint sprays you've got CBD drinks there's out there now possibilities of illness yeah so you always see you see really quite a lot would you say eating's one of the best ways or what would you say is probably the best way of taking CVD I would say that the fake liquids are the best ways to take care cure Lee because as soon as you found that about a minute later is into your system and it's already working you know instead of in Internet yeah and then seconds probably the CBD flour so it's sound principle it gets into your system a lot quicker and then third I would go under the tongue drops and take about half an hour to kick in and with the edibles such as the brownies this can take a piss or two backwards so some people might want a baby or smoke or put it under their tongue Satan's probably a better solution because most people at brownies yeah a lot of people like brownies in some people but you can make any food with singing gays so it doesn't essentially have to be practice yeah so now we're going to add in the chocolate lumps and then we're gonna sit in the rest of this mixture into they're almost done so now the tracks are in there all we have to do is sit in this mix and [Music] so we've finished folding it all in and it's looking pretty much like brownie mixture very Brown nice and gooey yes none of the flowery dustiness to left or anything at all yeah so now we're gonna pour it in and start the cooking process [Music] [Music] so some flat or even as even as we can get anyway now it's just time to cook so you want the thickness of the brownie to be pretty even or over just so you don't have some parts of really cooked in some parts that are all yeah one ends really thick in the others roof in you're gonna have a burnt side and then slightly raw sighs that's not not amazing no it's a we even it's looking good what we have to do now is pop it in the oven for about 25 minutes cuz should be done so it's 25 minutes in the oven yeah if you want to put it in the middle of the oven dry heat so we've set the timer for 25 minutes obviously it's not 25 on there now so we've said it a few seconds ago but once that's done we're gonna double check to see if it's good say if it's wobbling when we move the Train then it has to go in for a little bit longer okay so the Bradley is all done all we have to do now is let cool down and melt the last bit of chocolate for a little layer on top and then we're just gonna sprinkle the avb on top of that is now for the finishing touches we're gonna add the ADB into the melted chocolate pour it on top even out and be done once they're cold why is it worth putting in the chocolate and neither are mixes so you can do it either way but where this has or have been heated up in the PACs device it's already gone through the process of decarboxylate so you're gonna get the effects I mean you can it straight away it just skips having to cook it in butter for about three hours okay so if you didn't want to vape it first yet to get the ABV you would just cook in butter first yeah so what you usually do is in like a slow cooker mix it with some butter leave it for about three hours 10 and staring at about every half an hour okay it's just quicker way to do it so you don't have to bake it first you can just cook in the best yeah [Applause] [Music] so similarly as we did one for the actual brownie mix in there 10 we're now just spreading evenly over the seemingly melted chocolate so we've spreaded on the melted chocolate mix with the avb so we can give it about an hour to cool and then it could to eat oh thank you very much for watching Olivia vape induced e-m-f CVD star share this on to your friends who want to make CBD brownies happy baking [Music] [Music]", "AqGwJd5p3yg": "we've got a fun one today I sent restorative botanicals to a lab to see if it's real this is one of Amazon's top-selling CBD products which is funny because Amazon specifically says that they don't sell CBD so is the CBD real or sorry is this hemp oil really CBD let's see the lab tests by the way I bought this one for 20 bucks and I've gotten no affiliation with this CBD company or any CBD company these are the results of an independent lab that I paid directly if the CBD company pays for the lab tests it's not independent shocking I know you might want to let the rest of the internet know about that okay 20 bucks they claimed 400 milligrams of unspecified remember Amazon doesn't sell CBD so they're not gonna list what this is so 400 milligrams and they had a cord indoor lab 433 milligrams of total can monoids or 8.5 percent more cannabinoids men claimed they're even more accurate if you base this on CBD because they had 411 ish milligrams of CBD and it's a high quality full-spectrum extract meaning all these other cannabinoids 13 milligrams of THC not enough to get high by any means but to provide some extra effects and some CBC and CBG I've got to say I was shocked by these results the whole package in a good way kind of confusing way I suppose best CBD on the platform that doesn't sell CBD you can see the labs are here as always the links below for this whole review look at this it's below 5 cents per milligram of CBD and it's also below 5 cents for all of the cannabinoids it's extremely cheap I bought this for 20 bucks on Amazon to get below 5 cents per milligram of CBD for 20 bucks is crazy the average is like 15 cents some go over 30 cents and you're often spending over a hundred dollars to get those price points the more you spend the better deal you usually get not in this case it's cheap let me first say that I don't like that this company or any company sells CBT on Amazon you hear that restorative botanicals you're this close from a timeout Amazon has a specific policy that does not allow for the sale of CBD and I feel this misleads people so they get around this by saying that their hemp oil and full-spectrum to suggest they have CBD they also make some medical claims which is not allowed for CBD companies to say but they don't say they're a CBD company which is a long debate that we don't have time for here here's the craziest part restorative botanicals is US hemp Authority certified it's considered the best cert you can get right now for showing that you're a legitimate company that produces high-quality CBD come on US hemp Authority this company hasn't even transparent about what's in their product how can you give this award to them I also did an extensive review on restorative botanicals and found no negative reports so that's my review and I just realized I'm a little biased because my whole website is about transparency it's all about accurate CV labeling and well this company would fail miserably in that aspect but I can't really knock them they're playing the game they've got an extremely accurate product if you take their hint that they are in fact CBD and the cost is ridiculously low thank you for spending a few minutes with me here today if you want to see more of these independent lab tests and reviews please do me a solvent and lightly tap that subscribe button in like button I'll see you soon", "7nnK6hRdjXo": "WELCOME BACK

about something very very very interesting CVD but before we do I want you to subscribe to this channel first and also follow me on instagram ari why underscore mmm DL my Instagram page got hacked and I'm trying to build my following again so make sure you do that and now let's get right into the video so before we start talking about the CBD part I just want you to give you a background story of how like everything happened or how everything started so for about nine ten years now I've been like depending on coffee like crazy it got to the point where I was drinking coffee like way more than I was drinking water it was the only thing that I would drink that would allow me pretty much to get out of bed every single day every single morning and for me to focus on what I had to do it got to the point where I was drinking it so much that I'd know sort of like effect on me whatsoever so I would like still drink it but still feel sleepy and I was very anxious like all the time I was agitated super super impatient I didn't have no sort of like appetite whatsoever I was losing mad weight it got to the point where I got so so so skinny reduce my anxiety problems I started you know looking for things that I could take in order for me to be more relaxed and feel like a normal person all over again and there is wheat you know like people smoked but I honestly cannot stand the smell we'd and so that's when I discovered CBE I've tried other brands but the one that I'm gonna talk about right now is took it to a whole nother level lasting like a huge difference in my skin and then my mood and everything pretty much so now talking about CBD if you don't know what CBD or haven't heard about CBD I don't know like where have you been living it's been training everywhere for the past few years I think and if you don't know where CBD is CBD is a component of the cannabis plant however it has no THC whatsoever in it it has pretty much all the benefits of medical marijuana without the intoxicating effect and it helps a lot with insomnia pain and also anxiety which the brand that I'm actually gonna talk about is sugar and cush and the reason why I feel like I've been using this one is because everything is so yummy and they have like different alternatives so they have the cookies and the cookies has its gluten free dairy free 100% vegan it's all-natural you also have like the gummy bears and the gummy bears are honestly like one of my face like they taste they taste so good and in one bottle you have 30 gummies and you have also the CBD oils so the ones that I've got or cotton candy cotton candy and vanilla they taste so good so what I like about these is the fact that you have like different alternatives so so the way I do it every single day I would take one in the morning and one at night and I like the fact that they different alternatives so I can take one gummy in the morning and then take the CBD oil at night or even one cookie depending on how I feel and I would definitely recommend you to take one before like starting a stressful activity and usually whenever I take these I will start filling it after like let's say 25 to 30 minutes whenever I take it I feel like such a huge sense of like calmness and I focused so much better on my stuff it's like I'm easygoing and for some reason whenever I take the CBD or I feel like it acts faster so let me show you so this is the vanilla and candy my favorite one is that peanut head but the cotton candy you have 500 milligram CBD all in this bottle right here so the way I'll take it I was literally drop it on my tongue and then let it sit for like 10 seconds and then swallow with so let me show you you can actually add the CBD oil like in your food in your drinks depending on what you prefer I would say but I like to put it on my tongue and just I like to taste the oil I feel like and the gummy bears as well then I already ate one this morning but I'm just gonna eat it actually just for you guys down so you have like colorful gummy bears each one of them taste different it's chewy and doesn't it doesn't stick to your teeth at all you have the cookies I haven't tried the cookies yet let me try it so this is one of their cookies right here so you have 8 cookies in one pad and it's amazing oh my god well what I like the most about on sugar and push yourself but whenever you go on their website they have like a specific tab not like literally a whole list a whole report of each and every ingredient added into these products I would definitely recommend you taking CVD if you have problem with insomnia pain or anxiety especially on sugar and cush is definitely my go-to I'm the chip using it now and I'm probably gonna keep using it I mean they have different flavors I know that for the CBD or I only shows you the vanilla and cotton candy but they have so many other flavors that you can actually go on the website and check it out hey I just want you to know guys that all my reviews are honest I don't care how much I'm getting paid I would never lie just for me to get paid and when the products is pretty much cheap I just feel like it's supported for everybody to feel good in their own body so this has helped me and I hope that this video will help like some people out there I hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure you follow me on instagram rdy I'm

It has\na growing number of scientific articles that have been published on its\npotential health benefits as well as a growing number of anecdotal reports from\nboth clients and doctors alike on its potential health benefits for pain, for\nmood, for sleep and today I'm with someone that has some experience with\nCBD oil. I'm Dr. Ryan Shelton and I'm really honored today to be with Angela\nDavis. Angela is a registered nurse and she is also a representative for a\ncompany that manufactures and sells CBD oil. So Angela thank you so much for your\ntime today.  I'm treasured to be with you, just a few quick questions for the audience, again I value your time and I value their time as well, do you\nhave any personal use with CBD oil. Yes for sure.\nI started maybe about a month ago started using it myself\nthere's multitude of different options you have out there for trying it but I\nhave been able to find some good relief with anxiety and to help with regulating\na sleep pattern for my life. I feel pretty good with what I've been using so\nfar there's a lot more interest in a lot of different types out there that I want\nto investigate using between THC and THC free type of products so yeah I'm really\ngood with it so far. And the forms that you use are they\noral drops are they topical creams? They are two different forms so far the\ncompany I found and I've invested time in and interested in is has two\ndifferent forms right now and one is it tincture that dissolves underneath\nyour tongue, okay and one is a topical cream. Okay now I\nknow from my own research that there are quite a few companies that market CBD\noil online in the marketplace so it's important to me to always choose a\ncompany that works with high integrity that works with products with\nguaranteeing potency guaranteeing purity. How did you come about to choose the\ncompany that you work with? Great question, I actually went to, I was\ninvited by friends to go, to just to talk about CBD and I kept hearing about it\nover and over again there from my parents or my patients each each morning\nwhen I was at work I kept hearing the patients were using it and the success\nthey had find with it my parents suffer from some chronic arthritic type issues\nand pain issues that I would really wanted to be more knowledgeable about\nwhat CBD is because people kept asking me my opinion on it so I said well I'll\njust go and listen to it just so I can learn what CBD is but the more time I\nspent with this talk I was very much intrigued by the company's grass roots\nmom-and-pop type style business that was literally selecting the exact seed that\nthey're using all the way to the seal that they closed it with it is an all\norganic company they manage every aspect of the growing process to the selling\nprocess and I found that really intriguing that they took out any\nmiddleman and you know it's U.S. grown, it's straight from North Carolina you\nknow where it's coming from and that was very intriguing to me\nbecause there is so many different products out there that you would have\nno idea where it's coming from or what you're getting right a big deal for me\nwith it too is that each of our products have a quality code that everyone can\nlook up and scan and see exactly what you're getting in your model or your\nyour topical cream so it's very important to me to know where it's\ncoming from what's in it in the purity of it so you use it yourself and you\nhave recommended it there's are there reports that you're\nhearing back from others maybe have not seen yourself but others may be\nreporting some benefits that you personally have not seen yeah for sure I\nmy family member one of my family members that's using it has had a\nsignificant decrease in the need for other medications to help her sleep she\npretty severe sleeping issues meeting multitude up to four different\nmedications to help her get a full night sleep never still actually getting into\nit or REM type sleep and feeling rested in the morning and she started with this\ncompany she thought about trying it before to this hesitant not sure what\nshe was getting into so she also actually join me at the meeting and\nlearned about it and purchased the products that night she also is very\ninterested or intrigued with this company and how they're doing things and\nshe is down to one to two of those medications and the CBD oil to help her\nsleep now so when these were all over-the-counter things you know we\nnever would suggest her to get off of a prescription medication unless she's\ntalking with their doctor about it but she was able to get herself down from\nthe over-the-counter stuff by using CBD and it's feeling much more arrested than\ngetting full REM sleep and getting back into dreaming\nmuch more well rested Wow that's fascinating yeah it's pretty amazing\nMike my father as well has also found some great help with sleeping he has\nsuffered over the years from some PTSD and things like that that had a really\nhard time with his sleep patterns he too is using a multitude of things to\nhelp him get some solid rest throughout the night he would always tell a story\nof how he would wake up at a particular set of time throughout every night for\nyears which is kind of an amazing story wake up at the same time each hour\ndirectly throughout the night but that's been going on for as long as I can\nremember the most recent time I checked in with him on how he was doing with the\nCBD oil he says I don't make up with those times anymore so it's it's been a\npretty significant relief for him as well.\nWow so positive benefits do you have any\nconcerns about its use the research I've done shows it to be safe with little\nreport of adverse effects is that what you're seeing reported that to you as\nwell yes I mean my just coming from the medical field and being a nurse I you\nknow I always been doing research on and I'm reading a lot about it\nthe more I read about CBD and the benefits it has for such a wide\nmultitude of problems the more I'm impressed with it but I worry that\nthere aren't enough clinical trials out there that there have the solid\nbackground research on what it's doing with actual human patients you know\nthere's plenty of research out there on this beautiful plant and what it\nactually could do for your body we know what it does and how it helps them\nattend get yourself back to homeostasis but the clinical trials just aren't\nthere and published and that's the piece that always worries me a little bit I\nwant some some proof in the pudding I want to see it on paper but no I have\nnot had any personal negative you know feedback from it so far I think\nsomething that people always are a little bit concerned about a question\nits functionality is you know why didn't it work instantly for me whereas some\npeople do feel that they have some pretty immediate relief from it\nespecially the topical creams with the menthol and things in it for aching\nmuscles and sure joints and things but everyone is completely different with\nCBD oil and how it's going to affect them and how long it's going to take\nit's kind of a based on how does it make you feel like do you need a little bit\nstronger milligram dose do you need to take it twice a day instead of once a\nday so in every one you know some people don't get into a full effect until a\nmonth of having used it consistently so I think that's probably a challenge for\nmost people is how do I figure out exactly how much I need and how long is\nit going to take until it fully affects what I need it to affect mmm in the\nbeginning of the video I described it as a hot and trending topic are you are you\nseeing more and more people be interested in CBD oil\nyes for sure it was when I first started kind of jumping in it researching more\nabout it I was it was this huge explosion of people asking about it over\na really short period of time like I had nurses talking to me about it I have\nfour or five patients that week talking to me about it one of the ones it really\nsticks out of my mind I was just amazed by I was reading over her medications\nthat she takes reviewing it with her and it was on there and I just asked her\nlike you know how are you doing like this evening I'm curious about it I've\nbeen hearing so much and she was a chronic pain patient she was a\nrecovering addict she had been the poster child for addiction she had\nchronic pain she started with pain pills needed to go to the stronger ones to the\nstronger ones and she done into stronger medications because a narcotics didn't\nwork any longer but she luckily now in is a survivor and she said works an\naddict Recovery Center with other addicts which is amazing but she said\nshe still had her pain even though she got through the addiction until she\nfound CBD oil and she says it to her it saved her life she said she even her\npain is significantly less and that she knows she will never have to relapse and\ngo back to some type of pain medication that she finally son found something\nnatural that could take care of her pain yeah that's me\nit is her all right Angela I thank you so much for your time today I value the\nfact that you spent some time and opened your schedule so that we could inform\ndamaged you can inform me about your experience with CBD oil so thank you so\nmuch available my name is Dr.

its derivatives suggests that it may be useful more useful than once thought in this video we'll cover one particular derivative known as CBD I'll introduce CBD and the ways in which you may interact with the body I'll then further outline the potential health benefits of CBD oil including hair growth let's jump in so first guys let's have a quick introduction into CBD now can a video more commonly referred to as CBD is an extract from the cannabis plant CBD is the second most prevalent compound found in cannabis with up to 40 percent of the plants extract with the first being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol which is known as THC now what is the difference between CBD and THC to understand CBD is important that you first understand what it's not cannabis more commonly referred to as marijuana or weed is a plant that's often harvested for its psychoactive effects the compound found in cannabis which contributes to this effect isn't CBD though it's actually THC THC is the compound which induces the high that uses of marijuana receive if CBD doesn't have any psychoactive effects though why is it so often used well the answer is simple CBD has many of its own benefits which are independent of THC or other compounds found in cannabis what about CBD and how it interacts with the human body well believe it or not the human body is actually adapted to the use of cannabinoids like CBD let me explain found throughout the body a cannabinoid receptors which a part of the endocannabinoid system these can be classified by cb1 receptors mostly found in the brain and cb2 receptors found mostly within the immune system these helped to stimulate and regulate a number of physiological processes including appetite mood pain and memory as you'd imagine the cannabinoid receptors aware plant cannabinoids like CBD doc but cannabinoids produced by the human body and synthetic cannabinoids can also interact with these receptors once these receptors have been activated they are then able to influence various intracellular effects a neuronal excitability so what are some of the health benefits of CBD oil well before we discuss the effects that CBD oil may have on hair growth let's consider it's more general benefits first is it reduces pain and inflammation since circa 2900 BC marijuana has been used to treat a number of medical conditions these include muscle spasms joint pain and other such conditions which trigger pain and while scientists are still unsure of its exact mechanisms there were a few studies which highlight CBDs use in the treatment of pain SATA vex is an oval spray which contains a combination of THC and CBD the drug is a purely approved for use in many countries and is often used as pain reliever for those with chronic medical conditions one study on the topic published in 2015 offers a bit more insight into the drugs uses and mechanisms the study consisted of 30 patients all of which had been diagnosed previously with multiple sclerosis or MS the goal of the study was to determine whether the drug could relax the muscles and as a result improve spasticity and reduce pain the patients were given an extensive clinical and neuro physiological examination before and after the trial the parameters which researchers used to gauge results included motor threshold motor evoked potential amplitude into cortical excitability sensory motor integration and H Mac stroke m-m-max ratio as the researchers noted the results of the study showed an increase of intra cortical inhibition a significant reduction of spinal excitability and an improvement in spasticity and associated symptoms as such they concluded that SATA vex may be an effective drug for producing symptoms of MS how well the researchers speculate that the drug works along into cortical pathways this suggests that THC and or CBD can relieve a number of neurological symptoms including pain the next thing is that the alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression if you suffer from anxiety or depression you know too well for the conditions abilities to SAP you of oil energy joy and overall mental well-being there are many drugs on the market which target various pathways in order to treat these conditions the most common drug classes include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs but did you know that CBD may also be an effective intensity and the antidepressant were there were many triggers for individuals who suffer from generalized social anxiety disorder also known as si D but one of the most common triggers is public speaking with this in mind researchers from Brazil recruited 36 individuals to test the effects of CBD on si D the study consisted of 24 patients who had never received treatment for their anxiety disorder and 12 healthy control individuals the subjects were then required to participate in a simulation public speaking test or spst to determine whether CBD had any effects on those of SA D the SI d group was split into two groups the first group received a 600 milligram dose of CBD while the second group received a placebo dose these were administers one and a half hours before the test and both the participants and the researchers were blinded to the treatment the group which consisted of 12 healthy individuals didn't receive anything as the results of the study showed pretreatment with CBD significantly reduced anxiety cognitive impairment and discomfort in their speech performance and significantly decreased alert in their anticipated speech these results are especially significant when you consider how the placebo patients performed is they displayed higher anxiety cognitive impairment discomfort and alert levels the results of this study are certainly interesting but is there more pieces to back these claims or one study published in 2016 showed the effectiveness of CBD oil in the treatment of insomnia in children with post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD but just as with the previous study there were still many questions left unanswered the most pressing question is whether dependency on CBD is a possibility as of now there is no evidence to suggest that CBD dependence or abuse is a problem that's not to say that the possibility has been ruled out entirely however so CBD is a pretty interesting medication it's quite popular at the moment but now we're gonna go into how it could be used for hay growth well it's currently no evidence that CBD can directly stimulate hair growth or tree pattern baldness that doesn't mean that it doesn't have his hair benefits though let's take a look at what we do know about CBD based on current research the first thing is that it may treat psoriasis psoriasis is a skin condition that consists of flaking inflammation and thick patches of skin this condition can develop on any part of the body though areas with high sebum content such as the scalp are often a target there were an array of treatment methods including photodynamic light therapy steroids and immunosuppressive drugs but as you can imagine these can come with their own risks and potential side effects the good news a literature review published in 2016 indicates that CBD maybe a future treatment option for psoriasis patients it's well known that psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that may trigger an interaction within the nervous system the endocannabinoid system is one such system within the nervous system this means that is possible for CBD to play a role in mitigation of symptoms there is still much research to be done of course it also may stabilize sebum levels now we've already discussed about the benefits of CBD oil for treating inflammation inflammation plays a significant role in hair loss and whether it's the underlying cause or just a side effect of another condition we know for sure that inflammation must be controlled in order to stop hair loss and even be grow hair but another factor that's often overlooked in hair loss is sebum sebum is the natural oil produced from the sebaceous glands which are founded inside the hair follicle a healthy scalp can regulate sebum production so as to ensure a well-balanced environment medical conditions including male pattern baldness may trigger an inbounds however so how does CBD fit in according to a 2014 research study CBD exerts SIBO static effects on human see besides the research was performed in vitro which means it was performed in test tubes to culture dishes etc in a laboratory setting the researchers use cultured human see besides which highly specialized sebum producing epithelial cells as well as human skin organ cultures to determine the effect of CBD on sebum production as the tests showed the administration of CBD sasebo sites and human skin organ culture inhibits lipid genic actions of various compounds these included arachidonic acid linoleic acid and testosterone but how exactly does this work well it appears that CBD activates certain ion channels namely transient receptor potential of vanillite 4 or T or P v4 which then suppresses sebum proliferation and expression but why is this good for hair growth there are quite a few dermatological conditions that are triggered by the presence of excess sebum dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis are perhaps the most common the build-up of sea burden can cause irritation inflammation and itching over time this may dislodge otherwise healthy hairs from the scalp or even the follicles and prevent hair growth if CBD oil can suppress excess sebum production as at the previously mentioned study claims this may be a significant breakthrough for sufferers of many dermatological conditions and finally it provides nutritional benefit in some cases nutrient deficiencies can cause hair thinning and loss this is particularly true when it comes to vital hair nutrients such as iron Neeson and biotin hair loss can also trigger a nutrient deficiency within the follicles as the follicles become inflamed and are unable to receive oxygen and nutrients they were acquired from the blood vessels CBD is full of nutrients such as omega-3 omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids as well as gamma linoleic acid or GLA these ingredients may help to promote hair growth but they can also protect existing hair strands fatty acids are beneficial in two main ways foremost they provide moisture to the scalp and hair they also protect the cuticle against outside damage too so as to reduce breakage and split ends and we can go even further and say that the amino acids within CBD lend themselves to the structure of the hair on the hair is composed almost entirely of the protein keratin and there's amino acids are the building blocks of protein CBD oils contents can ensure the protein is strengthened okay great so CBD is looking like quite an interesting thing to add into a hair care routine what about legality issues there's much debate worldwide about the legalization of the cannabis plant in its derivatives including marijuana and CBD oil let's take a look at the United States for example well thanks to the 2018 farm bill which was signed into law in December 2018 CBD oils obtained from hemp plants are legal at the federal level but CBD oil which are obtained from marijuana are only legal in some states you may notice that the qualifier this bordered above what exactly does this mean marijuana and hemp both terms which often used to describe the derivatives of the cannabis plant the difference however lies in the THC content marijuana by definition is any kind of his plant very high variety that contains greater than 0.3 percent THC by dry weight these plant varieties are known to produce the height that's associated with weed hemp on the other hand is any kind of is plant varieties that contains less than 0.3 percent THC by driveway and this means that it's a non intoxicating variety hemp derive CBD oil are more widely legalized throughout the world so how could you use CBD for your hair well there were two ways to utilize CBD topically and by ingestion to apply it topically you would massage CBD oil into a hair and scalp to receive the direct benefits of the oil there are many brands of CBD oil shampoos and conditioners on the market these products may take the deliverability of CBD easier and they can also make it easier to add CBD to a routine a shampooing and conditioning are likely regular parts of your routine already the next thing you can do is you could take it over lay the vast majority of CBD oils are produced as an older supplement so as long as the brand you've chosen indicates that it can be taken orally you may want to consider that option this method can likely provide with the greatest benefits in regards nutrient absorption what should you look for in CBD oil well if you're on the market for CBD oil then you'll need to pay special attention to the quality of the products you buy what exactly should you be looking for well the first place to start with is full-spectrum CBD the oils derived from hemp plants are often classified as I have the full spectrum CBD or CBD isolate full-spectrum CBD contains many more beneficial components including proteins fatty acids and flavonoids the same cannot be said for CBD isolate which is likely good to contain just CBD and perhaps a few traces components listed above unfortunately there is very little regulation of CBD all around the world in the USA for example CBD oil is not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration this means that the manufacturer is responsible for quality and accurate reporting so if the FDA doesn't back the claim to these companies how can you know that their labeling is accurate the only way is to choose a reputable company the putable companies will often provide the results of third-party researchers this offers an additional assurance to consumers now the evidence on CBD oil for hair growth is slim in fact no trials which directly studies the use of CBD for her health have been performed that doesn't mean that we can't draw conclusions from other studies on the cannabis derivative though we know that CBD may control sebum levels and this is important for a healthy scalp environment we also know that CBD oil contains many nutrients which can provide the hair with the Bluefish that they need so guys that's what one of Chevys day on CBD oil now if you're worried about your hair loss don't forget to click the link in

medicine and how it can be helpful especially from an inflammatory point of view trying to enhance health is about I think one of the big questions when it comes to not just the benefits that we discussed earlier on is do I need a prescription in order to use CBD products yeah so that's a great question and I think people usually think so but because CBD is a health supplement no catch you don't and you can you can purchase it from your local pharmacy or health store and and because our daily oils and daily capsules are not decoded they can also claim that by their medical aid to the medical insurance cover cover health supplements yeah that's wonderful news so where do CBD products come from where the CBD come from let's kind of break that down for people yeah so so the CBD comes from from the cannabis plant okay but there's there's different varieties you get the the cannabis plant which is the marijuana variety which is the higher THC which makes us higher not from that variety from another variety or support of the cannabis sativa the hemp plant and we get our our CBD from from from Switzerland it is organically grown Switzerland it's screened for 300 different pesticides it's okay a lot of people might also be wondering so if I'm a sportsman or want to be a professional sportsman how does it then interact with my body and how does that stand with the rules of the governing bodies of shouting world so I think you know if you're a professional sportsman out there women please do obviously consult it's your a specific union yeah but wider or the world anti-doping Association agency actually excluded CBD and I wanted to say specifically the cannabidiol the CBD yeah because in cannabis plants you might have a lot of other cannabinoids including THC they didn't exclude that but they did exclude CBD in 2018 and I've seen the latest list it's still excluded but please obviously consult with your Union make sure you get a pure CBD product what not God and have a tested by all means yeah and I'm starting to develop my my cannabinoid capillary so on THC and cannabidiol are kinds of cannabinoids they rate exactly so tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are all part of the cannabinoids which is over 100 of them but very different and the cannabidiol part is what we are talking about here really deep products which has been excluded by water like exactly exactly keV you got you what about CBDs interactions with other medication can you use it in conjunction with other medicines and also a great question as a pharmacist always say whenever you using a health supplement always consult with your doctor they know your medical history based funding after World Health Organization in 2018 said that CBD is generally well tolerated it has a good safety profile it doesn't have any sort of addictive properties and that's why it was excluded by water not there's no abuse potential or dependence again with the THC very much so CBD not so much not at all so yeah absolutely safe always exciting to have you here with us when you bring us news of what's happening out there in the world of medicine so thank you very much appreciate people catch you in the streets supporting the Springboks in your and it's all the excitement but of course with regards to our conversation right now of course CBD products are widely known for reducing stress and pain and sleepless nights among many other benefits as she won't discuss with us earlier on and if you'd like to try CBD oil or other CBD based products you can find the rethink CBD range at all leading pharmacies and health stores nationwide choose less anxiousness sleepless nights and pain and inflammation choose CBD choose rethink CBD brought to you by relief pharmaceuticals", "Qe29DzB92x4": "today's review and lab tests are on r medicinal's 2500 milligram extract 2500 milligrams this is nuts yes i sent their 1 000 milligram extract to the lab before and got some backlash from that review i originally found this brand on amazon amazon does not allow cbd so brands on amazon don't mention cbd or thc it's a problem but now a bunch of credible brands do this the 1 000 milligram review was very impressive very cheap lots of cannabinoids but i still talk [ __ ] about the transparency issue well a bunch of r r medicinal fans reached out and they were like what's your problem jeremy it's a good product and you're not being cool one of them even called me an l7 weenie i don't even know what that is come on benny man the kid is a l7 winnie so i sent their 2500 milligram oil to the lab labs to see if it's real you've got to test multiple products or you won't know if a brand is consistent or real that's a big problem let's see the results right after this intro and disclaimer my name is jeremy roscoe and i spent a decade as a professional firefighter with a baby face but my real dream was to grow beard and become the greatest cbd reviewer the world has ever seen now i have a beard and review more cbd products than anyone ever no more baby face i send every cbd product to two independent labs to see what's real disclaimer lab results do not guarantee all products by cbd company will test the same many cbd companies produce inconsistent or entirely fake cbd i use affiliate links to support these free lab tests these are my honest opinions this is not sponsored i pay for the products and i pay for the lab test all cbd is blind tested to give you truly independent results you're welcome visit cbd examined.com for official lab tests and more this is not medical advice enjoy they claim 2500 milligrams for 96.99 that's a weird price and that is a lot of milligrams of who knows what our labs found 9 to 18 percent more cannabinoids than suggested by their label that's good but if we went by cbd lab a found 2600 milligrams of cbd which is extremely accurate we measured this in total cannabinoids because rnr medicinals doesn't mention cbd anywhere let's break this down into milliliters this is insane about 90 milligrams of cbd per milliliter that's so much a lot of novice cbd users might use nine milligrams this is 90. 90 milligrams wow over two milligrams of thc wow wow for sensitive people watch out because that can start to give you high effects for sensitive people those thc high effects and you certainly don't want to take a drug test if you're using this product a lot about one milligram of cbg and a milligram of cbc that's extremely good this is a well-rounded full spectrum look up the entourage if you don't know what's going on here this is probably the most potent i've tested in terms of total cannabinoids but the dropper is labeled that's nice so you don't need to take this much you can take far less the problem with any natural full spectrum oil that is this potent is that it will taste horrible it's just hemp and peppermint oil hemp doesn't taste good and this is a lot of hemp extract it's almost got a natural like tobacco or oaky flavor the hemp flavor is that strong this will put hair on your breast let me tell you but they warn you that the flavor is intense and they do not recommend this for those that are sensitive to hemp taste i respect that we can't really complain about the strong flavor because they warned us and the flavor strong because this is incredibly potent and natural the cost the cost is phenomenal under 4 cents per milligram that's cheaper than about 90 percent of cbd products on the market plus this has more cannabinoids than 99 of products out there which is a statistic that i just made up but highly accurate this tincture looks like something a dock in the 1800s would give you right next to a saloon in a gold mining town the liquid is brown it doesn't look appealing but the viscosity is actually light it goes down pretty easy which is a good thing now i still don't like that this brand is not transparent about cbd and thc levels i mean this this is strong and i'm a little worried about sensitive people to thc and cbd buying this they should know but maybe i should stop being an l7 weenie right you are in our medicinal fans whatever that is hey if you think that too leave me a youtube comment it helps this channel grow aside from the transparency issue this is one of the cheapest the strongest hemp extracts with a

TELLS ME FULL SPECTRUM CBD\nPRODUCTS ARE POPULAR BECAUSE\nTHEY DO HAVE TRACE AMOUNTS OF\nTHC, WHICH HELPS WITH PAIN\nRELIEF.

another vlog on my channel i'm so happy you guys are tuning in none other than this beauty here she is the himalayan hemp seed oil cold pressed multi-purpose oil so this beauty i found in amazon i will definitely leave the link down below in the description box just in case you guys want to check it out um this i use as a carrier oil for my face as a part of my skincare so as you can see this comes in a net quantity of 250 ml it's a source of omega 3 plus 6 fatty acids vitamin e minerals which is great it boosts skin repair immunity and even weight loss this company has a set of specifications of claims that it's pure it's wagon it's 100 natural no preservatives and it's non-gmo which is a nice thing to know and as you can see here they have a target symbol in which they've pretty much bought all the details in it what makes hemp seed oil great for you it's rich in mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids vitamin e antioxidants zeros carbohydrates omega 3 and 6 which is very nice it helps lower cholesterol boosts digestive health helps reduce joint aches boost weight loss nourishes hair and skin and enhances immunity which is a set of but of benefits of the soil moving on flipping up the bottle they have got a composition in which they has told that it's just raw hemp that is cannabis cetavalene seed oil mind you and it's not of the stems and the leaves in the directions of use they have mentioned of how do you use it over the food and relish the nutty flavor along with its nutritional goodness for a wholesome meal they've also suggested to drizzle it over the dips sluds humans or pasta and believe him or not this multipurpose oil acts as a great nourishing agent for this hair and skin okay so they've also said that it's best consumed raw and not recommended for frying so you're not supposed to put it under any other heat it's non-gmo and gmp quality one more thing that i wanted to tell you about this is they have not mentioned any fsa ci um certification so i'm not suggesting this to be eaten or to be adding it into your diet or not because i have no knowledge about that or using this particular oil in in your cuisines so i would definitely not comment about that particular area whether you could use this in your food or not i am primarily making this video in terms of just skincare because i have bought this as a alternative for my juicy chemistry hemp seed oil and it was a very good product so i was just looking for alternatives and i happened to bump onto this moving on this is just a quick description about this product in terms of its manufacture it is in india madhya pradesh and they have also mentioned it's a proud product of india in ayurvedic proprietary medicine and this is of a net and this cost of 8.49 for a net quantity of 250 ml um and the manufactured date is of ninth month of 20. so it's going to stay for a solid 12 months since the date of manufacture so that was pretty much it of the description that it's a glass bottle so i'm just being a little extra careful with it that was pretty much it of the description now let's go to how does the look feel and what kind of a consistency does this have so i've just put it horizontally so that you guys can see it's quite a long um bottle uh it's a 250 ml glass bottle i'm just being a little too extra cautious as you can see and it's a very um typical color of the oil is this color of the bottle that you can see here it's a very smoky green and i love that um color of the bottle and it's got a bottle cap which is plastic and i'll show you how does it look with the help of a dropper so it may give more knowledge or clarity as you can see it comes with the typical plastic cork which you see in most of the um bills that you use is a topping so i'm going to show you with the help of a dropper okay so as you can see this is pretty much how it looks like i mentioned it looks just the same color as that of the bottle i have already made a video of the juicy chemistry hemp seed oil which i used as my first product of hemp seed and a hemp seed oil so i found this almost of the same quality i'm not sure about the intricate or the details of whether it's just the same or not but i can only tell in mia in terms of my experience of using it on my skin and i felt it was just the same so i finished my first juicy chemistry bottle of hemp seed oil so i filled it up with the um this oil so i it's pretty cool because this was actually the juicy chemistry hemp seed oil which i first purchased and it was 30 ml and it was a round of around it was a round of the prize or mrp of 600 excuse me the bottle is a little dirty um so i found it a little too overpriced i was looking whether there were any alternatives and i happen to bump onto this beauty and i'm so happy i found this product so right now i have preserved this bottle i use it um the moment it gets over i refill it so this is the first um set of amount that i put from this bottle onto that and i've almost reached halfway i'm still using it and i'm forever going to use this bottle until i just show you i'll just put a little drop of it and it's a very runny consistency oil just as i've mentioned in the previous juicy chemistry hemp seed oil and i feel it's really nice you don't need a lot like two or three drops just on the top of your skin does a great job after your skincare it helps it to lock the moisture or whatever that you've put on under the layer of this oil so it's a very nourishing oil beautiful oil for um oily skin people especially because it's got a zero comedogenic scale point which is amazing it's just so good for the so that was pretty much it about the description and the look feel and all about that product i just felt that this was a much much better bit that i could find online in amazon i'm so thankful i want to bounce back to this product and would want to use this forever so thank you so much for watching i hope you all like this video leave it a thumbs up if you did like this video leave it a thumbs down if you do not like this video i totally get it do let me know about what you felt in the comment section down below i'd love to hear from you guys do let me know about if you feel there's something that i can improve on i would love to hear from you guys till then i'll see you in another video in another vlog in the same channel till then bye guys", "o_dsXDzx9nI": "[Music] every once dr. Rick this unboxing is going to be on topical medical cannabis use and I got three things - one of which I picked up in Colorado or at least I used in Colorado when I took a hiking excursion team up there I tell you I didn't know how to use that this was a couple years ago and a married medicinals is pretty decent it is it's a pump the pump you just spray once I'm gonna pump once and it comes out has a cream you between your hands and you put it on your back and you see that you feel the effects of the menthol you might have might not feel the effects of the CBD so all of the camp medical cannabis products in Illinois have to have a biochemical profile and that essentially means that it has to be broken down as far as all of its cannabinoids and the most important ones for figuring out how to purchase what is the ratio of CBD to THC now this one happens to have all CBD so I believe it's zero THC which I'm not sure how they came up with that because it is medical cannabis and there has to be some form of THC but I haven't called the company yet anyway this is all CBD I do not think that you'll have the psychogenic effect that smokers and vapors and edible or concentrate users will have because again no THC but just remember CBD cannabidiol which is a cannabinoid cannabinoid is just fractionation of the plant in the active ingredient of the plant CBD does get to the blood as far as stimulate the immune system with cb2 receptors on the immune system and it does get through the brain to stimulate or work on cb1 receptors of the brain so it does cross the blood-brain barrier but as far as giving you the psychogenic effect probably not now I felt when I this is my story when I finished a big hike we went back to the chalet in Colorado I took a shower I put this stuff all over the Summa because I was sore from that hike or from that ascent I figured I'm in pain so I might as I'll use the whole thing so I've covered myself like a moisturizer and not a good idea because of its menthol I was cool overly cooled for at least two to three hours now the other question somebody will have is well maybe that was a CBD and maybe I don't know but I would only use this sparingly so you should essentially just pump it you squeeze it out onto your hand it does have menthol so you have to watch your hand watch your hand to eye contact and then you put it on your trigger points of pain I would use it limitedly to one spot one region one area for at least five nights or twice a day for five days whatever you choose try to do that without any other variables to see how it affects you and just in case okay for some of you who are super sensitive or using THC at night streetwise or recreationally wise you do have to assume that there might be some entourage effect between the topical that gets into the skin and your THC that you used so just be careful it might accelerate the in the effect but you should always have your rescues and that's why I have these rescues here so your rescues will be the anecdote half of a half of the lemon or a full lemon squeezed black peppercorn black peppercorn ground up I usually just take this grind it up and are tell my patients that obviously I didn't break it yet tell my patients to grind it up and then put it in the lemon juice that you just squeezed and take that in now there's no overdose of those two things so you don't have to worry about that but it's supposed to neutralize the effects of the THC essentially it blocks like like these two things these are hemp-based CBD and CBD dominant medical marijuana so both of these you can probably see and if I felt here there you can hopefully see that the content here is dominant least CBD there is some cheatsy here in the hemp based product it doesn't have to say THC CBD breakdown because it's over-the-counter so you'll just have to assume that with the amount of CBD in here that it will neutralize your Tac so what these things do THC is the part of the plant if you take it at night or you take the whole plant part of the plant that gives you the psychogenic or makes you a little high dizzy forgetful fatigued so some people that might be good for PTSD sufferers but for non PTSD sufferers or people who are older trying to take care of rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia they're ready off and fatigued to begin with so we don't want extra that will rescue you it takes the THC which is supposed to be converted into something called eleven hydroxy THC another metabolite and it stops that so it'll helpfully help you get rid of your hai effect within 30 minutes I think again you can't really overdose on the natural things you can't really overdose on hemp you might overdose on the low THC medical CBD but that's the rescue should always have it around or you can just sleep it off or have a friend hold your hand so now into the topicals so we'll start with we already started with the topical cooling effect of all CBD that's Merri medicinals this is pain be gone I already opened that up so I it's technically out unboxing this is pain begun this bomb is mostly THC but here the exact breakdown and the type is so tiny I can't read that myself without my glasses so I'm squinting THC a hundred CBD zero so it's just the opposite this is all CBD all right out that you see that but if you can read great this is all THC pain begun and this is how it looks if I can open this up I just try to open it this is how it looks so that is a bomb it smells a little bit like marijuana but I'll just smell I can smell the oils I don't know this oil this is I have seen some people online make their own the only problem with making your own is that you can't have a problem with getting the exact percentages or by physical profile or by chemical profile so I don't know if it's and the THC might not be activated so you have the THC has to go through this complex process of decarboxylation to be activated you might not get that if you don't heat it properly I'm hoping that the companies have done their job so you will get the CBD product if your make it on your own through the skin but if you're looking for something else it might not get there so again this is mostly THC this is mostly CBD and finally this is lotion this is about half and half 100 of CBD and 100 of THC so this is half an F so this would be if you look at my video previous video on Ken at cannabis colors this would be red this will be indigo blue and this would be green because it's one to one if you can see that great and this one in addition to it being one to one it also hmm this doesn't even smell like cannabis smells like a spa this is nice oil but this also has Cayenne so it could be that the Cayenne I don't you can get the color of that that's kind of too much light in here maybe that you just got it but this is kind of salmon colored it smells more like the Cayenne than anything or the oil but this is hot this is hot this is neutral and this is cold so just these are options and the way I would play this would be that you use again you pick your five days straight and if you can use topical I really don't think you have to worry about even with the mostly THC one don't have to worry about it crossing the blood-brain barrier making you hide but use the red or a rescues if you have to I believe that if you do this two to three times a day if you like hot because you have a trigger point and you want to try it and try it there same amount two to three times a day for about five days straight if you want cool because you have hot flashes at night and you also have a trigger point or you have arthritis that's hot then use cooling to your area of attack but again two to three times a day five days straight no other variables to see how you effectively change and the other variables would be don't take any extra medicine take the usual but don't taint again an extra don't do anything new with your diet don't do anything new with your exercise and the same thing with the one-to-one you can potentially get a little bit because of THC content in here remember it's one THC to one CBD you can potentially get it to cross a blood-brain barrier but again if you use your rescues and you're really good you should be okay so if you notice good reflects with the use after five days of your experiment then cool you can use it anytime you want I usually use this as a supplement to my patients who are doing it orally using the concentrates orally or using the vapor smoke they'll have their protocol as far as what to do but during times of really bad flare-up I say don't change your formula as far as the vape smoke or concentrate but add this has an extra pain reliever locally so it doesn't add to the CBD that you have internally or add to the THC that you have internally it just gives you extra relief this is also very good for skin reactions those of you have psoriasis or eczema really nice I'm going to try it on a patient that has Lyme disease and is showing some psoriatic changes which were thought to be psoriasis but I really think it's Lyme so I'm gonna have him use this as well and we'll see how he turns out but hopefully you'll like this and if you have anybody that's on the fence as far as not exactly getting what they want from their oral or their smoked or their vaped and they want extra without having too much of a high affect then pass this on to them the other thing too is this can be a little expensive so you have to use it sparingly so as I mentioned I think this is for my patient I'm a caregiver for this thing is like 40 to 45 bucks this one I think it was same this one 30 bucks so they they go fast so you have to use them sparingly and again you have to wash your hands after you use these just in case you have to rub your eyes and one more thing the final note is that when you put this on topically you might still turn positive if you have a drug test so I know it you're not supposed to have that much THC in this thing or this thing but you can still turn positive now I don't think you're gonna have to worry about that but just plan on it and I addendum if you have it on your skin and you go and hug somebody that's a do T driver you can technically pass it on to them or if you hug a less than 21 year old you just got them to absorb too because they'll rub off on them technically even if it's a couple hours later can still rub off so be careful about your exposure past this video on if you like it otherwise subscribe to me down below went to when I do other videos and have a good day you", "6jxGSKLRpZo": "[Music] hey guys Cathy here and today we're gonna be making a hemp well so hemp oil being let's see not a huge portion of the self it's about 10% of my oils but it's a very dark oil and has some really great benefits for your skin I'm not fragrancing this one so I'm leaving it natural you might get some of the nuttiness off the hemp oil has a very distinct odor to it but it's not it's more gonna be an unscented soap and for colorants I'm going to do part of this in a French green clay I have mixed in with some of my soaking oils and for the uncolored portion I'm using not titanium dioxide but I'm using the sweet rice flour which I've used before in soaps and if you do some reading on it you'll see that the the geishas used to they may still use the sweet rice flour in their skincare regimen it's great for lightening the skin lightening any blemishes so that's what I'm doing today so we're gonna get things going here I'm gonna pour most of my white or should I say natural color in I'm gonna swirl with the French green clay leaving white on the top and then I'm putting on some hemp seeds after I texture the top I'm just gonna run a little bit of hemp seeds down the side so that is my plan I'm just straightening out my little swirly to earlier get my goggles on and we'll get to blending this adding my lye in it's always nice once in a while just to have a nice unscented soap like this something that's good for your skin but you know you don't have the perfumey fragrance oils or essential oils in there just just a nice soap to clean with [Music] you can see the color already it's just a lovely creamy color [Music] [Applause] I'm going to pour some of this off to make my green with not a lot just a bit like so just enough to swirl in the batter so we'll pour there the green in there get my spatula that's gonna be stirred in my hands and then the portion with our rice flour as well this one I'm going to blend a bit with the hand mixer just to make sure I get that rice flour incorporated really well [Applause] you can see it's not changing the color it's a white car it's just adding the rice so that that is good clean this off is it just a very basic simple soap nice and fluid so far look at the green in here from the French screen clay it's about a heaping teaspoon full I put in here and blended with my soapy oils so bring this bring this over occasional hemp seed fall in here I'm just picking those out here I've got these wonderful hemp seeds if you can see there we go beautiful beautiful the little something-something to top this with okay so I'm going to pour pretty much all of this in I'll save that much to put on the top just in case there's some green that shows up on top and here we go with the green and clean that out we'll get this swirled and I'm gonna stamp it with one of the victor stamps another one that he sent me and I'll link you in the box below to his shop on Etsy but I figured since I'm doing green kind of in this soap we're gonna make it for March first st. Patrick's Day and I'm gonna use this stamp to stamp it with after it's a little four-leaf clover so anyway that'll be cute so just giving it a swirl like so cleaning off my tool that's best I can there okay and then we'll spoon in the rest of this white onto the top pour it in I guess it's still pretty fluid hopefully we can cover pretty much all of this green cuz I like to have just the white on the top speak the rest of this in here trying to do this at an angle where I'm not blocking your view so I think we're pretty good here see if I can scrape this bit just so just trying to get every little bit I can out of here okay now I'm just gonna kind of cover the top I'm going to texture this I think so that green might show back up on the top anyway bang this down onto the floor here still have my glasses on cuz you're doing every you want to bang yourself down you wanna make sure you protect your eyes okay so there's that nice clean spoon at this point I'm gonna take my glasses off because I'm done with this with the blending it's such a etc I'm just gonna tidy my area here and I've got my hemp seeds and these these are edible these are food grade but you don't want to eat your soap naturally so we'll bring you in a little bit closer and hopefully won't take too long for this to set now just give it a little a little texture on the top and see if let's see if it holds or if my soap is still too soft as you'll know if it starts to disappear down into itself after a minute or two just trying to get some interest here it's so delicate and I just I can't help I love to play with the soap anyway I think that's alright that's gonna hold so now I'm gonna take my gloves back off and we'll sprinkle some of our hemp seeds on top I'll just bring you in just a hair and I'm just going to aren't they lovely they're so natural looking and just the perfect addition to the top of our hemp soap like I said I just want to go down one side and then we'll be back it'll be tomorrow for me and we'll use chopper to cut this beautiful soap and and then we'll do some stamping with our little clover stamp I know Victor does have a hemp stamp too I believe anyway I think I saw that on his site but I wanted to do something like I said in honor of st. Patrick's Day when I see my booboo but that's what we've got and we'll be back in just a moment to do the cut okay we're back and ready to use chopper to cut our hemp soap and I'm just going to cut the end slices off just to get to the color under hopefully and take that first slice off so there's our little end slice you can see the pretty little swirl I really like that don't worry I will we'll zoom out and get a good shot here when I'm done cutting and we're ready to stamp I'm just gonna adjust this actually let me get the other side and slice I'm cutting with the hemp seeds slide down so they don't drag through the soap when I cut it I love how chopper works look at that beautiful swirl with the French green clay it's just gorgeous okay so let me finish I'm going to measure my loaf and and then I'll see how many even slices I can get about 8 and a half inches so I think if I do for sure one inch and then I'll have a little bar left for myself so let me set this for an inch right about there tighten that down and we'll start cutting you get these beautiful bars oops see I almost cut wrong side I'm gonna have my hemp seeds facing down so there's a beautiful beautiful bar look at the pretty swirls and I have I haven't decided whether I want to bevel these or not I know I want to stamp them though with Viktor stamp so pretty we have a beautiful sunny day here but very cold a nice so it'll be nice to go shopping today it's Saturday and we'll have nice sunshine and it will just have to bundle up we had tons of heavy wind last night so pretty I just love this can't mine there we go love the swirls love love-love-love such a nice natural bar with no fragrance and here's our last cut very pretty so I'm going to put you on pause and I'll get a range to do some stamping and we'll be right back alright so we're all set up and ready to do our stamping and give you a better view of the lovely swirls that are going on in this soap period of natural I love the natural colorant the rice flour and the French screenplays wonderful so okay I've got my four leaf clover stamp here from Victor and it's soap stamps for you and I'm going to spray that again with a little bit of alcohol and we're gonna place our little stamp right in the center of each bar like so beautiful you can't see it like a lot because of the color of the soap but it's just gorgeous and we'll zoom in for a close-up here in a second but you can see cute little four-leaf clover and it's just adorable give it another spritz and finish these last few bars and like so let me Bob them up a little paper towel here just to get that shine off a bit so you can see the stamp it's so pretty and we'll put these right back by each other they kind of you kind of got a little bit of a butterfly effect going so anyway I'll take this out and you can look see so there's our little four-leaf clover I like that one almost looks like a bat or an O or somebody standing there with wings spread out that's kind of cool another one here and here's some good swirling going on in this so again this is the the a four-leaf clover stamp from soap stamps for you on Etsy I'll link you in the box below to his Etsy store stamps were provided to me at no charge Victor song gonna highlight a different one every now and then in my videos but for now this was our hemp oil soap and we put in sweet rice flour and the green is from French green clay no fragrance just pure natural with the little hemp parts on the top really pretty and thank you for watching I appreciate you tuning in and we'll catch you on the next video and we'll say bye for now", "qYBs7ryRmV4": "[Music] hey everybody due to YouTube's new terms and conditions this video is now age restricted if you are not 18 or older please exit the video thank you hello again everybody and welcome back to your probe of cannabis in today's video I'm going to be showing you how to make CBD butter to cook with but first before we get in today's video if you wouldn't mind hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you would please give the video a thumbs up to show your support so today we were making a very simple recipe on how to make CBD butter and first of course we're going to be using our hemp flour that we grew this summer out in the fields and this is our cherry wine variety we have plenty of it and it comes in at 17.4% CBD so I'm looking forward to using this in our butter recipe the other thing of course that we always feature and pretty much every single one of our cooking videos and we're happy to have a whole bunch more stuff to use now is our magical butter machine of course this is what our staple is to make everything easy clean no mess and it's just a dedicated cannabis cooking device the other thing that we'll be using today which is the first for all of our videos is the magical butter calm D carb box with thermometer this is going to kind of be a game-changer for us because I have received comments like is there another way not to use a 1-room foil or a household pan yes magical butter calm does make a decarboxylated or oven to 250 degrees at 230 degrees for about 30 minutes and now that's your preference on what your temperature is how much you wanted to deke our but the cool thing about this is it has an internal thermometer that you plug right into the box so you know what the temperature of those flowers are at all times now for today's recipe we're also going to be using magical butter coms butter tray mold so that we can get the sticks of butter right back to they were prior to making our CBD butter and in today's recipe we're just going to be used unsalted organic butter that we purchased from our local grocery store and we're going to be using four sticks of butter and approximately 26 grams of decarboxylated hemp flour and of course you could always add raw material to to get that CBD and it really depends on where you want it to be moving for today's purposes we're just doing D carbon so that's for today's recipe we're gonna go gather all the materials I'm gonna get the pre oven preheated get our flour into the box and explain to you what exactly you need to do to make CBD butter today we're gonna be making that butter and all we're gonna need to do is now that we have our D carb flour and again guys you know the drill this flour is in the oven for about 30 minutes at 250 degrees we're gonna go ahead and put all this flour in try to get all of it in you know the drill I can never get it all in then we're gonna get our melted butter and put that in again guys two cups of butter okay now that we have our two cups of butter and our 26 grams of D card flour we're gonna go ahead and turn on our magic butter machine so we're going to be doing a hundred and sixty degrees for two hours and we will see you guys in two hours so this time I took the liberty of straining the butter it's again no difference in any of our oil videos and you guys want to see how we strain that go ahead and check out that video I'll leave it up top so you can check out that video but essentially I've already strained the butter and I've cooled it down and taken the sticks out but I wanted to show you the simplicity of this magical butter tray because when you go to pop out your butter it is a literal stick of butter and that would that's what makes it really easy guys you can see the numbers imprinted at the bottom and it just makes it really easy to use in any recipe so you can look for this to be and a lot of our recipes in the future but that's all I had for you guys today I hope you enjoyed this butter recipe it's really simple guys and if you have any questions feel free to leave a comment below and I will gladly answer them if you haven't yet check us out on Facebook patreon Instagram and all other things including a bar website and if you guys are interested in any of our products you can always visit our be alternatives comm and our partnership with them and most of our flour can be found on that website that's all I have for you guys today I will see you in another video take care", "ri6gRvJGjYU": "hey these I'm Murray from humble B and me and today we are making this lovely gentle hemp and shea soap so you can see it's got a nice little sort of rustic white theme through the center and we've got a topping of some hemp hearts so this is a really nice easy bar to make and it's great if you have sensitive skin it's got a wonderful creamy lather from a lot of clay in there which is one of my favorite things and soap and the green color comes from just natural unrefined hemp oil which is naturally a very deep green color so this is a cold processed bar and I'm soaping it at room temperature which means that I've combined the lye in the water and let that come to room temperature over the course of several hours and not that the fats and also let those settle to room temperature over the course of several hours this is one of my favorite ways to make so it is so easy there's no fussing with thermometers and with trying to get everything to sort of settle at the right temperature because they'll just naturally settle up the same temperature which is room temperature couldn't be easier once you have achieved trace this is a really really simple soap to put together well blend in our clay and then we're going to take about a quarter of the soap batter and put it into a new separate Bowl and so that that's going to be this layer so that's a layer we'll blend our titanium dioxide into and then all you're going to do is put through about half of the green stuff in your mold the white stuff and then the rest of the green stuff and then because I wanted to really sculpt up the top and get some nice texture here I left it in the mold for about 15 to 20 minutes just to let it set up enough that you could really sculpt it and then I use a spatula to sculpt up the top as you'll see and then sprinkled some hemp hearts down the center and after that it's just saponify cut age and you're done so come on let's get started so we're starting with our melted fats and our live water so I melted these fats and made this live water about eight hours ago and so I've let them come to room temperature so this set this is just oh my one hundred percent room temperature soaking method where you just let everything come to room temperature it's great to do the sort of the melting and the combining part before you go to bed and then make yourself the following morning so we're going to add the lye water to our fats and this here this is pretty much the most dangerous part of making soap when your lye water is all concentrated like this so at this point I'm if you spilt it on yourself it would be like spilling a giant pot of boiling water on yourself not good now that it's in here it's heavily diluted and it gets less and less dangerous from this point on because as we reach tres it gets thicker and thicker and your spills become less and less messy basically you can imagine the difference between spilling pudding and spilling water right one will spread significantly further than the other so I'm going to give that a bit of a stir and then I set this aside I'm actually just going to pop this in our live pot and I've got my stick blender here and let's get this going to trace you all right we've achieved trace you can see that when I do this you just see a little hint of the drooling soap off the spatula and just leaves a trace in the top of the soap so I'm going to keep blending this for another minute or so and then we'll add the clay and then we'll be ready to divide this into two batches and decorate it you so this is gotten a bit thicker and that trace is just a little bit more obvious and now it's time to add our play so I've just got some white Kalyan clay here and at that I like to use quite a lot that's more than most people recommend but I've used quite a lot more than this in other recipes and I love the way it turns out so no worries so make sure you use your immersion blender to really blend it up so you don't have any clumps can stamp it down so that you're really capturing it you all right give that a stir I'm not seeing any noticeable clods of clay so we are ready to divide this in half so you certainly don't have to divide your soap batches in half but I find that I like to do the legwork of the mixing and the trace once and then do the decorating twice so I'll make one batch of batter divide it in half by weight and then make two different batches of soap from it so set our immersion blender aside and I'm going to grab my scale here and so what I've done is I've added up the weights of everything that's in this pot so that's all the fats and all the water and all the sodium hydroxide and so I have that number here and I've written it down and we're going to divide it by weight and this part is really important too got it divided by the weight do not try to eyeball it you will be wrong every time I know because I did it a bunch of times that way before actually learning my lesson you all right close enough that's within a few grams at least and so when you're considering which batch you want to do first there's a few things to think about one if you want to do something fancy and fiddly you might consider doing that batch first because the batch that is sitting will thicken up as it sits something else to consider is if one of them is going to be a significantly darker color than the other do that one last so that way you don't have to clean your immersion blender so with that in mind we are going to do the light one first so I'm going to set this aside for use later and we have our pot here and for this light soap it's going to have a wee swirl and I'm just going to make this an unscented hemp soap so I have a higher expand drink up here and I'm just going to put you know a little bit in here I'm not really fussed with how much it's probably about a quarter of the amount of batter and in here I have a little Pyrex measuring cup that's got some titanium dioxide in some olive oil and so this helps improve the incorporation of the titanium dioxide which can be quite clumpy into this half unfortunately because titanium dioxide is quite clumpy this is still not entirely smooth so we will need to break out our immersion blender to ensure we actually get a smooth blend alright I'm going to add a little bit more of this titanium dioxide mixture so that we get a stronger contrast soaps that get their colors from the oils that are in them tend to lighten up as they saponify so the amount of contrast that we're going to see here will likely drop significantly during saponification that is like both of these will be less green so we want this to be more white so that it really shows up against this when it's not quite as green as it is now and probably the rest of this might as well this part is really all about eyeballing in the amount that you're going to want to use is going to vary hugely based on the size of the batch of soap you're making so check the description box below and the accompanying blog entry for more information on that so we are going to grab our mold now the old soap counter shuffle and here and here so here's my mold and this is a mold that my dad made me and it's awesome and there are plans and measurements for it on my blog and I'll put the link to that in the description box below and somewhere in here but one my favorite thing about this is that for every one inch of the mold this mold holds a 100 gram batch of soap I know that's a pretty wonky metric Imperial conversion but it means that we have a 15 inch mold will hold a 1500 gram batch of soap and that's 1500 grams of oil plus the necessary water in line okay time to pour so this is thickened up a bit you can probably see it moving a little bit more slowly than it buzz which is to be expected alright scrapey scrapey scrapey and aiming for roughly halfway and then we smooth out so the reason I've used rubber bands stairs because parchment paper which is what this paper is not waxed paper is so delightfully nonstick that even tape doesn't stick to it and if you use tape your parchment paper won't pop and this is no good so we'll use rubber bands alright gently gently gently I'm trying not to dent the the green underlayer it's great this grapes great big I love these spatulas souks home so much the link to them will be in the description box below they are incredible I have like a veritable bouquet of them honestly if a man wanted to impress me on a date he should not bring me a bouquet of flowers he should bring me a bouquet of spatulas either batter actual flowers like baking flour men have done that in the past and that does work smoothie smoothies movie back out and then we're going to do our top layer of more green and remember to be gentle so kind of doing this from a low low height and just sort of very slowly scraping this down and you can't see anything because this pot is opaque I'm sorry you I'm actually going to grab yet another one of my beloved spatulas it's a lot smaller and I can really get into the corners here to start just smooth that down and so what I have for a top decoration for these bars some hem parts so I thought this would be a very suitable topping for a hemp bar so this is not quite as thick as I would like it to be because I want to sort of skooby skooby sculpt it up a bit before adding the hemp parts so I'm actually going to set this aside and we'll do our second batch of soap and then I will come back to this to give it the scoopy treatment that it deserves so soap mold aside now that it has been a little while we can decorate the top of our hemp soap and so what I wanted to do is kind of scoop it up and give it a bit of a a bit of a soap Mohawk and then run a seam of hemp arts down the center of it so I'm just using the spatula here to sort of press the top up and kind of flip it over the top a little bit shift this rubber band back give me a little bit more room to work grab those hand parts all right we will probably lose a bunch of those when we actually slice the soap and start to use it but that's ok some of them will stick and now all that's left to do is pop our lid on this and set it away to saponify for 24 hours so I will see you then so it's been about 36 hours because I ended up getting busy last night let's unmold these bad boys you alright this is looking pretty good but the sides here say you're got a nice white line through they're not even close to being even but that's okay and looks like I should clean my mold a little bit better because there's a little bit of a little bit of pink left over from a previous batch okay so I'm going to take off some of the excess bits over here set these aside for our scrap bin which I think with this one I'm probably just going to amputate the very end bits as tiny little slices anyways I'm not going to fuss about that too much so this hope is still quite sticky so I have a damp cloth here so I can wipe my knife down in between slices what I'm going to do is actually I took this to the side so that I don't catch any of those hem parts and drag them through the soap when we cut it see here we'll lop off our ends here and then go back divider up I'd say that looks like about half into quarters you and there we go there's some unscented gentle hemp soap thank you so much for watching please subscribe and check the description box below for the full written recipe and the links to the full written recipe on my blog and links to

can't even tell you it feels like there is a vice i'm in a vice and it is squeezing um my rib cage and this is a constant everyday all-day feeling i have in addition to a nerve other nerve pain hey guys welcome back to the channel uh for those of you who are new hey my name is ladon and about i don't know almost two and a half years ago you guys know um i was diagnosed with transverse myelitis as i've been on this journey and you've come along with me you've shared with me that you are also dealing with autoimmune illnesses chronic pain issues and so forth and so in today's video i wanted to share with you my experience trying um various forms of pain management over the past two and a half years i'll share with you what works with me what i take when and you know the results i guess um i have experienced in using these various forms of medication so let me start off by saying i am not a physician you should be checking with your physician if you're thinking about trying any pain management options my physician was very helpful in helping me to uh figure out the best way to manage pain and because you know these situations if you have transverse myelitis or any sort of nerve um damage that you're recovering from you know every day is different and um your pain changes kind of as time progresses my apologies for the background noise my daughter is wonderful enough to be making dinner for us tonight so that's what that sound is if you hear it okay so the first med i'm going to share with you is your basic tylenol this is extra strength tylenol and so i like this one i'm going to show you what the pill looks like it is the rapid release pill quick release medication is ideal and i like the tylenol this is what it looks like i am a real fan of this product because it is pretty fast acting i would say like within 30 minutes or so of taking this i receive some sort of some form of pain relief this is for um in terms of nerve pain it helps um a little bit i would say like on a scale of one to ten this would help like around a three or a four level pain just by itself maybe three or four level um my pain normally ranges in six and above six to ten um but if i'm having like muscle pain because i've really been working it out in physical therapy or doing my own exercise or you know i pushed myself in terms of walking and you're having those kinds of pains that occur when you are trying to activate muscles that you don't normally activate uh because you don't feel them because you know you have that nerve damage you have the transverse myelitis um this helps with those kinds of aches right so um i like it it works for me and i normally will take that at night time because it does make me a little bit sleepy okay um the next thing i take is gabapentin so gabapentin helps with nerve pain as well i take 300 milligram peels and when i take them if i'm only taking that and maybe a tylenol i'll take you know upwards of five a day uh to help manage pain and it helps to a pretty good extent i usually take two or three right before bed and i might take it with the tylenol and it helps me to sleep as you know if you have chronic pain sleep is a real big issue um the next thing i've taken are is the cbd so cbd helps with nerve pain um this is a water soluble and i use it i put it in coffee or i'll put it in water and i'll drink it and i'll just use like four ounces of water i find that that's the best combination for me and then a dropper full of this and this will help during the day and at night it doesn't make me really sleepy or anything and it works really well this is a 30 milligram bottle and it has uh 35 milligrams of hemp in it and i'll put the breakdown of the cbd all that but that's what this is this is cbd it's called um neuro and this is by broad spectrum my db cbd place that's the company's name and that's where i got this one from it's pretty pricey too just so you know um what i have found to be most effective for me and i'm using now are these two products so um these are edible and um they have five milligram of thc five milligram of cbd these things will lay you out they have laid me out on several occasions um if i take a whole one or a whole one and a half because you have to play with it figure out what works for you that will knock me out so i usually only do half of one or maybe one full um edible gummy and it will help with pain relief also if you're suffering like from anxiety because this causes us a lot of anxiety this whole experience these are great as well i'm trying to get it open okay so it's definitely child proof but that's what these look like this is mindy's they have various ones but this is the mindy's black cherry and i really like it it's called lush black cherry but five and five is a pretty strong dose in my opinion for me i've never been a weed smoker so this is all new to my system so you know if you use it recreationally then you know you may be able to do two edibles and i like to take this at night or when i'm just at home so if it makes me sleepy i can just go to sleep but yeah it's really good for a night time because you know our pain becomes more intense at night and it helps to minimize that so you're able to sleep effectively the greatest thing for me is this one um this is a combination of thc and cbd it's 10 well it's a thousand milligrams of cbd and 100 milligrams of thc so it's 10 parts cbd and then one part thc and this is a tenser so this one you take and you put a half dropper or dropper full beneath your tongue you let it sit there for 30 seconds and then you can swallow it and putting it beneath the tongue allows it to go into your system a lot quicker everything else i showed you has to digested you know before it can begin to work and so this is a great option because the thinking is that it goes more directly into the blood stream and so it will begin working much more quickly than the other options and yeah that's kind of been my experience um just kind of recapping the other products the water soluble it works pretty well as well um i could use this in the morning or in the evening it doesn't really leave me feeling groggy or anything of that nature but i do feel like it's not as effective as the products i previously mentioned in helping to deal with my nerve pain like i have to take a lot more of this and on a regular basis so that it's built up in my system um and i don't feel that i get the level of pain relief that the other product provide then of course i mentioned the gabapentin this works really really well i actually was using this and the tylenol alone um for the first almost two years of this journey and sometimes it was easy sometimes it was really hard i'd have to increase the amount of gabapentin i took but it did work um the reason my doctor kept suggesting to me to try cbd and thc is because it would provide um it'd be a more natural option and then um i would experience more release more relief and given the fact that um this nerve damage is something that in chronic pain is something that i will have to deal with for the foreseeable future uh if not always you know it's a great option to have and to go with something that is a bit more natural than having to take a prescription med constantly and having that be your own only source of pain relief relief and i really appreciate him he's been urging me for almost a year to use these products and i was hesitant to use a cbd or thc because again i never had used any sort of i never used marijuana before and i was encouraged a little bit by the fact that it is legal here in illinois where i live now i know it isn't legal everywhere so that's why i wanted to provide options um you know around prescription medicine that helped me but then also the thc cbd options that helped as well so um i can do a video where i go more in depth about thc and cbd if you would like um and share some other pain management options with you but these were the ones that were again near and dear to my heart they have been my um my rock and my source of relief for the past um two and a half years and i felt really comfortable sharing these products uh with you while parts of the last two and a half years um if you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comment section below if you'd like for me to talk about some other topics around chronic illness transverse myelitis chronic pain autoimmune disorders please do leave the topics um you know in the comment section below please share your experience in the comment section below and i will look forward to seeing you guys next time thank you bye you", "LKkvtd2f0mw": "back out here at dab hem cafe right off San Pedro here in San Antonio and now we're gonna be talking with Erika della Rossa one of the other owners here at the de cafe and we're actually learning more about the health and wellness benefits of hemp so tell me about I mean your story is amazing and using these hemp-based products you've actually recovered from from acne right yes absolutely adult acne it's something that I see young ladies in their 30s 40s suffer from and I'm not sure if it's childbearing years because I know that's when mine flared up or if it's a stressful lifestyle work stress family stress whatever it might be but I noticed that my breakouts works me they were consistent I had to use concealer that had covered tattoos so when I showed that photo to most people they're like I don't remember your face looking like that and I said well I used concealer that was strength to cover tattoos when working with these hemp-based products within two weeks I saw a difference I I was almost on my way to dermatologist for accutane which is

making a list of over-the-counter products that can help you decrease anxiety and stress and i ran into hemp gummies while i was browsing on amazon i was really impressed with the reviews that i saw it was not easy selecting a bottle as there are plenty of bottles with good reviews and some very confusing numbers on the label you'll see big numbers such as 400 000 all the way up to 1 million that i've seen recently and i had no idea what that meant a lot of these are also marketed the same way they have big numbers in the front unclear nutritional information on the back lots of health claims and happy people and photos with lots of lighting the bottle that i purchased was based on the reviews not based on just the highest number on the bottle if the bottle does not list the milligrams per gummy divide the total number in the front on this bottle it's 240 000 by the number of gummies 60. so that's 4 000 milligrams of what hemp oil also known as hemp extract on the bottle so here was my experience i initially took two gummies per day the first couple of weeks then after that i took about four per day i was curious because the claims were stress relief reduced inflammation improve sleep reduce anxiety reduce depression so they have a strong gummy bear smell with something else that i can't really identify the texture is softer than your typical gummy bear so initially they taste just like your regular gummy bear then there's another flavor behind it and i can't really identify it i had a headache the first day that i took one so i figured hey this is a perfect opportunity the headache really didn't go away i wasn't subjected to like a lot of stress so i can't speak to that on the first day nothing noticeable around the first try it did not change any anxiety ticks that i have it did not make me sleepy i was reading the news like always before i went to sleep so really there was nothing noticeable the first days other than eating a delicious gummy a month later i was reflecting upon any benefits because initially i didn't feel any and it seems to help with arthritis i have wrist arthritis right where my thumb meets the wrist and i suffered less during the month that i was taking them but the effects were not immediate it just took some time with regards to anxiety and depression i found the results negligible like a drop in the bucket kind of experience so i was curious about why these hemp gummies are so popular let's talk about cannabis a little bit so there are over 150 identified cannabinoids in cannabis with thc and cbd being the most popular so thc will give you that high and the cbd gives you the calming effects so let me clarify amazon does not sell cbd products so no these gummies don't contain cbd and they obviously don't contain thc but some people thought they did in the reviews the association with cannabis plant may be what brings customers to this product so let's talk hemp so hemp is a specific strain of the cannabis plant hemp is high in cbd but it is very low in thc i believe american grown ham has less than point zero two percent thc but the cbd is mainly found in the leaves and the flowering of the hemp plant but there is no cbd in the hemp seed which is what these gummies are made from so if the gummies don't contain cbd or thc then what are you getting so let's look at hemp seed oil about 75 percent of hemp seed oil is composed of omega fatty acids the rest is a monounsaturated and saturated fats about 50 percent of the hemp seed oil is omega-6 fatty acids more specifically linolenic acid about 17 is omega-3 fatty acids more specifically alpha linolenic acid i also noticed that this composition is very similar to flax seed oil so any benefits that people are talking about in the reviews is from omega fatty acids so i was curious and i did a search for omega 3 6 and 9 products and sure enough the reviews were aligned with the hemp gummy reviews yeah improved memory healthier skin lower cholesterol improved immune system reduce arthritis pain less anxiety essentially the hemp gummies are a cannabis-derived source of omega-3 and six fatty acids would i buy these again no for each of the benefits that are cited in the reviews there are actually other supplements that do a better job of addressing these issues that's for another video did i waste my time on this no from this experience i read up more on omega fatty acids and i found that omega-3 works great at reducing arthritis pain but the best source of omega-3 is fish oil so thanks to this hemp gummy i'm currently taking omega-3 fish oil that's a wrap if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below i always add more information in the description of the video thanks for watching",

today we're going to be talking about a product that Young Living has not come out with yet it is called CBD oil hey guys welcome to the channel normally I start with like a box and I'm pulling product out I'm telling you how I use it and how much I love it and or you know whatever but actually today we're gonna be talking about a product that Young Living does not have yet we will be seeing it in 2019 from them so um we're gonna be talking about CBD oil but before we talk about that let's talk about some things that I think need to be addressed let's talk about hemp versus marijuana let's talk about CBD versus THC let's talk a little bit about the history and uses and things like that okay so if you're ready to nerd out with me this is the channel for you alright so a CBD oil what is CBD oil CBD oil is oil derived from him okay Young Living CBD oil will be organic hemp that then we derived the the CBD from so let's talk about let's talk about cannabis and hemp in marijuana because those are words that we hear and a lot of people I think think they're exactly the same thing so cannabis is like the umbrella term okay it's like the overarching family of the plants and then you have him and you have marijuana and they are not the same plant okay they look similar and everything they're in the same plant family but they're not the same plant so you've got cannabis and you've got him and you've got marijuana now the main constituent of him is going to be C B that's canna been like stink at pronouncing things I apologize canna Biddy all can a vide all and I may be saying that I go quickly because I usually do canna Biddy all is CVD oil and then over here we have marijuana okay same cannabis family different plant marijuana has the main constituent is THC I will try to pronounce this for you it is tetra hydro canna bin all tetrahydrocannabinol THC is in marijuana in him we have CBD okay CBD is legal in all 50 US states marijuana is legal in 30 US states okay different they're different things so recently the fda approved CBD like as a drug called at the dole x Epidaurus for treatment of to specific epileptic orders and so what does that say that says that that people are taking notice that CBD can help with specific things so these specific synthesized drugs that were created are to help these seizure disorders now I'm going okay wait where did they get the idea to use CBD for that well that's because CBD has been used like around the world for a long time to help people with different things it's got antidepressant properties anti-anxiety properties and there are protective properties alright so um it's used oftentimes in the management and treatment of like chronic pain PTSD anxiety issues depression type 1 and 2 diabetes seizures brain trauma and even for help with the side effects of chemotherapy okay so how does CBD oil even help like how does it work so let's let speak out together for a minute and toxin chemistry and biology okay CBD actually binds to the specific receptors in our brain it's like the information pathways of our brain it's like our brain talking to our brain okay and then our brain talking to our body these are these information pathways and so the CVD oil actually binds to those and helps with the communication there so what are some things the neural protective effects brain neural brain protection there's actually been studies done where CVD helped hinder the development of Alzheimer's symptoms which Alzheimer's is literally the breaking down of the brain it's the degradation of our brain so CVD has actually been shown to stop the degradation the breaking down of the brain in Alzheimer's patients imagine what it can do on a proactive level for healthy people who have healthy brains imagine that that's amazing to me all right also there's analgesic effects like pain killing effects from CBD so it's proven itself useful especially for chronic pain sufferers because it inhibits the neural transmission that would cause what's called analgesic tolerance so if you guys have ever heard of people getting addicted to painkillers and they need a higher and higher and higher and higher and higher dose in order to feel the same effects they used to fuel down here that's because their brains are going okay I need a that little bit isn't doing it anymore it's called analgesic tolerance they build up a tolerance to it a higher tolerance and then they use mourn and they build a higher tolerance and that's how people get super addicted to painkillers but CBD has not been shown to have any analgesic tolerance meaning it can be really good for chronic pain sufferers because their bodies won't require more and more and more over time there's not those addictive properties that you would find with with actual like street drugs right or even pharmaceutical drugs that we have the market today so um CVD can can really be beneficial for chronic pain sufferers also CVD has been shown to have an antitumoral effect and that's a big deal guys um studies have shown that high doses of CVD has no toxic effect on humans but that with patients with related tumor conditions um that it can be extremely amazing for its antitumoral properties cancer patients this is like I mean breast cancer lung cancer any tumor or cancer this is this is a gate this can be a game-changer for you right on a more like maintenance basis CBD oil has proven very effective on anxiety and depression so it has been shown to reduce anxiety and patients there was a study done with CBD oil and placebo oil and the CBD it given to patients and I want to make sure I'm gonna read this so I make sure that I get it totally correct I don't I love to give you guys like the best information but like accurate information from the studying that I have done a 2011 study the test was administered to 24 patients with social anxiety disorders so an hour and a half before the test the patients were even either given CBD or they were given a placebo and it was found that the anxiety the cognitive impairment and the discomfort of the patients with the CBD was significantly reduced compared to the placebo group so the patients who actually ingested the CBD found that their anxiety that their cognitive ability and that their discomfort all improved right they were more comfortable like more cognitively able to function their cognitive function was higher and their anxiety was lower the so for for a study of this like this obviously more study needs to be done 24 patients is not a large amount sample size but it does lead us to believe that there definitely could be some really positive effects there now many people will claim of their own that yes this is what CVD does for me so this is just a small test that was administered to see if that potentially could be the case and they are seeing really positive test effects in that way so CBD also affects our serotonin system your serotonin system is actually what helps regulate your metabolism right your cortisol levels of cortisol is out stress hormone that causes weight gain right so it helps regulate your metabolism your reactions to stress so that's the serotonin system also your social behavior this is what we're talking about those anti-anxiety effects right those antidepressant effects your mood your cognition your appetite like these are all very positive things to be regulated and to help your body regulate because CBD actually targets the serotonin receptor that a one receptor it it can help with all of those things so a lot of people have said to me April why is Young Living getting in the CBD game right like what is going on there well as of December 20th 2019 CBD oil is now given the a-ok the agricultural Improvement Act was signed December 20th of 2019 so hemp was actually removed from the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 which means it's no longer an illegal substance under federal law now it's going to be over overseen by the FDA the Food and Drug Administration so you may be going wait a minute why was it illegal in the first place I'm glad you asked my history buffs take a tour with me let's go way way back so researchers believe that hemp might have actually been one of the earliest plants cultivated by man traces of him found it like a specific Japanese archaeological site that's over like 8,000 years old all right it is believed that humans started like actual agriculture ten thousand years ago so this could have been one of the first right plants that man cultivated hello very cool but more than that hip traditionally over the centuries over the millennia have been used up has been used for things like rope guess what guys Christopher Columbus on his ship his ropes were made of hemp because hemp made it all the way through it's very prolific in the northern hemisphere it was very prolific in the northern hemisphere growing wildly so it was use rope clothing paper guys the Gutenberg Bibles printed on him early draft of the American Declaration of Independence printed or written on him the final draft was on parchment but the early drafts were written on him also it is believed that the first u.s. flag was hand sewn with him and you Betsy so obviously it has like a very long history and in the Americas in the USA it has a really long history him was grown throughout the USA like commercially right as a cash crop and and actually King George required the colonists to grow it and then taxed him on it in order to support the crown but at least seven different US presidents grew hemp as a cash crop now him also grew wild here in the US in Jamestown hemp was growing wild and there's reports that like Native Americans were already cultivating hemp here in the United States when colonists arrived um also it's been used over the years medicinally as farm feed in textiles right all those things that I already mentioned for so long livestock cows chickens pay were grazing on him wild growing him and it was part therefore of the standard us diet right because all the animals were eating it and then our we're getting it in our eggs and in our chicken and all that and so the benefits are all affecting our body so April get back to the elite illegal ization what's going on there 1937 the marihuana Tax Act happened which taxed anybody who was growing any kind of cannabis hemp or marijuana why conspiracy theorists take note that the passing of the Act - is believed that it was literally just to destroy the hemp industry there's speculation that Andrew Mellon Randolph Hearst which you guys might be familiar with he was a newspaper printer and the DuPont family and if you're going wait I know the name DuPont plastics and nylon that they were all behind this marijuana Tax Act in order to destroy the hemp industry so that trees could continue to be used for paper thank you newspapers and the newspaper manufacturers that had huge stock in forests and the forestry industry and also the plastics and nylon industry which was very up-and-coming in the 1930s so conspiracy theorists go to town on that one I don't know the truth of that but it follow the money right ok so we go from hemp growing wild hemp being used by our presidents seven different presidents growing him him being used commercially right like all of this - there's a huge tax on it well then according to reports not only that the tax was was actually really opposed by doctors and pharmacists who then obviously they're being taxed on it they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa CBD hemp is really helpful for our patients it's not it could add rug and it's not addicting why are we doing this right and so they really opposed it it's still passed well then in 1970 that marihuana taxation Act was actually just adopted into the Controlled Substances Act so him marijuana were we're always kind of lumped together and they just got put right in the controlled substance act and guess what it made him on par with heroin and ecstasy as far as being a schedule 1 controlled substance so you in the u.s. we we couldn't touch it we couldn't do anything right well it was the ban was lifted for final product so you could import final products of hemp like clothing and things of that nature but you couldn't be the producer because that was a schedule 1 controlled substance so I mean I asked my husband if this would lend me any credibility in this situation at which one he said no but I thought it timely to mention that April's always been a pretty big supporter of him because this is my actual purse and wallet that I used as a teenager god I feel old right now this is 20 years old um I bought this when I was 14 I remember where I was and who I was with I was in ninth grade and I bought this hemp purse made in Nepal and a hemp wallet and I carried this literally it held up so well I carry this from ninth grade through sophomore year of college like until I got married I carried this for literally like what is that like five six years like six years I carried this in a hell so nicely quite honestly really really well-made product look at that it gets got this little hemp rope connector right here that this is all woven him on the the actual back it's lined with cotton but um this baby has held up it's a little crossbody satchel do you know what it was the perfect size for holding when I turn it when I was 17 I became a Christian and I got a Bible this is the perfect size from my Bible no joke and I felt like so so super blessed I was like obviously this is meant to be this Bibles from the Lord because it fits perfectly in my hip bag I have made two international moves and literally have almost nothing for my teenage years quite honestly like very few things no clothing at all which really do I want clothing from the 90s but I did keep this I have kept this for years and years and years lending a little credence to my hemp history here but ok so you couldn't grow hemp and you could not sell Hampton you could not do anything with him in the United States um fast forward 50 years 2019 the president signs V what is it Colin I make sure I use the right term agricultural Improvement Act it is no longer illegal to grow and sell and produce hemp products yay so people have said why is why is wild getting into this game we have been waiting for this to happen as an international company as a right as a company that provides product to all 50 states we wanted to make sure that everybody in the US could have access to this now um people have also said mmm April why are what's going on here is like you I want you guys to know that for me personally I have done research on CVD for years and I never pulled the trigger and here is why you guys know this sourcing is so big for me trusting that what I'm paying for is what I'm getting is such a big deal to me and that's why I chose to join Young Living when I got into essential oils because there were so many essential oil companies on the market I was buying my essential oils from Whole Foods and when I found out how unregulated that industry was I was like wait a minute so you're saying when I buy my oils from Whole Foods that say pure it only has to be like 5% essential oil and the rest can all be chemical synthetics and it still says pure yeah that blew my mind like how could producers do that well because it's a really unregulated industry and CBD oil is very similar there's so many companies springing up producing and in having CBD oil but I have no assurance of the sourcing I don't know if it was really truly drone organically if that workers were paid a fair wage if there's pesticides like you don't really know right young living with our seed to seal promise always consistently over and over again they put everything they're named behind the behind the production of their products from planting the seed all the way until sealing that bottle Young Living says look we're gonna do everything we can to make sure to bring the highest quality product to the market so Young Living is going ok here we go this is how we do this this is how we bring our people the best quality oil is that we make sure that we're taking care of the production the seed of steel standards way above and beyond the standards of any other essential oil company this very unregulated industry CVD very unregulated industry young livings way we can provide a really high quality product the highest quality product for our people organic hemp non THC organic hemp derived CBD oil infused with essential oils why why would they do that two reasons one you get the benefit of the essential oil and we've talked so many times that's why you're on this channel of essential oils and the benefits for your body in different ways okay but then too here's something I found so interesting and Young Living hasn't come out and said this but in my own research this is what I found and I think that it is really awesome CBD oil there's been studies done the beet oral bioavailability bioavailability is how your body can use the product okay the oral bioavailability of CD oil is somewhere between like 13 and 19% the inhalation bioavailability is somewhere between 11 and 45% with like the mean that you know the average being 31% so if oral ingestion the oral bioavailability of CBD is 13 to 19 percent and we know there have been studies done that essential oils increase the bioavailability of products so all of our supplements are infused with essential oils because you get the property of the essential oil that beneficial property but also it increases the bioavailability of whatever that supplement is so Young Living is going hey cv DOL is an amazing product our oils are amazing put those together and it's exponential the essential oils actually help the CBD oil to be more available to your body which means you use less with a greater efficiency hey yo thank you Young Living so I am super duper excited like I said I never pulled the trigger on CBD oil and the main reason was I didn't know who to trust there was never anybody where I went oh yeah okay you you're transparent about your practices your trans paranoid about how you farm I know where you're growing this I know who the supplier is you know what I mean nobody does that in essential oils or CBD Young Living is the only one that's doing that you know blooming doing one that's going look we're gonna control the whole supply process in order to make sure that there's no fudging anywhere because when you you guys know when you it's like a game of telephone right somebody starts it somebody produces it and then they pass it on and there's a ability for it to be corrupted in that and then the next person doesn't know that it's been corrupted and they think they're getting the original pure product and then the corruption potentially could continue and so other essential oil companies other CBD oil companies can say oh that supplier over there we didn't know that they were doing whatever practice that is undesirable we're just not gonna work with them anymore we're gonna work over here with these people now the only they will never do that to us because they put their name behind everything they own the farms or we have partner farms that work exclusively with us and adhere to our seed to seal standards which I set told you are above and beyond the industry standards like so far above me beyond so now that there's finally a source that I can trust for CBD oil I am super duper excited and you should be too Organic have CVD oil infused with essential oils this is going to be the utmost highest-quality CBD oil on the market and I am so excited so here's the deal if you've not yet joined Young Living if you're like mmm now's the time here's why this is

home he doused himself with water and made an impossible decision my house is now on fire couldn't stay in there so I come out and basically made a decision to run through the fire line i covered my face with my hands losses fingered that ear because the fire was coming from that angle Rudy ran through the flames and survived the water combined with heat from the fire created steam so intense it peeled off 75% of his skin his nerve so badly damaged his sense of touch immediately turned cold he was found disoriented and in shock along the road hours later doctors had to put him in an induced coma for two months and the next year of his life was spent in a hospital bed at UC San Diego Medical Center during that time I was having complications with the medications and the fact that some of these medications being opiate-based were overdosing I was slowly dying from having this in me so long so doctors decided to try medical cannabis as they slowly introduced it to his body he says his blood pressure went down his muscles relaxed and there was no need for morphine and then asked him if they just want to come pick it up dr. Mark Wallace is with UC San Diego's center for medical cannabis research he's been studying cannabis and its use for chronic pain for nearly two decades he says his studies reveal cannabis is a safer and more effective treatment for pain than opioids it's just inverted you with the THC and pain as the THC levels go up in the blood pain won't go down until the point where actually starts going in the opposite direction as the levels go up pain you might expect are worsening and so there is this therapeutic window a therapeutic window where just the right amount of cannabis treats pain and replaces opioids for about 70 percent of his patients the bottom line is I I prefer to visit medical cannabis before we resort to an opioid i I think cannabis is much more conservative I think it's lower risk there's never been a read or to death from medical cannabis or cannabis look at all the deaths annually from opioid use Reyes says while he survived the fire research like this is keeping him alive cannabis has made living with burns bearable seventy-five percent of my outside skin is now missing that nerve that tells me pain so in order to have any sensation anything like that it's always itching it's always quality it's always and I could hitch to the point of bloody it won't make any difference I smoked a little marijuana or ingest a little marijuana because there's different ways to ingest it now and that goes away do you know how many pills it used to take to do that a plethora of pills to do with one little plant can do so instead of swallowing pain pills he smokes marijuana consumes edibles and this stuff is aloe vera base and soothes his skin with cannabis creams while spending small amounts of time under the Sun this is my chocolate mint in his garden I've expanded and learned more to the point where I'm taking care of other herbs beyond it even though his studies reveal benefits to medical cannabis dr. Wallace says more research is necessary to pinpoint dosing but the research has been almost impossible since marijuana is still a schedule 1 controlled substance right alongside drugs like heroin LSD and bath salts the DEA has it listed as a drug with no medical use the National Institute on Drug Abuse says 9 percent of people using marijuana become dependent the organization also says several studies linked its use to an increased risk for psychiatric disorders but again more studies are needed to actually know how because it's federally illegal it makes the it makes it extremely difficult to do research and the reason is is because since its scheduled 1 the only source for it is there is the government NIH and that source of medical cannabis does not represent real world so the push continues from both patients and researchers to make cannabis more accessible especially to those living with chronic pain facing an opioid addiction I'm in California and immediately you see he gave me an option out not everybody got that not everybody got that like I did I'm one of the blessed ones Jade Hindman KPBS news", "9werp4Wvr4g": "the shisha is making it smoke so guys i think we're ready for our first hit of cbd hookah here we go cheers everyone cheers hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis on today's vlog we are excited to be trying something new for the first time and that is cbd hookah we have partnered with floor cbd a company based out of miami florida that offers a wide variety of different cbd products including this very first time we've ever seen cbd she shot i think that's really cool we're not big time hookah smokers but we definitely have a hookah that is the stunning glass and anytime we've got an opportunity to use that we definitely jump on it what i love about cbd is that it's the most popular cannabinoid besides thc so if most people have heard about cannabis passively they tend to have heard cbd and it's also the component that's going to keep you relaxed it's going to relieve anxiety stimulate your appetite do a lot of the pros and fun things of cannabis without making you feel the negative effects of a higher thc hit what's also great about this shisha is that it is nicotine free and tobacco-free which means that you can kind of enjoy the entire whole process and ritual of smoking hookah without getting too stony and you also don't have to worry about like smoking nicotine or smoking tobacco which are concerns that i would have going to a hookah lounge and smoking regular hookah that's why i think we're most excited about trying the cbd hookah because it is a healthier alternative for tobacco users so let's talk about the two different shishas that we have yes they actually come in eight different flavors total which i think is awesome that's a lot to choose from what we have on the table is pink lemonade and blueberry mint and because it's us we're not just going to be smoking this out of a regular hookah device we are going to be using our beloved stood in glass gravity bong yes it actually comes with its own bowl for hookah here so yeah we're going to be packing our hookah really great smell to it it definitely has that like strawberry lemon tartness to it coal already ready and yeah how easy is it to load this up put the coal on already ready i mean again very similar to your normal kind of hookah you know contraptions but we can flip this one so let's go and get this kind of primed up oh it looks like the puck is burning the shisha is making its smoke so guys i think we're ready for our first hit of cbd hookah here we go cheers everyone cheers oh it's really nice and easy that all it takes is a flip to get a smoke going and i love the smell of this pink lemonade so much really light actually yeah pretty enjoyable it's not i don't know i thought it was going to be very overpowering but it's not a lot of the times when i would smoke hookah i would get headaches from the nicotine i would always think that like oh you know it's hookah it's not going to get me high so i can just like you know rip keep ripping this oh man it surprises you how smooth it is it is so nice to taste both the the kind of lemon tartness and the sweeter strawberry side of the shisha damn that kind of body relaxation without the kind of cerebral paranoia that comes with higher thc and it looks like you can just go rip after rip on this thing on the cbd hookah it makes it very easy yeah i feel like i i will never go back to smoking traditional hookah this is the way to go 100 because yeah the things that i love about hookah the ritual the social aspect even just the fact that you could just like smoke on something very chill and passively like that's what i want and that's what i'm getting out of hookah 100 cbd hookah all the way for life if you want to pick up your own cbd shisha we highly recommend going to flora cbd pick up your own and also explore the other cbd products that they have there flora cbd also offers topicals gummies oils and also that cbd dip for all of the tobacco users out there that really just want

and CBD affect your sleep this was a video request and I was quite interested in researching this there's some cool information stick around [Music] so here in Canada there's been a lot of talk about cannabis lately and there's plenty of stores popping up all over the place so first of all what is cannabis cannabis is the Latin term for the plant itself and there are more than one species of plant therefore each species of plant has varying amounts of the compounds THC and CBD amongst many other compounds within the plant so some will have more THC than others and others will have much less so the species of plant really does make a difference and there's many blends of various plants you can get so that you can get the desired effect that you're looking for so what does THC THC is one of the compounds within the cannabis plant it's a cannabinoid and it is it stands for tetrahydrocannabinol CBD on the other hand is another cannabinoid within the cannabis plant and that stands for cannabidiol so what's the difference between the two quite a bit so THC is that compound within the cannabis plant that gives you that feeling of being high CBD does not have that effect so one is psychoactive one is not psychoactive THC is psychoactive CBD is not so looking at how each one effects your sleep I found that pretty interesting because you know I've I've heard of many people lighting a joint before bed to fall asleep easier and they think that they sleep better but if that joint that you're smoking has THC in it then yeah you are going to fall asleep sooner but it's going to interrupt your REM sleep and that can be a problem especially long-term it can be a blessing or a curse so looking at it this way if your REM sleep is disrupted that means that you are not you're not dreaming you're not getting into that dream state and you're not processing your memories and emotions this can be a blessing if you suffer from anxiety or PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder and the next day you will feel groggy as well just just like you would if you had a hangover so that's THC CBD on the other hand now apparently too good to be true it can help you fall asleep sooner it can help you stay asleep through the night I'm not sure about how it affects your REM sleep or not I couldn't find any definitive information on that and it also helps you feel even more alert the next day so this sounds really good there's not enough research to say definitively if there are any long-term problems with taking CBD so the jury's still out on that one and just to add a little fly into the ointment not everybody reacts to either THC and/or CBD in the same way as the next person each person each of us has a different number of receptors for cannabinoids and so THC tends to lock on to those receptors more so than CBD and that's why we get that that psychoactive effect now if you can flood your system more so with CBD rather than THC then those CBD they will take up those receptor spots instead that are therefore leaving less space for any THC that might be in there CBD has been shown to relieve pain which can be very good a lot of people use it for pain relief and and for getting a nice deep sleep so that's all the information I could find on THC and CBD regarding your sleep at this point like I said research is still fairly new a lot of people will say oh there's no problem with CBD but I think you have to take it upon yourself if you're wanting to try it to use yourself as an experiment and start low and then work your dosage up I am NOT giving you any medical advice whatsoever this is just what I've read and since everybody responds differently to it it would be wise to start small so I hope you found this information helpful and if you do use it and you've had good or negative effects you know maybe just write that down share your information so that other people can also help decide as well have a super day thanks for watching bye [Music]",

shopping doing fine a little sample on your hands you can pick something else up along with your new shoes or clothes so we figured just with the amount of people that are coming through here is a massive opportunity to really educate everybody on what CVD can do the Westroads mall now has this CBD kiosk good afternoon iein Cunningham sells products he says will help with a wide range of health issues people that are experiencing joint aches and pains sometimes you know a hard time sleep will CBD comes from hemp which doesn't make you high though closely related to marijuana it doesn't contain high amounts of THC CBD gives you all the medicinal benefits without the same euphoric high that you would typically get from a product that is high in THC it's a legal gray area Nebraska's Attorney General Doug Peterson maintains that CBD has been and continues to be illegal under Nebraska law American shaman this is Garrett butt Cunningham and CBD store owner Garrett carbonelle say they aren't breaking the law no one's getting high it's not hurting anybody and it truly is helping a lot of people Nebraska law shows hemp products should not have a THC concentration of more than 3/10 percent and the products sold at both of these stores don't exceed that we had anything in here that was above it I would I would expect them to come in here and shut us down well it may not be much of a war ii for Cunningham he hopes these kinds of stores will thrive going forward definitely the right time for something like this because again people are looking for a good alternative in Omaha I'm John Madden 3 news now carbondale says he's had members of law enforcement in his store and never questioned him about his products which they market as health and wellness aides we reached out to Peterson's office along with the Douglas County Attorney office for comment neither of them responded", "F82-_2jBY4M": "[Music] right now there's some turbulent times for the cannabis industry the cbd market is really really big the eyes of the world are upon us and we've got a lot of responsibility to make sure it's done correctly some rise some fall but at the end of the day we're going to get to a place where this industry is respected for the complexity and the regulation that it's voluntarily taken on and how it performs at a high level and that's the exciting part of being part of this and being able to shape [Music] sometimes i that asleep when josh is cutting my hair bro my girlfriend loves the sage that you got her oh the sound the lotion yeah so really cleared it up and she's used numerous products but nothing worked like the emotions so she told me to tell you uh thank you awesome man it's always nice whenever you actually hear the stories you know because that dude i know at first whenever i started making products i kind of was like well does it really even do anything you know like does this is this a placebo or does it work i just was lost with using so many creams and just being at a dead end when i seen that on his shelf i started using it and i got immediate results like within a few seconds i just saw a big difference just from looking in the mirror within a split second it just changed everything it's a great feeling you know to be able to create access for people that for one reason or another have the need to consume cannabis products hemp products and if it provides them some type of life-changing experience and it's really awesome for us and thankfully more and more people are sharing those personal stories and that's what's moving the ball on this issue people being educated on the issue and feeling empowered to share those stories because they don't have to be shamed for it anymore not everybody understands what it can do for you and i just want everybody to have the opportunity that i had and try it seven billion people have endocannabinoid systems we have something that's been a social movement that is now becoming an industry and there are definitely growing pains there are definitely people in companies who take the approach that's very extractive and they just want whatever profits they can and that's it and then there are folks who say all cannabis should be free it's medicine that's the ethos of it and then there are a lot of people somewhere in between trying to find their way we fight for our freedom right and i feel like growing this plant is a god-given right you know as long as you don't abuse it it's really important that companies take the time to do it right make sure that you're testing your product make sure that they're clean making sure that products have what you say they have i mean if you're saying as a company as a manufacturer that this has you know 50 milligrams of cbd in it you better make sure that that product has 50 milligrams of cbd in it and that is bioavailable that the body can actually absorb that 50 milligrams it's important that we as an industry push out good high quality products for people the laws are continuing to crack the door open and crack the door open more and more and more so that products that come from cannabis are and are continuing to be mainstream eventually they can't stop it no matter where we come from around the world we have all lived under prohibition we are all still living with stigma we have all had the same experiences with this plan those experiences have taught us certain lessons and those lessons have informed a common value system and now there are hundreds of millions of us all around the world collectively we are larger than most nations and one day we will learn how to recognize each other we will learn how to reason with each other and once we've done that we will start moving as one and we will change the face of this planet when we do that [Music] what's up bro hey what's up dan let me uh i'm on my way to the lab to see we're going to talk about everything bro the good the bad and the ugly my friend okay all right okay bye it's crazy i mean we just i just got an email a big national pharmacy chain wants to carry our products and who would have thought a retailer of that size would be carrying cannabis products you know what i mean made by two brothers that are growers and a chemist all foreigners all immigrants [Music]", "cRtFNT1bqoo": "hi everyone this is Anika with an EcoBoost DVD and I know this whole hashtag quarantine and chill thing is not working out with for everyone when it comes to the diet and exercise not being able to hit the gym so today I wanted to talk about CBD and weight management while many of the search for balance in our relationships in our work-life balance currently our stay at home work from home life balance our immune system and most importantly maintaining a healthy weight our bodies on the other hand are constantly in a quest for reaching homeostasis which internally maintains stability while adjusting to conditions that are optimal for survival such as sugar levels blood levels and also to regulate body temperature a perfect example would be running outdoors for exercise since most of us do not have access to a gym right now running outside is a great alternative your heart rate increases during running our muscles start working harder and need more oxygen your cardiovascular system is in charge of delivering blood and nutrients to your working muscles your body then responds by increasing the amount of blood your heart is pumping and that moves up blood from the inactive organs hormones are then released to signal your heart rate to increase so you can deliver more oxygenated blood to where it's needed throughout the run so as your blood vessels dilate your blood pressure will increase stay closed for your body temperature as your body converts food into enter doing this run it produces heat as waste product the heat then elevates to body temperature so to maintain homeostasis the blood vessels dilate to allow more blood flow to the surface to disperse the heat which leads to sweating and then the evaporation of the sweat cools down your body to maintain a steady temperature this is only one small part of homeostasis your endocannabinoid system works in such complex ways to maintain this homeostasis recent science has found that the endocannabinoid system does not respond to the endocannabinoids found in the body naturally but they do respond to external cannabinoids such as CBD so when introducing CBD to your endocannabinoid system it promotes homeostasis which and then turn reduces pain anxiety and controls appetite so how does it make me lose weight well scientifically it activates CBD receptors which then lower intestinal inflammation lowers anxiety so no emotional or stress-related eating we are all in search of maintaining that healthy weight it makes us feel better it makes us look better and most importantly it's very vital to our health now some people have the misconception that cannabis equals munchies and since DVD is harvested from the same shrub we automatically relate the two Stevie Dee on the other hand can be an appetite suppressant it has a great impact on metabolism in the human body by increasing the amount of activity the mitochondria has on ourselves which then lead to burning more calories as well as generation of fat cells by decreasing the proteins along with great diet and of great fitness routine adding CVD to I can give you that extra push in maintaining a healthy weight so during the quarantine right now I actually gained about seven pounds so about a week into it I started taking my Stevie Dee routine again and I incorporated Stevie Dee twice a day with running still not so much of the healthy eating but you know I have my candy here and there and within a week I dropped those seven pounds just by incorporating DVD twice a day to my daily routine the beauty of Stevie Dee is that there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to dosing for some people around five milligrams of CBD per day can be beneficial for others they need about 50 milligrams it's all really a trial and error remember to always start small and then increase accordingly but always be patient it can take anywhere from a couple days to a month to see the effects of Stevie Dee on your body weight loss pills can be very harmful for your body they can increase your heart rate you know heart problems but by adding CBD to your diet it's very beneficial and it's completely natural causing no harm to your body whatsoever anyways guys I hope that gave you a little insight on our endocannabinoids system and how CBD helps bring the body back to balance homeostasis and then maybe help you lose a little bit of weight or maintain that healthy weight that you always try to if you have any questions please like and subscribe to my page and always sure to comment at the below and stay safe guys this quarantine thing is

until I started taking CBD I think these little jammies these are this is uh this will [ __ ] you up though this is one in one one part CB don't put this one but yeah it does not put this in your you can put in your butt but you will get no nervous you're gonna get paranoid but it's it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does something to alleviate anxiety it sort of just leaks makes you comfortable with your own demise lets you do the existential angst is the flames don't seem so hot so you like yeah we're all gonna die yeah but right now we're not dead cool look

just CBD oil hmm I just find it it did puts you in a great place okay like it but I'm journal not topical its internal yeah topical is really good for muscle aches okay it's really good really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like a alleviating soreness and stiffness and stuff like that because I found I was yeah in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofens terrible for you alright really really bad what I found out was that if you let your pets lick it they get liver failure and die so don't did you guys accidentally didn't know I had a person who works at the Humane Society I mentioned you know mentioned that I found this stuff and like I just in desperation and Europe like she had some storm muscles

marathons he runs he's 240-mile Moab [ __ ] ridiculous runs that last three days and he was having like all this joint pain so he's taking ibuprofen every day of st. taking 800 milligrams not just once but sometimes twice a day and he was just constant aches and pains so dr. Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your gut biome and how much it [ __ ] you up and it actually creates inflammation and actually can cause stress or it can cause strokes rather and all sorts of horrible horrible things so I call him up and I said hey man that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache but you can't take that [ __ ] every day you just can't do it and you're you're [ __ ] your body up just get off of it and I sent him the recording he listened to it he's like Jesus Christ I don't have a stroke so he gets off of it all his pain goes away it turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen 2 times a day so the idea of like fixing himself was [ __ ] him up crazy death chasing that yeah yeah so [ __ ] ibuprofen okay well we don't I take it every now and then but you can't take it every day so you're a liar no I mean just saying don't take it every day but if I had like a bad headache I'll take you some Tylenol or some [ __ ] it's not Tylenol right

we're gonna test again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you get this and this oil right here get this then use our press-on material", "5fzZnbSDxY8": "hi everyone I'm Shireen the founder of my pain center calm hey we recently started carrying CBD shisha on our website and it has been flying off the shelves I guess during a pandemic such as this one corona virus everybody wants to smoke and so they they are moving towards a CBD shisha and the question I always get is like is it good does it work what does it feel like and so I thought I'd make a video because I I do smoke this all the time and I wanted to make sure you guys also knew what it feels like so I'll show you the I'll show you the puffing and all that stuff and the smoke that was my LexA but I don't know why I uh I grew up smoking she should I know that sounds weird but like not grew up grew up but like since a teenager so I would always smoke this one Al Fakher which is actually got tobacco and nicotine in it so the really good thing about these is there's no nicotine and there's no tobacco it's a hundred percent natural product 100% herbal two hundred milligrams of CBD which means there's two hundred milligrams of sous-vide in the entire packet and I get about six to eight uses out of this packet so you just do two hundred divided by six divided by eight I should have done the math before I turn this on it's like 25 finished milligrams of CBD per per serving of shisha I hope I did that math right today I'm going to I'm gonna test review our review product review mega mango and you might be wondering why am i doing mega mango well we've got we've got fizzy bubble we've got mega mango we've got double apple pink lemonade blueberry mint Just Peachy going great and mighty mint so drop it in the comments which one you want me to do a review on and I'll definitely do a review on it I'm gonna do mega mango because like I said I grew up smoking shisha and we smoked all the original flavors so like the top three were mint double apple and honey and so I don't want to test one of those out because you guys kind of know what those would already taste like and I love mangoes like I love a fresh mangos I love dried mangoes the spicing mangoes at Trader Joe's Iloka mango juice mango shake mango lassi I love mango anything so I thought doing a mango one would be a great way to kind of tell you guys how realistic the taste is and if it's if it's even tasty so here we go I'm gonna just unpack it for you it comes with a seal around it so you know nobody's messed with it so we'll break the seal off for you guys if I can got it it's a nice black container it's got the warning on the back it says do not operate heavy machinery after use keep away from children 200 milligrams of full-spectrum CBD hemp oil under 8 sale prohibited ingredients hemp oil honey glycerin camel molasses and flavoring made in the US and I saw somewhere maybe I'm not on this one oh I'm really on that on the packaging itself there is a barcode a QR code so you can get the certificate of analysis so when you open it up its packaged in there wow you can smell it like the minute you open the can it's like whoa it tastes like fresh mango like really does you ever been in on market oh my god I could smell this for days anyways it comes in this little plastic pouch just like this and what I really love about the plastic pouch that they give is that it's got a ziplock on it so it does close tightly again when you're done using it versus like when you smoke the tobacco one it kind of comes in a packet that you cut open and then once you cut it open it's on you to savor it likes make sure it doesn't spoil or get get hard so make sure you're always closing it back when you finish well so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pack my bowl I say that's additionally this this smells so good guide I forgot how it good this smells [Applause] [Music] so now you can see like the cool is lit it's on fire it's burning the she shows burning and you can see like the puffs the puffs are really big like and it's such a smooth inhale like if you're if you're familiar with smoking tobacco shisha you know and you've probably seen your friends do this the first time they smoke when you inhale sometimes if you inhale too much and it's not smooth you get this tickle in your throat and then you're trying not to cop in front of people you wanna be embarrassment happen with this this cvd shisha is so smooth even if you're novice you maybe only smoke before I guarantee I don't guarantee but you should not have that that tickle in your throat that coughing problem unless you do something weird when you're packing it thing but anyways that is your Mecca Bingo CBD shisha I love it it's such a smooth smooth inhale smooth exhale has that mango fresh taste like you literally feel like you're I don't know snorting mangos visit us at my pain center calm if you want to get some seedy shisha we've got all the flavors in stock let us know in the comments which one you'd like us to review next like I said be a fizzy bubble mango mega mango double apple pink lemonade blueberry mint Just Peachy going grape and my tea mint and as I said before I grew up smoking the traditional shisha flavors double apple and mint and honey so if you want to stick to the traditional flavors we've got the mint and we've got the double apple if you want to stray a little bit away but you're not not sure how far away you would astray I'd suggest a blueberry mint and then if you're just looking to have some fun try something new it's your first time trying to see shisha get whichever flavor really satisfies your palate like I love mango so I love smoking mega bingo but if you like pink lemonade eliminates and actually very interesting flavor as well just

long overdue product review so let's jump into it so several months ago you may have seen my review on hemp daddy's cbd oil and at the end of that review i promised that there would be much more reviews of hemp daddy products starting with the hemp daddy's transdermal cream transdermal cbd cream and obviously weeks have gone by i have not delivered on that promise so it's time to get into that today this will be kind of a quick and dirty review of just the essentials you need to know so if you didn't see my original review of the hemp daddy cbd oil i would check that out first just because i give a lot more information about the company in general and what really sets them apart as a product but for today we're just gonna focus on purely the benefits of this cbd transdermal cream if you're not familiar with cbd creams one of the first things i noticed about this is that it is a transdermal cream i didn't actually know what that meant and i realized a lot of the products that i've used in the past are actually topical creams so of course i looked it up to figure out what's the difference between topical and transdermal and basically what transdermal means is if you're rubbing it on your skin the cream is absorbing through the skin into the muscles into the body underneath the skin so you're feeling the impacts the effects of cbd not just on the specific area of skin that you apply the lotion but also beneath as well as it absorbs through the skin the topical creams on the other side are just going to absorb into the skin so you're only going to feel the effects of the cbd in the skin or on the skin as opposed to really absorbing into the body so just some vocab for you there and what i mean when i'm talking about trans durable cbd cream another thing that i mentioned in my last hemp daddy's product review is how i am certainly wary when i hear of all of the kind of cure-all claims that you get from a lot of different cbd companies so i do always appreciate that hemp daddy's is very upfront about the benefits you can expect to experience with their products and they also have a ton of research and different things published on their blog so you can get some more expert information on what you're getting yourself into so i just want to kind of give that as a caveat before jumping into this i'm not by any means trying to say that this is the cure-all for any illness any pain or anything like that what i will say is this is an excellent resource if you kind of have like a nagging i don't even necessarily want to say injury but kind of a nagging stiffness or soreness in a muscle or joint that's where i think this comes in handy because what the benefit that i have found from this is let's say after a particularly tough sprint workout and i personally experience like a um a con not constant but just a i often get a tightness or stiffness in my left calf specifically in my left calf i get it all the time especially like i said after particularly tough workouts so where i would use this is sometimes even before the workouts just to ease the strain on that leg but then after as well just to ease the inflammation it's not necessarily just masking the feeling of the inflammation so it's not encouraging you to train through pain but it just helps reduce it to allow you to continue to train and reduces that inflammation so hopefully you are not necessarily as much at risk for injury again these are just the the benefits that i personally experienced but that's where i think this really comes in handy as with kind of how i use all cbd products it just helps with overall maintenance as runners dealing with the inflammation the stiffness the soreness the joint pain the muscle aches etc that just come with the territory a lot of cbd products are just gonna kind of help to uh dampen the effects of that soreness or how you're feeling and kind of lower that inflammation just enough to allow you to train through it or to make it a little bit more comfortable i guess is a better way to put it make you a little bit more comfortable with that inflammation or make the inflammation a little bit more comfortable to train with i hope that makes sense i feel like that was a lot of words basically just to say that this is helpful as a tool but in no means should be used to just cure injuries but definitely definitely definitely can be helpful just to ease stiffness this especially was useful during the goggins challenge towards those later miles especially when i was really starting to feel stiff i would just put these this on before runs again just to kind of reduce that inflammation a bit to make it a little bit more comfortable for each consecutive run without the soreness building up to an unbearable amount that's sort of just a little bit about my take on the product i'll show you very quickly how it works it's very easy one thing i do appreciate is it gives you just kind of the recommended dose in the squeeze almost just like a little dime size or maybe nickel size bit of lotion there rubs into the skin nice and simple it's not greasy by any means uh it actually has a very nice scent to it it's unscented so it's just the natural scent of the cbd which i really like but just that little dollop is enough to pretty much cover the whole top of my forearm to get an idea of how much you need for any impacted area and it rubs in pretty quickly like i said you don't have a lot of the greasy excess just want to wipe it between my hands etc but very easy to use and a little goes a long way for larger muscle groups like when i was having stiffness in my thighs i would probably use like two to three squirts just to get a good amount of lotion around my whole leg again during more significant stress or more significant soreness that i was experiencing on especially those much larger muscle groups as i mentioned this is just a quick and dirty review i hope it gave you some beneficial information as i mentioned really what this is good for is just with all cbd products just the maintenance of your running routine and just helping to reduce the the negative impacts of the stress that we're putting on our body through this sport so the only thing that you can do is really check it out for yourself so if you are interested in checking out hemp daddy's transdermal cbd cream or any of their products go to their website hempdaddies.com i run on beer to let them know i sent you there and use the code i run on beer to save 15 on any order i mentioned at the top of the show i do work specifically with hemp daddy so if you order any of the products from their website using my code i earn a little bit of a commission off that it doesn't cost you any more it just helps me keep my website my youtube channel etc up and running and lets me celebrate an incredible product so thanks for tuning in i hope you enjoyed the review i would love to hear from you in the comments about benefits that you've had from cbd i think there is a lot more research to be done because i think there is a lot of benefits that maybe we haven't discovered or more ways to use cbd that maybe we're not tapping into yet so i'm always interested to hear about the experience others are having this has been my personal experience with hemp daddies i'm trying out the full range of their products so stay tuned for future reviews the next one coming up that i'm super excited about is the vaporized cbd that i've been using so stay tuned for that hopefully sooner than it took me to get out the review of the transdermal cream but really loving hemp daddy's products and loving adding cbd into my recovery routine so thanks for tuning in to another product review i hope you enjoyed it and let me know what you want to see from me in the future but until then i'll see you around cheers uh", "BBCDrNDF_N8": "matches my eyes hey guys and welcome to another ready review I'm Matt and this week we're gonna be reviewing hemp daddy's therapeutic hemp extract hemp daddies hip extract is a full-spectrum CBD oil which essentially means that it helps alleviate inflammation depression anxiety and helps with sleep so this is gonna be a little bit of a different review especially since this is CBD oil it's more of a supplement than it is actual gear so it's kind of different to gauge and I will give you my experience as best I can put it before working with hemp daddy truth be told I did not know a ton about CBD oil and its effects how it can help as a supplement but we had a chance to sit down with caleb simpson founder of hemp daddies he does go into full detail on the benefits of CBD oil and specifically how he himself came across it in his podcast episode of the reddy 80 podcast I highly recommend it we will link it up in the description below I had the chance to use this for about two weeks I was a little skeptical because this kind of stuff is something that I'm obviously haven't really used before especially CBD oil but I have to say has really helped with at least sleep that is the most immediate thing I've recognized I do feel a little less anxiety obviously we're up in Vermont so we're doing this big promotion there's been a ton of work as fun it has been and it is great it has been to kind of see the different mountains and just enjoy my time back in Vermont having the CBD oil to try out and get acclimated with and help alleviate some of my stress has been really really nice I would say that with this type of thing you might want to consult a doctor if you're thinking about getting CBD oil as a supplement keep in mind that it may affect different people different ways I don't think that I felt a very very distinct change but I just noticed certain patterns in my sleeping and just my stress level that I really do think this can be attributed to I did use the hemp extract twice daily for about two weeks I will say that it's kind of strange just drinking oil or ingesting oil but the mint flavor really does help to make it a little bit more enjoyable and it does taste like real mint it doesn't taste artificial or anything so it wasn't bad at all to take tailee in some cases I looked forward to it because it just makes your breath a little fresher if you get the mint flavor if you're someone who struggled with sleep or anxiety I would definitely recommend checking out hemp daddies I think it's really done a lot to help me out in the past two weeks and it could potentially help you out they do have a ton of information about CBD if you want to educate yourself and just get a little bit more acclimated to how it works I would definitely recommend that as well especially just jumping into anything new that you know might alter your brain chemistry or something like that obviously you're gonna want to read up on it they do have other CBD infused products they have capsules as well as a topical cream in addition to the hemp extract the topical cream is more for obviously like inflammation joint pain that kind of thing and the capsules are basically just the oil hemp extract just in capsule form that's it for my review of hemp daddy's therapeutics extract mint flavor don't forget to Like and subscribe to our Channel and check out the description for a link directly to hemp

next week", "fs4YpfxgblI": "Well, Buenos dias from San Felipe Mexico\nguys! Hope you're having a great day. It's Sunday for us.We just enjoyed a nice\nbreakfast here at Vintage cafe and crepas.. And... Not bad at all! Pretty darn good!...So here's the interesting thing...I really have no idea what we're gonna vlog about\ntoday. Do you have any ideas? Just life I guess. And see what happens...Let's see what the brings...We're good at that!... Well somebody needs a haircut\nand we bought this here at the bodega. And there wasn't a price on the shelf. So....\nI ended up paying like twenty-five dollars for this. I was thinking it might be like ten. Even\nthough we have some at Beck's mom's house. We thought... Yeah! Let's give her a\nhaircut here. The interesting thing is going to be seeing how the return process\nworks. I do have a receipt. Okay! well it looks like we're just gonna get in-house\ncredit! And yeah.... 20, 25 bucks no big deal! Because we do come to this Bodega quite\noften. Because they have a little bit of everything here. You know a lot of the\nstuff in this store is a.... Looks like it comes from Walmart. They have\neverything from scooters, washing machines and I think a great value is\nlike a Walmart brand. This is something quite fascinating! Every time an employee\nbuys something like a pack of gum or a drink, they scored it with a shot a\nspray-paint. I guess it's an effective way to secure your inventory. Well concerns have been expressed that\nthe toilet paper we bought last time is a bit rough. And this is the stuff we got\nfor twenty one pesos. And I have no idea what is gonna be better unless I use\nprice as like a factor. I don't know! This stuff is ahhh.... 20 peso! Sometimes you just have to live on the edge when it comes to toilet paper. I really would like to\ncheck this place out...They look closed because it's Sunday...Volunteers without limits! We spend enough time here that we would like to do some volunteer work and sometimes it can be tough\nfinding out where to. But we were referred to this place but... It's Sunday\nand they're not open! We'll have to come back. Look at all those motorcycles...Wow! Beautiful motorcycles to. You know this place is always busy. We\nneed to eat here one day. I'm like totally not hungry now but they're\nalways busy..... Good stuff! Guys this is a really.... Thank you for shaking on me!... Nice day here in San Felipe and the dogs need to get out and play.\nShelby, she's just gonna sand bathe. The dynamic between these dogs is pretty funny because the Springer, Gabe he loves to swim. The Border Collie Sichael, he will\nonly go out about to his chest. And then he gets all jealous that the puppies are\nout there. And just.... It's just a big game with these dogs!\nAnd then Shelby just likes hanging out on the beach. So this is all just a\nlittle bit of hearsay from, I think it was like Victor and Lily. But I guess at\none point they were anticipating cruise ships coming to San Felipe.So.... Some of\nthese ahhhh... Kind of more resort skyscraper looking buildings were developed and\nthen it got canceled out. So.... There's a lot of half-finished hotels. I,  It's like\na double-edged sword you know! You think it would be great for the economy for some cruise ships to come in. But yet it would change the whole dynamic of the town and probably take away some of the charm! Well we're gonna round this afternoon\nout with a trip to the sweet spot.They're not always open but Monica yesterday\nsaid that they have really good margaritas! You guys are a salt on the rim type of\nperson or a no salt? I just love that contrast with the salt... Well you gotta get a little sampler platter to soak up the alcohol. This little dog\nis getting mighty hungry right now! She's taking a couple whips off just in the\nhopes that she'll get some food. I am so glad we ordered a little bit of food...\nBecause these guys, they snuck some alcohol into that picture Margherita's!...Oh oh! Mom's intoxicated! Fortunately grandma had some dog food in her trunk. We attained the monster! Mom what are you doing ordering a whole slab of ribs?...That's what we are having for dinner....We are hungry! Seriously this has to be the best\nhomemade potato salad I've had in a long time! I think mom just didn't want us\ndriving intoxicated. So she knew we had to like soak up the alcohol! Wow! And we also just totally hung out with\nVincent the chef here...He's awesome...Yeah....The Sweet Spot.... Worth your ahhhh... Stop here in San Felipe! Alright guys! I got to give you a shout-out on my youtube channel because this food is great! We have Vincent.... What's happening?....DeAndre!...\nDeAndre... Quincy and this is the guy that adds tequila to those margaritas.\nHey! Great meal guys! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you for coming...You gotta love leftovers...I like the oranges...And grandma wants the oranges. I'm not safe to drive right now! That CBD oil must\nreally be giving her the munchies. Because.... Shelby has not let up.She is\nwanting all of what we are having... Our dog is a weed freak!...There's worse things to be in life.... But on\na very serious note! We have started Shelby be on CBD oil. Which is the\nnon-intoxicating, anti inflammatory aspect of hemp or marijuana whatever...And she has like an autoimmune condition with her spinal cord where it's all\ninflamed. And it has just been amazing! We've seen this burst of life come back\nto her personality! Like she's getting into shit and stirring up trouble. That's\nthe Shelby we know and love!...Like before she wouldn't be stirring stuff up! Like\nit really warms our heart to know that this CBDoil D oil... CBD oil is really\nhelping her. And if you guys have a dog with some type of an issue related to\ninflammation, I would highly recommend giving it a shot! And you can get it in\nall 50 states guys.... I think we found our designated driver! Ah Sitka, He's a good boy! Well, when the music is good and the\nseats are comfortable and the margaritas taste good.... There's just no reason to go\nhome! So.... We're gonna finish out here for the\nday. But be sure to hit that subscribe button because I'm sure we're gonna be\nup to something fun tomorrow! And....Thanks for joining us! Hope you have an awesome day. See you next time! Bye!", "XVvFltuYKSk": "took it away I'm excited that I would conduct a little experiment and try taking hemp oil every single day for seven days and kind of just like see the effects that had on my body I've always been into things like hemp seeds and hemp oil and everything it just feels skin because I know that it is so so good for your skin hair nails all that kind of stuff but obviously taking in oil is so much more concentrated and like you'll be able to see the effects and the results those are much more so I was very very keen to kind of like see if I would see any changes or notice any changes and some of the benefits of consuming hemp oil is hemp oil contains a large amount of antioxidants and healthy omega 3 to 6 fatty acids it's great for cooking hair skin beauty and minor pain and stress relief and it says here that the full spectrum hemp oil which is what I talked they also help with general stress and tension in the muscles like fatty acids CBD has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body which may help relieve the tension that many people carry from stress and promote recovery from exercise it also says that have oil can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles as well as prevent signs of aging from developing so I was super super intrigued to try it because for me like even working out stresses out anybody quite a lot and like stuffs on my horns and can break me out and everything so I was really really hoping that it would help my body to relax and that I could hopefully sleep better clear my skin and also recover better from my workouts so as I said the oil every single day for seven days I filmed a little updates every single day just kind of like showing you what I'm doing and giving you tiny little updates throughout it I'll put a picture here of what my skin is looking like today it is broken out so badly I'm not sure if it's because it's my time of the month I've been wearing makeup quite a bit lately and not washing my brushes computers into so I'm very intrigued to see if this does hulk's I've heard a lot of people saying that hemp and CBD oil can help that skin so it says take ten pumps and hold in mouth for 30 seconds before swallowing okay so ten pumps holding mouth for thirty seconds oh okay I currently describe the taste like kind of not bad but kind of not good definitely not as bad as half off like the whole mixtures I've taken to clear my skin in the past so yep that's day one done I'm excited to see what its gonna be like this time next week sorry it's not the best angle I'm currently do you know I'm doing yeah you guys yeah you're doing the the the broad spectrum thang I'm taking this Hampton extract is a broad spectrum yeah I was feeling sorry shitty last night and I had this madness II woke up feeling so much better so I'm not sure I feel just like a good night's sleep or if this had if this played a partner cuz I've read that it can like boost your immune system and stuff so a little bit of a sniffling no so hopefully if I have it again it'll just like kick it also my skin like basically I haven't really been having that many more breakouts just apart from that one John some to write in the mail not bad really what to do he's looking jealous I can't hold it in your mouth a second all right so that's the folder on about so far like I think I've had a bit more energy about saying yes if you're great I feel great instantly okay so time for my hemp all right ready it is day six today and I'm not sure if it's a placebo effect or not but I genuinely feel so much less bloated and like somewhat leaner and like I haven't changed my diet or workout routine at all in the past week because I wanted to just like really see the results of this so I'm not really sure if that is it from the hemp oil or not but you know what I'll take it though second last day today I'm actually really really excited to kind of give a whole update after the entire week because I definitely definitely have noticed like a significant amount of changes in my marine health like how quickly I recovered after that like cold or like how unwell I was feeling also my skin I feel like has improved a lot so excited to see like a full update at the end but anyway alright it is now day seven of it taking the hemp oil so I'm gonna take it to for the last time now and I think I will sit down tomorrow and feel like my entire like results just to make sure that it's been a whole entire week and so I can get like the full results of taking the hemp oil for seven days straight is it weird that I kind of like the taste no then here we is now day 8 to genuinely like I am so shocked about the results that I saw I'm not sure if you can see very well and obviously I do have makeup on right now but my skin has improved so much like around my time a month I always break out all around here and usually get like really bad pimples all around my cheeks and genuinely right now I've got like one here I'm honestly just like so shocked at like this could actually be helping my skin also because him is good for your immune system I was so incredibly shocked that I felt so sick like so just like she knew and you're like starting to get a cold and you just like feel it shooting in the head and I was feeling really like dizzy and I could just tell those getting cold I was so shocked that the next day I woke up feeling so so much better and usually like when I start getting those symptoms there's not really a whole lot that I can do like I can go to bed early and I can eat healthy but cold usually still comes even if it's when they [ __ ] a few days and I was just like a seriously mind-blowing the fact that it just like took it away third major difference that I noticed was my bloating I definitely experienced quite bad bloating and it's legitimately gone down so so much I just like feel quite a bit leaner which is weird because as I said I haven't changed anything in my diet or my workout routine at all last week and I can honestly just put it down to the fact that it does help with stress and I know that stress obviously is not good for the body and and can often make us retain fat and like get bloating everything that has also actually been studies that's shown that it can help with weight loss as well so maybe that played a role in it as well but honestly just the fact that it helps with my skin and my bloating and my immune system like I'm genuinely I didn't really just like can't believe how much it has done in the past 7 days and like what it would do if I kept taking it every single day so they have oil that I took was there's never emulsified broad-spectrum heme extract and what I like most about this brand in there of the supplement is that it says here that Symphony has a very low bioavailability meaning is very hard for the body to absorb it this is one most CBD supplements do not work to make sure you feel calm Quicksilver scientific which is the brand infuses CBD with a lipid to make sure the CBD gets into the bloodstream and also actually one more thing that I noticed was I had it every night before bed and I actually really really noticed a difference in me getting to sleep because usually me getting to sleep like it takes me at least half an hour to 45 minutes because I'm constantly thinking like that what I need to do usually youtube video ideas like my mind it's just gone crazy ever possibly I would say that and for the past week I would say that I probably fell asleep within the first 10 to 15 minutes actually just some study and it says CBD can help with acne due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties CBD can help treat a multiple of skin conditions it's anti-inflammatory properties help to reduce any redness and swollen areas so as I mentioned before I use the brand Quicksilver scientific and as I didn't mention it is very important to get a good quality one because a lot of them don't really show any results and organic is definitely best as well and they have actually kindly enough given me a discount code to share with you or if you would like to try at home well and that is save fire which will give you 5% off your order I am 100% going to be repurchasing this like I just think it's really really cool and as I said like I've seen those results from seven days I'm taking you I can imagine what it could do after like a few months I'm taking it could this be the answer to clearing my skin I don't know so yeah that was my seven-day hemp oil experiment I will leave in the description a link if you do want to check out this one that I did use obviously really recommend giving it a go even if it's just like an experiment like I didn't see kind of the results that it has on your body yeah I really really hope you have enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you did and also let me know if you want me to do kind of like more experimental videos because I love like not challenges but just like experimenting things a little like challenges see how they affect my health and see like what they can do in like a short amount of time but I'll also definitely keep you updated with how I'm going with it after light a few weeks and then a few months and see if the results kind of like keep going or if it just kind of like stabilizes a yeah anyway I really really hope you have enjoyed again and I would see in my next year", "8gBX5sbaa3Q": "woohoo first 45 mile week in a long time that's what i'm talking about i even got a peek day in and seriously it would not be possible without this [Music] hey y'all welcome back to biz live i'm vivian camille and today we are talking about hemp daddy's transdermal cbd cream this stuff right here is no joke i am not kidding when i say this has been the difference between me going out for a run and me not going for a run um with how effective it has been for me cbd was not something on my radar i really was not comfortable ingesting it so when caleb who is the owner and founder of this company reached out to me i said you know i'll give the cream a try and see how that is and i'm really thankful i did because like i said this has been the difference between me going for a run and me not being able to finish my run due to my knee and hip injuries and so this pretty much just like alleviates the pain and allows me to push through those runs i think it's a combination of this cream and just my body healing itself but i know that this makes a big difference caleb sent this to me for free in return i make a review video um however i didn't feel comfortable making a full review video based off of one cbd experience so i've tried two or three others to get a better idea of how topical cbd works and to better review this one and compare it to kind of the others i tried one that had like magnesium in it and like a cooling cream in it and it was good it worked well but it just it like ran down my knees there was like dripping wetness that would run down my knees as i ran and i didn't like that that was really uncomfortable another one i tried was a little cream that went on and it didn't work at all i didn't see any difference when i went running and the third one i tried was also a cream of sorts the first one that magnesium one was a roll-on kind of one but the third cream i tried it worked all right but it was like a lotion and again it like it stayed on top of my skin so when i started sweating when i ran it began to sweat off it didn't drip as bad as the roll-on magnesium one but it was like a lotion and if you've ever run with lotion on in the sun in the summer in tucson that's like the worst feeling on the planet i didn't know there was such a wide spectrum of cbd this one is the best i've found or i guess i could say this is the best one that found me um i met caleb at band at the bandera 100k and he kind of introduced me to his cbd company i figured out that it's all organic and it is tested by a third party to make sure that everything is consistent and the batches are all the same if you don't know a whole lot about cbd and are considering whether or not it could be a good thing for you he has a youtube channel i think it's called hemp daddy's i'll link that down below you can check out and he's got some really good informational videos that kind of explain it explain what it does explain the process and what have you so this hemp daddy transdermal cream the reason that it rises above all the others is number one because it actually works the first and foremost thing that i love about this is that it actually absorbs into my skin the importance of that is number one i don't feel like i have a second layer of skin on me my knee which has the cbd on it right now and my shin which doesn't they feel almost identical it's not like a gross layer there's no fragrance to this there's no dye in this there's no added anything it's just the cream and it absorbs really well the second reason why that's important is because it actually works some of the other creams i tried didn't really work at all this i put on about five to ten minutes before i go out on a run and within that time this stuff is jiving i mean i start like i am able to run and i think it lasts i'd say probably two hours on some of my long runs i've brought it with me and reapplied um but it works really well it works quickly and it absorbs into the skin there is 10 milligrams of cbd per pump this is the extra strength it's called extra strength for a reason it works i'll show you what you get in one pump you get that much sumo so i usually do one pump for both of my knees and then i kind of spread it out to the back of my legs um and then i do one pump for my hip to make sure that i am covered and that i don't have any problems um a lot of people use this for recovery after their run and they've said that it's helped them with their recovery but um i kind of use it as liquid gold and so i just use it on my run so that i can make sure i get through that run another reason why this is such a good product is that there are two ingredients in it lipoderm and hemp extract and hemp extract is number one there's about 60 servings in here i've been very disappointed with the other cbd i tried so if you know a product works then you stick with it so i am very very excited to share this product with you if you want a discount i will link a code down below and you're welcome to use that do your own research always um this is my review this is my experience with the cbd i would tell anyone who's comfortable using it to use this one because it actually works and it's third party sourced and it's organic and it's from colorado hand-picked family farm and those are all reasons why i would support this product and i'm endorsing it now but like i said do your own research try out different cbd figure out the one that works best for you but if you're interested in this one you can check that out with a link down below thank y'all so much for watching really appreciate it thank you for supporting my channel please like this video and subscribe if you're interested in more fun videos they're not all review videos but when i find something i like i enjoy sharing it so yeah you'll have a wonderful rest of the week i'll see you next week and happy trails yeah my knees feel unstoppable oh yeah i also came up with a jingle it's more of a wrap jingle goes like this hip daddies cbd and in the midst of that you can do a little bit of this him daddy's cbd hip daddy's cbd because your knees feel so good yeah um", "n3EFvI1Ij4s": "[Music] hi there welcome back to the cannabis kitchen today we're actually going to make something a little more fun we're going to make some CBD oil back bombs so bath bombs with CBD oil are very relaxing even people that don't have pain issues or whatever really enjoy using them so let's get started what we're gonna do first is use this big bowl I like it to be a little bit flat just so I can reach better when I'm actually shaping the balls and you're gonna need this strainer I like to use a metal one I find the plastic ones break pretty easily on me to wait so we're gonna start off by running our dry ingredients right through this just so that there's no lumps and bumps that we have to get out later on it's just kind of a pain in the butt and that way we have good consistent back bombs so we're gonna start out by adding 2 cups of baking soda and we're just gonna run that right through use your hands it's not a big deal I always wear gloves I find the citric acid it's a little bit hard on my hands and just run that through get all the lumps through add your next ingredient so the next thing we're going to add is a cup of citric acid and this one is almost this consistency of like a fine salt so it does take sometimes a little more work to get it through the strainer but it gets through there and it's worth it in the end as you can see there's quite a few bumps and lumps and stuff in there so you want to make sure we get all that out and you meup with bumps at the end you can run as much of it through as you can if you have any leftovers you can throw them out but for the most part we've got all of it here so now we have other ingredients that aren't going to require the strainer but we have one more to do first and that is a quarter cup of every room powder obviously I buy it in large quantities because I make a lot of these but I have some linked because we're gonna run this through there now so all our dry ingredients are in here we're going to give them a good mix together and then we're going to add in a quarter cup of salt so the salt you can use is you can use Epsom salts you can use pink Himalayan sea salt you can use regular sea salt you can use dead sea salt sometimes the dead sea salt comes in pretty big granules and it kind of looks pretty but it's a little harder to get your hands on today I'm going to use fine pink Himalayan sea salt you can use this in your food too which is nice less sodium so we're gonna take that mix it around now if we weren't putting any color at all into these bath bombs they would it would be really pretty having this pink sea salt in here I don't know if you can really see it's got you can see all the little pink crystals in there but we're gonna add some color the air so I'm going to use this color I got from crazy colors it's a little tiny when I wasn't sure on the color so I just ordered a little one but um this is the royal blue this is from crazy colors and they do a very good job with their color it now color is really up to you you can use as much or as little as you want I don't think you need to go to bananas I'm going to use just shy of a half a teaspoon and we'll see how that looks they're very very concentrated so you generally don't need to use a whole lot which is nice so we're gonna just mix this all together it does look like a very pretty color it's gonna actually get a little bit darker once we wet put our wet ingredients in so you're just gonna mix this around until you don't see any white powder anymore just then we know that it's well mixed there we go okay so now we're gonna add our wet ingredients which would be CBD oil and scent so what I did I wanted something a little bit more earthy so I used a half of a tablespoon of patchouli oil and I used a half a tablespoon of sandalwood and amber the other thing you're going to need is some high strength CBD oil when I make bath bombs I like a higher strength because you can't use a lot of oil or it's gonna ruin your bath bombs they won't set so I like to use a really high strain so that I can use a smaller amount of oil so I use two tablespoons of CBD oil in this one I don't recommend using any more than that unless of course you're making a recipe bigger if you double the recipe you can double your oils so I have two sandalwood and amber the patchouli and the CBD oil all mixed in this little cup so we're just gonna pour it in just like that get all that goodness out there we go alright and we're gonna mix this around now so we need to mix this really really well there cannot be anything that's not mixed so anywhere where those dry ingredients get your hands in there and give it a really good stir this is definitely a hands-on type of project you can use your mixer I use my mixer all the time but for the purposes of people that may not have a mixer especially a stand mixer I'm just gonna use my hands and it works just as well it just takes a little bit longer there we go so we've got that all mixed up this looks pretty good the consistency is not bad as you can see it's a little bit dry when I squeeze my hands together it should stick and it's kind of coming apart a little bit so we know that we're gonna need some witch hazel you can use a spray bottle that tends to work the best or you can use just put a little bit in a spoon and just slowly put it in I have I'm just gonna use one without a spray bottle on it so we're just gonna add this a little little bit at a time I've got a little spoon here I'm just gonna spoon it in the thing with witch hazel is that when it touches the solution you can see it's kind of starting to bubble a little bit so it's very important that you start stirring it right away because you don't want to activate your bath bombs before you get them in the backside of it so you put a little bit in as spritzer works fine usually that's actually how I do it but I also go through a lot of witch hazel so might have it big giant bottles all right so this consistency looks pretty good so what we're gonna do now is we're going to get our molds so these molds I use quite often I actually have a press as well but that's a whole other story so your bath bombs will be about this big so you drop in the tub it's not too much it's gonna smell lovely and if you get to go you can also use I don't know if you've seen them but you can use the plastic Christmas ornament balls and you can get them at Michael's or they have to sell them on Amazon as well I have links to everything you need to make these including the metal and the plastic bath bomb molds on the Canadian weed forum website so if you go there go to the recipe section every ingredient has a link to pick it up on Amazon that sometimes the easiest place to find all your ingredients some are harder to find that other citric acid I find a little bit hard at least in my area to find locally so it's much easier for me to order it from a distributor or in a smaller batch on Amazon so let's get started doing our bath bombs so we're just gonna take a bomb we're gonna squish it a little bit flat you don't go too tight but you want it to be overfilled okay then you're gonna take the other side and overfill that as well so now you take your two sides you squish them together give them a little bit of a twist when you hear them touching you know that it's nice and tight and closed so now we gotta get this thing out of here so what I do is I use a spoon I tap on my mold both sides not too hard dent your molds and there we go flip it over pop the top off and there you go you've got a beautiful CVD bath bomb and here we go now if you want to be really tidy about it you can clean your edges off as well so as you can see on these ones they've got a little bit of what's called they call it in a Saturn ring which is a little ring around it but you can take that off as well I like to keep it on I don't think it matters either way so but we'll make one this one I'll make it and we'll clean off the edges a little bit just so you can see a difference [Music] that top they're so getting your outside or your edge off it's pretty easy you just push on your edges and they'll either partially fall off or they'll just get stick right back into your backbone so you'll still have that Ridge there but that's okay it is a little bit neater looking this way so what you want to do too is just keep checking your consistency if you're finding that they're not sticking together as well then you're going to want to adjust and put a little bit more witch hazel in if you need to now if you don't want to order these molds you all certainly don't have to there's lots of things you can use as molds you can make your own you can make them look like pucks cut the bottom of a Pringles container up or something like that you can use muffin trays although if you're going to use muffin trays I do find it's a little bit harder to get them out so basically what you'll need to do is once they're made you're gonna just leave them in the mold you're gonna let them set and then you're gonna take them out of the mold flip them upside down tap on the bottoms lift up the tray and that will release your will ear balls for you well I guess they would be more like pucks wouldn't they all right there will clean these edges again just so you can see what I'm doing here all I'm really doing is I'm just pressing really lately on this outside edge that just cleans it out just a little bit there [Music] perfect here we go so we got seven bombs out of this recipe but like I said you can double it triple it as much as you want if you're making a really big batch though you're gonna really need to keep your eye on the consistency you want to make sure that when you squeeze it and you pull your hand away that fat piece sticks together once you start finding that it's starting to fall apart a little bit more witch hazel and you do that any time it's not a problem at all and then you can make as many as you want so the other thing you can do is play with color or split your mixture in half you can do half white half blue or half pink and half green or whatever you like the possibilities are endless you can split your batch once you've made it before you add your color you can just split your mix into as many bowls as you want and add a little bit of color into each each about them and they look really pretty when they're done so what we'll do next is we're gonna leave these bombs to sit overnight 12 hours is about all you need if it's a little bit humid in your area today our weather is it looks like it's going to be a little bit rainy today so what I'll probably do is we'll put a fan on them just to keep them drying very nicely otherwise they take a lot longer to set if it's humid outside or if it's wet or damp so we'll put a fan on them we'll leave them overnight and then wrap them up and give them to our friends or keep them for ourselves or put them in the bathroom so to wrap them is very easy the easiest way to do it is to put them in some plastic wrap just wrap them up or you can put them by some pretty little candy bags at a dollar store they're very cheap I think you get I don't know 20 of them or something for a dollar and you can just wrap them up and tie up the tops and give away as presents especially Christmas coming it's a good opportunity to get some stuff made for people stockings so what we'll do now is I will go fill this bottle and we'll try one of these bath bombs just you can get an idea of what it looks like when it's they're all done in when they're in your tub so buddy I don't have a tub here so we're gonna use this big bowl I'll fill it with water and we'll drop one about bombs in and see how it looks all right so let's drop one of these bath bombs in look how pretty [Music] look at that disappeared so the water is a beautiful color it looks super nice you can see some of the oils a little bit sitting on top there are ingredients you can add if you want that to dissipate you would add an ingredient called polysorbate 80 that's a little harder to get your hands on if you need to just message me in the on the website in the recipe section and I will send you a link to buy it if you need to but all in all you're sitting in the tub you've got beautiful blue water you've got lots of the CBD oil we're just going to make you feel phenomenal you can't ask for much more than that alright so you got to see how we made the bath bombs you see how love out there when you're fit when you're finished with them technically you can use these right away but you do want them to be a little bit harder because otherwise they'll get a little bit denty and they won't look so pretty but if you are dying to have a bath and you want to try these out and you make them and you haven't let them sit that's totally okay if you use them for yourself go ahead and throw it in the tub and enjoy your soak and if not let them sit overnight they should have a pretty hard consistency when they're ready to go and you know wrap them up give them to friends saving for later whatever you like to do store them in a fairly dry area if you can it is they will keep a little bit longer if you rock them up even if you're keeping them for yourself wrap them up in a bag wrap in a zip wrap them up in some saran wrap whatever works for you but wrap them up keep the moisture off of them keep the moisture away from them Stormin mason jars I'm sure you've got lots of those around and if not throw them on the table and enjoy

you please remember to give me a thumbs up but if you completed this video and was happy with it please also remember to give me a thumbs up so in this video I'm going to be talking about cannabis oil but CBD oil and CBD oil so kind of is oil is known to be illegal but I am going to be reviewing a substance that comes from cannabis oil which is legal so you know cannabis oil is known for making people feel so this is a form of the cannabis plant is extracted from the cannabis plant but they haven't extracted the form that makes you feel high or they have and they've removed it from the CBD oil which is why it is legal so I am going to be talking about the love CBD oil brand and it's a Dutch friend and it states that cannabis food supplement which is in 300 mg it's a CBD and CBD oil so CBD oil is known for helping manage anxiety depression insomnia social anxiety pain relief it's really good if you have arthritis and what the CBD oil does it helps with hormones in your body it helps with hormone regulation and our brains produce something called serotonin which is like a happy hormone in our brain and the CBD oil is known to help that feeling or hormone last a lot longer you know that hormone is usually there with me feel happy and giddy and confident and everything just going well and our bodies just intertwine with each other our organs intertwine you know everything's just blowing amazing but you know our bodies are known for kind of feeling down and drowsy and sometimes they do for like that and we just don't know why sometimes you know sometimes nothing's wrong but we just feel down but it could be down to so much factors like food well we eat the pollution free radicals sub conscious or subconscious mind anything so CBD oil is really good for some of those things as I said insomnia if you have trouble sleeping if you have trouble being in crowds in places of lots of people you know CBD are definitely really good for you another thing that is good I was using ashwagandha reishi they're really good for depression and anxiety and just help it relax your muscles but there is some more I'm loving the CBD oil and the reason why I purchased it is because it's so super easy and there's so much things about CBD oil that we do not know so apparently the CBD oil steli la plante structure is very similar to our body's structure to our to the genetic we know that the body makes up so if you look at a human cell under a microscope apparently it looks very similar to the cannabis plant that's why when we take CBD oil it it helps it works with our body so well because the cellular structure of it is so similarly i dint achill to our bodies it's amazing so that's I think that's one of the reasons why it works with our bodies so so well so this one that I have purchased is 300 mg as I said it had kind of this extract and olive oil if it just had the full kind of extract it would be way too strong so they need to had a carrier oil with this which they added a little bit of olive oil it says shake well before use which I do it's 2299 for 300 mg and 20 mil which i think is okay so if you is going to purchase 1000 mg it would cost you about 50 something pounds so that's the kind of price range well if you know so I'm going to tell you about the dosage those are the dosage it says take one spray day me for free days if needed slow we build up to a maximum of free sprays taken three times a day so if I take this three sprays one time a day remember for the first few days you take one spray three times a day sorry that would give me three six nine nine hundred mg for the whole day but it says after the three days you can take a maximum of three sprays three times a day that will give me a maximum of 2,700 mg for that day 2,700 mg for that day so if you purchase one that is a maximum of 300 mg you probably will be instructed to not take as much so if you've purchased 1000 mg you're probably instructed to take this once a day maybe free sprays once a day or maybe twice a day maybe one spray a day so don't always think you need to get a higher mg don't always feel like you have to get a higher dosage of something because if this was a lower dosage I'm sure it will tell you to take less so as I said it cost me 20 299 and I've only taken one spray three times a day and I've noticed a complete difference my sleep has been amazing I haven't woke up in the middle of the night I feel so much more relaxed my muscles feel so much more relaxed I feel like I can speak better I feel confident I feel amazing so that that's how I'm gonna put it cuz that's how I feel that's how it's made me feel and I've noticed how I was feeling before taking this CBD oil and I've noticed how I feel after taking the CBD oil and I have noticed a significant difference so I definitely would recommend this another reason why I recommend this because it comes in a spray form like my vitamin D spray which it's just so like when you're out when you're on the move when you're on the go when you're busy when you have things to do you don't have time to get a cup of water and a tablet and open the tablet and drink it down like we don't have time for that and on top of that you don't really want people knowing your business like what you're taking my on what are you taking I'm taking so what so and so and so okay I want to take that too and the person doesn't even know anything about it they don't know if it's good for you for them you know so definitely I think it's great because you can just open it spreading your tongue and you're off another thing is you don't need to take these things with food usually when you take the sprays they absorb right into the glands and they get into the bloodstream so much easier you don't have to take it as a tablet your body doesn't have to break it down it's not being exposed to acids that are used to break down the food it's so convenient they're a bit more pricey I take it sprays but they're definitely worth it and I definitely would recommend CBD oil because I'm only been using it for about four days now and I've noticed a significant difference like my sleep is so much better I feel less anxiety I feel less social anxiety I didn't I wasn't feeling like depressed or anything anyway but I just have like a happy hormone where I'm just like I feel amazing I feel amazing I feel amazing so I definitely would have recommend this so yeah it's by the brand love CBD it's a Dutch band and we just say how long I've been talking it's a Dutch brand and it's a form of cannabis it comes from the cannabis plant but they have extracted the substance that makes you feel high as I said so it is legal you know you can put this I purchased this in my local house store so it's fine it's safe and it comes in a lot of different forms you can get in a bomb like for pain relief and the bomb I was going to get for like period pains but I may get that in the near future so I'm really really loving the CBD oil you know it's great it's been working well for me and it's worked so fast and so quickly and I think one of the reasons why it's because it's got into my bloodstream a lot quicker because it's a spray foam and I just think it's really really good and I think I told you you get 20 mil and because you just I'm gonna use like free time today I think this is gonna last forever I'm really loving this CBD oil I'm definitely gonna put the information in the description below and as I said it's good for anxiety it's good for depression it's good for cardiovascular health it's good for it's also good for acne apparently just do some research but apparently like a load of people said that they use CBD oil for their skin and for the acne and it like helped them and it cleared it up and not just from the outside from the inside and I know you can use CBD oil on your skin this one doesn't really say you can use on your skin but if you can take the internally you can use on your skin it is quite strong I mean it's strong because I have had hemp oil before which is another form of the kind of is plant and I use the hemp oil for kicking and spitting on my salads and it does it does very much taste like hemp oil but it has a stronger taste it's a bit more potent and it has a burning kind of sensation but that's the way to know that is CBD oil it's a lot stronger and you feel that burning sensation I think that's amazing because you can tell that it differentiates from hemp oil and you can tell that it contains CBD and CBD oil and I thought the difference already and well you know yeah and I knew I would for the difference but maybe not so quick but I felt the difference so this is definitely amazing if you're suffering from any kind of social site or anything I definitely would recommend this so it helps our bodies just be back in tune with itself it helps our organs to be in tune it helps relax awesome when our body and our muscles are relaxed so much things are less noticeable like that on the unimportant things and our bodies are a lot more relaxed we feel much more confident and we feel amazing we can get on with my life so much better we can do more we can manifest better so I definitely would recommend this CBD oil so that completes my video guys thanks again so much for watching if you want any more information about my CBD oil I'll put it in the link below well not the mick below I put it in the description below but if you want any more information just remember to comment and I'll all be always be there to reply thanks again for watching this video please remember to keep your thumbs up and I'll see you next video", "fvnv4EP8rfQ": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Brittany and if you're new here feel free to subscribe if you'd like in today's video I'm gonna be sharing with you about the Charlotte's Web CBD gummies I bought these a week and a half ago at Bailey's gym I seen that they sell these I thought cool I've been wanting to try to show this web for a while I've never gotten the courage to actually purchase it because they're a little bit pricey but this is a lemon-lime flavor it is 10 milligrams per gummy so the serving size recommends too so that's 20 milligrams it's hemp extract infused gummies it has 25 calories 6 grams of carbs total sugar 3 grams sodium 10 milligrams it has lemon balm L thenen and the hemp extracts these come in a variation this is calm I use these for anxiety they also have post gym recovery and for sleep so I have tried these and I'm gonna share with you what I like about on what I don't really like about them and if I'm gonna continue using these and if they help me what I like about these is they actually taste like candy which is kind of well it's kind of scary but it's pretty cool they taste like sweet tarts if you ever have sweet tarts are very bitter and sour they look like these yes it's like little candies it's cut they're cute squishy they're like gummy bears what I also like is there portioned really well so you're not gonna go over or under if you're doing those drops those drops like you can easily take a little bit more take a bit less and say well I don't feel good today you might have not taken enough or so have you so these are portioned really well you could tell if they're working for you based on the recommended serving size because you know you're getting the exact amount I also like how it gives a very leveled calm it's very leveled you don't feel really hard and you don't feel really anxious you're just kinda in the middle I use these and I go to the gym I go out and about it makes me kind of want to like go do something and I'm a little more chatty on them I'll talk more I like that about them what I don't like about these well for one I don't like their price this is $54 I got these for much cheaper because they were on sale but you know this is why I didn't buy them from the get-go online because of their price so honestly I think they should be cheaper that's just me another thing is they don't they don't help on a bed and anxiety day when I'm really anxious they don't do much I don't know if it's just because I'm not taking enough milligrams maybe I need to take more but personally I wanted to go based on the serving size that they recommended and even stuff I don't see a very big change I would say but that's just me I mean everybody is different who knows you know it might work for one person but for me it's kind of just a little boost a little boost it's not enough for me to be like wow these gummies are perfect for me they're not they are not unfortunately they're great like if I'm having a pretty good day and not really anxious I just want to get out and need a little pick-me-up or something just want to feel calm just relax nothing's really bothering me this helps relax you a little bit but for me these are not strong enough and I just don't want to run through these because they're not cheap so why would I want to take more than what would last me maybe a month so it's definitely hard because CVV is not cheap it is pretty pricey and there's so many CBD companies to choose from I just want to give you my honest take on how I feel about these so that you don't go out and get it for the sole purpose of severe anxiety and stuff like that because for me on my bad anxiety days these do not cut it on a good day these are great because I still have energy I want to talk I want to like get up and get out but are these my favorite no they are not my favorite but to each their own please subscribe and like my videos thank you for watching today in the future I will be posting more CBD videos I've been trying a bunch out lately so stay tuned but till next time bye guys", "xl63tar39F0": "today i'm processing my roots or at least i'm getting them out of the ground if you're going to use roots you want to make sure you clean them really good these are there's just the main roots i didn't take any of the uh the uh the strings it was just too hard to get out of the ground oh my gosh it took me forever to get this out but these are nice uh thicker roots that i can uh def i'll definitely use um i will be close to the video on uh what i do with them um i make sobs and i uh actually eat them i use it in uh with coconut oil and i put in my coffee every single day except saturday and sunday which uh i give my body a break but it does amazing things and i will share that with you so don't throw away your roots keep them bad boys they got to be uh dried hung up and dried and then i'll cut it off bro that good stuff is all right happy growing everybody since uh you have now washed and dried your roots they need to be really washed and dried and if you have grown organically if you've been using salt-based um nutrients i probably wouldn't do this if you're going to put this on your body or in your body you you want organic roots are filters for your plant and basically it's in your soil it's bringing up in into your roots so make sure that uh you are organically based what i do is i break my roots down i've got me uh these fisca big o clipper dills but basically you just cut your your roots down into the smallest pieces you can get and then what i'll do is i'll put mine in this uh mortar and pulse stone granite whatever it is and try to get this as powdery as possible so you're going to have all sizes um whatever you have if you have a little um ninja food processor thing that'll work too but you want to get it as fine and as powdery as you could possibly do i don't know these words um the words uh the scientific chemicals that i'm going to put up on the screen so you can see it but one is for protecting your liver and the other is um a cancer killer and what this cancer killer does it sends a signal to the to the cancer cell tells it to commit suicide it um hypothesis i think is what um what it causes and that's like say if you have a a tadpole when a tadpole turns into a frog it sends a positive this chemical to the tail to tell it to die and then that's how the frog will lose its tail basically does the same thing to a cancer cell cancer cells don't have the trigger that tells it when it's damaged to kill itself it just doesn't do that so what this does will do that i am not a doctor i i can't tell you um i don't want to tell you you know eat this stuff um how i do it is uh you need get a get from you know talk to your doctor if you're if you're in a situation where you got cancer or something i don't want it to ruin anything like say i i can only tell you what i've been doing um i put it in in coconut oil and then uh once it's extracted out i pour that coconut oil into a little jar i take take a teaspoon every day in my coffee except for saturday and sunday which i give my body a rest so i work i have it in my coffee i just put a scoop in there and then you need a creamer of some type like a powder creamer that it'll attach to easier for your body absorb if you're going to use in sauce i take that same um coconut oil and i will put it into my assab bomb making process um like i said i'll put the chemicals up what we're looking trying to extract out of there um i they're crazy words so um two ounces or two ounces of this you want to cut this up in two cups worth into your i put it in a crock pot your own crock pot here along with about four or five cups of water two cups of organic coconut oil um i like the organic um i don't think it makes too much of a difference it's just the carrier but i like coconut oil it uh it hardens up um if you put it once this is done you're going to cook this thing for 12 to 18 hours i go 24 you make sure you replace the water as it you know evaporates out simmers out but you want to um the oil will stay and that's what's going to collect all your uh your chemicals that we're looking for um like say i'm really after two um but you know we don't know what the uh what the other ones do um but for solves and stuff it's absolutely wonderful it's great stuff don't throw them out keep your roots so you're chopping them up roots coming off they're going to be all sizes i break them down and i got some big ones small ones i'm going to use this to grind it up and then put it in my coconut oil and i say i'm gonna do it for 24 hours i will put those chemicals up so you know what they are if you have any questions you're welcome to come to our uh facebook group it's called growers helping growers it's

"RyyKvATLFOM": "what's going on people Sam here with Berryhill and I want to take this time to answer a question that we've been receiving a lot lately and that is the differences between full-spectrum CBD and broad spectrum CBD now I'm gonna answer this question in a way that I like to get questions answered and that is the easiest way possible so I'm going to try and do that for you guys as well now the main differences is this when I think full-spectrum CBD think about the full cannabis plant and all the components inside of it into an oil now and that includes THC now THC is the component that actually causes psychoactive effects on the human body so for some people that may be anxiety but some people are just relaxing and you know kind of seeing things and hearing things that they kind of want to hear in their minds but for me personally I like to avoid THC just because I like to have that control and with full-spectrum CBD you have a chance of having high rates of THC now a broad section of CBD you have all those components as well the terpenes everything involved in the cannabis and hemp plant but without the CHC component now the broad spectrum CBD is what can be sent and shipped out all across state lines all throughout the country and all throughout the world because there is no traces of THC in it so that's the kind of CBD that you guys are going to be getting especially if you live in the state that doesn't have a medical marijuana program and also does not have any kind of laws that have to do with having cannabis in your in your home and in your hand so we hear a very oh we want to make sure the best options for CBD if you have any questions about CBD feel free to reach out to us and can Vera Hill hair getting you the best forms of

don't forget to subscribe as well I upload every single Sunday and every single Thursday and then occasionally but most weeks I also upload on a Tuesday as well and subscribe see themself in any of my future videos and let's get at it oh I don't even know where to start because there is so many of different products and I want to talk to you about I think I will start with the very first product that I have ever used and that was CBD and I believe it's this with all of these companies and most of these companies I have collaborated previously and all the products have been sent out to me as bloggers mail however I'm in no way obligated to make this video and I just wanted to talk to you through them and I have been genuinely using them consistently so I thought that makes sense but all the opinions are mine that I'm not taught to like say any of it and to be honest to V the companies that they don't know that I'm even making this video so yeah anyway and this is the first company first product I used and it's the owners hemp CBD don't know how to pronounce it with this basically oil pure CBD extract in hemp seed oil so this is the 10% pet 10 milligrams now with the doses I am so confused I'm living there try to exit so though this is the same the same thing but like a bigger bottle of it and that's 5% per 30 mil so you can get all different percentages so I will just show you if I can here so this is like you like a little whatever these things are cold I don't know then you just drop it on look it I never realized that it has the amount on it and yeah new so you drop these little drops into under your tongue actually it's not that much left in this one oh okay listen yeah so you do the drops under your tongue it directs you to how how much of it you should use but basically you should start off small and then go up this one it's like the flavor of it it's okay it's got that CBD taste which is not it's not like amazing but it's not terrible I have heard you can put these in things again put them in cookies you can put them in coffees I don't know how to do that I haven't done this I'm not going to tell you to do so I will tell you though that this doesn't taste incredible you may be a little bit put off by it I started using it to help me sleep to help me relax before sleep by know that people also use these to help like the muscle recover etc etc I am also going to do a little disclaimer here and say that I don't know a hell of a lot about the background of CBD and how much it has been tested like if you know things about it I important feel free to leave them in the comments down below and I know that I've tried it and done it helped me as far as I know it doesn't have any negative side effects but it about everything can have a negative side effect to some to somebody so yeah I just want to put it out there and see I started using these before bed I was like yeah this is nice it did help me get into it it just made me a lot calmer I had before before bed so I started with this and it in it it was nice I was like okay cool we're gonna stick with this but I discovered this also I want to say honest and our incredible there they have been there just a wonderful company I think they were originated in Brighton but now they're in calm or something and the branded miss lovely the products are really good the communication with them is good everything it's like spot-on so if you want to try out some of the products I definitely recommend them because they have been really really great then I've tried out these and these are the clarity CBD broad spectrum for capsules so they are basically just or the CBD oil but in an already already already measured up perhaps you for your Diaries describe it and it says that it's 25 milligrams per serving maybe yes milligrams of CBD in each capsule okay yes and take one capsule once to two times daily and so I started using these actually in the morning as just like a try try an error and I found these amazing they have I think I suffer from from anxiety and depression anyway but these have helped me stay so calm that I usually have like a a dip around lunchtime where I start to feel anxious and and agitated etc smooth sailing I've stayed on a really good level where I'm not I I struggle with like being overly o overly excited and then and then like sad basically as a really struggle to get that right balance this kept me on there on a really good balance of being like yeah I'm okay I'm productive I feel good that's age there is not like you know fireworks and there is not like tears and so yeah I found this really really helpful this company have been medium when it comes to communication which is very upsetting and because I think the product is fantastic so if they can up their communication skills and kind of just make sure that that the customers are happy then they would get to enough that the product is ten out of ten for me anyway then I discovered something else so this is something I wanted to talk to you about because because I I need to be honest with you so I'm in no way shape or form promote and smokin I think smoking is a horrible disgusting habit that I am very very very ashamed to say I have had for many years I have tried to quit and smoke in time and time again and every time I it doesn't last for me but last year I have decided to try vaping and I have tried these CBD little oils so they have no nicotine in them and they have 1% of 10 on a little bit of 1% of CBD per hundred milligrams so should be milliliters because the liquids are not sure that's very confusing and and they come in different flavors so you've got natural hemp I've tried a mint mango strawberry maybe something else I'm not sure do they help me calm down I don't think so do they they have they stopped me from smoking cigarettes yes they have is that much better for me I think so I mean anything that you're inhalants isn't good for you so I will never say to smoke in something because that you shouldn't be putting anything in your lungs full stop however have gone from smoking cigarettes a lot to being able to smoke something if it doesn't have nicotine in it today don't smoke nowhere near as much that may potentially have some good use in it I think that's really good it to me anyway it has helped me so I wanted to say it because I don't want to lie but I want to be very clear I I'm not promoting smoking I'm just saying that has helped me maybe if you want to smoke and you want to quit smoking maybe that could be an introduction to it however I also know that together the government is only kind of looking into CVD and really is it like how them how much damage can it does or more faith in rather than see believe it either way and so yeah I'm going to recommend it but I'm just saying it helped me so that's something you you know you're looking into then you have my my my experience here and you can do with it whatever you you kind of choose to do with it but yeah they're nice they're tasty and they stop this stopped me smoking I haven't had a cigarette in absolute ages and I haven't been craving any cigarettes so I think that's pretty good then the next products I'm gonna talk to you about these are fairly new products and they are also from honest hemp most of these products are from honest and because I bloody love them oh I thought I had another one in here died and I have like CBD products scattered all around the house so I had to like go around and tried to find them all and but anyway I started instead of stops taking the oil because I felt like it was nice but I didn't feel like it was helping me as much as I wanted and I still struggled with falling asleep so much and so so I thought oh I don't know I just stopped to kind of using it and then one day I thought why have these why don't I why don't I give these ago and oh my goodness so these are CBD sprays so it's oil but it's in this spray form you can see spritz spritz you spray under the tongue and I think it's up to like 25 sprays which seems like a lot but I think was this sprays it's not the up to 28 sprays to do three times a day this stuff is the reason I can sleep again I'm not even joking I started using it just to sort of see if it works this is too small and they keep falling through the grate and and yeah I I fell asleep I was tired and I actually fell asleep really calmly I have been using these for a a few weeks months now months I would say and I have been able to fall asleep I like a normal person and it's about 10 1/2 10 I spray these I sit there and within half an hour I've gone into a beautiful sleep I still struggle with waking up throughout the night and I'd still have like night terrors and stuff which is not great however the fact that I can actually fall asleep calmly it's incredible I actually enjoy falling asleep now and I haven't had that in years so it and I know these work differently for different people some people find out it works for them some people found out they haven't I would say a lot of these are trial and error and you might have to try a few different products a few different strengths maybe a little something as simple as a different way of consuming it could be best for you but it's amazing the peppermint want is my favorite and especially after you have brushed your teeth like it's nicer to have peppermint to taste in your mouth this is incredible and amazing and I can't live without this every single if if I could give up all my CBD stuff but keep one thing it would be this now it also comes in a regular hemp taste which is fine like again it's like not great but it's okay the other thing is it's really hard to make CBD taste good so the peppermint one I actually really enjoy I think it's really nice and the orange one weirdly I don't I don't love because I have the oils that are orange and they're really nice but in spray I don't like it so that's probably a personal taste as well yeah give them a go try different ones of these ones and see which one's work for you but I have I actually cannot get over the fact that I can fall asleep now after many many months of not being able to do so and I'm so calm and now I would like I lay in bed and I'm just like this is nice I'm good to Bethnal asleep I used to lay there and like be terrified and be like super stiff and like not being able to fall asleep because I'm too scared and now I actually enjoyed evenings which is lovely okay next product also one that you consume and also on from owners hemp there is I have like three more companies to go go through so do bear with me and I have eaten all of these so there are none left in here open it talks about them anyway and these are the CBD gummies and CBD vegan domes these are sweeties whichever way you look at it so they're probably not the best for you because they still have hey I manufacture didn't get wig and they have sugar in them so obviously you know give and take but well the gummies are lovely the domes are bloody delicious and they just I don't know I don't know how helpful they are no no the Jake and I like to like treat ourselves to one of these at lunchtime like post post lunch of a little lunchtime dessert and they're nice and tasty so maybe maybe that could be something for you maybe if you're like traveling and you want something that would give you a little bit peace of mind and you also like want some snacks this could probably be good although I would say probably can't eat too many of them I've never eaten more than like two yeah each three to four sweets path setting daily dosage of 15 sweets per day yeah you'll be fine so you can have a few of these and you know as you travel in or something like that they're really really tasty what else do we have that you consume I think that's it for consuming I think but we have some more other products ok let's get let's go on to these ones so this is a company I've discovered fairly recently and I have worked with them and I think it's pronounced you are you nation and this is the CPD body oil so it's oil that's awfully infused with CBD and it is a body product not to be consumed but this stuff has been amazing unlike I've had some muscles where I've exercised and just like rubbing this into my muscles it feels really nice and really calming and amazingly so Jake gets a lot of sushi he's broken his neck before and many many years ago and he has still gets a lot of pains in his neck and this really helps him I would just never watch TV and just like rub it into his neck and it really it soothes him it helps him it feels really nice it smells amazing so I think if maybe something like this if you have any injuries that are that are bothering you if for example I get like rheumatism in my hands I just rub it into my hands and it just feels really nice and really soothing so this stuff is amazing and I also have another body oil from honest and as well and this one it is just as lovely it's nice a bit different than the other one but they both smell amazing they both do it amazing jobs and as I said I love all the products in one attempt so yeah I also wanted to talk to you about this one because it's just something a bit different I will leave everything linked down below as well for you so we have those and from our you Lu swell us from honest and I have all their bombs and body butters was this one which is called the South I have one more from you Lu which I had used yesterday and I have no idea where I've put it and but it's but it's similar sort of thing and these are all kind of body oils they all have lovely consistency very um the very soothing these are quite oily so I would say like maybe not for your face but for your body is lovely this self when I was and I was sick recently and I I was using it as like a vapor rub on my chest and it was so nice and great for that great for dry skin for elbows and stuff like that you have the essential balm which looks like there it's like a little ball thing and I use this on my lips and it's really nice and soothing and then you have this amazing body butter oh they're all smell to die for and they're just really lovely lovely skincare and the same with the other one the other one it's a balm as well that I have so yeah loads of body products that a hemp and now has to offer a swell hand CBP has to offer so that's it could be something for you I've seen has loads of because it's natural has a like a lot of natural ingredients that are really good for you so yeah maybe worth trying these also if you're wondering what the hell is on this that there's that Oreo crumbs don't judge me you know you're in lockdown with everything is covered in Oreo crumbs anyway a couple more products and this one is also from honest hemp this is the CBD cooling gel and so I got send this as like pure products and I was like this is very cool I have no idea why I would ever use this because why would you need a cooling gel but cool whatever like a nice packaging you know we'll give it a go I'm sure come in handy it came in handy a lot faster than I expected one when you burn yourself whether that's from the Sun or from like accident and by accident obviously please try not to but if you accidentally do this stuff feels so soo then it's really lovely the formula of it's beautiful and it's just really nice and also I have had about two months ago anomaly and in case you thought a lot my skin looks beautiful and glowy I've had what is it called it is called really bother me what is it called one sec I have had various what is it called micro needling there we go so it is basically I'm not sure if you'd be able to see this but I had like skin taken off and to help your skin rejuvenate and grow back in make it really really lovely anyway um post dis treatment my skin was on fire and I was given like a solution to put on my face to help it but my skin was really burning as it is like a fairly invasive and treatment so I thought well cooling gel surely that's gonna help oh my goodness it was perfect it was exactly what I needed it just helped my face still stay really smooth but it just had that really nice kind of cooling and tingling sensation it's amazing so and yeah infused with peppermint and eucalyptus so when they get too warm as well you can just like put a little bit of it on your neck or something and to get a bit of like freshness I don't know how to describe it but this is lovely really really nice and then last two products are from doctor botanicals which I don't think I've spoken about before on my channel and and from them I've been using this hemp oil and moisturizer so you've got this is obviously like a skin oil that's infused with hemp and it's lovely smells wonderful and I put it on my forehead to give my forehead moisture and make a look beautiful and shiny and then also I use this moisturizer not moisturizer to coat a mask it's a very gentle mask actually this is a moisturizer I've been using it as a mask well there you go and just put a thick layer of it on my skin in the evening when it needs a little bit more moisture and soothing again and and it's really really lovely for that as well yeah I feel like I have talked to you about a lot of CBD projects as I said I've been using a lot of them both consuming them and putting them on my body and I am looking to explore more of them because I really like them I think that they're great it's a it's a great ingredient to have in your everyday life let me know if you have tried CBD products which ones you have which ones you liked which ones you didn't like as much and I will leave links to all of these down below or as many of them as I remember as many of them as I can find so do check them out if you have any questions about my experience leave the number I'll be happy to to respond yeah the tip for today's video gives us a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time bye", "VQo5mZ_0hvA": "what's going on guys it's Christian from access labs here to talk about the age-old question full-spectrum versus isolate we've all either bought both products and one works better than the other whatever it may be but I'm here to talked about full spectrum and why it is proven to be better for most of all of our customers typically whenever you're dealing with a full spectrum product you have a variety of cannabinoids within the implant that you're giving within our oil with an isolate CBD product all you are getting is straight isolate so all the entourage effect does not come into play whenever you're doing with the CBD isolate product so as I'm pulling this poker chip you see every single other cannabinoid that's coming with it that is a full-spectrum product but if you are looking at a isolate product this is what its gonna look like so as you can see only one cannibal is coming coming with it and it is just CBD so that is the easiest way to really describe the differences between CBD full-spectrum and CBD pure isolate products so if you guys ever do have any questions we're always here here at access labs to not for you to give a quick call to and we're always here to help thanks", "maaVSWhhRog": "it's taken the health supplement sector by storm the CBD market now worth more than sales of vitamin C and D combined made from an extract of cannabis that is legal and doesn't make you high CBDs effects aren't yet well researched but it's estimated 1.3 million people are already taking it for conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain leslie began taking CBD capsules for her pain and now runs this cafe in lancaster offering it in drinks and food i wish add a video to what i used to be like cuz you won't believe how I was yeah it's really really helped I think people just need to be aware that there are a lot of products out there that what there should be and you have to be careful where you're buying and what you're buying there's now blind testing by the body which represents the CBD industry's major players has revealed just how big a problem that is when this cannabis testing laboratory analyzed 29 widely available CBD oils only 11 of them were close to the potency that they claimed nine products were significantly stronger than claimed seven were significantly weaker including one costing ninety pounds which had no CBD in it at all and 15 contained other chemical compounds from cannabis which are controlled substances meaning those oils were technically illegal to sell I don't think a consumer can easily tell between what is a sort of cowboy firm and a reputable firm I think one of the things that we're looking towards with our policy report is that we would like a self regulated environment where there can be an equivalent of a kite mark standard where you know that if you buy a product with a certain kite mark on it it's been rapidly tested at an independent laboratory and it fulfills all of the required requirements of what industry says good looks like and the regulatory bodies agree with the government says we have always been clear about the legal position on CBD we advise a cautious approach to these products and companies should seek legal advice to ensure compliance with the law and ensure products are safe what's called a twin head filler the bottles come down here but manufacturers who are trying to comply say they urgently need a level playing field to rid the industry of cowboys how that lurks whether that's a new agency or whether that means being a licensed producer you know meeting a whole range of different criteria then that's what we need you're prepared to do that to get your business very much so I've invested a lot of money in this company and we've got a fantastic business here and it's you know difficult when you hear of stories like that where you know unsafe products are being put on the shelves even though the benefits and risks of taking CBD aren't at all clear it's still one of the fastest growing categories of well-being products yet reputable manufacturers are crying out for help from the authorities to ensure people do get something that is legal safe and contains what they've paid for Catherine Jones five news you", "ATvB4nB4ALs": "ah hi everybody sydney here welcome back to my channel today today i'm going to be going over the math on how to actually figure out how much thc how much thc or cbd is in your oil how potent it is um a lot of questions i know in the last video i posted honest let me be real with you guys really quickly i posted that video thinking maybe if i got lucky like 15 people would see it so it wasn't my best work just gonna put out there it was my best work a lot of you guys have not seen the video i got a lot of comments on it a lot of questions all the concerns mostly great comments so thank you guys for keeping it positive i appreciate that let me preface this by saying i'm not an expert i don't know all the answers i'm just a girl making cannabis oil in our kitchen just like a lot of you guys i do know a little bit of math on how to figure that out i know in the last video i said i was going to give you the math and i kind of tried to in the comments but you know it's easier to just see it done so that's what we're going to do today we're going to visually walk through this when i have my levo machine now levo corrected me that's how you pronounce it levo my level machine is sitting here i made a new batch of oil so we're going to be doing the math on this particular batch what i have in here essentially is a cup of coconut oil i infused five grams of cannabis into this oil it's very concentrated very dark in color i don't know the exact percentage of the flour i was using so i'm gonna just ballpark it in like the 15 range just because that's pretty average for cannabis so let's say it's 15 it's always good to also overshoot it a little bit especially if you're dealing with thc just so you don't really overdo that and then obviously you can trial and error the amount of milligrams on your own personal body to see where you're at before we continue to go make sure you subscribe to my channel thank you for liking this video and watching well thank you for liking it if you like it please like it thanks for watching and keep watching if you want to know how to decode and figure out how much thc or cbd you're actually consuming when you make your own oil let's freaking go y'all okay everybody so what i have here is my piece of paper a pen and then my phone over here is my calculator and let's just freaking go into this thing oh and hello let's just like take a moment and just look at the beauty look at her oh look at her so to start things out i'm gonna write down the amount of oil that i used so up here i'm gonna write one cup um of oil the amount of cannabis that i use which was five grams grams of cannabis canna and those are the two numbers i'm going to start with if you'd like to convert your grams to milligrams one gram equals a thousand milligrams you can write that on the side one gram equals one thousand milligrams that's just for further conversion um and if you want to find out like per tablespoon you can also convert that i don't know off the top of my head so i'm just going to keep going so from here i have my one cup of oil and my five grams of cannabis oh and i know that this is 15 let's say it's thc for the fun of it 15 thc if you're using a hemp flour you do the 15 or 20 or whatever percent of that in cbd is those are the numbers you need to start with those three numbers right there you have three numbers your amount of oil you're infusing the amount of cannabis that you're using in the percent of whether it's thc or cbd they're using into that oil to do that i multiply my five grams of cannabis times my .15 so because if you convert you move the percentage over two decimals and that converts it to the percent or to the decimal rather and that would equal because i can't do math five times point one five equals point seven five so zero point 0.75 grams of this whole 5 grams is actually my thc that's present in my cannabis so from here in my whole cup one cup of oil i'm now once i'm done infusing going to have 0.75 grams of thc so .75 grams of thc into my oil i want to convert this grams into milligrams so in order to do that i just cross multiply so i have my one gram at top per 1000 milligrams i cross multiply you get rid of the grams and so per one cup of oil i actually have and then i multiply these 0.75 times 1 000 i have 750 milligrams of thc so in this entire little guy right here because it's a full cup there is 750 milligrams of thc in here okay so if i want to know let's see i'm using this for baking per tablespoon let's say now i would just convert this into tablespoons so let me look up really quickly what how many tablespoons are a cup cup two tablespoon so there's one cup so let's write it up here in our conversions one cup equals 16 tablespoons so that's another conversion you should know one cup of oil equals 16 tablespoons i can again cross multiply cups to cups and then there's 750 milligrams of thc per i mean this was a long way around just like honestly just switching out the numbers but just so you guys are more visual with it 750 per 16 tablespoons and then i want to find out how much per one tablespoon one tablespoon at the top and we don't know this answer we don't know this answer that's what we're trying to figure out and then you have 750 milligrams per 16 tablespoons pretty much you want to make sure these are always on opposite opposite sides of the line so that when you cross multiply you can actually just um cross it out and that what's that's how you get your numbers i don't know i took math a long time ago this is just what makes the most sense to me hopefully i'm explaining it in a way that makes sense to y'all uh unfortunately i don't know if i am 750 oop 750 why can't i do this pretty much all you need to do is take 750 and divide it by 16 and that'll give you how much thc per one tablespoon so we're trying to figure out this number right here so 750 oh my god divided by 16. so there's actually 46 milligrams of thc in a tablespoon you can also further convert this and you know figure out if you're using a cup in like let's say your entire cup in a recipe and it makes eight slices then you can really go in deep and figure out how much cbd thc whatever is in your slice but other than that that's really the math um screenshot this i hope it makes sense to you guys i mean i made a video about it so again it's just a lot of cross multiplying a little bit of conversions with this up here and then really it's just this percent of whatever you're find trying to find th c cbd whatever it may be and making sure you just take that into account in your total amount of cannabis cool y'all and that's it i hope that that was really helpful if it wasn't if i confused you more i sincerely apologize i am not a mathematician i took math a long time ago i'm just trying to use what i learned in essentially middle school and applying it here but hopefully that explains things a little bit more if you like this video again please make sure to give it a thumbs up a like um if you didn't like this video whatever not sorry about it it is what it is you know i'm just trying to hear live life and make my freaking cannabis oily people so if you would like me to make something with this cannabis oil let me know in the comments below what you think i should make with it i tend to like to bake healthier things like paleo cakes and dairy free items and gluten free items that's kind of the stuff that i personally eat if you don't eat that stuff that's no big deal i literally do not care but also just let me know in the comments what you want me to make with this stuff because i'm planning on making oh actually i know exactly my sister's birthday is coming up if you're watching this in the very very very future it's already happened but maybe i'm gonna make her a birthday cake with it hope you guys enjoyed also levo thank you so much for providing me with this item if you guys haven't got yours all ready i'm obsessed with it i love using it it does make your place smell a little bit like cannabis but honestly in my opinion not as bad as like doing it in the stove top or in your own oven and it's freaking easy cleanup i just love how easy it is you can download an app you can control all the temperatures from your phone it's literally the best so if you're going to make the investment i highly suggest doing so if you want to buy one for yourself i'm going to link them down below so you can go purchase one i do not have a discount code just yet levo if you see this if you are watching i would love a discount code to give to my people so if that does happen and you're watching this again in the future i will update with the discount code

amount of [ __ ] I do you know you use products there like like I guess like not THC even though it's still like because you train so like yeah you know for like information so you use like robots and tinctures or something that yeah yeah yeah use some different CBD creams like there's a one and one cream it's THC and CBD but I don't think it's psychoactive but there's something about putting it on muscles it makes it feel really good yeah I don't think it affects your thing really if it does it's a very very very small amount no cuz it's got to go through your skin somehow or something I don't know how that would work but it's the I love that [ __ ] I love CBD creams they're so good for like sore muscles oh yeah man that [ __ ] works fast like right now you can go to like independent vitamin stores and they have lines of CBD products there along with vitamins they already make so like you know [ __ ] like with four joints for yeah joints I got CBD vitamins for your joints and stuff like that them those shits actually work yeah I got to tell you going on tour for so long you know I used to get [ __ ] in my knees every now and then and when I started you know taking the CBD vitamin for the joints man within a month I stopped feeling any of that information though or the you know the soreness from from the movement did you got a make for an hour and a half of night tonight it's crazy minute I'm glad to see it's at least that right now is hitting those vitamin stores and they're about to be in CVS and Rite Aid's and all that stuff Victoria shake-a yeah yeah does he you seek that CBD buddy my friend Dave Foley had arthritis pretty bad when you start taking CBD was talking about on my podcast his finger straightened out started being able to use his hands like yeah mine arthritis with her fingers are like cross like yeah his were just yeah guess it you know it was really badly affecting his joints somehow and he said the CBD just completely relieved him of that how many milligrams was he taken I don't know I don't know I don't remember but yeah I think people should work that into their vitamin regimen you know the the CB like the one you were talking about on your show was what was it you know CBD and THC but it was equaled out his ten milligrams yes CBD ten milligrams of THC and I think with that in your vitamin regimen [ __ ] man that that helps a whole lot it helps a lot yeah CBDs legit it's legit in terms of like alleviating soreness a little drops and shut yeah people take that before workout whatever it's doing like in reduction of inflammation that seems to be what they think is one of the primary reasons why people have illnesses yeah is inflammation and they think if the more you can reduce inflammation and the you can avoid things like arthritis and a lot of deterioration and they think that uh CBD is one of the best ways to do that it's really interesting yeah I mean they have been talking about the you know the progress people have been making in terms of you know having certain ailments in treating them with CBDs yeah and you know more and more people are coming with you know positive results and it's it's

going to be documented we're going to be doing like weekly videos of us like meeting working on all this stuff and just showing you guys the ins and outs of branding and what it takes to actually start your own like cbd company because this is like becoming a pretty big theme of 2020 and like 2019 like people are starting to build up cd brands and i want to document everything because i haven't really seen anyone doing it so we're just here at the soul house in west hollywood shout out to peter for getting me in here just got the membership so nice we just had really good food um honestly just like the entire ambiance of being here is very inspiring because people here are just working work and working and that's kind of what we're doing right now too so right now we're just kind of figuring out like a mood board i guess of the type of branding style that i want to do um so i'm giving peter some ideas he's going to give ideas we're just going to bounce back and forth and meet somewhere in the middle and whenever we meet in the middle that's whenever we actually start the branding process i already have the logo the name the domain everything is already set up in terms of like the name but we might end up changing the logo because he didn't like the typeface i personally like it but i see where he's going with that i do want to be a little bit more modern um but yeah very excited to see what's going to be going on i'm going to update you guys shortly whenever we make the next move two thousand almost three thousand dollars on a payment plan because peter just told me to do it and also yeah [Music] uh we just wrapped up our meeting at seoul house um honestly didn't get much done but we did get some brand direction done which was very important uh i don't think so but now we're heading over to actually sample some products to this one location in la that's like part of the reason why i moved here is because there's just more opportunity here for cbd stuff i guess like can call someone up pull up to their store and just try i'm gonna go test out this flavor and this like actual product that i'm gonna be selling and gonna get his opinion on it too so yeah should be pretty cool my first experience actually trying it so this is the pm formulation you choose for sleep yeah and then that's a full spectrum and then this is what i was telling you about being the water slider the water is better than broad spectrum blend which is similar to a full spectrum but that one has an energy you can take the b12 you can and this is no no flavor this one doesn't have a flavor whatever you want you're gonna try a couple facts i mean i've never ever taken a cbd oil before never never well you gotta try it i've tried i've tried gummies before but i've never tried this well try the oil first and then see what your thoughts are with that because that's that will kind of show you the the the oil aspect i don't like spectrum literally tastes like nothing yeah just a little bit of a bitter taste behind it but cinnamon flavoring in it  you're good actually i like water slightly because it doesn't stain clothes it's just made out of water okay oh i like this one nice little taste to it yep so that's that's the packaging definitely thinking about doing like regular tincture bottles so a dropper yeah exactly exactly like a dropper um you guys offer like custom droppers as well like yeah i mean you can go black matte yeah you can go clear you can go blue you can go white like you can see the white ones behind you all right so just got out of the meeting got a bunch of samples for different products that i'm trying to actually run in my brand and i'm going to be meeting with a bunch of different suppliers not just one you don't ever want to just meet with one person and keep your mind on that person i guess so having variation and stuff testing out different products that's what we're doing right now i'm going to give some of this to my friends to try out because i don't want to base it just on how i'm feeling um but yeah meeting went well now let's see what's next on the branding side of things we got the product kind of unlocked but definitely got to meet with some more suppliers and figure that situation out but [Music] all right guys so now i'm basically going to recap what happened in this episode like the first ever episode of project sd and you guys will understand why i'm calling it sd and like all this stuff in the long run but for now um pretty much the concept of everything is going to be all like behind the scenes of me building up this brand that i'm about to launch and i believe uh like two months or something like that i'm still working on you know getting all the finer things all set up and you know we've made a lot of progress from the stuff that i showed you so from that first meeting at soho house we actually came up with a brand identity and i got a new logo made after the new logo that i had made i got like the packaging and stuff designed after the packaging got designed i did the actual tinctures that it's coming in so i sourced a brand new tincture from alibaba so you know it's been going kind of weird with this coronavirus stuff and a lot of what i'm doing right now is very very similar to um pretty much with like drop shipping brands and anything like that because again it's like the same concept where you find that winning product in that niche and then you go and find a supplier for it and then you do your branding stuff and then you work on the ads so pretty much this entire series is going to be um behind the scenes process of me building up this brand in different episodes so this is the first ever episode um it's definitely going to be more structured for the next few months because i just didn't know how to do it right now but as you guys can see we did make some progress and you know from that point of like getting the product like formulated i guess in that meeting that i had with that guy i realized in the moment it was very cool looked very good for content but working with those kinds of companies where it's like a white label company or something like that it's not a very good idea because they don't have like the highest quality product and with my product it's going to be selling at a higher price like 80 bucks per bottle so i want to make sure that the product quality is amazing and actually really works for customers because this is a wellness brand it's a cbd brand it's a product that is coming to market to solve some sort of a problem and i don't know i don't even know if i want to tell you the niche that i'm going in but you know you you're gonna end up taking this product before you go to sleep that's all i'm gonna say right now and it will help you with that so yeah i'm working on getting the product sourced right now making it even better so i'm going to talk about that in the next episode as well i'm actually going to structure it you guys will see how i structure it but the next video will be coming out next week so yeah that was pretty much it i don't want to work with that person that i i was showing off and there was just a cool cool time meeting him learning a little bit more about cbd and actually trying it but i've now found a new supplier and that is kind of the update i guess and i'm also in toronto right now not even in la and one more thing i'm kind of going off on a tangent but the reason i moved to la was to get into the cbd space and i ended up getting pretty much like over by two people in the industry or who i thought were in the industry by basically just wasting my time and you know at the end of the day time is something that you can't get back if you lose money sure you can make the money back but the time that i wasted from literally september to like december-ish i guess honestly i'm never going to get that time back um and i'm pissed off about that but at least now i'm making progress with the real people i have around me so very excited and to those people who you know screwed me over if you're watching this that's all i got to say to you make sure you are working with people you trust and have full trust in and that's all i got to say honestly it's very surface level at the end of the day in la there's a lot of fake people there's a lot of frauds out there so you want to make sure you know the people that you're working with are real humble they have good product and they're able to meet the demands that you have as a brand and as a company so that's kind of what i've learned so far is to keep your circles small you don't really need to be in a certain place to get this kind of a brand up and you know i'm in toronto i love toronto so much i was in la just now um kind of just going all over the place but yeah that's pretty much it for now i'll catch you guys very very soon in the next episode of this series and i'm going to be dropping like drop shipping videos and all that other stuff um regarding just you know ecommerce stuff in general this is just another addition to the channel trying to make it seem a little bit more cool so thank you guys so much for watching if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe like this video and comment down below your thoughts on the series and also follow me on instagram fez hit me up if you ever need anything i'll see you guys in the next video peace you know specific uh we'll just like reroute them directly to your medium article so they can do like their meeting or we can make it aesthetically appealing on your site where it's like actually like yeah like a nice a nice blog section on the site exactly okay i don't think we take that approach because that in itself would be pretty uh pretty effective especially for a brand that you're trying to do and really stay away from from", "7_m23_-ER6w": "by now most of us have heard about the benefits of using cannabis for sleep

cannabis for sleep with the meteoric rise of cbd products in recent years one of the most common questions we hear on a day-to-day basis is should i be using cbd or thc to help me sleep we know from published studies that thc can act as a strong sedative in fact a study published in the journal of pharmacology biochemistry and behavior found that the more thc a strain has the better it will work in helping patients get to sleep the reason for this researchers suggest is the way thc interacts with cb1 receptors in the brain however this same interaction is also what's responsible for the psychedelic high that thc produces for many users a potent high can result in increased levels of anxiety and paranoia which is exactly what you don't want when you're trying to get some quality rest another issue with using thc for sleep is that it may have a negative long-term effect on circadian patterns a person with normal sleeping habits will start to feel sleepy based on their circadian rhythm which is essentially an internal clock that tells us when we need to rest when it's time to sleep the body produces hormones and chemicals that help settle the central and peripheral nervous systems into a state of rest under long-term influence of thc chemicals like melatonin can actually be overproduced meaning that you start to feel sleepy in the middle of the day this of course can entirely throw off the body's circadian rhythm and can result in erratic non-productive sleep patterns using cbd for sleep on the other hand appears to have fewer negative effects instead of acting on cb1 receptors in the brain cbd appears to work on 5ht1a receptors these receptors influence the body's reaction to the presence of serotonin which is the precursor to melatonin the body's natural sleep compound in a recent study published in the permanente journal researchers observed that cbd produced improved sleep in nearly 70 percent of subjects suffering from inadequate sleep patterns a separate study published in the current psychiatric reports suggests that cbd holds promise for rem sleep behavior disorder as well as excessive daytime sleepiness for these reasons it appears that cbd-based cannabis and hemp products may hold the upper hand among patients that are trying to improve their nightly sleep patterns it's also worth pointing out that cbd helps tremendously with things like pain and anxiety both of which can have a major impact on short and long term sleep quality of course finding a quality reliable cbd product to use for sleep is no easy task in today's oversaturated market whatever you do be sure to look for a reputable brand that offers verified lab reports with each product they sell this will allow you to get realistic unbiased information on

if you're like me you have some kind of chronic pain that you deal with for me it's years of wrestling it's in the back of the neck kind of radiates to the side of the head and even throughout like my eye and my forehead region all on the right side and i have ongoing appointments with ents and eye doctors and my regular doctor and there's nothing that they see at the moment which kind of leaves us in the space of well it's it's probably nerves and just pain that you're having i i don't like pain and i'm pretty sure you don't like pain i mean there's some people out there that like pain there's like whole websites dedicated to that but that's that's something different we're talking about nagging everyday pain and i for one don't like taking anti-inflammatories or even tylenols every day i can't i can't breathe anything i can't do cigarettes i can't do the marijuana my lungs just aren't built for that and i've tried edibles before and that really [ __ ] me up so that's why i started looking into cbd oils there's some local vape shops around me that sell cbd oil but you never really know which ones are the best ones and that's why i guess you know i trust internet strangers on amazon.com to to give me good reviews on some of that stuff but amazon doesn't sell cbd oil oh no no no they have hemp oil i'm gonna let you i'm gonna let you in on a little secret sometimes there's actually cbd oil in there and it is called amp oil don't tell nobody so that's the chance i took when i ordered these three products obviously i'm not gonna be able to tell you how the products work today so i'm just going to show you the products i'm going to use the products and then i'll uh do a little editing magic and i'll talk to you guys tomorrow later in this video about what i think of these products first up are these american hemp gummies 1 million 10 times power body discomfort relief made in the usa i don't know what the the million means or the 10 times power but yeah it's supposed to be hemp hemp oil right serving size one gummy servants per container there's actually 60 gummies in here active ingredients hemp oil hemp extract vitamin e vitamin b omega 3 6 and nine how come it's not listed on the vitamins over here other ingredients corn syrup sugar water gelatin citric acid natural and artifice flavors carnival leaf wax yellow number five and six red number forty blue number one take one or two gummies during the day or at night too thoroughly before swallowing and and all these things on amazon they always if you leave a good review they'll always give you like an extra of the same thing all right so let's open this up and see how they actually taste oh got a little yellow gummy stuck to the lid here smells good maybe this will be the one that i take oh this is soft i like this this is soft it it's really stuck on there um yeah these are really like a lot of these in here are stuck together uh but they rip apart easily so not an issue with me wow that tastes good that's pineapple and i love me some pineapple stuff like this could be dangerous i don't mean dangerous in the sense like i think i'm gonna die but dangerous in the sense that you may take too many just because it tastes good and you want maybe have a second or third but maybe you could tolerate two or three definitely a plus for the flavor so what do you do when icy hot don't work

got the hemp oil oh whoa yeah it doesn't smell bad i can definitely smell the rosemary oh it takes a second to hit you right away i can say that i like the hemp cream it's definitely soothing with that menthol there i don't know about the other effects of the hemp oil you know or the cbd or whatever it might have in there it says hemp oil could be cbd you know like i said sometimes they're disguised but the menthol definitely helps right away i'll let you know a little bit more about that in a moment the sinus plumber for your nasal sinuses this is this is pretty good if you have severe congestion and you're like me and you buy some of the the more expensive sprays in the store this is all natural 100 natural i'm trying to go natural i'm not trying to get any you know extra chemicals up my nose that i don't need up there and it's got that hemp oil i don't know if they have oil is going to do anything better like i said i'll know it a little bit but i can tell you right now uh it feels good i'm starting to feel i got to blow my nose start to feel a little drainage going on now so so i like this again i'll follow that uh follow up with this in just a moment and the gummy you're gonna have to wait for the gummy at the end of this video i'll let you know how i feel got a little hip pain get a little shoulder pain i'll let you know if it does anything for that or if it reduces any anxiety for me my initial thoughts after a day of use with these products let's start with the sinus plumber the sinus plumber is a good nasal spray uh it definitely cleared out my sinuses probably even a little bit better than the over-the-counter stuff in the store does even the strong stuff so i think i'm going to continue using this version of the sinus plumber i don't know about the the hemp oil if it did anything different but it definitely drained my sinuses a lot better than the other products that i've been using all right also my neighbor's gotta you gotta start mowing his lawn now all right now my neighbor's mowing the lawn and the ice cream man is around all right whatever let's let's get through this um hopefully this mic picks it up more than you hear the lawnmower in the background but yeah with the hemp cream i really enjoy the hemp cream it's got that cooling feeling i i use it again this morning right around the eye area i actually used it on my lower back last night right in that like sciatic area it helped me through the pain at night for that area so i like this i'm going to continue using this it's a little expensive so if you're using this i just i just wouldn't use so much of it i wouldn't be liberal with it just just rub your fingers over it just a little bit is all you need and then um yeah hopefully this is a better alternative than some of the the icy hot the icy hot kind of burns if i try to use it for pain and then you have some of the other stuff that's just cooling that maybe doesn't last as long i think this this lasts longer than the stuff i get over the counter these things right here definitely helped me get a better night's sleep i wasn't tossing and turning i actually slept throughout the whole night i think i went to bed early after taking these i don't mean too early i mean for early for me is anything past or like before midnight i'm an insomniac i'm i'm up till like two in the morning but these things help me sleep and not only do they help me sleep but actually i think it calmed my nerves down a bit so i was watching tv i was watching some youtube last night i fell asleep at an appropriate time i slept all night and i woke up at 9 00 am so i got plenty of sleep i woke up refreshed and then that's when i put on some of this hemp cream to to get me started for the day to try to reduce those headaches so yeah i would definitely recommend these if you want to pick these up for yourself i'm going to leave the amazon link below if you want to help us out by clicking that link and doing your amazon shopping there that would be appreciated if you liked this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up go ahead and subscribe to the channel you'd be helping us out i appreciate it and we'll see you guys next time in the next video", "LnkLZqOaGQ4": "Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the Internet In our opinion of course Bob. It's always in our opinion Brad, and our opinion is always right, yeah there you go Just ask us, All right today Brad we're going to talk about can pain relief creams and ointments help your pain> You know your neck, back, shoulder, hip, knee pain, does it help, and we're trying to answer that question today Hopefully and we've done this video in partnership today with iherb.com Again, we had the discussion last time is it iherb or iherb? Yeah, because we always have stupid discussions like this Is it gonna be on the, yeah we'll have a link down below, and there's a reason we like iherb.com, they they fit with our perception and our Approach to handling pain don't they Brad? Right try to do it conservatively in a manner that Doesn't require opioids, right doesn't really require any medications. This is all over-the-counter stuff There's no downside to trying this stuff. I mean, it's not gonna have any side effects It's not addictive, it either is gonna help you or not I guess with the exception unless for some reason you might have a skin reaction, that would be the only Downside and iherb is the largest online store for natural products they have 1,200 brands and They have over 35,000 products and Brad and I are gonna go on there and count them tonight to make sure they have 35,000 That's our old joke The second thing we like is because we're all very conscientious of price Their price is usually 30 to 40% less than if you went to a pharmacy or a health food store So we're all trying to save a buck, and if you use the links below to buy any of these products You'll get another five percent off. You know we make sure Let's give everybody a bargain and the last thing I really like about them Brad is they kind of built this business with the idea they're gonna have these perishable products, they built a warehouse that's Climate-controlled, very clean, they have a rapid turnover products You don't have to worry that these things have expired at all and they go so the shelf-life You don't have to worry about it being on the shelf for four years. They grabbed it off the floor Or that it's sitting next to a can of motor oil They got it all figured out Alright, so Brad and I did a video previously on pain patches, and we might allude to them again today But these are some of the products that they have for pain patches, why don't we just kind of put those off to the side But we also have the ointments and the creams, and I had to look up What's the difference between an ointment and a cream and apparently ointments have a little more oil in them, And it makes them a little more greasy Greasy? That's how they describe it, very good, we have three types here Well Bob before we go any further. I did notice there's a few people If you are new to our Channel, please take a second to subscribe to us We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free And we upload every day and also go over to Facebook and like us because Brad and I like to be liked there you go Alright, so we got three products. Yep, and you've tried all three, Brad? Yep, all three of them, alright and I tried two of them because you had the Tiger Balm So I couldn't try that, but my wife tried that too though She did okay, so let's kind of give our opinion on these two so this is the T Relief and Topricin pain relief cream they have really no smell to them, right yeah that that's what I liked about it Yeah, so there wasn't any of that and sometimes people want the smell, right they want the fragrance But in this case especially like if I'm at work or something like that and working with patients closely So I put them on my knees just to see. I worked out with them and that was fine, too It didn't really leave a stain on my clothing or anything so Where did you try these? On my low back, and I like this one right here, The T Relief I had good success with it and I keep it in my bedroom so that If I got some I back pain I use it and it's nice because before work I can go to work with it, and I don't have to work with patients. There's no I wouldn't say it's an odor but some of these you got that menthol smell. Yeah, again I like that but again I don't want to work with somebody that might be a little bit sensitive to it Here in the medical field you don't want to put cologne on because some people are allergic to it Or they don't respond well, so you want to be very neutral. Yep, so that's that's why these work great This by the way just to give you some price comparisons This is like $12.71 from what I saw on their site This was $9.99 this bigger one here and the tiger balm was $6.80 I think that was this one six dollars little bit more concentrated. Yeah, so all of them they're fairly inexpensive and Now your wife tried this one? Right. Yep. I used the one on my back I had better luck with that, but this actually you get that menthol cooling feeling which helped But again for the reasons. I just started discussed this has that menthol fragrance, my wife used it She had a bad cold so she put it on her throat She had a sore throat and whatnot and you know slept with it overnight and whatnot and that always feels really good Yeah, it gives you that, so I think it's just like with the pain patches Brad It's a really personal thing you're gonna find one that works for you now I looked at the reviews on these and they all had pretty good reviews There's a lot of people that do like them, and we look at these as tools They are not gonna take away your pain Cure it is what I'm trying to say, but we we kind of a formula here You know what we say is you have temporary relief Plus movement so if you can figure out some movements to do because usually a lot of times movements will sometimes heal your pain, right Temporary relief plus movement can equal permanent relief So let's say take the neck let's say you're gonna take some of this cream you're gonna rub it all over your neck and now the pain is diminished enough that you can try some movement within there, some neck rotations Generally with necks we often start off with you're gonna do chin tucks Put the cream on And then you're gonna do some chin tucks like this, and then eventually we want you to work on doing some extension like this This is very actually relevant to me today Brad because I was getting sore right in here, and I was doing these this morning Okay, I should have put some cream on, and it's actually just has loosened up now, Because I was doing a lot of these. Yep. So it worked out really good, for some people That motion doesn't work very good, so for some people you do the chin tuck and side-bend to the the side of the pain So the pain's over here? Chin tuck. Bend to the side. This is the direction I tend to go because I get pain on this side, because I tend to lean like this all day So you want to balance it out For some people it's rotations Brad, and even if it hurts one direction just go in the other direction right now And you can even give yourself a little stretch back in the head and always in really good posture, gentle stretch A little stretch is good might as well crank a little harder. That's not the idea Do your fingertips only and stretch you should just feel stretch pain any sharp pain with any of these You don't want to do that, so again hopefully this is gonna allow you to do this comfortably again It's one of the tools you're gonna have to cope with the pain Again if you can get away from using medications And you can just use these this is a big in the plus column, right exactly Another one Brad would be the shoulder, a lot of people have shoulder problems, you could rub the creams on there and then We're gonna want you to try some Movements with the shoulder, one of the ones that we often start off with is Extension, so you actually It really helps to take like a broomstick or this is a PVC pipe or a cane and My thumb is down here, and I'm gonna start working back like this and again, you know the cream or the Ointment hopefully takes away some of the pain And this should be a painless thing too, you can go up to the pain, but no further, you know a little Stretch kind of a pain is fine But if it gets that sharp pain, then you're going too far and you need to back off a little bit You know and it might be a forward flexion thing You can work on forward flexion too so let me go this way, so I'm gonna go ahead I'm grabbing below here, and I'm gonna start working on flexion here. Yep working into that direction Let's say this is my arm that had arthritis perhaps You can just grab your hands together and let the strong arm or the good hand help the weak one And we just go up like that until you can go, and you can do 10 to 15 repetitions And then leave it rest and come back an hour or two later and work it again And then one eventually you'd like to work on and is you can take a strap or a belt works out good too You can hook your hand in here and take it around like this, and I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna work on pulling it up like this and this seems like a strange one to be doing But it really actually is one of the ones that you want to use towards the end where the shoulder's getting better To really complete things, you can see if you're having problems reaching back You can compare like if this one's way up here, and this one's right here You know you got to get that one up there too eventually Again just Consider it. These are tools They're inexpensive, and they help you get through the day, and that's all really sometimes We need to do is manage the pain enough to get through so and then eventually improve And you know the body wants to heal itself We just need to give it time and work with these to get through, a little assistance.

product review today what we're going to be talking about is something that i've been taking for quite a bit of time now i'm on my second bottle it's the retican raindrops and so this retails on the ontario cannabis store for 43.50 and that's for a 30 mil bottle um here it is so uh comes in this sort of unassuming box and this is kind of a brand that i've overlooked for a long time i don't exactly know why i don't think i loved the look of it which is strange because you know i don't really care so much about the look of things but i don't know this one threw me off for a bit anyways that was a mistake because i really like this product and i'll tell you why so here's the box and the bottle just looks like this and it's got a sort of child proof safety cap and as you can see it's meant for a syringe which it also comes with which fits nicely i'll show you here's the syringe a one mil syringe so you know one milliliter of oil will give you 15 milligrams of thc and 15 milligrams of cbd and the syringe fits like that and then you draw out your cannabis oil so one thing i noticed with my first bottle my syringe was green and this one's white and the first syringe i had was actually a little bit easier to draw up oil with um so i don't know why there's a difference in syringes from one batch to another but that's just something i noticed so uh the oil itself is a blend of different cannabis oils and extracts i guess and they're all sort of grown in a greenhouse in the niagara escarpment area of ontario which you know i love everything about the niagara escarpment so it makes sense that i like this oil that's where i do a lot of my climbing really beautiful area of ontario and retican really makes it known that they're a very canda proud company um back to the oil so um it's co2 extraction method which you know is very common with a lot of the oils you'll find on the ontario cannabis store and yeah that's uh one before i get into the effects and the flavor and all that i wanted to do i think this will be really helpful for you guys but sort of a comparison with uh with some of the balanced oils that you'll find on the ontario cannabis store and that will kind of explain why i really like this oil as well so as i mentioned this one retails for 43.50 and that's for 30 mils okay not all the oils will be 30 ml so you got to pay attention to that so let's start with the symbol uh balanced oil i think that's what it was caught called i previously um did a review on it i'm pretty sure so the symbol uh retails for 30 39.95 and it's a 10 milligram balanced oil so in one milliliter you get 10 milligrams of both thc and cbd whereas the retican you get 15. so you get five milligrams more and it's only three dollars cheaper so i think that um for for the deal for getting what what you get for the price retican is a better option if you're not trying to achieve like exactly 10 milligrams in a milliliter retican is is the better option because you get more now let's go to the soleil balance oil which i really like as well but just for comparison it's 20.90 and that's for 30 mils but it is a 5 milligram balanced oil so you got 5 milligrams of thc and 5 milligrams of cbd so um it's you know it's about half the price but a quarter of the dose uh not a quarter a third of the dose make sure my math is all right um so um unless you are sort of a novice user and just coming to cannabis oils for the first time where you know a sort of a low-dose product like that like the soleil would make sense you get a better um a better deal with the retican as well and but there is one major difference well which i'll point out in the flavor so well i'll give a little hint soleil is flavorless radicand is very much flavorful moving on to the lumina so the lumina was one i believe i also did a review on i think i've done a review on all these ones that i've mentioned that i'm mentioning the luminaire was 49.95 and that was for only 20 milliliters and it was only about a 10 milligram balanced oil so you know unless you know the lumina hit you in some way that other oils don't um it's a very bad deal in my opinion the reticans away better deal and then lastly the kiwi balanced oil that one was 21.45 and that's uh again for 20 mils and and it's a 10 milligram balanced oil so again you get less so it's about half the price of the retican but you're getting 10 milliliters less so a third less of oil and it's only a 10 milligram dose so i think out of all the balanced oils if you're trying to get the best deal most bang for your buck the retican is the way to go so that being said let's start with the flavor so the flavor of radicand you know for a lot of people this is going to be something that takes off a point for radicand because it is very sort of flavorful it does taste like cannabis but it does have a lot of notes of terpenes you know if you're used to cannabis you sort of start picking up on these notes but there's you know some citrusy nose there's some flora floral notes there's some earthy notes but it is quite strong so it's something that you would have to get used to and if it really puts you off which that taste does for a lot of people then you might be better with something like the soleil balanced which is completely flavorless so for flavor i think that's one thing one area where i might have to take off a point with uh the retican as for effects effects just as good as any other oil so good sort of body effect i've you know again taking it for sleep it's working really well and i like the fact that i'm getting um a pretty good dose so i only need to do sort of a half mil and i'm getting like around seven milligrams um or you know just over seven milligrams which is which is a perfect dose for me so this will at that dose will last me two months for like you know 43 dollars which is an incredible deal i find the effects take about an hour to an hour and a half to come on and uh they typically last for about four you know four or four and a half hours around there i do sometimes when i wake up really early in the morning i've noticed that the oil has kind of worn off so it takes me a little bit more time to get back to bed uh sorry i don't mean early i mean later in the morning so like kind of five ish that sort of deal but it seems to last like if i wake up in the middle of the night let's say around you know 2 a.m definitely i'm feeling that the oil is still having its effect and it's quite easy for me to get back to sleep so um that's uh really it uh for the retican there was two things that i was gonna take off um a mark with so one was the flavor and the other one was you know in a perfect world um this would be 20 milligrams a 20 milligram balanced oil which is sort of like the magic sweet spot for um using cannabis for you know kind of medicinal purposes especially when we're talking about cbd 20 milligram dose per day is kind of like the minimum therapeutic dose so you know to be nitpicky with this product i'm you know i'm going to rate it an 8 out of 10. i really like it i'm probably going to be using it for a while one mark was taken off for the flavor but again that's not something that's such a deterrent for myself but could be for a lot of people especially some of my patients who are sort of new to cannabis and one other mark off just because it misses that golden 20 milligram dose but that being said it's it's a higher dose than a lot of the other oils on the market a lot of other balanced oils so i don't know it's it's a tough one you know i'm gonna say i'm gonna give this an eight and a half out of ten because it's hard for me to take off a point for that it's almost like it deserves an extra point so there you have it with the retican and i'll be back with some more product reviews for you guys shortly", "v7Zp4w7HyKM": "in this video we're gonna be looking at hemp seed oil and how hemp seed oil could

questions about yourself and your hair loss and then you'll receive free expert personalized advice on how to naturally regrow your hair in the best possible way but for now let's get back into the video what is hemp seed oil or hemp seed oil is an oil which is extracted from the seeds of the cannabis or hemp plant the oil is used in cosmetics and in cuisine worldwide hemp has also been used in the health community for years as a source of nutrients and minerals m-seal oil doesn't usually contain tetrahydrocannabinol which is also known as THC THC is the compound in cannabis that is responsible for the high of its uses so what's the difference between hemp and CBD oil well it's true that both hemp oil and CBD oil come from the cannabis plant these two oils come from different parts of the plants however and this can affect their nutrient contents and abilities as the name suggests hemp seed oil comes from the seeds of the cannabis plant the oil is obtained through a pressing process CBD oil on the other hand comes from the flowers and leaves this oil is often extracted through a chemical process it's good to get definitions out of the way but what about the difference between the capabilities of hemp seed oil and CBD oil well in general CBD is better understood by the scientific community he's been included in an array of research studies in trials and as such has established itself of the better of the two oils is that true not necessarily but more research with hemp seed oil would provide us with greater understanding of his capabilities and how it could be utilized so could it be used to promote hair growth well let's get this out of the way now there is currently no evidence to suggest that hemp seed oil can be used to promote hair growth that doesn't mean however that the oil is completely useless let's take a look at some of the oils known benefits to determine if it might be of use to hell or sufferers well hemp seed oil is composed of multiple fatty acids the breakdown according to a 20-17 article is as follows and we can see them all on the right there now why does this matter well fatty acids and nutrients which play an important role in the body this is especially true of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which hemp also contains fatty acids contribute to cell membrane structure and they also modulate gene transcription these are important for healthy functioning and perhaps more important to hair loss so far as a fatty acids have also been proven to combat inflammation now there are many types of hair loss the most common is under the genetic alopecia also known as male pattern baldness but no matter the type of hair loss that you suffer from you are likely dealing with follicle inflammation even if you don't know it in a g8 for example the follicle becomes inflamed ever due to the possession of due to the presence of DHT or due to scar potential this is still much debated in the hair loss community if left untreated the inflammation will miniaturize the hair follicles so new hairs are unable to grow this can then lead to thinning and eventually irreversible balding so where does hemp seed oil fit into it well as mentioned hemp seed oil contains fat which have been proven to reduce inflammation one study even showed hemp seed oil to reduce brain inflammation in mice which just goes to show the power of its fatty acid content the high fatty acid content of hemp seed oil then can contribute to overall scalp health so how could you start using hemp seed oil in your own hair cavity well the first thing is to add hemp seeds or hemp seed oil into your diet perhaps you'd prefer to add hemp to your diet naturally and you can do so with hemp seeds or even hemp seed oil well hemp seeds and hemp seed oil can can be ingested by themselves by taking the spoonful of each each day for example or added to your cooking hemp seed oil has a slightly nutty flavor so this makes it a great choice for salad dressings dips and marinades you can also apply it to your scalp if you're hoping to get a more direct benefit from hemp then you may be interested in topical use hemp seed oil is easy to apply to the scalp you just pour it into your hand and apply to the scalp using your fingertips you may even want to combine it with proven methods for heavy growth such as micro needling or scalp massage what should you look for in hemp seed oil well when purchasing a specialty oil such as hemp seed oil is important that you take a close look at the label this will help you to determine if it's the right quality for your needs so what should you look for well the first indication of quality is whether the oil contains genetically modified organisms or GMOs I strongly urge you to purchase oils that are non-gmo as this gives you a better idea of what's actually in the oil and this quality you'll also want to take a look at the list of ingredients you'd think that oil would just be oil right but that's not always the case the oil you purchase should be 100% hemp seed oil if there's any additives or other oils mixed in then it's not the best quality and therefore may reduce the benefits you see the good news is there are plenty of sellers both in store and online so you can be picky about the product that you buy to conclude hemp earnest byproducts are often vilified and sometimes over sent sensationalized it's true that the benefits of hemp seed oil is still very unclear but the research that does exist on hemp and its contents can offer some hope to hair loss sufferers do you have any questions about hemp seed or do you want to share your own experience with hemp or leave your question ok down below that's what we're gonna shave each day on hempseed oh don't forget to take the hair guard hair loss quiz by clicking the link in the description make sure to hit subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video thanks a lot", "h77IaMCkN78":

things going and every time I recommend something I always ask for feedback they say next time you see me let me know if this panned out and was what we expected it to be and want one recommendation that have been giving personally I've been having very good feedback on he's actually our CBD sale as a use for helping with migraines we've got lots of patients in migraines it's a very debilitating inconvenient diseased state to have and any any other tool that they can have in their belt that helps them treat the situation is is very much appreciated I've gotten very good feedback on this I'm

will explain what you can use cannabis oil for how you can use it and what the benefits are of cannabis oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank

and so i decided to do another one of these because if you haven't watched that one you should and at the end of it i said well what happened to the wall in processing hemp extract i've abbreviated that as w-i-p-h-e and that's what we're going to be discussing on today's live episode of thanks so much for dropping in my name is tom i'm a lawyer with the collateral base and if you want to follow me on instagram you can you can just find cannabis industry lawyer on ig and follow me there today we are going to be discussing more about the usda final hemp rule we did a usda final hemp rule video last week was quite popular and so was our delta eight thc and its legality and the vape cartridge ban that arose from the omnibus bill that donald trump signed a couple days after christmas so until march 27th you can buy vapes and products in the mail after that you're probably not going to see them so today we're going to discuss the wall in processing hemp extract because as you know the usda's rule did an excellent job of saying that you can have up to a one percent uh total thc amount and then that would that would keep you from being negligent if you test that you may now remediate it and so you can add it to other hemp biomass and chip it together so that that total plant tests a thc a compliant of the 0.3 percent and then that biomass where's where's bio mask and earmarked for it's not primable smokable flour no it's not going to become delta 8 moon rocks it it will become a an extract a cbd extract it's going to be thrown into an extractor so if you are tuning in and you have hemp extraction give yourself a thumbs up and click subscribe because on wednesdays and sundays we do cannabis legalization news yesterday i believe yeah we had a great show with nano emulsions we have our wednesday that's our business show and then on sundays we have activism so we're going to try to get some more of the people that were pardoned by uh president trump on his way out to discuss about why nobody should be arrested for cannabis let's get back to how the uh agricultural marketing service which the usda final rules that abbreviates as ams how they addressed and approached the wall in processing hemp extract conundrum because if now you're able to remediate this hemp and turn it into biomass it's going to the extractor the extractor is going to have ethanol or super probably ethanol with the volume that they're at uh and that is going to create a winterized crude eventually and that crude is not going to be thc compliant in the sense that as you strip out the the biomass and the moisture that's in there you concentrate the percentages of thc and so a terrible ifr that's an interim final rule came out by the dea last august and that kind of casted dispersions regarding the legality of hemp extraction which of course is ridiculous and then i was hoping that we would have something in the final rule to discuss about that and we kind of do if you dig to the final rule down to page 181 and then you zoom in because you're trying to you know make sure that people that are reading this at home can follow along let's see here the ams response to the 2018 farm bill directed the usda to establish a national regulatory framework for hemp production in the u.s and the final rule outlines provisions for this mandate the ifr and this final rule do not cover hemp or its products beyond production period further dea has issued regulation covering some some of these products or in-process materials and then they footnote down here oops i have already cued this up and i've zoomed in much better on it nope ah they override uh that is bad coding on the policy of the um department there because now when i click back it's going to go all the way back to page one this is what it clicks out to let's hit forward that's terrible and this is the dea publication that came out like i was mentioning earlier august in 2020 and that dea publication then discusses uh how they're supposed to be treating this hemp extract and i had it queued up before i screwed that up extract there you go it does appear 22 times and they kind of punt on this as well and they point over to the fda and that fda regulations that should be coming out into the future and then they link out to the fda here it is this is the one that i was looking for this interim final rule amends the definition of marijuana extract and then they get into it this revised definition now includes the 0.3 percent thc limit for the extract meaning hemp derived extracts containing less than 0.3 uh thc are also decontrolled along with the plant is itself as discussed previously production of the hemp and its extracts defined under the aia now falls under the same regulatory authority and shared between the states of tribal territories and the usda now look that's a little interesting because it says extracts right there and then uh in the final rule the the usda actually punted on that issue because they said oh the dea has the information they link to this page and then the d and they also made this this fleeting thing that the fda also has some so the fda also has regulatory oversight over these compounds and then they link out on that to this uh fda thing which is from the last administration so that's going to be interesting because this one's from december of 2018 by scott gottlieb who is the um the acting administrator i believe the the dea and it basically says that uh it's illegal to advertise them in a dishonest way like you can't make any specific benefits and any specific treatments but people already knew that and then it also says that there is no generally regarded as safe for cbd yet both of them contemplate this other thing that's going to be by the fda so no there's no new answers on the wall in processing hemp extract and not only is there new new answers there's a punting and then that punting has a link to a dea article which is then another punting and they also then ensnare the fda which still hasn't published its rules and now there's been a changing of the guard at the fda so who knows how long this is going to take uh the important thing is that nobody who's currently processing hemp i think recently correct me if i'm wrong in the comments uh has gotten anything shut down from the dea yet i haven't heard of any and i'm pretty sure if it happened somebody would tell me pretty darn sure okay so there's a few other things in the new uh dea not dea usda final rule for hemp production that we should mention prior to wrapping this one up as well and that has to do with the amount of testing that they're doing and so now they had a dea requirement which is still there but that dea requirement is effectively being continued until 2023 to allow the dea to get its affairs in order to have enough registered labs and uh that 30 day it used to be a 15-day harvest window and that was changed and now it's going to be a 30-day harvest window but that again that doesn't come into play until the dea is then going to be testing on that and that doesn't appear to be a case until 2023 so however your state is currently testing the hemp will continue to be how your state will continually continue to test the hemp for 2021 2022 and then i believe there might be some movement on this or at least there would be a a new farm bill or ron rand rand senator rand paul's one percent thc may have passed the senate and we all hope that it does other than that there was some very interesting which i didn't really understand much testing flexibility that they reported on and so like what does that 0.3 percent mean and how should it be tested to determine if it is compliant or not like should you test the most strong part of the issue the the material by the dry weight or should you test everything uh it was pretty interesting all in all the the usda's final rule on hemp is an improvement but it still has this gray area about that wall and processing hemp and how cbd is going to be regulated by the fda the dea clearly has no authority when it comes to the production of the uh of the hemp the problem with the uh dea's interim final rule that came out in um august 20th of 2020 is is right here and it says you know as a result a cannabis derivative extract or product that exceeds point three percent uh delta nine thc is a schedule one controlled substance even if the planet was derived from was hemp you know point three delta nine on a thc on a dry weight basis and so that's essentially kind of directed maybe at the wall in processing hemp extracts issue where uh you're processing it and it goes over that now we can make the argument that that's not fair to test it you tested it when it was harvested uh the dea has now been satisfied it's compliant hemp like you knew that compliant hemp went in uh you have no basis to think that anything would be wrong and then of course you could also argue that it's not done yet and then that would be that um that argument that was like how do you test this substance and so they were talking about like you know you could kind of do these flexibility type tests and so if you're testing a winterized crew that's not a product it's it's not i don't know nobody's unless there's people that are out there retailing winterized crude and there might be um it's not fair to test it at that particular juncture we still don't have that information anyway uh hopefully you guys are enjoying these and thank you so much for tuning in and and watching all this stuff

ways CBD oil, nature's arthritis, anxiety, pain management and cancer\ntreatment benefits your dog. Cannabidiol, CBD is one of the most\nremarkable compounds in nature. CBD oil has proven very effective for joint pain\nand inflammation. Increasingly, clinical studies have demonstrated CBDs abilities\nto halt cancer cell growth and shrink tumors. There are 60 compounds specific\nto the cannabis plant called cannabinoids and CBD is one of them,\nwhich holds the key to a variety of medicinal and therapeutic effects that\ncannabis offers. CBD oil is extracted from the stalk,\nleaves and flowers of the cannabis plant and contains hundreds of natural\nbotanicals in concentrated form. Just as in humans a dog's body houses an\nendocannabinoid system as part of its immune system which runs throughout the\nbody, and this system is filled with receptors that bind to the cannabinoids\nin the CBD you give to your dog, and this stimulates all kinds of changes in the\nbody which are beneficial. CBD is not psychoactive, the psychoactive effect of\nthe drug cannabis comes from THC only so basically CBD won't get you dog high,\nsimply relaxed with zero psychoactive effects. And more scientific research is\nbeing conducted on the therapeutic effects of CBD than ever before as new\nand exciting evidence uncovers major medical benefits. And with this in mind\nlet's look at 19 different ways CBD oil benefits your dog. CBD provides fast\nresults, usually signs of improvement begin within days. CBD reduces stress,\nseparation anxiety and nervousness to allow your dog to be more calm and\nrelaxed. CBD reduces the effects of arthritis quickly and increases mobility.\nCBD hydrates your dog's skin. CBD reduces inflammation and alleviates joint pain\nand studies have proven CBD is highly effective at\ncanine seizures. CBD Boost's your dog's immune system to provide optimum\nprotection. CBD reduces skin irritation and itching. CBD restore shine and\nsoftness to a dog's coat. CBD improves a dog's appetite. CBD improves alertness\nand mental clarity in dogs, it improves your dog's gastrointestinal\nhealth, and it's important for effective canine cancer pain management. CBD aids\nin post-surgery recovery and it also improves comfort and pain relief for the\nlast days of life, it's also really good as a cortisone replacement. It aids in\nweight loss. CBD aids in thunderstorm and firework phobias and CBD has no known\nside-effects. I've researched these benefits myself\nover the years directly from thousands of dog owners, so I can confirm that\nthese 19 benefits are real, effective and working right now to heal canine\nailments and assist dogs all over the world. Many dog owners report that within\ndays their arthritic, limping or in pain dog is greatly improved with\nfreedom of movement a much reduced pain. There are also lots of reports of\nrenewed energy, alertness and playfulness especially in senior dogs with reduced\nanxiety, more calmness, appetite and reduced use of vet prescribed drugs and\ntheir side effects. You may even notice that once your dog is experiencing the\nbenefits, they'll happily encourage you for more. As a side note, one owner\nrelated how her dog had never let her near the dog's mouth,\nso CBD was added to the dog's food. Well the following day while the owner was\nsat in her armchair, the dog came up to her, place her head on her lap and was\neager for her to administer drops directly into her mouth.\nCBD comes in different amounts per bottle and depends on the strength\nneeded. For dogs you want it in the 350 to 500 milligram range per bottle.\nHigh-quality organic CBD oil is not cheap because extracting CBD from hemp\nrequires a lot of plant material and careful monitoring of the growing\nenvironment. I only recommend an organic product as hemp is known as a hyper\naccumulator, meaning it absorbs contaminant\nfrom the ground it grows in and will pick up heavy metal toxicity\nunless it's organically grown. CBD oil must come in a glass dropper bottle, not\nplastic and be organic. CBD is dispensed into your dog's food or can be given\ndirectly by mouth under the tongue. I recommend giving under your dog's tongue\nif that's possible as it's more effective by this method, simply because\nit gets directly into your dog's bloodstream rather than eaten with food,\nwhich means your dog's liver will filter out some of its effectiveness. It's\nimportant to note that prices range wildly from $20 to $65 plus for a 250 to\n500 milligram one ounce bottle full plant organic extraction. This gives you\n8.3 milligrams of actual CBD, enough to be effective with dogs for the\nbenefits I discussed. Another important thing to note is that I've been working\nwith CBD oil for 15 years and it's only recently that CBD products have taken\noff and for good reason. However the information on CBD oil can be confusing\nas large online retailers like Amazon are not allowing product manufactures to\nmention CBD in their advertising and so confusion arises about whether any given\nproduct is true CBD oil or just made using the hemp seeds, not the whole plant\nextract. So I'll link to a product in the description below\nthat's genuine CBD oil, it's organically grown in Colorado USA and has been\nextracted using co2 full plant extraction and contains all the\nbeneficial terpenoids, flavonoids, essential oils, vitamins A and D, trace\nminerals, phytochemicals and omega-6 and three oils for dogs and cats. And for\nchronic health conditions like phobias and fearfulness, you can give half the\nstate to dosage and this will mean cost savings while still getting effective\nresults. My recommendation is to start with half the stated dosage, observe the\neffects for five days and work up to a full stated dosage if you don't see\nnoticeable effects for the condition intended. If your dog has major health\nissues like cancer, try working up to a double dose, as every dog, just like\npeople have their optimal dose, and there are no side\neffects other than a potential to sleep more soundly during the day. If your\ndog suffers arthritic conditions and especially if they're on vet\nprescribed medications for the condition don't even second-guess this natural\nalternative, get a bottle, stop the meds and treat with CBD and you'll be amazed\nat its effectiveness, without the side effects and the expense of veterinary\ndrugs. Raise the dose if you need to, it's safe and to find an effective level for\nlonger term use and the side benefits and numerous has discussed. Also if your\ndog has arthritic movement issues, an excellent complimentary dog supplement\nto feed alongside the CBD is bacon flavored soft chews, they contain many\nnatural ingredients including the CBD to aid pain free movement with universally\nexcellent feedback. They're also USA made with a hundred percent money-back\nguarantee with excellent customer service, again I'll leave a link to these\nin the description below.

find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of drug tests that look for cannabis analyzed a urine sample and screen it for marijuana metabolites since CBD derives from the cannabis plant you might rightly wonder if I use CBD can it cause me to fail a drug test for cannabis on its own CBD actually cannot produce a positive result on a drug test for cannabis that's because drug tests that

our episode on decarboxylation to learn how to HCA becomes THC and why that process is so important so if you only use CBD are you in the clear well it depends if you're using a high CBD strain of cannabis you'd likely think it's safe but this can sometimes cause you to fail a drug test many of these strains still contain high amounts of THC which will still set off alarm bells on a urine screen however if you're using hemp based CBD oils or pills these generally contain just trace amounts of THC at about 0.3% these products should not cause you to fail a drug test as long as you do not consume extremely high doses a false positive on a drug test can occur with doses of a thousand milligrams a day or more with CBD products though most people consume about 120 to 160 milligrams

under free I feel it a little bit I think [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey yo it's Cristina with another TV stuff review and today I'm going to be reviewing hemp vana pain cream so it says it is legal in all 50 states big difference between hemp and the other stuff y'all it says pain cream Aksum um strength odor-free no irritation no burning non greasy it does say that it's paraben free and vegan gluten free and cruelty free and on TV so there's some directions on the side apply generously to affected area and massage them to painful area until thoroughly absorbed into skin repeat as necessary but no more than four times daily off and on the back just your typical warnings of drug Facts again on the side have on the pain cream absorbs quickly and goes to work instantly it's unique formula includes a proven active ingredient plus the moisturizing benefit of cold-pressed hemp seed oil for soothing relief to back neck shoulders feet wrists calves and more and it is made in the USA so I just got back from the gym I'm gonna go hop in the shower we did a little bit of total body today so I'm definitely going to apply it on my neck and my shoulders and maybe my wrists a little but and I did hurt my knee so I'm definitely going to be rubbing it on my knee as well so I'm gonna go hop in the shower and then I will be back to trying to sell out much I'll know what I think alright y'all so just got out of shower I'm going to rub at some of my new hip bone of pain cream on my neck and my shoulders and my lower back so they Jim we did upper body aches so definitely feeling a little sore normally I would you blue from deuterium or I have this stuff that I got into yoga supply box called yoga and it's super super good too so again I'm not a huge fan of the snow I let my daughter smell it and she said it felt like silly putty and hairspray so take a little bit just rub it on it doesn't have that minty smell that the icy hot and it's blue to do which actually that was actually one of the things that I like all right I feel it a little bit I think unless it's just the fact that I just spread collection I mean it's a little cold here in the bathroom but I think I feel it a little bit I'm so good at it give it a few minutes and see how it is just finished in yoga outside I'm definitely going to be rubbing my hip on a pain cream on my wrist a little bit and did a lot of inversions and I can definitely feel it already so I'm just gonna open it up I already took that seal off I don't know feel like I just need a really bad piece I don't know what I think about the smell it's evidence odor freak maybe they mean they didn't put any fruit fruit smells in there but it certainly is not odor free because it kind of stinks it smells like silly putty and maybe like cleaners or chemicals on a neem and now I'm just gonna rub it on again I would compare this to like doTERRA or icy hot both products again I love them not really feeling that cooling tingling I don't know if this because it doesn't smell I don't know why I would change anything but definitely by now I would have felt it with doTERRA or icy hot so we'll give it a couple more minutes we'll see if it works any better but I'll definitely be back to give you guys my opinion and what I think oh okay oh so I have now tried hemp ona a few times I have ripped it on my knees and as well as my ankles after hitting the gym I've done it on my wrists I've done it on my right elbow and also on my neck and shoulders and a little bit on my lower back so I really put it everywhere now that says that you can um not man sorry I would probably give hemp lot of pain cream 1 out of 5 stars not only do I not feel like it works but it's most I'm sorry but it smells awful if I'm being honest it's just it's not pleasant to smell when it's in here smelling it on my hands afterwards it's just it's not fun it's really gross so I'm not a fan of the smell I do miss the cool tingly feeling of something like icy hot or deep blue both of those work way better than this I really don't even know if I felt this working yes I rubbed it on maybe for a minute I felt a little something if I walked past a fan there's something like that but for the most part I didn't notice the difference I did not notice it worked but I'm curious do you use a pain cream and if so which one do you use and what do you like

benefits What is full spectrum CBD oil and why is it better than regular CBD oil? Check it out. Hey guys My name is Johnny Ross.

Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant.

Than we have ginger root essential oil clove bud oil essential oil sorry and some golden jojoba oil and then I also have beeswax that I buy this online off Ebay from a bee farm and then I have  my sauce pan now I because we have hard water in Arizona when I do this it kind of messes up the pan and as you can see so\nthis is become My, umm, double boiler pan that's all I use it for so I this is how I makeshift a double boiler see just\nput the water in here turn on the stove and then you can heat up the oils in the measuring cup and it won't burn them. What I have already done is I've put water in the sauce pan I am just warming that up and I'm gonna let it get warmer than I'm gonna use it so I'm\ngonna put it on high for now and I'm going to come back when it boiling and turn down the heat to medium and then I'm gonna start warming up my\noils and melting my beeswax. As you can see the water boiling I'm going to go ahead and turn that down Now while that's cooling-off gonna go ahead and take my infused oil. Shake it up real good because it had some plant  particles down here and I'm going to go ahead and use all of this.   I pour in my St John's Wort infused oil   and now I don't put the essential oils in until after after the beeswax is melted because I don't want to evaporate the any of the essential oils I don't think I need and olive oil but if you needed extra oil you can go ahead and add that and I like to cut up the beeswax so that it melts quicker and I don't\nhave to use as much I don't have to keep it on the heat as long   I have my beeswax. I'm going to go over to my water that is calm down in such a wild boil And now,  I prefer using wooden\nchopsticks to do this and we're just gonna go ahead\nand warm this up and then again this is on medium heat you do not want to have it on a high heat you don't want to be impatient  and use high heat because you'll cook out all the herbs and then all you have left is\nnothing but a cooked oil and wax   Just let that go for a while you are going to have to do this until the beeswax is fully melted my beeswax is getting melted and mixed up in there. It's about half way done. half way melted Ok, the beeswax is almost completely melted. I've got a few pieces still in here. okay now I know that I'm completely melted but I also know that they are small enough pieces that they just gonna\ngo ahead and melt before I get these in 'cause I still have a few things to do. I need to add jojoba oil you don't need much I like to add it 'cause it's really good for\nthe skin so any salves, I just add that to it now I need to add my clove essential oil Lastly you need ginger root essential oil now I have perfected this recipe down to\nthese three main herbs that you have to have you cannot make this without all three Ginger is what helps the salve penetrate through the skin and\ndown deep into the muscles and joints. The clove helps numb any pain and the Saint John's wort oil also helps with relieving pain and just soothes muscles and joints. Alright! and the bees wax is completely melted in there Now these are 4 containers I got this I got all these in a pack of I believe 10 for a dollar at the Dollar Tree they are wonderful containers for\nsalves. They also come in rectangle shape Now you want to pour it in   Now I'm going to go ahead and put this immediately in the sink with running hot water That helps it I to easily clean out measuring cup. Another good thing is to take the boiling water and put it in there;  pour it in there . Now that we have the salves in the containers We're gonna go ahead and put them in  the refrigerator. Now this is why I have the cutting board because it's a lot easier to transport\nthem especially when they're in their liquid state to the refrigerator you can just leave them out but I prefer to do them in the refrigerator and cool them off quicker and get them sealed up and ready to go. And we'll be back when they are cooled off! I just brought them out of the fridge they are done and ready to go put a lid on and put a label on for each joints bruises sore muscles anti-inflammatory cramps and more", "DbIvkKuEBl0": "full spectrum cbd oil when and why should you take it and what is it let me explain you and answer all of your burning questions today in this video and hopefully by the end of watching it you will really have a clear idea what full spectrum cbt oil is and why you should be choosing it and when so my name is nadia and i'm the founder of vicario cbd and i'm a holistic nutritionist specializing in cbd oils first and foremost what is the difference between full spectrum and cbd isolate it's quite self-descriptive but cannabis has over 130 different cannabinoids and by the way hemp is cannabis um it's just a type of cannabis and there's over 130 different cannabinoids cbd and thc being the two most popular and prevalent ones but there's a you know over a hundred different ones so when we talk about cbd cbd is one cannabinoid it's an extra they extract that cbd and it usually looks like powder so cbd is isolate is usually just powder versus cbd full spectrum it's exactly what it means it means it's a bunch of different cannabinoids um so cbd still being the main one 95 percent off full spectrum cbd would be cbt but there's also cannabinoids like cbdn cbg and a little bit of thc so cbd isolate would have 0.00 dhc however cbd full spectrum will have a little bit of thc it is usually a very small amount um less than 0.3 by dry weight um that is kind of like the legal um requirements but sometimes it's even less than like significantly less than that it will depend on your full spectrum cbd so uh if you're really worried about thc uh whether you are just taking cbd for the first time um like myself when i started with cbd i really didn't want to have any thc in it because i'm so afraid to get high so because i take it monday morning and i don't want to have teachers in it then go for cbd i sell it however if you don't mind a little bit of thc if you're like smoked weed a lot of times and you're like i really don't mind i'm not scared of it i'm not afraid of it um then that amount of thc isn't really significant enough to you know to get you high that being said um we still most of our oils at aquarium are cbd isolates um thea with cbd isolate being our most popular one um you can get it by following the link in the bio and using the code youtube um it has no flavor it's made with mct coconut oil and cbt isolate and that's it it has 0.0 thc so there will be nothing to worry about and most of our products still contain just cbt isolate however there are benefits to full spectrum obviously there is a whole concept of full spectrum cbd oil having an entourage effect that cvt isolate doesn't have so what is entourage effect entourage effect is when cannabinoids are working together um and so thc will help will it will make sometimes cbd stronger if it's in a right proportion so in full spectrum it is the case so um when it when we're talking about cbd qualities like anti-inflammatory or analgesic or um that it will help you sleep thc and other cannabinoids can really boost the function of the effectiveness of cbd itself so that is what a rush effect is so is full spectrum cbd oil better than cbd isolate well it really depends everybody is very different so you have to make your own decision there is no better or worse cbd isolate doesn't have thc in it so if you are worried about thc whether it's a drug test or just your own personal reasons then it's just stick to cbd isolate however if you're not worried about the liberty of thc full spectrum might be for you full spectrum because of in entourage effect can be better for pain management because um it will be stronger anti-inflammatory and stronger analgesic so whether it's arthritis whether it's headaches back ache or whatever that is cbd full spectrum can be better might be better and another one is sleeping noise insomnia cbd full spectrum cbdo can be more effective in um in case of insomnia and actually falling asleep and relaxing that being said i have had um some customers um report to me that they feel sleepier from full spectrum cbd than cbd or isolate and in that case you don't want to be taking it monday morning right um so let's say you're taking cbd oil monday morning you're taking it for stress you're taking it making sure that your energy levels are stable throughout the day um you don't have pain or sleep problems um then we i recommend sticking with cbd isolate just because thc can make you a little bit more relaxed um to compare it to just pure cbd as i'm saying all of this i just want you to keep in mind that we're all very different and we will all have a very different effect personally speaking if you ask me i will tell you that i don't feel the difference between full spectrum and isolate but that's just me some people feel huge difference and some people love full spectrum and some people love isolate so i don't think there's a right or wrong reason full spectrum is definitely gaining popularity um and we do have our full spectrum that you can also get in by following the link in the bio we ship in u.s and canada you can use the code youtube to get 10 off however i i will insist on saying that there is no better or worse just because it will depend on your lifestyle if um you feel like you're burnt out and you're really tired and you need you know three coffees to stay awake in the day um cb the full spectrum cbd oil might really like make you even more make might make you more relaxed and in that sense um it's a good thing like cbd will help you get over the adrenal fatigue and like will force you to rest so it's not a bad thing however you probably don't want that effect on monday morning and that being said if you are struggling with pain then i would go for cpg full spectrum another question i could commonly ask is whether they taste differently full spectrum versus isolate and yes they do full spectrum does have a little bit of a more like weed taste versus isolate um in a regular concentration doesn't taste like anything and if it's a high concentration it might taste a little bit better but full spectrum almost always has that tiny bit of a weed taste and smell no matter the concentration is so just keep that in mind so i hope you see how both full spectrum and isolate have a time and a place in our day i do highly recommend you trying both and seeing what which one works for you um comment below with which one worked for you better and if you see the difference and if you don't also let us know make sure to subscribe to our channel and i hope to see you in the next video", "pRQQqKUyIro": "[Music] hello my name is Jennifer Dixon with the green valley nation and today I want to give you a really quick review on the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD this is a highly concentrated product that claims to be great for sports recovery folks suffering from anxiety issues and insomnia and sleep related issues Charlotte's Web grows and processes all of their hemp in Colorado they use organic non-gmo and vegan friendly products to make a full spectrum CBD using co2 extraction methods the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD comes in chocolate mint flavor it has 60 milligrams of CBD per each suggested serving size of one milliliter there are two current sizes which are 30 milliliter and 100 milliliter which gives you at least in this bottle eighteen hundred milligrams and then in the 100 milliliter bottle it gives you 6,000 milligrams of CBD because this is a full-spectrum product there is a little bit of THC in it but it's less than 0.3 percent and so it won't get you high let's talk about the packaging on the outside of both the box and the bottle is a picture of the Rocky Mountains a kind of tribute to where they are located and on the outside of the box is a QR code it's on the bottom right hand side that you can scan and get the analysis and the information about the particular product you'll find that each bottle inside of the box is individually wrapped with cellophane so that you know that it's new and that it has the ingredients and it has the suggested serving size of one milliliter because this is a full spectrum oil you'll notice that it is a little bit darker and greener in color than an ISIL it might be that also means that the flavor is going to be a little stronger now Charlotte's Web does use a chocolate mint flavor in this product but that doesn't necessarily mean it covers up all of the flavors let's try it you're gonna put it underneath your tongue and you want to hold it for at least 30 to 60 seconds the first thing that you're gonna notice after taking this product is that even though it is supposed to be chocolate mint flavored it doesn't taste super chocolaty just a little bit minty you're gonna still taste the plant it's a it's a full spectrum product so it definitely has that plant flavor to it however within 15 minutes you're gonna notice that you're calmer that you can focus a little better and that if you have any residual pain because it's so concentrated this stuff knocks it out pretty well now for me I'm very sensitive and I react very very quickly and strongly to CBD so I don't need very much I use like a few drops maybe a quarter of a dropper full and that will last me all day for you if you are a little less sensitive to it or you are dealing with a higher amount of anxiety or pain you might have to use the full suggested serving size of one milliliter and it may not last you all day you might have to take this every four to six hours it really just depends on how your body reacts and responds to it and then how quickly it metabolizes the CBD you can also find that when you take this before bed it'll help you to relax and go to sleep I find that when I take it before sleeping it puts me to bed like that and then I can sleep the whole night which is glorious let's talk value here this is considered a premium product so it is definitely on the higher end of the price spectrum if this is not something that you're generally as concerned about then it's a perfect product for you however if you live on a pretty tight budget this could be a difficult addition to your daily routine if flavor is also a big thing for you this might not be the best option because it definitely does still have a strong earthy plant flavor there is a hint of but if you're very sensitive to taste in flavors then I would definitely not recommend this product for you overall I really do like the the Charlotte's Web maximum strength CBD oil it does what it says it's supposed to do help you to relax it definitely helps me to sleep and it definitely does help to manage my aches and pains I can't recommend it if you are looking for something that is on a budget because this is a little bit more on the higher end of the spectrum but it is a great product high quality every single time I take it it's the exact same and if you're not as sensitive to flavors it's going to get the job done pretty quickly because it's so concentrated so you might not need as much thank you so much for taking the time to watch this review once again my name is Jennifer Dixon with greenvalley nation and if you liked it make sure you subscribe to this channel for the most comprehensive library of hemp products thanks again see you soon bye bye [Music]", "YPsJctUFfUo": "hey there this is Rick I hope everyone's having a great day this is the next video in my herbalism basics series and this video is how to make an ointment now in order to engage with the healing and health giving properties of herbs we need to prepare them into a format we can physically use in an effective way and one of the ways we can do that is by making an ointment and these can also be referred to as balms ourselves now haribol augments are used primarily to form a protective barrier over the skin rather than to be absorbed into the skin a lip balm is a good example of this point iment helped to keep heat and moisture in so they are particularly useful for applying to the skin surrounding areas of aches and pains arthritis and rheumatism sufferers will especially benefit from this heat retaining action on the other hand if you want a remedy that needs to be absorbed into the skin then you may be better off with a horrible cream now I've actually made a video on how to make a horrible cream and you can see it by clicking the link here or at the end of the video now horrible pointment are made using infused oils beeswax or other kinds of solid fats are melted into the oil and then poured into jars and left to cool the result is a solid or slightly soft pointment depending on the ingredients used now a fairly popular average ratio and general guide is one cup of oil to one ounce of beeswax the ingredients will be different each time depending on what pointment you're making and what recipe you're following oh now it's really really important that you never make a preparation from a herb that you don't have sufficient background information on or understand its potential strength also some infused oils are safe to be used on wounds or broken skins but others must not be used in that way so it's important that you know these things about your hubs before you start working with them oh okay so here's how to make a simple point Minh now this will involve heating an infused oil in order to melt additional ingredients into it so you do have to be very careful about overheating the oil so for this method you need to use indirect heat and you can do that by using a double boiler which is a glass or ceramic bowl sat on top of a pan of boiling water you can also buy an actual double boiler system which is like two glass sauce pans that sit on top of each other now the secret of the double boiler is to only allow the steam to heat the glass bowl above not the boiling water itself so here's how we do it take an already horribly infused oil and add it to the bowl on your double boiler now add a block or pieces of beeswax and use the universal ratio of one ounce of beeswax to one cup of oil allow the bee's wax to melt gently into the oil and stir them together well once the beeswax is melted switch off the heat now this is the time to add any essential oils that you may wish to put into the mix stir well and allow the melted ointment to cool slightly and then pour it into clean right jars before it has the opportunity to set if it does start to set too soon just reapply gentle heat again real iqua fight now do be aware of leaving this point Minh in hot places such as on say a car dashboard because it will become liquid again if it gets reheated now as far as shelf life goes pointment can keep anything from three months up to a year all depending on the ingredients and the oils used so that's it for this how to make a horrible augment video make sure you look out for my other perhaps specific how to make herbal preparation videos where I will show you other methods of preparing herbs into remedies thanks for watching see you in the next video you", "9yNV3XQdusY": "[Music] hello and welcome back we are on episode 17 of the podcast we are live from Detroit and we're here to talk to you about the effects of cannabis topicals I'm Jen and I am Earl and this is the podcast episode 17 Wow we are getting up there is exciting it is we are here to take different cannabis topics about canvas products about cannabis itself and we go out we study that topic and we talk about the topic so we can have a well balanced understanding about canvas and campus tommy's yep so we take a new topic every week we talk about advocacy science a lot of history isn't history some do yourself yup a little bit about the business some business stuff we get into politics science science science is the big thing science is a big thing every I feel like every episode has some science and I yeah I do I do I do I feel like this that's very very important and we get into just like you said just a little bit of politics you're just a little bit of politics we have a lot to cover to them we do I'm excited let's go right into it I'm gonna go first with my new story I love my news story today and by the way our nut news is sponsored by tickety app.com teddy is going to be the first app where you can journal how cannabis and cannabis products affects you and you can also share that journal but also 5 products based upon the desired effect that you want yep so go to tickity app t IG g i-- t y app calm and put your email in you could be one of the first users to actually use the app and hopefully it launches by April 20th onsen Nook knows no she's gotta have one okay seth rogen have you heard about this he's launching a new weed friend cuz of course he is called a houseplant really launching it and Columbia with his partner camera versus partners name but read the article it's in there and they're doing houseplant sativa houseplant indica and house plant hybrid those are going to be their brands they start Hospit whoa whose supper alg\u00fan who's that he comedian he's a white comedian he's in a lot of movies um so he was then what's the one with the fraternity you know you were watching the girl 1 oh I think that's him is that the main character guy I think his name yeah ok I think that's him ok ok ok ok he's in a lot of stuff yeah he's pineapple Express ah ok ok ok so you play a lot of papaya yes every movie he's in he's related and he's a stoner in it in some aspect so it kind of makes sense that he's doing it so I thought that was a lot of fun stuff so a lot of celebrities and kind of do some branding and all that jazz yeah if you're gonna do some branding celebrities also do some social justice advocacy as well okay be about your business don't just come here and make some money come on coming here and also help the movement yes yeah I would agree cool that's a good story this yeah so I'm gonna talk about one main topic and then we're gonna blaze through perfect different ones I like that so the first one we talk about is the Michigan Commission all right we talked about it before Bobby found his show it's about driving while high okay so the Michiganders a commission on michigan's commission the state should the state should not set driving limit of marijuana that was the outcome of this commission okay so governor Snyder had before he left wanted to have a commission where people will go and study the effects of cannabis and see if there was a line on how we can measure all right well this is if you pass disappoint you are too impaired to drive so kind of like the alcohol limit of being point oh eight yes they're trying to find the marijuana limit right now trying to find this numerical number that just doesn't exist say cuz what affects you is gonna be different than me exactly there's not like a percentage Colorado is trying to do that they're trying to get people to volunteer to drive hi to some yeah well and that's this I don't think it's ever gonna I think cops won't have to do cop work yes you're gonna have to be able to see if someone is at driving recklessly pull them over have a conversation your sobriety test and then determine if the person is impaired or not mhm I don't think you have to have this numerical number cuz when you do that it's just it's it's setting a scary precedent because I could be over the limit just because I am a heavy smoker yeah and I got up in the morning and I went to work and I got pulled over and they decided to test me and I'm over the limit because I'm a heavy smoker yeah I agree so I I mean I I just think this was uh just to see a logical response I like that that's cool to how we are putting together marijuana policies yes made in Michigan it's I think that I mean we get a little bit of politics a lot of politics we talk about just feel like know what is you talking about but this is just like it's just common it just makes sense right I agree so that's cool yeah none of that all right but if you are driving reckless you still could get but that's yeah I was gonna say and that's kind of like with everything you know just drive safe and okay yeah I agree and I think what you said earlier was uh the first time to cover the story was just like get my way I'm gonna place through a couple articles you got the links in the show notes you can read the four articles for yourself next one is coming up March 31st fifty unlicensed stores we have to shut down yeah which they they had about two years I was gonna say they had plenty of time to this is now seems to be a very firm March 31st so which means it probably about a hundred retail stores or so okay or provisional centers put it in perspective at one time there was 300 yeah that's in Detroit so not just Detroit like now the entire state's gonna have a hundred so there's a limited access yeah for a little bit but if you know someone will not so know someone there you go all right cool all right um local crime data shows this is from Boston 25 News local crime data shows recreational pot shops are good neighbors yes I've heard about this where in places that there's pot shops the local area actually has a decrease in crime holy shiz like who would have guessed wait a minute mean that is the biggest argument is that all marijuana is coming here let me I'm going down it's just like listen this they've trying to put fear in you so that they can control you and manipulate you okay so don't fall for that all right let the love walking love not fear okay yeah it's a lot more beneficial towards life but yeah this so this is a great article to debunk that and even an upcoming presidential elections they gonna use the same thing yeah crank crank crank what this is a great article he's proving that it's the White House and federal scientists are pushing the myth that marijuana is laced with fitna so yeah there was myth kids fear trying to control people that a lot of marijuana out here that could be given out to kids at Halloween could be the lace with a sorry that's mine yes 30,000 chicken $30 if I gave your child that please tell me cuz I want it back or you gotta pay for it so up to some shady stuff in the White House under individual ones administration so I'm just saying oh say no yeah another one I want to say no for president individual number one people are lining up to grow marijuana research but President individual number one Justice Department won't let them Oh meaning that the DEA was just about what we need more research me Maurice everybody need more review we know more about marijuana than we do pubic hairs okay well you know enough about this okay but you keep crying about research but now there are causing institutions who are trying to do research but they are slowing down on applications so read the story kukuku marijuana cup marijuana come I'm trying to place through this okay the legalization of marijuana go marijuana legalization vote canceled due to lack of support in New Jersey Senate we talked about in the past yeah that New Jersey is going to be one of the next days that have recreational no it died is not over but retarted was very interesting because there's a lot of actual proponents against the bill because it actually includes social justice provisions oh sorry it was like automatic expungement there was an application process that will actually include people who have been disproportionately affected by the war yes but people push back the kiss that oh man okay medical license growers in Oklahoma are it is booming in Oklahoma pretty much gonna open up in pretty much in Oklahoma for medical marijuana if you have twenty five hundred dollars in your bank account you can utilize it really it was that free there's over 1,200 right now crawl licenses have been issued that's awesome their program has been up and running for nine months that's awesome put in a comparison with state of Michigan we've been doing this for almost three years we've gone at two in a December we got three years going on we have about less than one hundred girl Isis there's over 1,200 and Oklahoma right now it's like a thousand retail store licenses and their market is like like the size of Detroit right it's just crazy so Oklahoma Guam they actually are going to legalize cannabis is actually at the governor's desk he'll be the first u.s. territory read that one and then legalizing activist push marijuana industry to uphold social responsibilities please read this it is very important that we support businesses that are also supporting social equity and social justice so that businesses actually do do that please be conscious other people that you do spin your dollar with because if they don't care you should not carry it it um and on I say Mel men hold ninety-three percent of Canadian cannabis boardroom positions men hold ninety-three percent of that so Thomas Leggett it's not just colored this is men and women as well once I have an opportunity as well I have a seat at the table and make a difference in this industry yeah man actually I'd be a lot better a lot more women we're actually women are pretty smart yeah last thing man wanted okay help the DEA here people wanted the DEA someone they need someone to burn 1000 pounds per hour okay yes the oppose it oppose right now they're in need they need later or something that can control and burn up to 1,000 pounds a week this was putting out time on what you're spending your money and resources on who could I know giggle a steak cheese alright give it to Oklahoma that was the nut news please read the links as now I'm talking slower alright are you ready for the main topic we are ready for the main topic cannabis topicals we are gonna talk about this topic was I thought when we talk about the topic you know we're time okay we've got a lot of questions about topical this is gonna be a topic oh cool topic all right oh my god I know when I was researching I was like [ __ ] like I was still researching this morning me too yep and I up to like a couple hours and I was like I need to cut this yeah it was just like okay we have a lot to cover we're gonna try to get into this please bear with us but yes we're gonna talk about the effects of cannabis tapa cold we got some topicals to show you guys - yeah top of course with testimonials we got a whole bunch of things let's start off with I guess kind of cannabis topical 101 all right what are cannabis I was gonna say topical so it's something you rub it on your skin like lotion cream sauce like bath bombs almost so things that you put externally yes and there's an image for that too now if you warm so dad echoes can't forms a topical so a lotions creams bath salts bombs so you can infuse any of that with cannabis and then there forever becomes a cannabis topical okay so that's what we're talking about I think the next thing is to talk about kind of how does marijuana infused topicals actually work yes and we're gonna do kind of like a literally a 60 second review on this please check out episode number six in our cannabis therapy series about how cannabis affects the body we actually get a lot into the endocannabinoids system but pretty much real quick we have an indica system that's one of 12 systems in our body that goes along with the cardiovascular system this skeletal system the endocrine system look at that I get a little proud alright cray cray so the endocannabinoid system is is is responsible for bringing our body back to balance between all those systems okay and for example use the example okay you get off balance because you have maybe there's a lot of activity within your brain so you have seizures so using cannabis can help bring that activity don't be balanced and that's how it actually helps you not have caesars so that's kind of how it works so even though we produced endocannabinoids we can also accept outside cannabinoids right and those ice outside cannabinoids from a plant we call photo can happen oh yes so we have an endocannabinoid deficiency so we have a low level of endocannabinoids which means we're kind of off balance we can increase our cannabinoids by receiving outside cannabinoids and those from plants are called fuddle cannabinoids and those actually found in cannabis yes it's also important to know we have receptors that's how we can kind of find she didn't like my first analogy last week but analogy is we have receptors all over our body in our skin and that's how outside cannabinoids signal actually they plug into those receptors and that's how we communicate mm-hmm so the ones that we're gonna be talking about are the cb2 receptors cuz those are on the external organs yeah so you can have cb2 receptors on the inside of your body did you know that when it's on the outside of your organs and your skin is technically an organ so that's why we have them on the outside that's it there's one of systems the skin system is a skin system so I wanted the organs it's an organ is it really yeah your skin isn't into the largest organ on your body I might have made that okay I know it's an organ though and so that's why it has cb2 receptors and that's what actually I mean it makes it was amazing you got a cut and it just like it starts to kill it so repair itself and it's just I got right it just has this system yeah God is yeah what a creator all right going on - all right so how THC and CBD work together yes so we understand how it kind of works with a body not byte graphic and yes thereby graphic is actually kind of talks about the entourage effect okay and the analogy is that the sum of his parts is not greater than a whole okay the whole is greater than the sum of his parts you take a bicycle there's over 800 parts you could break that apart but if you just take the handlebars you know imagine giving your child for Christmas you know I'm gonna get you a bike and then you know opens up the gif and it's like handlebars and it's just like that's it one mono with this you know me but when you put those handlebars with all the other parts now she's you know I'm pretty happy girl right oh my goodness of course it was pink all right so so that's how it works oh so when Tom I see THC and CBD it also works as an entourage effect and when I say entourage effect THC and CBD are cannabinoids that are found within the plant booze also there's a hundred different cannabinoids hundreds I was also terpenes and there's also flavor noise so all that work that all that is part of the a hundred pieces of that bike and when they all are together you get the full effect when you isolate them they're not as good so that's how THC and CBD work with it and we're gonna move on to kind of why would you need time for those pretty yes it's like what are the usage of them I think so some of the conditions and system are symptoms if you have this if you have arthritis if you have chronic pain from could be a sports injury you have inflammation if you have neuropathic pain that is huge with a lot of a lot of medicines and a lot of therapies now are not really helping my kid we have really pinched nerve zoom out of nerve right so if you have that are just kind of like you're stuck with us right burns severe burns a skier ear taste secure skin irritations that skin irritation together skin infection skin cancerous you have anything else you've got fibromyalgia I didn't want to say that out loud because I didn't pronounce it thank you yeah fibromyalgia that's like the constant page pain that you feel Lady Gaga has that so if you've heard of it before that's what Lady Gaga has it's new joints it's just constant pain all over your body they don't really know what causes it but it's just you're always in pain there's really nothing that helps it okay yeah so if you haven't this and you're in that position you know we're gonna give more information but think of this is why we're talking about canvas topic and I also saw that it helps with headaches yes I think that topicals are helping with headaches surprisingly and let's see what else p.s psoriasis I was gonna say that too I'm really good at pronouncing those was phonetic so yeah so those know if you have I mean keep paying attentions because that is kind of what this is for okay we're gonna kind of talk about the benefits later and how this actually can can relieve you but this is who we're trying to talk to about even if you're not about you know using smoking cannabis topicals could be a solution yeah I mean so like think about if you use icy hot all the time yeah this is a replacement for icy have almost only really we have a topical that we're gonna show today that I use for pain relief all the time that's what's on has pinched nerves in his back he's got a really messed up back and herniated discs and he uses this and it works better for him then I see how it ever does what's up and we're gonna do arm so now we're gonna do some testimonials too but like say okay we talk to you right now you have arthritis you're interested in topicals that are infused by cannabis where you get it from how do you find it not you're in a pursuit of looking for this and if you're if you're in a legal by state or a medicinal where they have medical marijuana or records from marijuana there are retail stores where you can acquire this or if you aren't in a state where's medical you can have a caregiver you can access that but unfortunately may still limit access it is to one of the most beneficial ways that people can actually receive relief so that's why I also wanna talk about do-it-yourself - yeah some of the do yourself stuff would be olive oils coconut oils and alcohol are some of the easiest bases we're gonna do a show at some point and show how to make it but if you just had you know found some cannabis trim just got that donate from someone you put that in a crock pot with some olive oil or coconut oil or even alcohol let that cook for about eight hours on warm and then strain that there you go that's what that's it you know it's like you could do it yeah and then and then when it comes to to dosing when you're actually using that I'm the great thing about the topic OHS is that they're not psychoactive not you're not gonna get high so you can if you put too much on it's just like putting on too much lotion just keep rubbing it and you'll be perfectly fine you're not gonna get high from it not and I shall just call myself because it's not that it's not psychoactive it's not it you don't feel yeah the impairing yeah it's not it's not impaired because we still have the receptors and it's going you still want to have to get relief yes is that in since its psychoactive but you're not high you can drive you're totally fine all right you don't feel messed up so somewhat dosing is not like no if you're over consuming I add about something like that there's no peak point exactly so you kind of plant as much as you need to to get to the point where you want to be and there's like no you can never like overdo it so like if you do it in an hour later you do it again you're you're fine it's not gonna be addictive or anything you could just take a bath for hours and just soak yourself in all right so say you actually find somebody's topic was right now there's some there's some warnings we actually want to kind of yeah warn people about what to look for we're coming out to look for because not all products are the same mm-hmm they're so in the reason why they're not the same because right now there is no standard of labeling all right it's not like there's a FDA regulation right now on these type of calls there are actually gonna come up with rules but even if you're you know just in a medical state is just you may say this hasn't been infused by cannabis so you want to watch out so you make sure you do have a clean a safe and we want to talk about some ingredients kind of boiling I think artificial ingredients and colors you kind of want to avoid that yeah there's no real reason to use it like it's gonna look how it's gonna look you don't need to diet right they just kind of let it be natural price I think that's the key you just want to look for if you can pronounce the name that is actually on the ingredients or listen in the event just I wouldn't I wouldn't use that topic where you're kind of defeating the purpose of looking for a natural way to get relief yeah so yeah I think that's my kind of no petroleum fragrances chemicals minerals all those things scent synthetic ingredients haja native ingredients all those are counteractive right to what you're trying to achieve so you do want to read the labels and watch those as well and then look for out the natural basis cocoa butter shea butter extra virgin olive oil and I think I said no those were the only ones I put on my skin yeah like you can feel like other types of oil but like you cook with that true true true and then also on some labels you can you can see how its processed - mm-hmm so if it's you you want to look for things that are whole plan yeah we talked about the entourage effect talked about the whole bicycle so things I say full spectrum yes things I say whole plan or total plan those are the topicals that you're gonna receive the most bang for your buck right okay so I think that's key and then if it's quality tested that's a plus but if again if you if you can make yourself then you kind of know if it's where came from cool alright now let's go on through discovery medical and therapeutic benefits from camera stop yes ah now we can put up the medical benefits of TAC top of clothes from Natalie you put that one up antibacterial I did not know that it was anti I always like thought it would be because kind of like makes sense that it would be yeah it's like it's marijuana but I never really knew that antiviral anti-tumor you know analgesic analgesic no analgesic okay yeah GES I gonna do J no don't okay something stuff yeah okay pain reliever anti antioxidant then also you can pull up the next one Nelly benefits topicals anti-inflammatory pain reliever Nero Nero controller so there's a lot of benefits of topicals yes antispasmodic you kept skipping happen I'll choose my words wisely and you can see these two so we're kind of pulling them up and they're probably going through a little fast but if you go to g3 Omnicom /resources this is on there yes we have a whole handout for how cannabis topicals affects you yeah thank you for that plot shameless plug by the way

testimonies of just CVD isn't it's just not gonna do anything but you add a little bit TAC voila okay that's what happens all right so top nine benefits by treating or reducing conditions I don't know

about to get to the next stage for the night you know I'm doing anything and I want to hit one the bathroom and just apply some olive oil infuse on my wing way I did so apply my wing wing it didn't say that I was gonna see you know what was gonna happen you know I want it I want to unbiased feedback okay I didn't want it like say something and then it's like you had that placebo effect and this is like so long story short and it wasn't a short story by the way if I was to get a Google review for my performance that night I would have got 5 stars I got 5 stars and I have not even released a sequel weapon and a secret weapon was the infused olive oil I tell you right now it was it was it was which would your wife agree with you yes okay yes she I feel like that's the most American part to me like I could give it a minute okay the Google review or would have been her okay all right it would've been all right no not me personally of course I'm talking about you know one minute all right so yeah so that's my yeah I I will testify fact topicals really do enhance sexual pleasure cuz it increases like your sensitivity yeah and I'm gonna be kissing to the bloodstream through there as well cuz think like sexually I know it's just terrible but STI is that's how they're transferred it's because they're you have openings to the pores yeah so yeah it was a great yeah it was my secret weapon super weapon so hey pro tip semi-pro my star Austar team - all right cool you can move some wife's at home like shaking her she watches this show I'm actually using that I have that you know you can be some army you never bad right you don't watch my show oh I'm holding it I'm holding it I'm just waiting for my mommy's you come at me I'm like mo you don't have a watch my show you don't love me yeah I'm gonna say it was okay what she probably watching right now this one yeah alright so we're going on some questions and answers yeah maybe yes bother pulling these up do you want to start showing some ones oh wait so as she pulls up questions and answers I am going to do a little show in toke [Music] so this is the cell that I was talking about that we use you wish we had smell-o-vision I know it smells so it smells kind of like like beeswax if you will yeah it smells really really nice it's super in the scene you see that definitely recommended so he makes um honey if to which is why I think it's funny he has these calves yeah yes oh he's that do it yeah cuz actually smells like cuz that yeah I thought you got it yeah so yeah don't ever that's cool we got some primo buddy alright from my friends over a primo buddy now you're honest and saying why is it looking backwards so this is olive coconut oil so this is coconut oil that can be used as a song as you can see this is green and it's thick you can smell this - smells good right there hi Janis okay so you could take this and you can apply it alright on your skin you can see it's not uh it's oily but it doesn't turn your skin green okay my mother had the most non painful thumb ever all righty do you need a hand good next thing I'm gonna show we talked about skin cancers so this right here is Simpson oil still about promote buddy this right here as you can see a little bit tar this is tar right here only but as you can see I'm apply some of this on my it does leave a little wow green which one is that yeah so this is what Rick Simpson oil he had skin cancer he applied this on the area where he had cancer and with that I believe was within a year that tumor and that skin infection was going on so marijuana its medical so this is uh again this is again it may be nighttime if you want apply that unless you like that look you can have that green that's gonna be a new style yeah the twenties all right so this is olive oil so see this is more liquidy it does have a little bit of a color but I'm also like super super light so that's not good so people I was gonna say well I think would definitely make you burn so maybe through like a bomb or through so it kind of rubs in nice though you can't really tell anymore yes my fingers it's definitely and I like spreads smells alright and then the last thing is the CBD oil here oh this is pretty oh this is bright now it says total plant right oh it says total plant I can't really give you any feedback on my own what do you just like sprayed on you yeah what is the actual spray they're kind of saying it's a oral spray but you can also comply as a topical okay yeah so you just kind like a weird double to show-and-tell yeah it's a spray just pointing at your mouth okay couldn't you haven't used it yet no no I don't know cuz it's so CBD but its total plant so yeah and that's yeah so we talked about if it just says CBD they're using it as a marketing tool it does say total plant which means okay must be other cannabinoids or are the flavonoids with that as well but I don't know but this is something I do offer to my patients as a caregiver if they do so choose and soon as that tickity app is up and going will have my feedback they have feedback because that way the patients can actually journal um how that seed oil affected them and then they can rate the different effects from scope and I can then give better recommendations for the people so cool alright now there's someone talk I like the show and talk was any questions no there were no questions no no I know hopefully be just being is so informant we are so informative know that we're smart they're good key takeaways key takeaways um so my key takeaways where I actually have never known anyone to have sex using any kind of cannabis related topical so that's cool that it actually works cuz you've read about it online yeah but you never know if it really works so it's cool that there's like a real person I was daring enough to try and that's what she took from this a whole episode that's everything that we know that's my key takeaway I think mine would be all the benefits but I think also I would have thought okay maybe just a TAC or something like that or CBD was cool as a topical but it's the whole plant still still pleasing that's kind of like that's like a whole theme that we're seeing is everything that has a benefit from cannabis like the whole plant is what you really want right which was why I was so hard for people to actually try to patent certainly because you really can't patent a plant right you try to patent some of the extractions of the compounds and if you just extract one compound it's just it's just got handlebars right bicycles so cool we're gonna blow on never do that oh oh man we got everything done so we got the thanks to everyone before we go into things I do want to say we're into our topic for next week so to join us in pre think of questions how to smoke concentrates good one it is talk about how to smoke we're gonna talk about different forms of concentrates yes measurements as well especially if you're going to a dispensary for the first time we're trying to use it you want to be familiar with the lingo yes as far as the weights and also what the current prices are as well mm-hm so send us your questions and we'll get to them in the next show yes and please you too we can talk about it earlier yeah but check out any past episodes on our YouTube channel g3 cannabis therapy has

tobacco university video we're going to be exploring the cbd based hemp cannabis giving you a little bit of background of the summary of the story of charlotte's web as charlotte here is thought to be one of the great contributors to science to be able to really help support and really start a whole wave looking really at cbd for potential medical treatments so first off well who is charlotte figgy here and we see her pictured here she was a child with uh catastrophic type of epsilopsy she became a symbol of positive impacts that cbd can have on individuals particularly young children in this example charlotte had juvederm which is a rare form of epilepsy sadly she did pass away in april 7th in the year 2020 at only the age of 13. her cause of death is thought to be pneumonia but in that short life that she did have she did have a great contribution here to the cannabis industry so she had that rare form of epilepsy which is basically that duvet syndrome which is a kind of seizures that start very early on during the first year of life this is kind of showing brain wave patterns of a seizure child at the age of six was having a seizure about every 30 minutes so not only were they potentially very severe but they were reoccurring at a very short intervals so over two years her parents paige and matt had tried many different things they sought out a lot of advice and medical kind of advice from different doctors and they tried a whole bunch of different things you know diet alterations acupuncture drugs with really no changes from any of the above really sadly at the peak trout was having about 300 seizures a week or about two every hour and at certain times was not talking not moving and then doctors really were looking at some very experimental type options however half a world away matt the father was deployed to afghanistan and he was researching online and he found evidence that candice may help reduce seizures so it's kind of just he was in afghanistan and a lot of areas where potentially cannabis or certain forms of cannabis may have originated there's a kind of connection there we thank him for his service as well uh and this this leads us to the stanley brothers so how are they involved with charlotte's story well this daily brothers were marijuana growers in colorado and they were cross-breeding a stream of marijuana that's high in cbd and low in thc and remember thc is that psychoactive ingredient their focus was to breed down the thc and breed up in concentration the cbd they were able to achieve a cb level of about 21 while still mean maintaining a thc level under one percent and that's a very stark difference between those two cannabinoid levels the reason was not for recreational smoking which is typically associated with thc but for the potential for medical benefits so the stanley brothers were really seeking the highest grade of kind of medical cannabinoids and here looking at the cbd breeding that up in concentration while reducing the thc levels so we're looking at this kind of flower extract extraction so the mother went to a local denver colorado dispensary and purchased some high cbd variety cannabis the owner were actually surprised of the request since nobody really wanted it because it didn't have really any effect that high cbd level doesn't really have that psychoactive high that low thc and high cbd really lacks that recreational kind of psychoactive high thought to be potentially with what was called r4 at the time had a cbd level of 17.61 and a thc level under one percent of only 0.76 percent however it is important to note that even 0.76 percent by the current uh 2018 farm bill would still be considered federally illegal or marijuana at that point and the mother after taking the flower home extracted the cbd from that flower kind of extracted that particular compound now the impact of the actual treatment the day that she was given that charlotte was given the cbd oil treatment under the tongue she did not have a seizure that day which continued into the night and beyond overall it was a sharp decline in seizures it was very notable and again very positive here she went from having 300 seizures a week to only having one a week just from this cbd treatment she went from being on a feeding tube this is charlotte to eating on her own and she started talking and also walking on her own so this really was an eye-opening experience at large in the medical industry as well that cbd treatment may really provide a lot of potential when we're looking at seizures at this in this example so looking at does charlotte's web equals cw2a as this was according to the u.s patent and trademark office joe stanley filed a joel stanley's filed a patent application in may 2018 on behalf of his company also named charlotte's web so in the public documents stanley describes a plant type capable of producing 6.24 cbd content and 0.27 percent thc content so you're looking at these numbers and from what i just pre described say it's much lower but keep in mind here this is staying with or under that federal limit of 0.3 percent thc so of course the cbd conservation was reduced but still having 6.24 it's a very high producing cbd strain here and still staying with under that federal limit so the patent was actually approved in july of 2019 and if you search it on the internet you likely can probably find this patent the new cultivar c w 2 a was asexually reproduced via stem cuttings of vegetative and or flowering plants and cloning by the inventor and the inventors greenhouses nurseries fields and our facilities in colorado springs colorado according to the patent asexual clones from the original source have been tested in greenhouses nurseries fields the properties of each clone from its cultivar were found to be transmissible by such asexual reproduction the cultivar is stable and reproduces true to type in successful generations of asexual reproduction so this kind of disproves or shows here that it wasn't just a one-off plant it wasn't just one unique individual it is reproducible through asexual reproduction typically using vegetative propagation known as clones so plant patent specifics well the patent was issued by cw holdings as a plant patent not a broad broader utility patent so we want to be careful in the definition between those two this means it is good only for legal protection against a competitor growing the same cultivar from clone even though this may be overall limited protection it is groundbreaking and that is the first and only plant patent for hemp cultivar issued within the united states so this again shows you what the utility patent covers i'll give you kind of some descriptions here as far as looking at you know the utility patent this case dependent and kind of include all of this phenotypes cultivar just to give you that general overview here but the plant patent specifics here and just keep in mind that this is not a broader utility patent they were just looking for that kind of way of protecting for a competitor growing the same clone the value of having this patent here you know what's the advantage what's why would go through this process the patent doesn't prevent others from developing their own strain of symbol characteristics so that's an important note the goal from the breeder standpoint though is to protect the strain you have put time into and resources and developing protect your specific strain here the patent does not prevent a competitor competition in general but can provide an advantage in the market so that's why it's advantageous for them to go through and have that patent for their plant the specifics of charlotte's web so is a sativa-based strain with the state 13 cbd however the patent does state officially 6.24 cbd and that thc below that zero point three percent these unique uh and proprietary genetics are used by charlotte's web the company to create extracts for a variety of health and wellness products contrary to popular belief charlotte's web products are hemp derived and are non-intoxicating they lack any strong levels of thc new consumers should consult their doctor with any medical concerns but this i felt important to kind of address this story it did get a national publication and really gave cannabis really kind of ideas in the market to allow doctors to look at it further and really to investigate the cbd for its potential medical benefits and charlotte again sadly in her short life there was able really to kind of change radically change the cannabis industry in people's perceptions of cannabis which has led to hopefully continuation for it to be used to help other individuals going forward", "3NFrhEOzckY": "how CBD can help with your back pain back pain is something that can affect your life in several ways it may cause job-related disability increase your missed work days

a look at this new treatment a growing number of people are calling a miracle drug it's an oil cannabis oil or CBD oil and it's legal in every state in fact the state of Tennessee actually licenses hemp farms and processors you may have seen the ads touting this oil for relief from chronic pain I have to admit I was surprised at what I found when I took a closer look Karen Smith's life changed for the better because of her dog I have a dog who has highly anxious at her wits end she gave her a few drops of CBD oil she just like found and is relaxed the former hairdresser suffered from chronic shoulder pain and a terrible case of plantar fasciitis she figured it couldn't hurt to try the oil herself karen says she takes about five drops of the oil under her tongue every day within like three weeks my shoulder was 90% better and in six weeks my foot was almost completely it was gone CBD stays for cannabis oil is extracted from the hip plant marijuana's nonthreatening cousin the active ingredient is THC like that found in marijuana but at much lower doses it does not make you hot cannabis oil is legal in every state it looks like marijuana as you can see from these pictures that lucky leaf processors and him FFA's farms shared with us we found some doctors in Memphis are already urging their patients to try CBD oil instead of opioids I like your socks you're showing off your shoes today dr. Robert Burns is a gerontologist in Memphis he researched these oils he says they have a viable biologic basis for working for people who have pain either neuropathic pain they've got a disc that's bad or they've got bad arthritis it does seem to help I was totally desperate Cheri Henson went to a series of doctors for nearly two years to find relief from nerve pain nothing was working and I didn't like taking the muscle relaxers and the opioids I didn't like to wait me do I was worried I was gonna get addicted she saw Karen Smith's Facebook post about her experience and decided she had nothing to lose a few weeks later overall I'm pretty much pain free Smith and Henson agree there is a stigma about using cannabis oil because of its relationship to marijuana but they agree with dr. burns that with this legal option we may not need medical marijuana or this may be a good alternative and probably a cheaper alternative downside dr. burns says side effects can include dizziness or nausea and he has concerns because sales of this oil are not regulated it is buyer beware when buying CBD or hemp oil dr. Byrne says make sure the product has been verified by an outside company and pay attention to the numbers on the bottle like 501,000 the higher the number the more concentrated the CBD oil is so if you're buying a thousand milligrams in a bottle it's twice as strong as a 500 so you're not going to use the same dose he advises start with the lowest dose and stop using if you feel dizzy or ill it doesn't work for everyone and it costs between 70 and upwards of $100 a bottle so do your research and talk to your health care provider to make sure it doesn't work against your current medications for more information on CBD oil and even how to get a license to grow hemp in Tennessee go to our website Fox 13 Memphis dot-com I'm Valerie Calhoun for Fox 13", "B1BLFQr01sA": "[Music] hi welcome to another episode of talking with docs I'm dr. Paul's alzo and I'm dr. Brad weenie okay so today's topic we're gonna cover what is the best topical ointment or cream to use on my arthritis or my sore muscles or bones a lot of people are looking for the answer to this so stay tuned okay first of all what why do we like using topical treatments for like arthritis of the knee or the hand or sprains and strains because it smell good they smell awesome it's not the answer they can smell good but the main reason like topicals is because they're safe yes totally agree I love using topicals if they can reduce the number of pills any of my patients have to take especially my older patients love topical I have some elderly patients that take so many pills I'm like do you have room for lunch yeah like you're on so many different medications you have time to eat lunch cause you got that set up there you got yeah the whole tray opened day one day two day three and day one's got like 50 pills in it it's confusing I can I'm on one medication I'm gonna say that I supposed to take every day I can't remember to take it so if I start twitching or fall asleep our talks without and take my medication okay all right so we like them because they're safe anti-inflammatories and your topical presenta if you took an anti-inflammatory pill yep like an aspirin type of pill there's some risks with that yeah I worry about my stomach I might worry about bleeding I might worry about blood pressure kidney function how it affects my diabetes so many factors yeah I mean these complications are rare and those medications are very effective in a supervised setting however it's always saver do not take it yeah because they carry some risk okay so we like topicals because they're safe okay we like topicals because they're effective yes they deliver the treatment right to the source of the pain right you've got a sore thumb you're putting it on your thumb sore knee you're putting it on your knee right instead of taking it having it go through your entire blood stream to get to that part you're putting it right on that part and science is more organized now too so they do studies to show that using a top of a head some medicine in it versus a topical that's just a placebo the one with medicine actually works and they've tried lots of different kinds of things so we have evidence that topicals are effective yeah okay I like that they're versatile you could put a whole bunch of different things in the top of them multimodal that's the buzzword right there now our pain gurus and our specialists say that we have to use a multi-modal approach to pain which means don't just use one thing I use a bunch of different types of things and you can get topicals that are multi modal and when you say multiple you mean like anti-inflammatory muscle relaxant nerve agent local anesthetic there's a whole bunch of different choices right right okay so that's why we like topical so what is going on is it easy to use your heard use they're very hard to use because you have to put a DAB on your finger and put it on the spot I'm just kidding they're easy to use easy it's very easy to use okay and you know guys like us we don't look at the instruction manual you know I mean first you I'm putting together a table or a desk I don't look at the instruction no and I usually put together wrong yeah except for when I'm doing surgery of course I look at the instruction manual oh yeah okay so that's why we like tacos now what is the best topical to use I think the answer is that it really depends right on a whole bunch of things what's in it yep we're gonna give you the tools here to understand what to look for inside the topical that might work okay yep so first of all I think it's important for it to have an anti inflammatory component to it something in there that's an anti inflammatory I would agree I like that I like some type of anesthetic in mine yeah something that's gonna sort of numb calm the nerves down yep and just give some kind of anesthetic and then you can get in to have something in there that might act on the muscle yum that's gonna relax the muscle in the air cuz you get some muscle spasm around these sort of musculoskeletal pains and then I'd say the last thing is that a lot of pain pathology relates to functions of the nervous system maybe kind of a specific effect on the nerves yeah so if you can find a top well has a few different components in it that can attack the pain pathways from those different angles that's gonna be your best one and ultimately because they're so safe and easy to use yeah you can try a few different ones and see which one works for you yes okay some work better on with some people some work better on other people and it is a little bit of trial and error for sure yeah I did the other thing that seems to be coming along the pipe is DVD and things like cannabis type products in a topical is potentially gonna be the future of some of these types ooh yeah that is that is something coming down the pipe there hasn't been a ton of evidence yet on that because they're just gaining approval over time a year or two however there are some studies showing that there are some studies showing they're gonna look at that question yeah down the road I'm gonna go get a topical we're big fans of using topical treatments for musculoskeletal problems we've sort of given you the idea what what our take is and what a good one would be do it with the supervision of your darker though to ask you know ask suggestions mention your what you're thinking about and then you can kind of decide together sure you often you need your doctor because some of these are over-the-counter but the over-the-counter ones usually aren't multimodal and usually aren't very strong that's right I'm gonna put the prescription strength ones usually get the drug levels the topical drug levels up to a point where they can actually have a good effect yeah so hey if you like this video

isn't the biggest CBD company but if you go online into any CBD a community like go and reddit you would think that this is the most popular brand why well I bought this bottle of 750 milligrams of CBD for only $32 that's extremely cheap but is it too good to be true let's see the lab results they claim 750 milligrams of CBD and we found 794 milligrams of CBD or 5.8 percent no it's an accuracy it's excellent look at all those other cannabinoids 905 milligrams of total cannabinoids Wow we'll break that down THC 30 milligrams of CBC and 37 milligrams of CBG you guys know I'm a fan of Bluebird botanicals this blows them out the water with the CBG it's more than anything I've tested that's so much CBC - right I was really surprised by this one the CBC and CBG those are the cannabinoids and Charlotte's Web they might be the secret sauce to that very popular brand and I think it might have something to do with all the positive research and positive reviews for that strain and the various conditions possibly people like it the official lab test is here it's just one test and I don't claim the law test this way but it's completely independent and I promise you that I have nothing to do with this company or currently any CBD company the price for sense flat per milligram of CBD if you look at all my tests 15 cents is about average 4 cents is the cheapest out of all of them I tested not only that it goes down to 3 point 5 cents per milligram of total cannabinoids not only that you buy the larger bottles of CBD that they offer and the price per milligram of CBD drops to 3 Sen do you know what this mean not only that I sound like a damn commercial right now but you guys can see my industry report I've got the reports for everything I review they offer veterans disabled and low-income individuals up to 60% off who qualifies of course I don't I don't think they give every single person that discount Wow a little hard never but I really do appreciate they do this for people in need and they've got to be losing money doing this but the the regular price is insane - it's just it's it's cheap ingredients just hemp hemp seed oil and coconut oil beautiful I would be a little disappointed if they added sugar whatever other weird ingredients CBD companies tend to put in their oils this is the milliliter breakdown for dose I would caution this is this is potent you don't want a full dose of this your first go around look at the THC two milligrams of THC that's a lot research shows that high effects can start at two milligrams and sensitive individuals is you high and obviously it's enough to risk a failed drug test some people start off at five milligrams of CBD this is a 50 milligram dose just be aware of what you get into Wow welcome to the 700 club kid Lazarus is a company out of Seattle they've been around since 2014 and remember CBD just became legal at the end of 2018 so they're kind of like vets in this industry let me get the bat out of the way I did find one negative investigation by NBC that found Lazarus natural product had a high levels of lead however just looking at the product in this news piece I was like does that look like Lazarus Naturals label not really it looked like the label was printed on a home computer and deteriorating it didn't look like what I bought they bought it off of Groupon never do that Lazarus came out later and said that the product they tested was counterfeit which is actually a big one group on now I report everything that I find to be transparent but I think NBC's report was just negligent why would you buy something on Groupon and then publish those results but it should caution you that there are lots of fake CBD products out there and you need to buy from legitimate retailers I also don't like that they sell on Amazon because you need to be sneaky and say that you're just hemp oil basically to hide the fact that your product has CBD but the biggest companies are now doing this so what are you gonna do the good nbc6 investigators tested Lazarus and found that they were one of the only companies they tested to have accurate amounts of CBD Wow now you have my tests my independent tests and theirs to confirm its accurate which is good it's good to have multiple sources that's it that's the review this is the cheapest it has the most CBD cbc CBG they're good to vets and low-income

cannabis so let's get it to so once you filter out your cannabis put your cooking oil into a new mason jar alright guys my cannabis juice ticking the wall it's now done that you got to watch this video don't forget to Like share and subscribe please [Music]", "erH14bNZP74": "okay now the audio should be coming through all right hey everybody so this is an attempt for me to start to try to connect with you guys uh a lot more than i than i have been and i hope this live stream is actually working i normally have a totally different hardware setup um for how i would do anything for youtube but it looks like my mic's coming through i'm just gonna hope and pray that it is working um so hey everybody i just wanted to get on here and just do a couple of um updates about what we're doing at curious about cannabis and yeah just share a little bit about kind of where things are headed and to let you know that in general i'm going to try to start doing live streams um beyond you may have seen previous live streams that i've done where i just play old uh podcast videos and so i'd gotten some requests to um you know sort of set up a 24-hour stream of of podcast episodes and i've done that a couple of times but um i don't have dedicated hardware to run that all the time but beyond that i'm going to try to start doing live streams where i'm just connecting with you talking to you directly as i'm able to so we'll see how it goes so first of all i want to say that um you know those of you that follow us on youtube if you don't already follow us on instagram i really recommend you connect with us on there because i do make um live streams and posts on stories and stuff a little more frequently there and i honestly share most of my news on instagram because that's where a lot of the kind of cannabis industry is is hanging out but i'm going to try to change that um to let you know a little bit of what's been going on and why there haven't been some posts in a while um i've been teaching quite a lot so our um our curious about cannabis workshop series launched just a couple of weeks ago for this year and i used to teach these workshops locally in person here in oregon for years since at least since 2015 and then of course 2020 hit and had to kind of reevaluate everything in life as so many people have and so we made a really big pivot towards virtual education events and i was very very skeptical and cynical at first but it seems like it's going well so now i'm really really excited about it because it's enabled me to connect with people all over the united states and in canada mexico all sorts of other places and to really have the chance to dive into all sorts of details that i can't get into in podcast episodes or you know kind of casual conversation and um yeah so our first cohort um is underway with that workshop series and we just had a really great um guest lecture from dr anna schwabe it did her phd uh dissertation work looking at genetic chemical and organoleptic variation among uh cannabis flower super super super interesting stuff and she was gracious enough to stay a little extra and talk with my students and myself and answer questions just really really great experience next week we've got kyle boyer coming in to talk about lab testing murphy murray is going to be coming in to give us lab tours and talk about extraction we've also got dr arno hazakamp who's um you know basically one of the first researchers to present this idea of chemovar or chemical variety he's just published tons of research on cannabis since he started studying it professionally in 2001 i believe a major name in cannabis science research but he's going to be guest lecturing in a few weeks and then we also have dr linda clumpers who's a clinical pharmacologist that'll also be coming in towards the end of the workshop and guest teaching so just tons of great guests that have been really really gracious and giving me their time and energy to help make the workshop awesome so that's all been going great if you are interested and you didn't get in on this first cohort i will be opening up the next session uh the next session's registration window is going to open next week so if you go to cacpodcast.com learn you can find information about those workshops and some of our other educational events that we have going on i think they're extremely unique compared to other stuff that's out there and i've had students tell me that you know ones that have taken a lot of the available cannabis education stuff that's currently out there they tell me that there's nothing like what i'm doing out there and that the content that we're going into goes far more in depth and one student told me today it just gets in the nitty-gritty of all of the science of all this sort of stuff and kind of shatters some maybe some preconceived notions you may have even learned in other um cannabis education uh courses and stuff like that a student told me today that he's just got uh more and more questions and i was like well that's a great sign that you're learning um so yeah those workshops have been really really fun and so they are intensive they're six weeks long each um but if you're looking for like the really intense cannabis science you know course um uh check it out curious about cannabis workshop series there's two parts it's 12 weeks series total and each workshop is six weeks we also have a beginner's workshop that is launching in april um the session first session starts on april 9th and if you or someone you know is totally new to cannabis i mean starting out at ground zero basically this workshop is made for them it runs a month long and it covers all the general basics that you could expect you know uh addressing you know just what is cannabis what are all these cannabis products what are these terms that are being used and dispensaries and stuff and how do we think about those terms how does it connect to science or doesn't connect to science in a lot of cases um and how does cannabis and other sorts of cannabis products in general how do they affect the body and are they safe those are some of the basic questions that we go through um it's only a hundred bucks like i said it runs a month um in general the way i see it is if it can save somebody from buying products that aren't actually in line with what they're looking for then they will probably save quite a bit of money that would pay for the the beginner's workshop many times over um so yeah if you know anybody or if you run a dispensary or anything like that um check this workshop out and and please send people there i'm hoping to get the cohort um built out um by the first week of april and we'll be off to the races um some other things i wanted to talk about that we have going on that i am excited about um so if you're into the crypto world then you've probably heard of nfts if you're not in the crypto world you've probably heard of nfts because people are starting to write articles about them quite a bit um nfts non-funchable tokens you know are basically digital assets um the best example to describe them would be like in a video game if you're buying uh um some sort of item in a video game uh that's essentially an nft um although up until now they haven't really been on blockchain and if you're not familiar with what blockchain is it's essentially just a really nice ledger that keeps track of the flow of information and digital goods so cryptocurrency got really really popular and operates on blockchain but uh blockchain is a lot more than cryptocurrency and nfts are really highlighting that and so some common examples of nfts there are like virtual trading cards like mlb and nba have both started producing digital trading cards um as nfts um additionally there are kind of these virtual worlds that you can join where you can buy land in these virtual worlds and develop uh virtual structures and things like people build digital art galleries for instance to showcase their art people build um uh arcades even casinos all sorts of stuff uh decentraland is the most um probably most popular example of of these kind of like metaverse systems but they utilize nfts in all sorts of ways like i mentioned they have art galleries and people post their their digital art as nfts in those systems but also nfts can be applied to things like contracts and intellectual property and i'll be really excited when people start to understand the value in that because nfts are huge for content creators and artists but they're also going to be really huge for all business i mean the the audit trail aspect of blockchain is unparalleled i mean it's just something that if you read enough about it it'll click why blockchain is not going away and how more and more we're going to see more things get on the blockchain and likely we'll see a future of the internet where you have the on-chain internet and you have an off-chain internet and the off-chain internet is sort of uh this more murky side of the internet that's doesn't have this kind of level of audit trail and everything uh more what we're used to right now and then you'll have the on-chain internet where everything is tracked and there's no way to really uh fudge things which might freak people out um regarding like anonymity but the great thing about blockchain and cryptocurrency and everything is that uh even though these audit trails exist um there's still plenty of ways to stay anonymous in using things on blockchain so when people see transaction histories they don't see your name they see this long string of random characters that represent your wallet um and the other wallets you know that things have been moved to so it can be used for anonymous you know internet uh transactions and that sort of thing um or not and so anyway if you're seeing all this hype about nfts that's kind of what it's about is it's you know showing that blockchain is way more than cryptocurrency and digital assets in general are are starting this move over uh to nfts and it's huge for content creators like myself because it gives us a little more power uh to do very interesting things with our art and um also provide a way for our fans to potentially make money um off of supporting the things they like so with all of that rambling out of the way curious about cannabis has launched our curious about cannabis canna card nfts we have well over 100 of them right now waiting to be released and as far as i'm aware we are the very first um you know company that's producing educational cannabis content in the form of nfts and we're one of the first groups that's making cannabis content all at all as nfts at least in some like systematic formalized way there are people that have made spinoff you know little nfts out of photographs and stuff here and there but you know we're putting together a pretty uh substantial system on how to use our cards and these these can of card nfts they basically look like um pokemon or magic the gathering uh trading cards in a way that's kind of how they're modeled um but they're digital some feature photographs or artwork some feature videos um so some of these cards it's almost like uh you know like in harry potter uh the trading cards that they have um you know the the wizards start talking to them and stuff well these some of these cards you know are kind of video format and kind of have that that feel to them uh where i might be explaining some concept about cannabis or whatever and then the cards themselves have educational information about whatever topic's being represented by the card on there and so these cards are you know they're collectibles uh some of these cards are only minted once so they're literally one of a kind others are minted in groups of like 25 or 50 so that's how you get your commons and your uncommons and your rares but beyond the fact that they're fun little cards that have educational information and they're collectible they're going to have very direct tangible value because we'll also be using these nfts as discounts for merchandise discounts for events and tickets to exclusive events so up until now we've had our patreon and we have a nice little community on there people that have been supporting the podcast and all of the work that we do um and we always you know give out discount codes and stuff to patrons to give them free stuff for discount stuff for instance all of our patrons got into the first uh cohort of the curious about cannabis workshop for free not everybody actually took advantage of the opportunity to take it for free only a couple people did but they had the the opportunity to do that which was an 850 value some of these can of cards uh will have values that um range anywhere from a couple of bucks to two thousand dollars or more um so if you like what curious about cannabis does what we've been doing and how we've grown and you can kind of see how we're evolving then these cards could potentially bring quite a bit of value to you if you're wanting to take a lot of our workshops we also have a ton of self-paced courses that are going to be launching next month that are you know in general is trying to give people as many ways to learn about cannabis as possible but if you're interested in gauging and engaging all of those things um then you may want to consider trying to get one of these nfts um especially some of the rare ones and you won't necessarily have to buy them um we will have opportunities like uh giveaways um plus there's a kind of a whole game associated with these can of cards that i'm i'm not going to go into completely yet because we're still rolling it all out and everything in due time but essentially there will be um challenges that you can complete some are free some not the challenges that you can complete that will give you the rights to claim uh certain nfts with higher values you know so for instance if you're wanting to take a workshop you don't have 850 bucks to spend on getting into the you know the month and a half workshop well another approach you could take is trying to complete one of these challenges that may give you access to one of the rare can of cards that you can use to get into a workshop for free that kind of thing and so you know you may spend however much uh to get through the challenge like for instance one of the challenges will be you know taking a self-paced course on the learning platform which in general would be like 15 bucks or something you know you go do that but you also get access to one of these nfts which then gives you access to other stuff so in general it's not going to be for everyone but for those that are kind of into crypto and do like what curious about cannabis is doing and you want to see more of what we're capable of next we're kind of taking things in baby steps as we kind of organically grow here but if you're you know really really interested in in these workshops and everything um keep an eye out for announcements about the nfts and and what we're going to be doing with those if you want to learn more and kind of see some of these nfts you can go to openc.io so that's o p e n s e a dot io and that's the marketplace uh that where we'll initially be launching these and if you search for can of cards are curious about cannabis can of cards because there's a couple people have tried to do some spin-off kind of can of card stuff but as far as i'm aware we're the first and we certainly have the most uh nfts that are called can of cards but you may come across one or two others that use that name but if you search for curious about cannabis you'll find us and you can see uh some of the uh cards that we've put together um and and kind of get a feel for those you should see the one with the video embedded in it there's also a couple of signed cards um i have my signature on them um all sorts of stuff on there and we're going to be collaborating with artists and photographers and stuff in the canvas space to highlight um other people's work and in general um you know going through this process we've learned a lot so we're also gonna be helping cannabis companies get their own nfts made so if that's something you're interested in if you're an artist in the space or if you are if this is all interesting to you and you want to dabble in it um you know that's something that uh you can reach out to us about and um you know depending on the situation i might be able to to give you a little assistance there or we can collaborate and get your art on a can of card and the goal with that is that we'd be uh splitting any revenue that that comes from the cards so it's not like you'll be giving me my giving me your art and then just being thrown to the wayside uh anyone that we collaborate with on these projects um you know we plan on trying to split things pretty much right down the middle uh in most cases um so if you're not wanting to take on the infrastructure of nfts and you've got cannabis related art and that sort of thing that that might be useful reach out and we'll see you know what makes sense to do um yeah with that um another thing i wanted to announce is that it you know like i said at the beginning in general i'm gonna try to do more live streams um they'll be very casual kind of like this you know i don't even have my green screen uh my chroma key stuff running so you just see my green screen behind me you know these live streams will probably take place usually right after i'm done teaching and so i usually have a lot on my mind then but um yeah so be on the lookout for these live streams one thing i would like to talk about right now is delta eight thc a big subject um that is really really getting hyped especially after i think a new york times article came out not too long ago about it but i was recently interviewed on a podcast called brave new weed and um on that episode i think it's their most recent episode you can go look it up and listen if you like um but uh and we talked all about how delta 8 thc is generally made um how i'm getting a little thing here telling me my mic's too loud sorry if i've been yelling at you didn't mean to um you know basically how delta h thc is made how what we see in labs when we're testing these products um what sort of safety issues might be involved and what consumers need to know before they consume them and some of the main takeaways so once again go look up brave new weed and listen to the whole conversation i was also stoked that um apparently raphael machula heard the episode um and and sent an email out um you know um saying that he liked it and everything i was super super excited about that um one thing i need to do in one of these live streams is i um i had a back and forth with dr mushullum last year and just asked him some questions through email and stuff i would like to interview him on the podcast at some point but he's not always in great health and so it's that can be challenging but at some point i need to read his responses on my questions i think that might be fun but in that episode some of the takeaways and i'll just take a couple of minutes here and then i'm going to jump off but delta 8 thc molecularly exactly the same as delta nine thc except that a double bond is located in a slightly different place within one of the rings of the molecule and that is exactly the same same chemical formula um same 2d structure just like i said there's a double bond in a different place and for the chemists out there if you're familiar with the carbon numbering of the thc molecule i don't even have to explain this to you but the double bond in delta 9 thc is at the nine location uh the double bond and delta eight thcs in the eight location um and this is stuff you can see very clearly in the curious about cannabis book um i don't market myself enough so those of you that may not know uh there is a curious about cannabis book yeah you can find it on amazon barnes noble cacpodcast.combook but we actually talk about in that book how uh you know how chemicals are numbered where the delta nine comes from how delta nine compares to delta eight etcetera etcetera um but delta eight is basically the same as delta nine with the exception of that location of a double bond in the molecule but that small change results in fairly big differences in how the chemicals affect the body delta 8 seems to have similar receptor targets as delta 9 with weaker affinity which um kind of fits what people commonly talk about with delta eight that it's uh not as potent as delta nine in terms of intoxication potential and that sort of thing um and there's been a fair amount of research on how delta 8 could be used um therapeutically because it was looked at for a while as being this possible alternative to delta 9 um that wouldn't get people as high but you know they could still get a lot of the potential therapeutic benefit like anti-nausea effects um possibly even anxiety relieving effects a lot of the same stuff that has been known about thc so that sounds great right you've got a molecule where you're getting a lot of the benefit of delta 9 thc you know if you're not getting as high and it's available in the hemp market so um what's not to love well the problem there are multiple problems one there's a legal issue and we'll get to that in a second um but there's also a safety issue a lot of people assume that delta eight thc is extracted from cannabis for the most part no that's that's not the case now that's not to say that people are not extracting delta athc they certainly are but let's put this into context most of the delta 8 thc products that are on the market are in the hemp market generally you know i've tested i don't know how many samples of cannabis i've tested in the lab thousands upon thousands um delta thc even in thc rich cannabis cultivars shows up in extremely trace concentrations fractions of weight percents when you start talking about cbd dominant cannabis it's orders of magnitude lower um and delta 8 thc in general is kind of an artifact of delta 9 thc because it's it's not enzymatically produced by the plant it's uh the plant produces thca that decarboxylates to thc and then um over time that double bond moves around in the molecule and you've got a little bit of delta 8 thc in there so in general if you wanted to extract if you wanted to make a delta 8 thc product just from extraction and refinement you're talking about having to process absurd amounts of biomass of hip biomass that would just cost probably millions of dollars in between the the extraction process and the refinement process and everything to get um to where you've got some nice bulk delta 8 thc and clearly based on the pricing of delta 8 thc products people are not spending that much money to make it excuse me so what's going on well the way that most delta athc is produced is uh primarily from cbd cbd is isolated out of out of hemp that cbd is put into acidic conditions um usually with acetic acid or sulfuric acid and it's kind of left in a sort of broth like that for a while and cbd will change into delta nine thc and then eventually the delta nine thc will change into delta eight thc and you know you generally um through testing and other things you you know kind of follow that trajectory and um pull the you know stop the process once you've got quite a lot of delta eight thc in there and then often that product then gets um you know solvent purged out they'll then distill it and refine it into these delta eight thc distillates and it's that term distillate i think really confuses people because when you call something at distillate it hides its origin um because you could distill uh raw cannabis extracts you could distill a synthetically derived cannabis product in this cannabinoid product in this case and it's all called distillate and i think that's kind of what's delayed people cluing in on the fact that most delta athc on the market is synthetically derived um if you want to don't want to call it synthetic it's at least semi-synthetic i mean they're taking one chemical and making another chemical and the problem with that is that you get um well the chemical synthesis process is not perfect and so you get unintended by-products and if you listen to the curious about cannabis podcast i made a really silly uh kind of promotional thing for one of the episodes uh that was kind of like a game show and it kind of poked fun at this problem that people were trying to pass off delta 8 thc is an extract and then when they go and look under the hood they see all of these weird uh peaks representing um on the on sort of the analytical graph that would be called a chromatogram they see all these mystery quote unquote mystery peaks that represent these chemical byproducts thc isomers that we don't know what they are xothc delta 10 thc whatever thc most of these things we don't have reference standards for it's very hard to solidly identify so not only is most delta 8 thc on the market being synthetically produced but depending on the producer it can be very impure and depending on the analytical lab testing it um this may not be always obvious labs vary in quality quite a lot depending on where you are and what regulations there are and stuff and so i remember back in the day when i was doing cannabis testing in oregon before there were any regulations whatsoever there were labs we were competing against that were lumping together delta 9 delta 8 cbn anything that was related to thc they'd lump it all together just call it thc same sort of thing happens with delta eight thc depending on the lab sometimes uh they'll take all of these mystery peaks and just add them all up and say yeah that's pretty much delta atc um so unless you're actually looking at the raw chromatogram that the lab produces sometimes even the producer may not know how impure their products are um so just to summarize delta a thc mostly synthetic um there's a chemical byproduct problem we don't know what these chemicals are exactly that are kind of hitching a ride and those uh byproducts can range from two or three to five percent of the final product to as much as 10 15 20 30 i've seen delta 8 uh distillates that were really only about 30 percent pure with huge isomer peaks i didn't know what they were um and you also have the fact that some producers are manipulating test results i mean if you have a pdf editor you can go through and change what a pdf says and in the hip market that you know where the uh the testing world is in some places kind of still the wild wild west um that can be more or less easier to do so there's several major problems um some of which are specific to delta eight and some of which aren't um so you have all that then you have the legal issue that i mentioned so is delta athc legal uh synthetic delta athc is as far as we can tell not legal um and this is not legal advice i'm not an attorney i don't have legal training blah blah blah disclaimers um but the dea has clarified that synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinol meaning delta 9 thc and all of its isomers the thc class of compounds of which there are at least 30 or more that we know of all of those are controlled thus illegal in a very big way um the pushback from the hemp industry is folks say well but delta hthc is naturally occurring in hemp it is it is a natural phytocannabinoid and yes that is true but these products are not hemp derived they're derived from cbd which is derived from hemp but that is not the same and there's a big difference between producing a an herbal extract and producing a synthetic chemical regardless of whether that chemical occurs in nature or not if you have synthesized it it is a synthetic chemical and there are certain safety purity issues that come along with that that i've already highlighted so that's why this is kind of a no-brainer from the fed's perspective in the united states of course it's illegal is there much enforcement on this no are people taking advantage of this kind of lag of enforcement hell yes they are to the degree that there are companies that are spraying delta 8 thc on hemp flour to produce smokable flour that will get people high this is such a short-term vision i don't understand i do understand because human nature they're always going to be those people out there that are going to do stupid things um what all i will say sort of my mantra lately on some of this because i do a lot of consulting around cannabis quality and compliance and what i will say is that a lack of enforcement is not evidence of a lack of violation so just because the dea hasn't come after you just because the fda hasn't come after you um it doesn't mean that you're not doing something wrong and it also doesn't mean that they're not going to come after you later and possibly even retroactively apply um laws later so you may think you got away with it five years from now and they can still come down on you because a lot of these delta 8 thc products are very public a lot of these companies are very public about what they're doing and trying to rely on the gray area for safety i think that's incredibly stupid to do i'm sorry if that offends you um but just coming out of i i don't like the laws around cannabis and cannabinoids as they are i would love to see cannabis descheduled completely um and just totally take care of this issue but we're stuck with things the way they are for now and right now the way the controlled substances act is set up this is the way it is this is the feds have been pretty clear on how they read the law there's not really room for interpretation here uh even though a lot of people may argue that there is i really don't think there is uh in general you've always got to read laws as conservatively as possible because that's how they're going to be applied and interpreted not as liberally as possible that's just wishful thinking um so are delta athc products legal technically on a federal level no they're not not in terms of the controlled substances act um will people continue to get away with uh selling delta eight thc products for a while probably um i don't see indication that the dea is going to take action uh immediately but who knows um and i kind of expect that they will take a couple of bold moves at some point to make a statement that will kind of help balance the market a little bit likewise with the fda our cbd products legal that's a real gray area because the food drugs and cosmetics act says you can't put drugs in food or supplements cbd is technically a drug the fda has said in some of their warning letters to companies that they you know that's how they interpret the rules and even though they are continuing to take comments and and try to figure out how they're going to regulate the cbd industry technically according to the way the law is right now um cbd products sold as supplements and foods pet food cosmetics those are all technically they technically contain drugs once again i don't like that i don't like that that's the way the law is i think that lawmakers when they were writing the latest version of the farm bill and all that they should have been a lot more careful with their language so that we didn't have to deal with this problem and now congress is kind of trying to fix it by trying to get new legislation passed that would make exceptions for cbd uh to get it recognized as a dietary supplement and a signed uh grass status generally regarded as safe but right now that's not the case um it's just there's this lack of enforcement issue but like i said lack of enforcement is not indicative of a lack of violation and the fda is very careful about indicating in every warning letter that they send that just because they don't bring up a certain issue in a warning letter doesn't mean that that company has not violated other things they haven't mentioned this is all to say you know to those of you out there wanting to get into the cannabis industry want to get into to hemp and everything just really got to be careful and recognize that things are changing a lot and there's always hype around new laws there's so much hype around the farm bill and what it's going to do for the cbd industry that was just unfounded um and you know like i said you've really got to read laws conservatively because that's how they're going to be interpreted and applied most of the time a great example of this related to the farm bill is the issue over total thc is the reference to point three percent thc is that uh delta nine thc like the farm bill you know defines it or is it total thc that it incorporates thca the way that i read the farm bill it seems unambiguously that it is certainly total thc because the law as written states that that thc value has to be reported um as a post decarboxylation value which means total thc now does it explicitly say total thc no it doesn't have to though post decarboxylation that is a scientific term meaning after the carboxylic acid functional group has been removed from the molecule okay well um how do you calculate that like if you're doing liquid chromatography where you're actually seeing thca and thc separately the way you do it it's scientific mathematical thing divide the molecular mass of thca and thc you end up with a correction uh factor you find out you know thc is uh 87.7 percent the weight of thca the difference between those molecules the only difference between them is thc does not have the carboxylic acid functional group like uh thca does so you're just accounting for the loss of weight from basically that co2 molecule popping off of thca i don't see this as controversial i don't see this open to interpretation and i think when this gets challenged in courts um that's the way it's going to be read i think it's pretty clear that if you take the literal word of the farm bill and um you know as it stands right now title vii and the language of the controlled substances act which was amended when the farm bill passed to provide allowances for him it always brings you back to this post-decarboxylation requirement which means that it doesn't matter if um your product you know uh would would pass scrutiny under 0.3 delta 9 thc you've always got to assume the thca is going to be decarboxylated and and then add those values together so the actual formula just to make it clear for anyone that's watching or listening you just take thc your thc value and then you add it to uh you know put in parentheses your thca value times 0.877 which represents that 87.7 percent molecular difference and so you correct your thca for decarboxylation then you add it to thc um there's no other way to do it i mean that's that's all it is now one uh aspect to this that um folks may argue as well what about the fact that decarboxylation is never perfect so does doesn't the correction factor of 0.877 um exaggerate the decarboxylation potential i don't know i mean sure decarboxylation rates will vary for sure is it possible to totally decarboxylate thca it depends it depends on what you're doing with it and as i just pointed out with um like the delta eight thc issue i mean people are making are getting into synthetic semi-synthetic chemistry and everything and when you're getting into that world you kind of do have to make assumptions that people are going to completely decarboxylate and take that into account and i'll also point out the usda final rules clarified this issue and even put the formula in there so it's clear that the feds are reading this the same way that i'm reading it uh at least from my perspective that's that's the way it seems to me they haven't indicated in any way that i'm off as far as you know how i'm reading those words and i'm so you i'm very accustomed to reading legislation like i said i've just worked in quality management compliance for so long uh you just get used to understanding um you know how words are being used in laws and what they mean and how you know the writer that was writing the law you know what they were uh you know trying to get across and so it makes this kind of quick and easy if you're used to it but i can understand those that like don't read laws very very commonly they may not know certain things to look for nuances to to check and everything but you know uh the reading of of the farm bill and the control substances act makes it pretty clear that 0.3 percent uh value refers to um total what we often call an industry total thc or post decarboxylated thc um it is what it is uh i do think that when the farm bill is um revised i think that the definition of thc will be changed to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols all thcs all isomers it'll close the delta eight loophole um i'm not saying i want this to happen i'm saying this is the practical outcome that i expect based on my experience and based on my scientific knowledge and and other you know industry knowledge about all this stuff i don't really see it going a different direction but we'll see but i i expect that will change the definition of thc to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols and i think they will also bump up the 0.3 limit as a compromise with the industry they'll probably say okay you want us to bump up the 0.3 limit fine we'll do it however now more things count as thc and so it's it's gonna be kind of a double-edged sword uh sort of thing but um it's really not gonna affect things too much because these compounds are in such trace quantities uh concentrations like like delta thc for instance um uh and it's possible they could even change it to cannabinols which would also include cbn but i don't i kind of don't think they're going to do that i think they'll define it just as tetrahydrocannabinols they'll raise the 0.3 limit maybe to 0.5 or maybe to 1. i kind of don't think they'll go as high as 1. i think they'll they may go to 0.5 or 0.6 i think has been advocated for um but then a lot of these regulatory gray areas will be gone i also think that the next her revision of the farm bill if legislation doesn't pass beforehand uh there'll be something in there that clarifies for the fda how to think about these compounds whether we're going to give them treat them as generally regarded as safe uh how do we interpret these things in context of the food drugs and cosmetics act and when all of that happens which will happen in the next two years i think if i have my timing right how i'm thinking about this all of this ambiguity goes away and then i think we will see a new era of enforcement uh by the dea and the fda throughout um the hemp industry and all all cannabis um markets to some degree depending on how each state's laws are set up to protect themselves um yeah i don't know i could be totally totally wrong and that would be cool if i was but um i kind of don't think i will be um so um i did a recent podcast episode on the curious about cannabis podcast with david heldruth jr which i haven't gotten on youtube yet i need to catch up it takes longer to get things processed for youtube so that's just the way it is but we talk all about these issues and kind of how to prepare for the future of cannabinoid markets in the united states particularly and some of his companies have been working with the dea and the fda for quite a while um to understand how they're interpreting things and that conversation just told me that everything that i've been deciphering from all this seems to be on point based on the messaging he's hearing from the dea and the fda um so i don't know that ramble is just basically to say hey be careful out there and don't assume that just because you're getting away with something now that you will forever and it's generally not a good idea to build a business model with such short-term thinking in mind and for consumers out there be careful about new products in general um something we talked about in the workshop uh our live classroom session today in our workshop it's about contaminants and how uh as time has gone on you know cannabis flowers killing it in regulated markets as far as um you know being very clean and everything but when you get into extracts and concentrates and products made from extracts and concentrates you just enter a different world and the safety issue is just all over the place because when you think about safety of cannabis products you're not just talking about cannabinoids and terpenes you're talking about chemical byproducts you're talking about additives diluents excipients all sorts of different issues packaging hardware are metals leaching into your extract out of your vape pen i mean there's just a lot that goes in there so i don't know this is a live stream ramble so i just hope this has been helpful um stay safe out there don't assume that just because something is cannabis derived that it's safe it might be um but we got to be careful and hold each other accountable and take care of each other and that's you know as a scientist and an educator that's what i feel my role is here i've spent the better part of this decade the past decade of my life studying canada's products in the lab and getting experience in all sorts of areas of the industry and you know sort of view it as my role now to try to pass on some of these insights things i've learned things you know that i kind of see coming and um hopefully hopefully it's helpful to some of you and hopefully it leads to better outcomes with cannabis or whatever so with all of that said um i hope you enjoyed this live stream um if you haven't already check out our website cacpodcast.com that's curiousaboutcannabispodcast.com

it help your eczema your dermatitis your rosacea s-- your rosacea do you guys have rosacea or do you have rosacea and your psoriasis is CBD oil helpful well it hurt you the CBD oil gets you high I'm gonna talk about CBD oil in this video so stay tuned what's up my friends welcome to another video I'm Rob Stewart and I'm here to help you get your skin and your overall health back on track and in today's video I'm going to be talking about CBD oil let's jump right into this sucker it's a great topic so online in your communities the use of CBD oil and other cannabis products for healing has exploded with the advent of different states legalizing weed and legalizing marijuana for medical purposes and for recreational purposes there's a ton of research going on about things like CBD oil now let's talk a little bit about CBD oil does it get you high like smoking wheat no it does not there is no psychoactive ingredients in it it does not get you high you do not feel the same way you feel if you smoke a bong or you take a hit off a joint just doesn't feel the same what are some of the kind of medical benefits that people are saying that they're getting the most common one is that it helps digestion and gut related stuff it kind of calms down that area of the body also many people are reporting that it helps calm down the mind it relieves stress and it kind of knocks down inflammation and pain in the body do those reports stand up to the test of my clients and the people that I interview and talk to you on a daily basis who are suffering from eczema and dermatitis psoriasis and rosacea so far across the board most people that I to have said yes the CBD oil has helped them immensely my girlfriend who does not have the skin disease issues but does have some you know neck pain and some digestion related issues she takes the CBD oil and it works wonderfully for her it really knocks down the amount of inflammation in her body it helps her to get a great night of sleep it does wonders for her digestion and it makes her feel way less stressed when she takes it many of my clients are taking doses that are very small and seeing pretty good results so for me I say hey the side effects of CBD are very minimal almost none you're not gonna have allergic reactions to it it doesn't negatively affect your liver your kidneys or digestion any of that it seems to only be helpful so I say hey if you're someone looking for relief and you're looking to naturally heal your skin CBD oil may be something that could really really help you remember healing the skin naturally has to do with healing the digestion healing the gut peeling the liver kidney the small large intestine in the lymphatic system if you take a supplement or if you take something that helps your body digest food better it knocks down the inflammation that you're having the healing process is going to be enhanced by doing so also even if it just mentally gives you a little bit of an edge where you're not as stressed where you can focus more on you know reducing the symptoms and going after the root issue and a long-term solution for healing your skin then awesome if it helps you sleep better awesome so I'm not fully like everyone takes CBD oil it will fix everything but hey for those of you open to taking CBD oil you can get it legally it is an amazing supplement it's one of the only supplements that I'm starting to promote I don't sell to stuff I'm not representing any company at all there's really only three supplements that I tell people would be awesome for them and that's vitamin b12 and that's for everyone across the board meat eaters and meat-eaters to try follow the air.you Vedic tried OSHA curb that really helps tonify the colon and three CBD oil for those who feel like they might need it if you're super stressed if you're super anxious if you have constant inflammation if you seem to be like cleansing and eating the right foods but you're just still having major soreness pain and inflammation in your digestion CBD oil may be something that could really help you so this was just kind of an information-based video today I wanted to report on how some of my clients have been doing with CBD oil how my girlfriend's been doing on CBD oil and the reports that I've gotten from people that I've interviewed that are taking CBD oil in hopes of reversing their skin disease by using it now quick caveat do I think that CBD oil will have a direct effect on the literal surface and the symptoms of your skin disease and do I think that CBD oil will have a direct effect on healing your skin disease no but I do think that CBD oil can knock down inflammation improve digestion improve overall stress and mood so therefore in a roundabout way it should improve your overall health if your overall health is improving then your skin health is improving as well and so I say hey there's no negative side effects go for it if it feels right for you anyway guys that's going to be it leave all of your questions and comments down below if you're looking to get a hold of me to become a private client to have me lead you through the process of healing your skin I'd be happy to do so there's a link in the description box for that also hit me up on the good-old instagram at stuart rob-stuart and i'm putting up lots of information to help you

kidding bye-bye", "kzbq3cFf-s4": "hey dr. axe here today I want to talk to you about how to start using CBD and CBD oil CBD is a hot topic of conversation today the problem is a lot of people don't know what type to buy how to use it in the dosage I'm going to be answering all of those questions in today's video the first thing you need to know about CBD is that it really supports the balance of what's called your parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system a lot of us live in this fight-or-flight stay of constant stress which can affect our hormones our sleep our gut health what CBD does is allows us to get more in a parasympathetic State and so when you're buying CBD the things you want to look for is you want to buy CBD number one that is certified organic now I can't stress that enough when you're buying CBD look for the USDA certified organic seal on it if it's not on there if it doesn't say organic you don't want to buy it just like you want to buy coffee organic just like you want to buy your kale Organic you also want to make sure that CBD is organic or else the most the time it's been sprayed with chemicals herbicides and pesticides so make sure it's organic number two make sure your CBD or CBD oil is full-spectrum now full-spectrum means it's gonna have all of the other nutrients that CBD needs to work most effectively in the body let me give you an example of this did you know that if you consume calcium by itself it does little for your bone health your bones need more than calcium your bones need calcium vitamin D magnesium boron phosphorus your collagen your bones need all of these different things what a lot of people today especially companies that are more synthetic based and what they create they're creating these isolated synthetic forms of CBD which don't really work with your body similar thing tumeric is great because it contains curcuma noise and tumor owns and all these different types of nutrients when you're buying CBD make sure it always is a full spectrum which means it's going to have CBD but it's also going to have a very small amount of things like THC CBC CBG and terpenes which are what are found essential oils now in terms of dosage I tend to do between 20 and 50 milligrams a day and that's really what I what I notice I'll do maybe 20 milligrams twice a day or 30 to 40 milligrams in the evening that's how much I personally take if you're new to it though and just getting started sometimes you might want to just start with about five milligrams maybe just a half a dropper of a 10 milligram dose and see how your body feels with that and then you can move up over time and you can take it in many different forms everything from the oil form CBD capsules or tablets and also a seaweedy powder all of those are great forms of CBD and I think by using CBD you're going to know some great benefits in your health", "T0dObVCg0wQ": "trying to figure out how much CBD oil to take can be frustrating most resources tell you to start out low and gradually work up but if you're not noticing any results it can be tempting to double or even triple a dose in a single day doing this can be counterproductive so make sure you establish a clear dosage plan if you anticipate taking CBD over the long-term it's important to remember that CBD is not a miracle cure don't expect to take a few drops of tincture and voila all your symptoms are gone the effects of CBD oil are not instant and many people make the mistake of using CBD once or twice and then writing it off completely if it doesn't work in terms of where to start with dosing we recommend just starting out with a low potency oil a dose or single serving is pretty universal at one milliliter of oil which is exactly 20 drops so rather than trying a single drop or two of a high potency formula start out with a low potency 200 to 300 milligram bottle take a single one milliliter serving and see how you feel in order to know exactly how many milligrams of CBD you're taking you need to know two things the total CBD content of the bottle and the size of the bottle in milligrams for example let's use a standard 30 milliliter bottle that contains 300 milligrams of CBD total if you take a 1 milliliter dose this would equate to 10 milligrams of CBD the key in deciphering dosage is to stick with how much you're taking for at least a week in other words don't immediately up your dosage if you don't notice any effects at first and give the CBD time to work with the receptors in your body if you still don't notice any effects after about a week then you can start upping the dose however be mindful of the fact that your CBD oils ineffectiveness could just be that you're using a low quality product the manufacturing of CBD oil is still largely unregulated so the amount listed on your bottles labeled could in fact be far from the amount that's actually contained inside also when administering servings remember to put the drops under your tongue and hold for at least 30 seconds before swallowing this will give the CBD ample time to be absorbed into the bloodstream before entering the digestive tract and lastly increased dosages gradually and be patient it could take time for your body to respond to the act of CBD compound so don't get frustrated if a week 2 weeks or even more goes by without noticing much effect also if you have access to a doctor or healthcare professional who's willing to talk to you about CBD be sure to speak with them do you have any input or first-hand experience dosing CBD be sure to share your

struggled with since i've been a small child and i'm sure everyone watching this video has dealt with it at some point in life whether it's you know chronic and you deal with it every day or it's something that comes up that's situational especially with all the changes that are going on on in the world i thought it'd be really kind of beneficial to chat about it and kind of give some tools and tips that have helped me my kids my clients um and all that stuff so let me dive right into it now if you're dealing with kind of anxiety that's right in the moment like you're really hyped up it's really stressful your panic and all that stuff it's really important kind of break that energy in which when you're in that moment in that mindset it's really really hard to do so something that i really focus on that helps me and you know i've given and helped my children with and all that stuff is working with your five senses so your sight your smell your hair your taste and your touch now for me um smell is really something that i go to so it's either either i'm opening up the front door and breathing in that fresh air or kind of working with an essential oil my favorite go-to is vanilla because for me it's just really calming lots of people like to use lavender but again everyone's different with what tool and tip works for them um also listening to something you know you know it could be chanting meditation or even hip-hop and your you know your favorite song that you just want to kind of break it down to and kind of like just get out of that anxious state and that focus where your mind's at um taste is also a really good one either it's um something healthy or something really comforting to you to kind of just instead of focusing on the anxious energy and thoughts going to your senses whatever is working for you also touch is a really good thing for me it's something always soft some people use kind of a hard texture or a rough texture to kind of break up that anxious energy to something else but you know i always say use what works for you everyone's different everyone has different you know stressors and anxiety and situational you know things that come up that bring it to you so it's really important that you kind of fill your toolbox with what works for you now if you're dealing with anxiety like every day whether it's you know kind of not not you're not in panic mode but it's more kind of baseline there and it just it's just what your your system is it's really important to kind of get out of that funk or that you know cycle is going back to the basics and when i say basics is really self-care basics now for me you know that's working on my my sleep working on my healthy intake hydration mindset and a few things that you can do with that is like when you're going to have a shower simple things not complicated and all that stuff but simple things when you're going to have a shower visualize that shower the water coming down is cleansing it cleansing your mind body soul and just really kind of washing away that stressful energy and just kind of letting it you know rinse cleanse all that stuff another thing is listening to meditations when you're you're when you're trying to sleep at night and your your mind's racing put on a meditation i always say guided meditation um because then you're not sitting there trying to think of what think or what not to think about guided meditation kind of makes you focus on their voice and what they're visualizing for me at night time i love somatic drumming that really and the guided meditation behind it it really kind of suits my soul also with hydration make sure you're drinking enough water that is easy to stay but you know it's really hard sometimes for people some people don't like the taste of water and then you can infuse your water with fresh fruits if you don't like that go to a pure juice and kind of infuse your water with that um what else healthy eating you know you don't have to dive in and be like clear out everything and go full hard in but you know have a smoothie in the morning if you don't like smoothies have a salad but just something basic to try to get your system back on a healthier path because living with that anxious energy all the time is really really hard on your system and your mindset um something that's really helped me throughout the year is this personal development listening to podcasts or um or audiobooks i'm not really like i can't really sit there and read a book i'm a mom of three kids can't i don't have time to do that but listening to an audiobook or a podcast while i'm going throughout my day really is helpful you know it kind of really takes me on a different path and it's also very healing um also you know exercise if you can't go out and you know lift weights at the gym or whatever put on a youtube go stretch it out put on music and just dance something to really elevate um your vibrations and kind of shift that energy anxious energy into something that anxious energy wants to move it doesn't really want to sit there too much if you're during the day um it wants to move so it's either dancing cleaning something like that um also really working on your environment if you're in a cluttered environment you know your system is going to kind of react to that if you have a calm clear clean environment your system is going to automatically feel a little bit calmer so again don't fully overwhelm yourself just take baby steps little baby steps because if you think of a ladder right i always give this analogy if you think of a ladder letters have little kind of baby steps to get up if you take those baby steps out of the ladder you're going to have a really hard time to get up there and it's not going to be stable and safe so take those little baby steps and appreciate acknowledge them appreciate them put your blinders on to other people and what they're doing and really focus on your journey and celebrate your baby steps um now one thing for me that's really helped when i was in a really anxious stressed out kind of i'd say dark moment in life um i was really looking for something to help soothe me you know i've tried lots of things and and it just wasn't working so i did turn to cbd oil and the reason why i picked thought cloud basically because there's so many cbd oils on the market right like you could feel overwhelmed of what to pick what's good what's not the reason why i picked um thought cloud is because right away you know i'm a researcher i went and looked on their website and right away um i saw it was reconfused now for me you know someone who is going to get um and going on my reiki journey and becoming a reiki master i saw the recant fuse i'm like whoa you know alignment okay let me look into this company and then i saw you know their reports and how pure and amazing their product is another thing that really kind of got me in there is the owner of the company leo he would go on on live on his instagram or make videos and talk about his day talk about things that he's struggled with and how he's overcome them um and it was really kind of i really enjoyed you know look i looked forward watching his videos every day and kind of connecting with him you know when you look at somebody in the eyes you connect to their soul and their energy and i just i felt like all of those things kind of aligned for me and that was the right company to go go with and i'm so glad i did because three years later i'm still using their products now the main reason why i'm using their products on top of those things are their products are good they work so it's kind of like you know a no-brainer there all those things that made me think okay let me try this company and then you know three years deep and i'm still going hard with them because it's something that i include in my daily practice with nighttime i take their nighttime series that really help kind of calm me and help me sleep so yeah i hope those tips were helpful um if you want to connect and reach out to me i'm on instagram my instagram is optimal journey i also have another instagram that's skin care beauty diy and also if you're looking into you know getting some thought cloud products and testing them out my discount code um for you to save money is discount code skin really simple skin that's it um and yeah so hopefully this video was helpful for you i'm looking forward to whoever wants to connect and reach out and just you know wishing you all the best and namaste thank you you", "Lz69U4-nAAQ": "hi guys Sam here I want to start this week's YouTube video a little bit differently I want to start with a story it's a story that's very personal to me it's a story that I've never told anyone but here goes a few years ago my hair started to fall out I know at first it was just a couple of hairs here and there but before long I couldn't look into a mirror without being confronted with an image of Phil Mitchell it knocked my confidence I can go out something had to be done that's when I discovered CBD oil I started rubbing CBD oil into my bald head morning day at night it was costing me thousands of pounds but I didn't care I just went hair and then the miraculous happened it grew back now that's a story which is completely untrue and I totally made up and the reason why I did that is because when I was first researching topics for this YouTube channel one of the most searched for terms on YouTube was CBD oil and hair loss that's why I wanted to make this video because it's really important that people understand what CBD does do and what CBD doesn't do [Music] now CBD oil is made from the cannabinoids found within the hemp plant and seed oil contains no cannabinoids and is essentially like olive oil but made from hemp seeds now CBD is a hot topic we all know that and that's why the confusion between hemp seed oil and the benefits of hemp seed oil got sort of muddled in with CBD oil and all the benefits of CBD oil so there are two very different things and I want to be clear that there is actually some potential for hemp seed oil benefit in your overall hair health that comes from the fact that hemp seeds contain a complete amino acid profiles they can obtain all nine essential amino acids which are they essentially the building blocks for proteins and that's what makes our hair so hemp seed oil yeah can't genuinely be really good for your hair but just in the same way that having a healthy balanced diet can and should do for your hair so if you like said you have it if you healthy diet then your hair's gonna be healthier as well if you are missing some of the essential amino acids and also Amiga threes and sixes are present within hemp seed oil which are really good to supplement as well which is especially for you if you're vegetarian  now if you're vegetarian for example it can be a slightly more difficult to get that proper mix of essential amino acid and omega-3s and omega-6s so supplementing your diet with hemp seeds or hemp seed oil can really go a long way to helping your hair health now it can be confusing because of the fact that a lot of CBD oils use hemp seed oil as the carrier oil like for example what I do with future well the carrier oil for the CBD is hemp seed oil so when you are taking this CBD oil you are also ingesting hemp seed oil now that may impact the health of your hair so by that logic yes taking this CBD oil may help your health may help the health of your hair however if you just want to improve the health of your hair you do not need to be buying CBD oil you need to be boring hemp seed oil is a hell of a lot cheaper and like I say it's essentially just olive oil made out of hemp seeds that's what you really need and if you're buying CBD oil if your hair is absolutely no science that exists to reinforce the fact that CBD the cannabinoid is going to do anything to improve the health of your hair it's all about the hemp seed oil why it's that that's where it comes from now the causes of hair loss typically are genetic so even if say CBD miraculously could prevent hair loss it's knowing to go back in time and change the genetics of food grandparents that's just not how it works and that hair loss really is a serious issue for a lot of people I don't mean to make light of it I don't mean to make fun of it but that's why I think it's important to make videos like this to explain what is gonna work for hair loss what definitely isn't because the last thing I want is like I said of my totally nonsensical story that if somebody ends up spending a lot of money expecting serially to treat something it has no chance of helping that's when it gives the industry a bad name you give CBD a bad name it means that people are gonna tell their friends that CBD doesn't work as CBD is not gonna work for this issue but that doesn't mean it's not great for a whole host of other things and that's why I think it's important to make this distinction so the people buying it for the right reasons I hope you've enjoyed this video I hope that has made clear the distinction between CBD oil and hemp seed oil because there are two very different things if you want to learn more about CBD if you want to know when the next video is gonna get released please subscribe to the channel click that little bell next to it so you get a notification in that this video comes out the next video is going to be on Amazon and eBay on what to look for when you're buying CBD online thank you very much see you next time [Music] and CBD", "AeNwoJ1YGOk": "hey guys I wanted to tell you about something that is truly truly amazing I don't know where this person got this product because it was sent to me as a gift in the mail it's called canna XL cream this is a cannabis cream and it's relief for joint your skin and nerve pain

hand at all thanks for watching guys and we'll see again bye bye", "Smd4oEcuhDQ": "what's up guys you know what time it is there's the low and the high we're gonna see how that presses later anyway let's uh yeah let's see how she does all right uh when i said let's see how she does um break the woman up to 170 and i have um 18 grams of 74 to 159 micron dry sift not melt or bubble flash just dry cleaned very very efficiently clean and let's see how she presses those you're wondering um and thank send yourself that's a different press it is um i have a lot when i you know when i'm dialing things in or dialing in um specific psi's time uh press time press times um temperatures etc um i love my rosin press new york 20-ton tank right there beast plates are huge just love it but for tonight again as i mentioned a lot of work to do and a lot of presses and i have everything else out there this is really the only uh one of a few hash presses tonight um i know a lot of people aren't big fans of flower rosin but um it's a very you know as far as the the economics of it it's an undeniable product you know um it's a it's a completely solventless full melt product that that we can shell for very very cheap and it's never bad and that's like as dark as it gets and that's not bad at all always a nice butter consistency um i try to keep it fresh fresh but literally i don't know with flour rosin i can collect it immediately and jar it and get it into the freezer immediately and it's still buttered by the next day all right it's time to give this thing some pressure and by some pressure i mean little to none and now yep there we go we just deployed this place back down to zero psi so around a thousand and it's falling pretty quickly we're warming up and i'm evening out the bag here um again i have no idea how this press is going to go so i don't know if i said that or not yet but if i had been if i didn't say that or not yet now we have no expectations here um no guarantees of gold or anything all right up to about 25 hundo and what do you guys see in there nothing either huh falling pretty fast hit the three and it's falling relatively fast again um we have to be making some rosin i have a feeling i'm going to be heartbroken over the yield but i don't know then again maybe you just needed a minute you guys see both of us we got just in case you're wondering and back down hey turned out to be a pretty decent dry sip hash press after all um and for that anybody that might care this specific strain is cbd kush it's uh it's still very high in thc it's just it's uh well it's much higher you know most of your strains that have any thc in them have you know one percent maybe one and a half or no cbd this has i want to say like six 11 or maybe yeah 11 that's right that's right it's 11 cbd 16 to use so three to two and go ahead and uh run this guy across the top clean that out there we're at max psi there uh if anybody cares i'm i'm not trying to go any higher than six or sixty five hundred um i bumped right up to 6500 there and it fell pretty quickly there's obviously still some more hash to this place let's look at where it looks like we're going to get a reasonably looks like we're going to get a relatively decent yield got about 15 seconds left here there's more than definitely going to be a second press in this but i have had it on the plates for long enough that that can be our second press oof oh yeah all right how'd it come out how to come out um i know we're probably looking at the camera right there going like bro very dark rosin um you know as i mentioned dry shift and let's try something from some cbd kush buds that um let's see we're not only uh dry but they've been curing for a while so there's gonna be some you know the alpha and beta chlorophyll properties some mature maturization of the trichrome head is going to of course amber eyes that milky white or uh even just cloudy i'll tell you what the good reward again i feel like well i mean obviously that's [ __ ] i feel like this guy's got a second press in him but you know i don't know i'll never find out um i keep all my pucks and i keep them separate yeah i keep my rosin chips separate so that i can make solventless coconut oil with them and then i also go ahead and turn it up a little notch there and make that solventless coconut oil that you can use to make edibles you can dose your own you know what i mean let's see if i can get you guys in here really does look a lot darker than it than it actually is if you go you know um it looks it's yeah it's crazy looks darker on the camera that does the eye but it's not it's not a dark it's not too dark sorry of a chocolate color but it is gorgeous and as far as stability goes well let me just show you i can already tell just how it's going to act by holding the parchment for a minute yes my favorite ash rosins come up with this sorry i don't know i mean my favorite presses come up like this um whether they be you know flower or ash or whatever obviously as a smoker i i personally prefer hash rosin but it's uh it can be significantly more expensive and it can also be not available depending on where you are you know what your deal is if you're one of the people that you know follows me or um or has been following me for a little while or maybe uh or you you know you live in the pnw you're in the oregon market the wreck market uh california market washington market etc you guys just i'm not talking to you guys um and but even still you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about as far as the pricing of the hash rosin it's just brutal look at that i want you to see that collection let's go ahead and grab go back and grab our other one there we go right there right right there oh don't break on me oh it broke on me hey we got them all there you go ladies and gentlemen there is our cbd kush dry sift hash rosin not flower rosin damn okay oh we were gonna do yield weren't we i mean why not right okay let's see i'll try not to take too much longer i'm sure you guys are probably already bored if anybody's even uh you know i imagine 90 of you already have checked out and or maybe you just fast-forwarded to here i don't know either way my apologies for moving too slow for you damn that's stable that's the thing man with ah you can get the uh you can get hash rosin to maintain its fresh breast consistency much longer and also of course i'm working in a cold room right now so it's not really going to start to butter like this if you guys can see that or not but we are at 5.4 out of 18 which um 5.4 out of 18 that's almost 33 that's a solid 30 percent yield solid 30 yield on some triceps that i did not take a bunch of time and try and card and get it all clean and perfect or anything i just mucked it all around beat the hell out of it and uh i bet we can get this to 5.4 and above [ __ ] five point four nine five point five five and a half grams five and a half grams eleven sixteen and a half grams that'd be thirty three percent yeah we're definitely into this into a solid thirty um what's beautiful about this is that number one sloppy sloppily collected dry sift this the reason this gave me a third yield and some very reasonable quality hash rosin for a cured product not live not fresh frozen not fresh cured um this gave me the 33 yield because or 30 sorry about 30 yield because of the micron specifics this guy which is 25 to 73 the low microns and the high 160 to 249 i'm sure this guy will probably only yield about i don't know if this yield if the other one yielded 30 this will probably only yield 15 or 20. but there's a good bit in here so you know if we have uh 40 grams of sift in there or 30 grams of sip in there and i get uh 20 off of it well then we got another six grams of beautiful hash ruffles and of course then we can put it all together and it's and it's just full spectrum now let's see here i'll show you one more we'll get it prepared for you a little bit whew yeah it's just yucky i don't know i know some of you going like yo that is dark it's gross ew it's cured resin it's not fresh frozen and again it's frozen it's not gonna have that kind of clarity to it you know um it could have a beautiful color to it but it shouldn't unless it's very very fresh pressed and it's very live and has that beautiful color generally is not a lot of clarity this stuff is already starting to butter as you can see but you know i'm not uh i'm not writing any letters home about it or anything but again this is cured product and i keep forgetting to get this far i keep distracted getting distracted sorry aside from this being cured for the product not being fresh frozen not you know etc the um shoot almost almost as dominant as thc as cannabidiol um look at some videos of uh hemp rosin pressing even the live stuff is nowhere near the color that we get out of our fresh frozen hash rosin with regular canvas so having said that i'm sure the fact that it's a high cbd strain had something to do with it and again um well not live is not live but that's five and a half grams of incredibly high cbd uh three to two so generally my hash rosin comes in between uh 75 and 85 percent cannabinoids let's say usually right around 80 to 85 percent cannabinoids so if we're three to two you know um five goes into eighty what so what are we like uh right around fifty percent thc thirty percent cbd that's gonna that'll smack and it's incredibly medicinal hope you guys enjoyed the video hope i didn't bore you try to keep this baby under 20 minutes and of course this is just a little personal press for me here on the lab and uh hoping to be um submitting for inspection very soon so that i can start to produce here okay guys", "x5JqPkiKUY8": "hi hi hi guys hey how you doing i'm hoping your day is good your evening your afternoon so far your week is coming along well shout out to texas texas been having a hard time lately guys a couple of days that storm really was brutal to them i'm happy to hear things is looking up thank god and i'm hoping everything will work out for you guys i really do shout out to texas all right let's get to the point let's get to the point the question came up what is the difference between him oil and cbdr all right so let's let's let's let me tell you what i know of so the hem oil is rich in cbd oil okay it comes from the cannabis plant just like um cbd right cbd we also know is canon big dial right or canopy doyle like someone would say okay as well and it comes from the cannabis plant as well we normally known as marijuana plant but the only thing excuse me the distance is what they're aimed to do right so now the him oil basically is aimed for nutritional values right so with that said it helped boots for instance um the circulation in our immune system right it also has g la gamma linolenic acid so what gla does guys is part of the omega-6 family that plays a part a very part the growth of our hair our nails giving us healthy skin right so that's what that do now it also have omega-9 which helps balance our cholesterol and you know what high cholesterol does right okay so now even more so the hemp oil also is one of the carriers that helps the absorption of the cbd oil in our digestive system in a past video i spoke how hemp oil olive oil and coconut oil are one of the main carriers that help with the exhaustion of the cbdr in our digestive system which makes it easier and you know it works all right so now both hemp oil and cbd oil is legal but now however cbd oil podesta's properties that's aiming and assisting say with treatments for ailments say um depression anxiety chronic disease uh mental disorders for those that have cancer that help them um with the appetite the nausea now the cbdl have receptors right cb1 receptors cv2 receptor and their role as little soldiers right they stay they they around you guys they they're in the brain because we have the endocannabinoid system in our bodies anyway right so these receptors they working and they're targeting they're targeting like liquid soldiers you get you get the grip so that is what they're aim to do and also it has promising in helping people um that want to kick substance um use disorder want to stop smoking um they're saying it's becoming promising with parkinson's disease tourette's system cbd oil even though it's in his early stages in the baby stages but there's constant constant research by scientists and saying listen this is what we're finding although we're experimenting in rats and not enough with humans but this is our discovery so basically this is the difference between cbd oil and the hemp now let's be clear there's no such thing as pearl cbd oil so if you happen to come across a bottle and it says pure cbd oil nine out of ten guys it have him oil or just snake oil it's just leave it on his shelf leave it on his shelf but going back if the bottle says pure cbd oil you better believe 9 out of 10 it has thc in it now zero point zero three percent so you save a three tenth is legal by law which means you're not going to get high like the marijuana right marijuana has cbd too but it has more thc which gets you that high feeling and a lot of us we don't we don't want that hype feeling at all so now there's three different um type of brands i'm not gonna say brands but three different type of variety of cbd you have isolate you have broad spectrum and you have you also have full spectrum so know that so there's there is a difference there now with the isolate usually it only contains the cbd um and no other cannabinoid but it doesn't mean it doesn't have any thc it might have very very very little thc or no tac okay so now you have the full spectrum the four spectrum does have um thc and the cannabinoid right but it has more cbd in it and very very very very little thc the broad spectrum guys well i'm gonna tell you um the response spectrum allegedly does not have thc but like i said you have to do your research um you have to make sure that you're able to get um the disclosure on line of what it what it actually contains and you should be able to get that online a lot of times it's on the back of the bottle and you can't read it right so you have to be careful so basically that is the the difference between him oil and cbd oil and i can't stress enough stay away from buying um dcbdr from these side stores gas stations even if you buy um from um drug stores or any reputable companies i'm seeing all over the place i don't want to say any names um do your research and make sure at least you can get anywhere from 30 to 60 day your money back guarantee if it's not working for you and the reason why is 30 to 60 day because everybody system is different and everybody pain is different so it might take 30 days for it to get in your system and you feel some type of relief or it might take 60 you know and also depends on the strength i can't stress that enough either i'm i'm seeing 3 000 milligrams 2500 uh milligrams guys and even though they're saying that it may be safe to take it um you can't od on these milligrams but on my last video um when i spoke with um some organic suppliers they're saying that a lot of times it's not safe so anywhere from 300 to 1500 they saying is basically safe anything over guys they really don't wreck a uh record minute it might cause you dizziness um diarrhea um mood swings stomach aids so people of different companies i'm sorry different um brand name companies they produce all this so you can buy okay you can buy and that's not good so with that said guys don't forget to subscribe click that button leave me a comment

welcome to my recovery journal my name is Mark and today I want to talk about a product that I've used the last eight months that has had a significant impact on my health so real quick to talk about my health I have been dealing with pretty bad chronic illness since the age of 18 I'm now 27 the last third of my life has been heavily affected by my health I'm not able to be fully independent I'm not able to hold down a job right now and haven't been for years but I am working to get back to that point and this product has been a part of my regimen that is getting me closer and closer hopefully so the product that I'm talking about today is Charlotte's Web full extract hemp oil now this product that I use in particular is pretty strong it is their original formula it is 50 milligrams of CBD which is cannabidiol per milliliter I take it as two different servings I take it in the morning half a milliliter and I take it before bed half a milliliter so overall I'm getting 50 milligrams around the per day of CBD I'm also getting a total of I believe 86 that's it yes 86 milligrams of extract in total so 50 milligrams of that 86 is CBD the other milligrams are other cannabinoids that are extracted in the extraction process hence why it is called a full extract because it includes the other cannabinoids that are naturally present in the plant so CW hemp which is the company that produces this oil has a really great backstory and I highly highly recommend to anyone who's interested to check out their website and read about the history of their company it's a part of the reason why love this product not only does it help me it helps a lot of other people and it's a story of its creation is pretty awesome story in my opinion so I will include a link to their website in the description you can check it out if you want to so I want to talk a bit about the medical benefits some of these benefits have been studied extensively most of them are preliminary studies because of the cannabis laws in America there's not able to do it they're not able to do a lot of research and studies into the health benefits and full effects of these different cannabinoids but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence as well as preliminary studies like I said on mice and other types of studies so we have some information about CVS benefits so the first main benefit is it has a great anti-inflammatory effect there have been studies that have shown to reduce inflammation throughout the body depending on dosages obviously all of these all of these supposed treatments or uses for treatment are dependent on dosage and so it all berries so on top of inflammation you have its ability to relax the body and to reduce insomnia and people CBD has been found to be a strong anti-anxiety meaning it is very helpful in reducing anxiety and depression it also is excellent for pain relief all different forms of pain whether it be muscle pains neuropathic pains or joint pains CBD is found to help reduce pain and that may be related to its anti-inflammatory effects obviously again there needs to be more studies done to really fully understand how CBD works but well it's a good start and the final and probably most important is its anti-seizure effects this is go to the backstory of the product it was produced for a young girl who had dravet syndrome and I don't want to over ask me but I believe it was tens maybe hundreds of seizures every day and so her family worked with the founders of this company of CW hemp to develop a tincture that she could take hopefully to reduce her seizures and my understanding is that the Charlotte's Web oil not only reduced but eliminated her seizures so that's pretty incredible in my opinion secondly I would say is that it really helped alleviate my gut discomfort I had a lot of bloating and general pain I had a lot of difficulty eating normal quantities of food I was definitely not getting enough calories per day and again while this didn't completely eliminate the problem it got me so much closer to being able to stomach three meals a day and being able to handle a day without having severe intestinal pains there are other products and other forms of treatment that I've done other supplements other regimens that have really really diminished my gut issues but this is definitely a big piece the third main thing that this oil magically helped with was my pain I had all types of pain in every part of my body pretty constantly this oil along with cannabis using cannabis has had a serious impact on pain reduction I have taken many different forms of painkillers in the past and no no if them were worth the risks because they weren't effective enough to take on the risks but this stuff has been unbelievable at pain reduction and a part of that is because of its anti-inflammatory effects I have an auto inflammatory disease and so inflammation my body is very prone to becoming highly inflamed and so having this bottle here really helps in emergency situations when I feel like I'm having an inflammatory attack I can increase this dose at my dosages of this oil and it really helps reduce the attacks pain wise and duration wise and forth and probably most important in my opinion for me is what it did for my mental health I've had anxiety for pretty much my entire life my earliest memories with anxiety go back to probably first grade so it's probably 6 or 7 years old and as I got older it came in went in waves this severity and my anxiety caused me to have to provide depression and it was really terrible and when I got sick at 18 years old my mental health spiraled out of control I was having regular panic attacks and anxiety attacks I was having constant constant bombardment of terrible thoughts and its worst I was having suicidal ideations I was having constant anxious thoughts 24 hours a day and it was mental torture I felt trapped in my head I felt like I couldn't control what was happening and it felt like misery really genuinely and within a couple weeks of taking this product there was a significant reduction in my what I would consider uncontrollable anxiety so the anxiety that was just my mind going in it I couldn't control it and the calming sensation that I got from taking this product from taking Charlotte's Web was was I don't know how to compare it because I've never luckily my parents never put me on drugs pharmaceuticals to handle a problem but this has been a game changer for my mental well-being since starting this product I have been in a clearer stronger and more confident headspace then I've been probably my entire life and that's while dealing with my health so it's it's I just love this product for my anxiety most of all so if you're
