{"baEnTUQaKf0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that Q&A it will be fired up as soon as I get enough questions and answers I need people to put questions unlike stuff like that so for my Q&A so questions and answers but yeah basically so give me as many questions as you can on this video on Facebook and anywhere you see me so yeah even if you've got a send that as I will be making a peel box soon so to do the Q&A is block power so people couldn't send in Q&A to the peel box and send me stuff as well so that's all gonna be set but yeah today what we've got and I will say thank you to the person really big thank you I'm not going to mention the person at the moment because I don't know if they want to be mentioned but really big thank you I've used my own kind of a sticker that I print out myself I print all these myself everything that you see with stickers or graphics designs is all done by me so that's all done got some cookie dog got one of it we did get two so we got it in this head chef as they say vacuum sealed bags I had two of them so we smoked one day me George yeah my girlfriend did say yeah but she's very quiet over there speak a bit louder there you go you might Hirota but yeah basically I can't wait to try this a few guys can see that in the bag but it looks awesome we will get out and get some pictures and we're not gonna get a close-up video because I find that takes too long but yeah we are gonna get some pictures of it close pictures stuff like that show you guys the bud and as soon as we crack this I will let you know the smell so we're gonna jump in and we do the appearance halfway through because we do the appearance more after we've cracked the burden I've got my little bit left over I'll be looking at it double-checking it see what you guys reckon and then that's when I chuck in a few of the pictures as well and stuff like that I chuck in the description at the start so we do dismount no oh my days not that mmm then cookies I can't stop smiling it that is awesome now for cookies that is really really really like warm good warm gooey cookies a kind and speak I'm so excited warm give me cookies with that star dog smell in the background eyes awesome it's not as pungent as when I first cracked it open but like I said I've been letting her sitting here I thought it's gonna be smelly yeah it's not as smelly but there's still that gorgeous cookie smell I can't wait to have a look at this so we get this out we're gonna use off tweezers because we do not want to touch this at all carefully does it like a surgeon the last little leaf oh my days the smile is still in the bag it's crazy it's amazing there's so many trichomes on this is just just glistening just shiny looks like glass some crazy looking they love the look of it you can lush all my days yeah head chef box so hope you like a pick up some of them in myself to put some stuff to store it in and stuff oh yeah this bud we're gonna take the leaf off the top I'm gonna show you guys just double-check all the dirt on no no if I'm on the side here we go and this is awesome I'm gonna pick up perfectly so I don't drop there you go my days like I always say I don't know how close the gap and stuff but this bud is awesome what a gorgeous looking thing coconuts I love to look a bit the try clones pistols everything call this is amazing now yeah but some nice nice boat on reviews but I had stuff like this this is one of them buds that you would classes weed porn it's lush it's just shining constantly I can't stop staring at it it's amazing yes sir weirdest up instead of staring and see what we've got here so I mean is quite not sticky but it's dry as hell but then try cons as soon as you touch him and apply a bit fresh now anything's next to it then photons there would be if you collected order Keith off that and he just kept collecting it and it's pure blonde I swear down now that would be multi multi Keith and you better make some nice wax out of luck shut her out of that will be waxing more shutter e substance what glass yeah see what we've got so the smell now because we smarter straight away in that thing in the bag I will say the smells good but I'm not gonna give the score or anything yet I'll tell you about the smell precisely yeah because I'm gonna grind it up and tell you after its ground because I imagine it's gonna be a lot more potent once it's ground because where I've opened the bag to get the 1 gram out of there before and this is the other gram so yeah it is dead on so we're gonna split this for me and my girlfriends we've got a meditator for her so now we're gonna try and find some scissors but if not then I might have to use my fingers no she shouldn't mind right yeah we've got some she found some thank you babe right then what we do they just trim it just so because basically if you're wondering why I'm doing this as well I've been mucking around with crystals aluminum no not aluminum I'm only on crystals and sulphate crystals so they stain really bad especially the ammonium ones so if you've got dyes in them I've been using yellow I'll show you some of the crystals that's one of them and that's been sat on the side trying good nice right solid solid is how and I got a whole sheet here let's tick and get this off here I'll show you guys about breaking any of them but yeah basically we've got the whole sheet here so I've been knocking on crystals so I'm not touching the ton of this as much as I can I'm just showing you quickly this one is a gorgeous looking like a violet Lee looking one I don't know if you can see it on the light because like going straight for it but when it's dark and dark areas that's nice violet these look more like a creamy Sun so yeah but they're looking nice just then once I know I've got some ready to go back in but I've got these ones as well so I love I love things that grow and I think they're gross but yeah we've got our solution sitting in on side you can see a little bit of sediment at the bottom so it's slowly coming back down to room temperature you still got a little walk these ones will be going back in to grow some more that's a form of crystal so they're twice the size of the other ones maybe three times the size yeah that's a form of crystal he was growing for a month before so we got to least a decent size about that size and then we left it to grow a little and then I'll show you so this one we started straight from seed so this is how the other one would have started off we're doing a seed crystal and it got to this and then you put it back in and it gets stirred up and then once we put that one back and it gets bigger and then not want to get to that size and exceptionally just Karen going that's how it happens in New York as well so what we doing is yeah I was doing earth crystals in our home as I was saying so technically speeding up the process but yeah what we're gonna do now is just take that off there I don't know why me being stupid trim this up just in sections just so I can split me right I do it do it section by section so because she don't mind what she gets if he's like little bullet liebe it's because she just grinds the lot with me I like my buds because I like putting little nuggets in only grind it on camera so I can get a smile and get the full effect but I reckon you get better effect when you don't grind it because the more you breaking can try cons the more you're losing trigrams I could see loads on the back of here and it's like as soon as I just trimmed it I don't like trimming it about that little shop in it and even pulling it apart I get scared about I do it so dead it could be sometimes this smile oh wait he's like I smell it again every time you chop it it's like that warm cookies with that star dog Oh crazy there will be a description on it so you guys can actually check out the description this time I checked out the description so if I'm wrong why it's say in any good flavor - smells let me know in a polite way obviously as I said I'm very temperamental don't like being I just am so there we go as my girlfriend just pop it into here it's very sticky break into it I'm not actually sticky like there's a dry sticky as I can say it's the way I could explain a dry sticky if you know what I sticky is so like more like the aspect of yeah I just had to cut the video because family has been a bit a little bit noisy so I just cut a video but quickly as I was saying I've got older kind of this in the popgun it's my girlfriend so I chuck it to her oh sorry and as I was saying it's like a dry sticky so the cannabis is all dry but as soon as you start breaking into it this sticks straight away because the heat and stuff like that and when you're playing around playing around with it not applying it you going to say that wax type of names but yeah so when you're mucking around with it it's quite sticky John passed my big grinder Georgia thank you you get my girlfriend to grab my grinder for me and these are the new grinders that we have I will be something nice you know I've got one green and full red so far my ones a bit dirty I've been using it just to do like a little review on it not actually unboxing review but a more actual review on how the grinds stuff like that so these are amazing so I will be doing a review shortly on them little check if my cluster picks besides you normally get a plastic scraper I think I've took one oh yeah after I hate the plastic scrapers only because a lot of people like on I don't they flick it about quite a bit I like using met razor blades and turning the razor bleed not that way but that way and you've got to be careful normally a blunt one's better just to scrape it up it's a lot easier but you ever cut a little bit of this sauce going to up and tell you the smell so because it's my bit now the man because it's my bit now I'll use my fingers I don't mind a bit of it's not good but I don't mind it we've got that but there to take a picture off I think should be right oh just get over so we take it off Go Daddy there's two points there so we get two bombs out up so this much that straight in there I don't like using too much because what's the point I'll be pushing yourself way too far only time you need to do that is when you actually need to push yourself for a video or for a bit of fun going this way it's smart I can't wait to smell this because just cutting it on his own smell is just pungent really pungent it's kicking out some nice sweet notes there's some really like strong star dog notes like the chemically about any description from this so I don't even know what it is I'm wrong let me know oh my dudes there's definitely pining this all right what I'm good to make sure what I've gone for it yet let's going to get into that a bit bit and it is is a free piece and it's all screw screw connections so now what we can is that really cookie smell like a real nice pungent cookie smell sweet like like I say all cookies I mainly got like not all to me it smells of it like a warm gooey autumn smell I can't explain autumns bar like it's just mold wine smell but it's not actually mold wine is that refreshed like warm feeling the feeling you get off it that's what it makes you feel like in the same smell and then you got that like warm gooey cookies behind it with the star dog it's lush gorgeous train can't wait to taste it now I've been waiting for a long time I think it's been about a week or two weeks say a long time for me that's a long time to hold on to cannabis because I smoke it like I eat food so I need it it's one of them things I've got to have it because if I don't I get very sweaty anxious and basically I can go into the states like where I start crying I'm meant to be on medication been off medication for two years now not three years now yeah about three years now so and basically it's helped me so so and I wasn't but I don't like medication I hate medication anyway that's another total thing or have to do a vlog on but you've got yourself a new rig yeah we've got this for a bit now we've got this Christmas think Christmas time yeah Christmas time run about luck so I've got this at Christmas off my mum or my girlfriend a cot over which one one of them I just got a load of money and Pete Sugarman annoys we're not flying presents because they don't know what to get me because they don't apply me just random stuff and I not like you stay give me the cash and I go buy my own things so I bought this so it's a nice little recycler it's not actually as long as I've closed got it drops him so pops through you take that out then it recycles here and the double recycler so it don't hit you in the mouth nice colors and I'll be selling these soon yeah got to pick up these off me I just need to work out on the onions by that time and I'm just gonna cost me and if I got to cash so yeah put that back over there for now and we fill I polled up with a bit and yet as bone dry this stuff is literally bone dry and we do a smallest one just so we can see which is death all right it's we don't wanna kill myself at the next one yeah it does smallest one and then they do a nice sized one so this one would be for the flavor and next one of you for the buzz and then we'll have a look at the appearance and there'll be some screenshots but uh might be some screenshot so I might actually guard to get some pictures on my phone instead of zooming into the picture and trying to screenshot so I should better get some pictures on my phone if I don't use the HDR or whatever is that HT recorder so my phone's got a built-in automatically and we have bought ourselves some hemp awake because when I watched Tyler's video I smoked basically he was using cement wick and it looked a lot nicer to smoke with he choked a lot less and then when I tried it is a lot more smoother and I find just just move it out so you've got yourself a nice little bit then you've got to use a lighter to light it up and then what's his lip it's like a much it just keeps burning down you want enough and if you tilt it go up even more like that it's burning so much so it's pretty decent it's just made from hemp wick and beeswax whatever if you guys can read that but I will put a picture of the heavyweight kind of stuff like that and rule does these herself I will be buying some raw and we're kin drizzler and everything like to do with raw because wars with her the best she's got try get this perfect now and what I'd like to do sometimes is tuck it back in the center so it stays dead straight but sometimes it don't work because it's quite annoying and stuff when it wants to be and then just but this one's a bit more loose than the other one the other one was quite most got a lot more stiffer can't speak once again yeah anyway just talk to me and I'm gonna get in a bomb I'll say makes yourself said again it's toxic me and make yourself bomb I'm gonna be hitting one base office cliff dab deep anything if you've got some big juice why producer and make sure you hit some food because it's not nice to hit well for someone else it's a week in front of you and watching them smoke and you're not smoking and I'll say see through the clouds hope you don't die because I've got a coffin moving yeah see if you close anyway hi guys basically what happened was the video cut out as I was hitting the bomb so you probably got me doing the bomb basically but thank god we've grown a smoke on this one sure thing basically I will hit another little little one quickly it's really quickly adjusted just so you guys can see me it's nice tasty but yeah as I was saying the flavor at pungent cookies really nice it just kicks you in the back of the fro like the sweet flavors the warm feel in right the back of the throat it's not much harshness there it's really clean really really clean you can't see the ash you know because but yeah basically as the cleaners smoke I smoked in a long time and especially with this make sure you guys get some home wick the cars the lighter makes it taste like crap let's go I've also you know ever since I've been using this I went through one in the first day or two of these first day I use this like no tomorrow because I hit a lot of wrong sister people not know me in the area like this me that know me in the area you know I smoked quite a bit so yeah we need to get a bud up now because we've used a bit too much no no so now who's gonna pick it and just rock up load in so they're gonna be a bit more harder but especially without having wick I do say we make a big one so let's go for it let's go for it me you get this little bit off about tapping it so I hate trying outside because and you losing your crystals see if we've got any uniform see what the gods made oh they were collection going not much just off at first not we might scrape it up and see what the crystals taste like see it's hitting me already elbows not gonna mention the buzz yet yeah strong stuff is really strong no and I definitely say the flavor 10 out of 10 for the strain flavor yeah it's an awesome flavor one of the best ones and it like captures you nicely and everything so it's really nice really really nice yeah alright we should have to cut the video basically back to it now basically someone just knocked at the door and the dogs start barking well like I said our households very noise in the daytime I don't like doing videos in the daytime not trying to keep at nighttime but because I'm going to UPA's event on Friday I'm trying to clear my phone of all space that's being taken up so I've got a lot of videos to make today I've got this review we've got go out make some rap videos some music videos so yeah I got to do them and care oh I see free of them off my phone I've got four of them one more photo clear three of them get them off my phone and then I've got eight o'clock yeah I say seafood or clouds until I mean it's heaven which this bro nearness but I just slowly but yeah see if you're close make sure you hit a bong spliff anything add a brick and hit it with me see [Music] we use lighter cuz the buds wedged in there [Music] [Applause] [Music] while Sato hears that stream it's very strong huh as you guys can see cactus you especially if you try to make a big one and it don't help I've got a cold and a cough but yeah for King excuse my language can't breathe at all thank you excuse me a minute guys done my nose basically when you've got a lot of mucus blowing the back your nose and your chest I'm gonna smoke pizza you can't breathe horrible I don't know how the video looks I don't know if I look stupid or what on it hope if I'm COFF my guts up all right but definitely a strong strain I feel buzzed up to how but yeah it's one of the nicest strains I've had for a long time well you can't think it's one of them ones can't like think of what I want to say and stuff like that so it just hits you straight away incidentally I've had free no so instead of two so yeah catches you especially when you put a bird in first and ground up weed but I took my own way but yeah definitely check out the screen it's telling her ten-four bus the bus catches you in the temples the shoulders I'm just then I felt a bit like not like a looser genic but it feels a bit wobbly so it's quite a nice bug and the buzz it's amazing like shoulders catches you nicely the back of the neck you can feel the backs out of me and even the top of your head you can feed it all relax on the top of your head so what I'll say this make sure you guys like and subscribe make sure you definitely smash that like button trying to get as many likes on my videos as possible make sure you comment for the Q&A as well because I need some more concept that so many more comments I've only got about three or four so far so we need a lot more than three or four to do it so yeah I try to tuck them up me as much as you kind of up my life about everything just anything you think of just not stupid comments and like I said before like and subscribe it's toxic me check out more of my videos and hopefully we get some more subs be more reviews coming out got fun review to edit so I've coming up I've got a beatboxing video to edit it's not be going up to and this one so that's a few

"ILe9uCMbcag": "hi there stu's reviews here doing fuzzies again who cares i don't care i don't have to have a reason do i pretty sky today okay so i don't know you guys didn't notice but what happened was i'm so stoned that i did the whole review when the camera wasn't on so let me just tell you it was a great river there was funny [ __ ] [Music] anyway i smoked most of the joint here's what the product looks like snapshot keeps the kids out of it and the dogs interesting even though i already did the review there's still plenty of time do not do the review this i feel like i'm bugging the neighbor so i'm getting paranoid am i the only one who notices how much i smell you know it's like to sign me up for the mayo clinic right now i'm ready great product fuzzies rules oh yeah this is my new smoke g prince g brave something rather here we go deep rape three notice the almost abalone-ish graphic and this product really is amazing overall i mean because products really are just about a thing that's in your hands or thing in general but especially if it's something that you can that you can actually use as a 3d model in front of yourself so you know i mean things like that the magnetic battery back did i say magnetic it's magnetic so it everything's kind of magnetic these days but and then just look at it it's like the invicta watches and in fact the invicta has a watch it's kind of like the seiko it's a but it's done up like this just to be an object of now let me show you how great it works i had to turn the heating of this thing way down to like way down so i don't know who's smoking it with the hot heat i don't it's anyway you", "mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on these these is they they're the way you hold them they strung in your hand they burn slowly not burning fast I've been at this for about an hour or so 35 minutes it's a good burn if you were smoking a regular blunt

catalyst cannabis uh the day that connected switched their name to catalyst down here in southern california they had a five dollar aider deal and this is it purple cookies so let's go ahead and take a look i'm kind of excited about this just to see what's in here i did notice this ticket was on here so i'm guessing that's the normal price so it's about old pal range but yeah let's go and see what's in this bag but first let's check out this panel here so purple cookies of course testing out two 14.23 total cannabinoids cannabinoids however you want to say it thc at 13.5 percent and then wow a surprising amount of cbd frankly at 0.07 so looks like this was packaged really not that long ago we're coming about a month and a half ago or so so uh yeah let's just go ahead and get into this i want to see what a five dollar hauler looks like nothing really on the back there i'm not expecting a whole lot uh i even was debating on doing this really but i'm curious and i'm sure you guys are too wow i had to really work at freaking pulling this bag apart all right let's see does it have one of those flaps no all right let's see what's in here oh wait it does on the front maybe i hate these kind of bags to be honest it's so confusing as to where you're supposed to go okay i'm just gonna get root forcy with it there it is all right so that's what we're looking at okay i kind of expected that there i don't know what this is is this even weed let's see i mean that seems to be uh i guess that could be weird it's like a piece of the stem i think or i don't know chime in with that i don't think i'll just put that back there like you can see it a little bit more in focus all right so what we're seeing in here yeah not the greatest and uh maybe the five dollars uh with about the right price point um let's go ahead and get some of this out in the light i'm just gonna pour it in my hand just kind of keep it neat because i'm not really sure what i'm expecting there so there we go oh okay yeah this just smells like pure veg like just like well this needs to breathe a little bit it's just like i mean it smells like what it cost you know and i'm not yeah i'm not going to paint the picture really any rosier than that it just smells like pure veggie larf um i'd be lying if i said anything else it's just the smell it comes off it's like grass like wet grass kind of you know yeah maybe a little like sweet must in there but it's like not anything that i'm used to that i'm used to seeing or smoking so yeah uh i mean you know it was five dollars so whatever that it is what it is i mean like zooming in on that looks pretty tricked out for larf you know like so but yeah that's pretty much the quality we're getting here so um you know i i honestly if it was not five dollars i'd say no uh don't ever buy this uh yeah 20 i'd have a really hard time with this so just uh you know double up and then your art if you double up that money you're gonna be in a lot better place and it'll probably last you a lot longer but hey i'm gonna see how this smokes maybe i'll turn around on it but yeah the smell is not doing any favors it looks alright though so yeah we'll see how it smokes", "V_OLCJGpjEc": "alright guys so what happens when your dog eats over a dozen pot cookies now I hesitated to make this video footage is like a year old and I'm gonna show you I just wanted to you know I decided you know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead

three if you haven't been following my instagram man this is day three of the blackout that's currently happening in my community um they shut out all the freaking power to the whole entire like block because they're trying to prevent any fires from happening there's a lot of really high 85 mile winds and stuff happening so they just don't want anything bad happen dude there's trees broken down literally all over my complex and things i'm just like whoa this looks like literally like a horror movie bro go follow me on my instagram to get updated with that stuff because i have no power bro i haven't been able to upload i'm just literally recording right now because look you see my setup back there nothing's on bro because there's no power whatsoever i don't have internet access i don't have internet to edit i mean i don't have access to my computer to edit videos so yeah um we've been staying at my in-laws house because they're the only ones with um access to you know and internet and you know anything power as that so we've been staying over there for the past couple days and there's no one here so man so i'm taking advantage and i'm gonna be smoking this cheetah piss blunt guys that purchased that cookies you guys remember that video i'm finally gonna be smoking it right here throughout the whole entire apartment and just gonna be talking to you guys since no one's here i'm just gonna fully enjoy this to the max so i just cut it open right here you have to cut it with scissors it doesn't have a little seal to open it but this is the cheetah piss bone this one is sitting at 23 thc this is the front and then let me go ahead and slide it out all right guys boom and then you get it in a nice little long white tube boom and then let me go ahead and take this out hopefully no bud falls out oh my goodness this thing is thick yo this is thicker than a bowl of oatmeal boys holy smokes this is the cookies blunt this is a hemp wrap with a glass tip and you got the cheetah piss stuffed to the max right there bro it feels like it's going to fall out but they got that thing wrapped in there nice i'm squeezing around and it doesn't really seem like there's any gaps in here so let's just go ahead and uh smoke this yo i lost my thing to mount my freaking tripod onto my camera so this angle is just gonna have to do all right yo so we got our blunt and we got our torch right here because i heard with these you kind of you it's better to light them with the torch just because you could get a nice more even burn so that's what we're gonna do boys we're just gonna go ahead and torch it roast it like a little marshmallow roast the tip boys don't burn it too much and then once it's nice and charred you can pretty much just start cheating on [Music] it oh nothing hit back boys oh my goodness this thing is about to get hot hold on let me close the window so i mean the door so it doesn't go out to the living room and stuff all right so right off the bat what i taste from this wrap dude is more like a i know this wrap is some type of flavoring i just can't tell what kind it is [Music] but this thing is burning smooth dude so i thought the last cheetah piss which was light death was super smooth this is like a whole different level personally i've never tried a hemp wrap so i can't really say i'm too familiar with this wrap but overall so far so good dude the taste is actually super smooth like i'm saying you get a very very nice sweet aroma to it like when you inhale i don't know if that's the weed or if that's the wrap helping it but dude they rolled this honestly pretty freaking perfect all right so i'm gonna just keep chiefing this thing away until i make a dent in it because i honestly don't feel like i should just be talking over this whoever's on the phone can wait bro this thing is too good man so far guys i think i'm tasting a lot more of the wrap than i'm tasting the bud which kind of leads me to believe like i kind of wish they would have just rolled this in like some type of joint maybe like a vibes papers like cubano joint or something i know you're supposed to put like a quarter ounce in those but just make like a special type of like little can and paper and roll like a two to three gram j with a glass filter because personally look i'm not trying to bash it and say it's bad but me personally you know when i smoke i usually try like to taste my weed and i feel like in this case the hemp wrap is just overpowering the weed a hundred percent [Music] like i am getting a little bit now that i'm hitting it more i am getting a little bit of the essence of the cheetah piss that i got from the light def but this one is just like a hundred percent more smoother the light def i'm gonna be 100 honest that one when i smoked it out of a j when i smoked it out of a bong it just tasted so phenomenal like that you could taste every single terp in that plant and in this one i just feel like like the the hemp rep is just doing too much in this man it's playing like it's trying to play like the main role in this part and then that's not the case it shouldn't be the case man the main person in this should be the bud 100 [Music] we are blowing some fat clouds i'm not gonna lie this is kind of burning though how can i describe this it doesn't hit like a blunt bro because the glass tip just gives it a whole type of different filtration system and also the hem wrap is just like so neatly wrapped it kind of reminds me of a backward i don't know if you guys could see that but it's kind of like a spiral [Music] bro this thing is chucking clouds dude i don't know if i don't know if like you guys can see all the smoke around me but this room is definitely getting hot so like you know paying 30 beans for this or was like 35 beans for this like i don't even know i think it was 30. [Music] i think personally i would rather just i don't know though because 2gs in this it's kind of worth it plus the glass tip plus you don't even have to roll it already there i guess this is a fun thing to to cop when you're out with the homies or when you're gonna go gonna go out to sesh or something for a special occasion i definitely don't think you should be you know copying these when you're just gonna go smoke by yourself or something because this is this is enjoyable but honestly buying an eighth would be way more enjoyable and being able to hit it out of the bong [Music] just because when i personally was hitting it out of the bong i felt like i was getting a way more crazy high dude and um like i kept saying i feel like you could taste the strain a lot more now remember this is um 100 indoor grown this is like the main stuff that they try to sell out so the one that i had last time was a light death which was supposed to be cheaper um you know in quality but in my opinion there was nothing cheap about that that plant was 100 fire i wouldn't mind going to cop that again because i had such an enjoyable time smoking that one [Music] this thing is ripping bro like it's starting to get hot in here because of all the smoke man i'm starting to get the little sweats let's talk about the high so far so far it's like i'm saying i'm not really getting a crazy high like i felt like i was getting with it with the um in the light def cheetah piss um with this one it's a little bit more mellow it's not like boom smacking your face put you to sleep like the light death was and i don't know if that's just because it's in a combination with the hemp wrap or maybe it's just because i haven't finished the whole thing but i'm not getting a crazy height but i'm just gonna keep chiefing and see if that changes throughout this [Music] once you get to the end dude is when it starts like really really hitting honestly like in the beginning it hits but when you get to like the in the middle to the end is when it's just like i feel like that's when it's more tightly packed and it's just literally chucking clouds and i feel like it gives me the sensation in my chest like oh dude does he just take a fat hit but look at the circle ring on this everything about it dude everything about it is good in my opinion it's just that the hemp wrap like i keep saying it just gives such a distinct taste dude like it tastes like it doesn't taste like wheat it just tastes like out of place you feel me it doesn't taste like it should be like you should be wrapping butt in this in my opinion maybe i'm just this is the first time i've ever tried a hemp um wrap and i must say i'm not the biggest fan i'm definitely not the biggest fan i would never go out of my way to you know wrap one because i feel like now that i've tried you know joints bongs everything i feel like i really really know what's the best method to get the most out of your product [Music] oh my goodness this thing is freaking hitting dude i'm trying to hit after hit but soloing this to the face is kind of like crazy i know some of you out there are probably like yo yo i could finish this but this is actually some freaking gas and it's actually packed perfectly so it burns very very slow like i feel like i if i look back at the camera it's probably going to be at least over 10 minutes i know [Music] and so far dude this room is actually very very hot box i'm not gonna lie but it's all good because we have one of those air purifiers the ionizers that you just press and it's like boom instantly wipes up everything i love it dude if you if you are um you know a smoker you definitely should get one for your pad if you want to be smoking inside because it instantly i kid you not in almost not instantly instantly but within like five to ten minutes it clears up the whole room the smell the stink everything and it's you know finito this thing is freaking hitting harsh now dude once it gets to the end it's kind of like plus it was like when i started it i think it was like up to like right here so it's a it's a pretty decent sized blunt i must say myself this thing is definitely like i'm not getting like that crazy high like i was saying but i am feeling a little bit more like of a of a head relaxation honestly it's not a body it's just more in the head and i feel like maybe the hem prep has something to do with the conjunction of the bud like i was saying but i'm i'm honestly i feel all right definitely not a pr a bad product like i was saying it's just like me personally man after you know using joints bonds everything i feel like i already have my preference and these hemp wraps just for me are not the wave so with that being said the overall product is actually really really good you know seven out of ten i felt like it would get i would give it an eight or a nine out of ten if it was wrapped in a joint with the gloss tip i'd rather i prefer to see that than this honestly but the overall concept of it is actually really really freaking dope like if you look at it it's actually really dope you know the cookies and the cheetah piss and having everything just at the fingertips of a just a blunt with the glass tip is phenomenal so with that being said seven out of ten for me um i'm gonna go ahead and end it out here guys if you guys enjoyed today's video do me a favor smash that like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button guys we're all so close to 40k all right shout out you guys out and um we're out i'm faded as heck already and we'll see you guys in the next video", "yCzwL5PYets": "[Music] [Music] [Music] this by comedy UK week we do have some absolute fire in front of us this is the Platinum Girl Scout cookies yeah I've gotta say this is just absolutely fire certainly one of the best UK strains are having a little while I mean the looks of it taste it's certainly up there but before I get too deeply into all of this and what I will do is I'll show you the clips from when we first got the bull when I first got the board I did pick up a cue I've got just over 3.5 left here now so I'll get this out at that state will show you the official from from when we first got you can see just how painless was looking and then yeah I'll come back and give you the proper vehicle this is some fire on Platinum Girl Scout cookies UK brain yeah I'll come back and tell you more advice or first of all shade if it's a woman's face got it the old people what's good got something else for us to look at it's just coming to pace today there are seven grams of this and it's a slacker name of Joe scout cookies or a PGs D stands for as you see all the backpacks in that it does look like we've got some absolute fire it's a difficult C medicines but I'm sure you can imagine well one of those videos were just about to tear it off via get opened and then then we'll see what's to see exactly what you're saying but just from the old looks on the outside does I'd like it to cover it in tracking so some nice quarters and wood strips there see it feels dense as well but yeah we'll get the safe and see exactly what it say damn so I just got that all poured out cuz hey that is looking absolutely fire this Platinum Girl Scout cookies as you can see you look we've got one nice big nog I don't know exactly how much this weighs but that is so dense crazy crazy density to it clobbered in tricare's look really nice bone structure damn say I need some darker greens and was purples running through there as well few smaller notes and stuff like that all of these are super dense as well everything okay super super dense but I can say this weighs 7 grams and probably wouldn't even guess that with you just being sorry to close it was close to a free bar there just sayin grams and for interest to plug you know I don't think I've been robbed the nothing like that I'm just saying these boards super dense super super dense this is you keep growing as well this isn't no caddy this is you Kate your own weed tell me farmer who's got ukv coming that's looking quite this level not many people not that many people is certainly carried a dirt stays to this level but not as easy to get as you might think but this is a real fire I'd say Platinum Girl Scout cookies what we'll do is I'll just go get this on with the flash as well just before I get to smoking it will so you can see those tricare's poppy see a bit there you go that's a Platinum Girl Scout cookies with the flash I see that crazy nope they're super super dense long don't you get hit out not stupid Emmet's though they all are really really nice and dense Noggs really cool wood structure to her covered in trichomes all of them absolutely Kate it looks more like anything they're just UK it really does looks a lot more like Cuddy than it does UK this is some crazy crazy looking we've won some real crazy but can we ever seen even get any better lighting on this for you but you see that a lot that he's crazy you know people always wanna tell me that the UK we'd very much up to Kelly but just on looks and on bag appeal this is much not quite easily quite easily saving actually packs that have it look like this cord standing while the best-looking you keep active route but wait to get to making this it stinks as well it's got a such a potent smell to it definitely getting some of that cookies smell off it good-looking set of boards 7 grams Platinum Girl Scout cookies looking by seven grams plan of Girl Scout cookies you can absolutely fire damn can't wait just shaking it like what Walker say look CD do it that's really silly got I'll be up there I'm just a straight bag appeal yeah let's get smoking it we're gonna look at it off now let's get smoking and see exactly what soon so as you can see from these videos some seriously seriously fireweed I mean I've still got the big note that you lot saw in those videos just here I mean this note weighs just under three and a half grams by itself and it isn't the biggest knock like it just sort of goes to show you just how dense this [ __ ] is super dense super nice means coming in try fans really nice little infrared I mean that's all but structurally you don't see on the UK week very often it's more coming from Cali weed I mean that's a these Clapton Girl Scout cookies lazy they don't know Girl Scout cookies is og+ didn't poison flattened Girl Scout cookies as you've had before further this is OG culture across a deadly poison cross with some other unknown third string and but essentially it's just a Girl Scout cookie straighteners may not have a bit more to it or maybe a little bit better some would say yeah he didn't come in this packaging as well you just have to put it in this box okay I say we do a three and a half Brown looking stupid stupid fire now I guess one thing I do need to address and thirsty or five say I stand there some people live that way if you've got that from like UK reading stuff I'm not going to tell you where this is coming from some people might know where this has come from because you might smoked it yourself you know if you saw this Platinum Girl Scout cookies drop the other day and you pick some up he's coming from the same place you can see that but if you've got the skill step you say it's super fire super dense batch it's coming from the same place you know I will give you a little hint I've got the walk-on if you did get this back you'll know exactly what that means and you'll know for a fact that we're about it if you didn't don't worry about it you're not going to get your hands on it anyway because all got now I would have imagined but yeah absolutely fire absolute fire and it's one of Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains I tried a few a while ago now that four five years ago when I first started smoking but not at first I was making but when I first I'm seeking to take people seriously it was one of these strains are like you wanted to try and try like it was one of those Cali straight answer one of the first candy strange sort of sort of saw and you stop moaning used to get to understand a little bit your greatest off you'd see like gills bad cookies it's probably one of the first places I tried a proper blood sample of it and this sort of takes me back to those times I do don't see as many cookie strains about right right now this right ii like you see cookie crosses Girl Scout cookies in strains but not as many people just straight up smoking a straight or Girl Scout cookies and I've gotten okay I say I do miss it a little bit like Girl Scout cookies which this is is absolutely fine I mean he does have almost like cookie taste but it's not like either I can hear nothing like that it's just have a taste and you couldn't describe it's like a cookie taste if you know what me it's quite it just isopods my finger on exactly what a start but it just reminds me of like really good weed that I used to get a few years ago the best way they used to get a few years ago cuz now there's so many different flavors different strains dis down here but they sure she minds me of like a few years ago when you get your hands on some proper quality Girl Scout cookies and you have that smooth nice taste but I can't really describe it because it just tastes like dank and stuff like that I wouldn't say it a taste straight off with cookies but it doesn't have an almost complete sorbate sort of taste to it which is super super nice I mean like say this has been super nice white ash and tastes super nice but I've really nice build got cookies I've I've been super impressive it's what I'm trying to say you know look wise it's got built bears some of the Masters you can't even fell in the channel and I mean I didn't choke to my brethren who knows a bit about we endure whatever smokes bit of weed and he was his first reaction was RPG ours and all this and I've got to say if these have been grandma PG ours then I'm PG our gang of all the [ __ ] way and I'll say that like loudly if this has been growing Fiji ours [ __ ] I want all of them PG iceberg because this was fire and it still smoked fire like why I should like taste nor flee and that got a lovely taste to it and it's got a breathing I'll try as well I wouldn't say the Holi is that the craziest thing about it I saved the hide if anything slightly what let's it down as we certainly had stronger strains on this channel recent channel born together and certainly recently as well at the root--so G and the genital are all over the sort of those stronger than this it's not the strongly smoked but it is a super clean super enjoyable smoke but you could sprinkle at any time in the day Jan I mean it's relaxing it will put you where you want to be and you know we'll enjoy smoking it it's just not one of them that will knock you out you know if I wanted to right now to sit here to smooth through these three five and I'd really enjoy doing it that's what I'm trying to say but hey what the hi that I get from it wouldn't stop me from carrying on smoking John I mean it it's not crazy or overwhelming at the high and I've never really found a high of Bill Scout cookies to ever be like that crazy but it is nice you know it does have effects it does do a North End lap for a base leg it's absolutely perfect and I've got to say I've been enjoying the smokiness as well and when you consider like what this looks like you know what it tastes like the others and the price that I paid on this which is just you mean you normally UK prices and the fact that if you did it there what this was that someone tried to say that it's kind of a very easy to could you know it looks like Kelly it feels like Kelly even smells like Kelly like a proper you know she's got proper flavor to it it's not super super nice I've got to say I've rated it absolutely rated it and then just touch that PGR thing as well and thing I do want to comment on as well is people complain about PTR's when people want to talk all of this in that Bucky jars that Neal but now I do agree that P jobs aren't a good thing and that I dearly want to put the most natural thing in your to your body if you're going to smoking it but that being said if you're one of those people that do think that way think of yourself you know it's a good way to think but my Schumann is is that you've got to think that way about everything you know you can't roll a spliff with back here and then go oh I'm not smoking that it's got pgoz rare tater you smoked you with back key probe like that it literally says my [ __ ] packet they were like 70 substances in this cause cancer and you're worried about PG ours that for me you know I try and not spit it back here I'm trying to cut down and completely smoke pure but I do spend there there back here now Andras or Indy I don't think really fruit Matsu pennies around and say I thought P jars mothers because the battery is almost [ __ ] you what bro no that's what gives you cancer and get me that it's got to do with the PVR well you see I'm not saying awful to do a paid job but the same way you know if you do care RPG oz you then shouldn't you smoke backe and you should also pretty be like a vegan of [ __ ] version I mean no you should put none of this dirty shape to your bodybuilding all put into our body so you see but it is that deep and you take everything that deep or it's not that beef luck I think and then none of its up deep I mean poor I don't mind people being like [ __ ] PTR's not wanting that a fan for you've gotta then reinforce a for the party you laugh I don't smoke [ __ ] [ __ ] don't be drinking [ __ ] why do you care about PG oz you get me that if you are if you sleep okay to eat them but they complain about PG oz and you're bored by your [ __ ] use your minds in the wrong place bro you get me lying and lots you know I dismissed people I'm not not gonna be one of those I know this man I've ever seen code me personally other one like to do with that but not each one of us newspaper I'm just pointing out the fact that it's obvious hypocrisy hypocrisy whatever the word is in the scene of people saying that P girls with and smoking with like baggy or like swampy position blue business and that that [ __ ] faithful paint pretty martyrs all be done that [ __ ] obviously isn't called fear now I'm just saying that you know if you're gonna be like that reinforce it for your life I didn't know how I got into this run I don't know why I thought I've started on this ramming the middle of a [ __ ] straining review yeah that's it anyway but like I say is pleasant Girl Scout cookies absolutely fire I'll breathe enjoy smoking it's got a good cry to it nothing too impressive but it looks ten outside it really really does I mean the tranquil bridge the density would structure it just looks at a night attack and it's smoked each smokes up there I mean is why a sh it's really cleanly burns really smoothly and smokes read smoothly as well we know does it it's not too expensive on the exhale or anything like that nice and easy smoke I've got to stay hydrated it do get down to give me this rate I will actually say as well irate cookies and irate cookie strains now do you think they get a lot of flack because there's been so much hype over the last few years that some people omitted it which I mean as saturated or marketing with the constrains what a good black girls got cookies and stuff like that's not nerds that beat is you know I mean and the last good cookies we cover this channel was like the neat just cookies by nature boys which have been here if I cannot put five something which was absolutely fire I think you forget that administrative I think I'm actually gonna give this all things considered you know a [ __ ] within a given nine point seven and nine point seven but their ass at it like I think that's one ice or in if not leave high score in UK for we've had on this channel and no proper producer to sort of tell you you know who's by and to go follow and shout them out and stuff I just I've got to say I'll read this I read this alight reading are smoke today it reminds me John I mean it is sort of makes me reminisce about what I mean that years ago when I first started smoking we just open up the best rings of around the ends light for what you said on the on the team you know when it wells to describe this with platinum girls faculties its peace meaning what every single box for me it's the only thing I could possibly say is that I thought maybe a little bit more from the high and I probably giving it maybe even a ten out of ten but yeah absolutely fire that you know people on the channel that you can't say that neither people died anyway don't think there is any UK read out here but rivals did cutting me now see some Cali be looking ahead of they don't bro night don't get me wrong obviously telling me this fire and just lose a fire Riveter but just because it's from Kylie doesn't mean it's fire knocks a from you okay doesn't mean it's fire but this is lethal fire if you spent on this if you spend some Platinum Girl Scout cookies let us know but if any of you you know got your war-club smoked on this exact batch let me know what you thought of it you know I've sweets one of the things by that I've got through the same person or whatever that have also have been you came that I've been serious serious buyers so they'll definitely more this sort of stuff coming through the channel and I mean spat on some Grape Ape unfortunately with a bridge to absolutely thick Ulis because I was away well yeah that would've been asking the channel but yeah clapping Gilstrap cookies give me another nine point seven out of ten that I rate it what kind of say is the best Girl Scout cookies I think are better stoked I like the old Scout cookie so I can't give it a [ __ ] rate in the only thing that one maybe what more for me it's just a bit better the high bit more than ten entire a bit more not cared you know I mean well I'm not gonna not get too much nine point seven out of ten [ __ ] [ __ ] up of quite a lot of the Cali we've had on this channel like that's how Suzy says I'm looking right now a lot of these wrinkled boys are stuff like this is better than a lot of that I made up for free the weights make sleepies everything looks a bit P job or not Eiling give a fault and nine point seven out of ten it's big bull pundits if you enjoyed the video give us a like give us a comment all of that Lux a few have swim from this batch and let us know what you thought of it love to hear what's more people for if you've got yarns on this fire and and yeah we'll be back in a bit of a strain review real soon", "UZuNAANWNVU": "well guys welcome in the CCC I'm Shannon I'm Dani and we're back again for another strand review today we actually got something special for you guys if you guys have been following along last month or so the last few stray interviews have been a little bit underwhelming but today we've actually got some fun we do have some fire this is cookie dough by cache cremation if you guys you know follow closely the you know high-end weed connoisseur seen on Instagram you probably know his work he brought us the starburst OG the grandma's cookies I know we got a full mount video up of the starburst some crazy melt that we got from him a few years ago I think we might have history interview the grandma's cookies I know he smoked it a couple of times this is some really really crazy wheat man obviously we've reviewed just about every cookie cutter is on the show at this point a lot of them have several differences for a lot of it's similar obviously there is different cuts but this one of all of them just the way this is grown is always so much different so much more of a treat yeah I mean it has those spirit buds which is pretty rare when you're looking at a cookie this is not what you're used to seeing when you're used to looking at cookies usually you're gonna see more than round-nose you know I mean usually a little bit more color if I were to see this in pictures I would never guess it was to rice but it is very very pretty still super pretty leaves you know cash has been around for a while when I think of cash I do think of the bubble the bubble mount that you used to make all the hash whatever this should get to be [ __ ] big dude I'm not gonna lie this isn't we barely kept enough around to do this [ __ ] string review for this [ __ ] [ __ ] knocks me on my ass man yeah we got a zip of this [ __ ] we had just you know been smoking and smoking we were supposed to do the review two days ago we didn't end up doing it like [ __ ] we got to do this before smoke at all yeah I mean this [ __ ] has me [ __ ] passing out you see me going and laying up in my bed at 3:00 in the [ __ ] afternoon dude I'd never do that like you get too high off this [ __ ] and you know your day is pretty much over definitely after smoking this weed I would have to say that I've been raping the strings we've been reviewing lately a little too generously after smoking some real real heavy gigantic organic we you know it's it's a little bit it's a different thing it does feel different like Dan was touching on there I mean the stuffs grown all organic actually veganic so you know no animal products no sprays no heavy metals no GMOs I mean it's really the way that you would want we grown if you were growing it for yourself another thing that's crazy about getting to try this we didn't particularly sure exactly how long this batch or he takes this particular cut but the grandma's cookies I know he's running 12 plus a week sometime right so like you know you guys that are out there buying and you know and us most the time buying you know commercial weed from stores or whatever they're growing the strains that are gonna give him the best yields quickest flowering times nobody's trying to grow these you know connoisseur strains that take 8 9 10 12 weeks you know that means a fully fully develop some people will say that's too long some people say you don't need to go that long I don't think you can [ __ ] argue with anything he's doing with this week no I mean this right here ladies and gentlemen this is the peak like this is the best flower to get I'm gonna go out there and say set it this this is top shelf right here like when you crack it it just has that like sharpie funk to it you know yeah I was gonna say could the cookie turbine the lineage I know this is some kind of OG KB relation obviously you guys know I've said it once I'll say it a million times I [ __ ] love I mean the og KB cookie cut I think is probably my top 2 and maybe my favorite cookie thought of all time right you know I mean it's I'm definitely getting just that classic fire cook eater but like you said there was like a little extra funk in there or something maybe maybe like a Sharpie maybe something like that a lot of times we use these weird descriptive words for terms like gasp we say it smells like you just [ __ ] onto the gas station it doesn't sound good right it is good it's so overused though but this this is different I'm not gonna lie like it does have that cookie aroma but it's much sharper and it almost smells like Elmer's glue or like a [ __ ] sharpie or like remember those what are those sharpies that like magic markers remember this kind of smells like like a dry erase marker yes they were called magic markers you got a much bigger bowl packed in there I actually went a little bit too small on the last one throwing for the gust go once again forgot the ashtray I think we probably average about one out of every 10 videos do we get all the essential pieces here on the table ashtray bongs bold pieces lighters we're making it work I got I gotta be honest with you guys it's always a lot more fun for us it's more of a treat for us we have more fun doing these videos when we get to review something that were truly really excited about that's good that's good all the way down to the bone they gave me the sweats made my face hot but not harsh it's really really good the thing is not too many people actually get their hands on these stuff so when I do I feel very blessed I wish there was more people I mean this guy's had this six lines gone for years he's never changed up he's just kept it on her and you gotta appreciate that you know especially with it where the industry is at these days like that's gonna be very rare it already is very but it's gonna become more and more rare to find that grower that actually puts in time to grow some [ __ ] like this it's really kinda it's more of an artist I mean at this point it's one of those things where it's like there's growing and then there's like part and there's like having you know a passion and dedication like there's people that just do it for the money this guy I can tell you you know from experience just you know from from knowing them well enough and from seeing the passion that he puts into the work you know and the end product like it's not about the money for this guy it's it's about pushing it forward you know it's all trying to push the boundaries and top yourself every single time yeah he's got pride he takes pride in growing the best medicine or you know cannabis that he can and if you put your name on it you should yeah you should you know I guess well we're going to rating this you know this is honestly pretty easy to rate for me so for a fact it's okay effect ten looks ten smell ten tens across the board I don't even know you know there's not much Activision going to it's [ __ ] amazing if you ever get a chance to get your hands on some of this stuff it is pricey I will say that it is pricey but it is well when I smoke weed like this it makes me miss growing weed not because we ever grew me this good right certainly didn't know but just because like when you find some flowers that are just top-notch 11 out of 10 you know what I'm saying and it's rare like we see decent weed all the time we see good weed over time but when you see something special it's rare it's rare and every single time I see this guy's weed yeah it looks like this so that's just I mean it goes to show the dedication to the craft and like this is one of those things like I think this is worth spending a high price tag that a lot of these exotics you know are fetching that are just at today just commercially grown weed I was grown in a warehouse and didn't get the love and attention to detail that it takes to in my opinion priests produce some we'd liked it shout out to cash I'm gonna go in on one more bar here but I'm actually gonna give an 11 on this product on my first 11 if not the person thing past 10 that I've ever given out so shout out to cash 11 on the cookie dough yeah I think it's same for me at the end of the day I'm giving this stuff a perfect score I think that's probably the first time ever in history CCC we both came out perfect scores or anything I'm so stoned you can't you can't not [ __ ] give this partner eleven earns amazing and it joint taste good out of the bong I'm smoking would have it the other day yeah I mean it's definitely got the power it's everything you're looking for when you're looking when you're trying to treat yourself to something you know top shelf you've gotta clean this that [ __ ] fire on Superlift or another string review I'm Danny for the CCC 4:20 and I'm Shane make sure you like this video hit the bell subscribe if you're not already and we'll see tomorrow [Music]",

that i said the only brand i really know well i guess those are the two now so raw raw juicy did you know he owned uh you know 2.0 didn't know that yeah well more you know i've never tried that stuff but him too oh ain't that the drink yeah i've tried that [ __ ] before this it's like it's like a it's like it's like it's like a it's like a water it's a fruity water one of those vitamin waters yeah yeah it's damaged just like one of those i don't like vitamin water just give me plain water but what everybody's actually kind of solid like it's not the best thing like i mean you know like as an athlete [ __ ] is lived off the gatorade and pirate for like mostly life so we know that when i all the side [ __ ] started coming out like the only one that i like the only power drink i still [ __ ] with that's like off bread but it's still good is that body armor shout out by [ __ ] kobe or rrp that [ __ ] covey because that was his [ __ ] that body armor oh yeah they get off that too any type of like flavored water like that i'm good now you don't even like just regular like fizzy water and [ __ ] like that that should be so good i just had a bottle today like it's like you get the you get the you get the satisfaction of soda but it's still water but it's still water still not good for you though because it's kind of sugar in it no no it's just water it's literally just water with carbon added to it that's what gives it bubbles used to buy those by the [ __ ] pack and i just i can't drink it anymore it's gross i mean i think there is one with sugar in it but really [ __ ] just like fizzy water like fizzy flavored water like those shits it's literally just water with carbon in it to give it bubbles i don't know she used to buy the fizzy ones and then she bought the regular ones that weren't carbonated and that's even [ __ ] worse oh fruit water those [ __ ] are nasty oh gosh the grape ones are the worst those would be those those are nasty but one time so we were doing this weird [ __ ] some on some white people [ __ ] in south dakota we were doing a mock house party so we were literally like we had a bunch of students and uh parents would go through it was like a tour and we would act like we were in a house party and like scenarios would come up and we would like pause and they would like talk about the scenario and stuff like that like there's like a rape scene and stuff like that i wasn't part of anything brutal thank god i was just part of this one scene where we're playing the game at this table or whatever oh so you [ __ ] played beer pong that bit uh it was some weird card game or something i don't know but um i was with my brothers we were doing the scene together and these [ __ ] know i hate flavored water and they had something with them that day they brought this he's like all right here you guys goes to play for water yeah so it's supposed to be regular absolutely i take shots that's like my part i literally like i take three shots and these [ __ ] filled each shot with grape flavored [ __ ] water and it's the worst one i absolutely hate the great one so that [ __ ] really acted like he was taking a shot yes it looked legit because i was like i threw the first one back i like i was like and then i took the second one i kept it in my mouth took the other one kept it in my mouth because i didn't have to say any lines after that wait until they left the room and went spit it out in the sink oh that was this man said the grape flavored water yeah flavored water is trash but fizzy water is good did you want it's not too bad flavored water is trapped with fizzy flavored water it's good that's not bad but the [ __ ] dizzy flavored water is hella good like i said i just had to um i had a what was i had today i had a black cherry that was the flavor i had today those are the best black cherries hella good if i'm gonna drink the fizzy water it's definitely gonna be black cherry what the [ __ ] was that your shoes [ __ ] probably not that black cherry was hella good though black tree like cherries a low-key goated flavor bro i don't think like is it weird that like i don't like cherries on top of my well cherries on top of like those like on top of like milkshakes and [ __ ] aren't cherries that's mary she don't cherries it's just soaked in like sugar water pretty much it's like a candied cherry pretty much yeah they're cool and i don't eat them but they're cool and sure like temples no i don't i don't eat them hoes at all perfect i don't eat them i never got cheese on my on my all my [ __ ] when i was younger my like shakes and whatnot i'll just give it to my mom or something somebody would eat it not a big fan of cherries in general i don't eat like actual cherries either nah but like cherry pop tarts are goated um there's some oh black cherry uh there's a black cherry i want to say dutch or like a game leaf no it's a black cherry game yeah those are goated those are fire um [ __ ] cherry vanilla soda and damn near anything like cherry vanilla i carry soda itself there's fire i don't know if i have black tray but i know like tray vanilla coke you've never had black cherries on the the shasta oh that's just fire i don't know if it's the same cause soda don't it's not the same anymore because damn we use real sugar i thought straws to use cane sugar or like sugarcane they might i don't know i had the shots to like i got one from the vending machine it's still 35 cents clutch i got one from a vending machine that [ __ ] did not taste the same or i don't know i never really drink sauce just like that my favorite soda growing up was uh dr pepper until i can stop drinking soda fruit fruit like dr pepper they got the best cherries on the dr pepper yeah that was that's the reason why i [ __ ] with cherry soda like the cherry uh like vanilla root beer always been stupid cherry root beer went stupid they did a trade vanilla or you know cherry vanilla coke is fire yeah that's just fire too i'm about to say you know i like like burger king mcdonald's that should be having like those thousand drink machines and whatnot like bro once i saw what i saw a tray vanilla root beer bro i was man oh yeah that's just oh i love those machines with the [ __ ] thousands of choices but yeah i thought that i had to stop half of them are out though i had to stop doing that [ __ ] though bro because um i just hate when you go through a drive-through and you ask like when you like a jack-in-the-box and you ask for a certain drink yeah they just be like what and then they just like throw some random [ __ ] in the cup well you asked for a [ __ ] cherry sprite they gave you purple [ __ ] fanta what the [ __ ] i'm crying yeah now when i go to like when i go to like places like that i always go inside just so i know like i'ma get what the [ __ ] i want to get because like there's this burger king uh tuskegee school and [ __ ] with that like everybody everybody in tuskegee already know about the burger king first off shouts out to them but um nah bruh they have 1000 drink machines too and my and my [ __ ] my [ __ ] when i was out there bro was a um or vanilla high c i prefer the fruit punch classic fruit punch i see i mean orange is classy but when they put that ella in that [ __ ] but that [ __ ] or they got the [ __ ] the minute made better made us fire out of those machines true loki if i was there if it wasn't like if it was on my campus i would have came down with like a couple water bottles or something filled up no it's not on campus it's like i mean it's like a couple blocks but like [ __ ] i mean [ __ ] do walk there it's honestly like the same distance from like here if we were going to like you know that quick stop right down there yeah like at the at the end like right by the freeway it would literally be like the same dish from like walking for like i know i'm just left like my dorm room too burger king because where i stay was like kind of like deeper if you were then if you're like at like the martialettes or something from what we called it but yeah like [ __ ] i remember i asked i was like hey bro let me get an orange vanilla high c one time [ __ ] they just like i said they just threw some [ __ ] in there bro oh wait uh i came back in i was just like [ __ ] it do this myself went in there yeah just like [ __ ] it that's what i do well you got the wrong [ __ ] i'm just gonna i'll take a couple water bottles fill that [ __ ] up go back to campus yeah no that's the thing like a lot of [ __ ] just to help whoa what the gym i don't know i really never saw nobody who heard about that but in south dakota i went to visit my brother one weekend and there's a mcdonald's like two blocks from campus so like i guess a couple years ago things would just like always get hella drunk and just try to walk through the drive-through and they're like they would just like they wouldn't let them let them and then finally like [ __ ] it i guess it's safer than them trying to like drive because they're drunk so then they they literally let people walk through the drive too they might as well just let [ __ ] do that [ __ ] that [ __ ] is hilarious we're sitting there we're in my brother's car he's got like this old-ass cadillac where my brother's car and this drunk guys dude behind us and all of a sudden he just starts shaking the [ __ ] car he's like bouncing us we're like oh do we have to get out and beat his ass oh i'll be over here like they're about kicked out of line though they're like they're like the mcdonald's people told them to stop man i saw that show like they let them just walk through i'm like okay let me this that's nice honestly i like that that's nice i used to get hella mad cuz i remember there used to be times where me and my brother used to uh oh yeah because we had to i can't think you gotta smoke your eye [ __ ] there's smoke everywhere it's always in my way in my eye uh i could this you don't even bother me right now no uh there's this taco bell you know what do you really talk about where i used to live by like kfc in the taco bell yeah like when me and my brother were like stupid young like when i was like the 34th grade we like you know ride our bikes over there get food and [ __ ] like and then like sometimes on the late night we just be like [ __ ] let's slide with the [ __ ] um obviously the front will be closed if we just be like bro we on the bikes bro like this is technically right and through i don't know if it's driving but it's right it's just a dangerous thing because like you can get hit they actually let you get you did they actually let you get food no they should never let us get food yeah i figured they wouldn't they see you on the camera like nah these two [ __ ] think they about to rob what i'm like bro if you try to get me two tacos and some nachos bruh it's not like i could take out fast on this [ __ ] bike anyway right if you really want to rob them on a bike bro like how far are we getting [ __ ] go call 9-1-1 be like hey bro two [ __ ] robbed us on a bike they went that way you getting caught for sure that's what i'm saying don't rob nobody because karma unless you have a plan karma is a [ __ ] if you steal for anything still from these million dollar corporations yep that bought a [ __ ] for like two cents to sell it to us for like five dollars oh for sure [ __ ] walmart mm-hmm i always get your five-figure discounts i i don't know if i could i could say this on camera i used to like i worked at walmart like for like two months after we graduated and they got work they when they put me in the blood aisle with the tobacco island i'd have [ __ ] this man's on his back i [Music] i used to steal some candy a little bit like not nothing big this little thumbs up you can say you steal tvs from you can scam tv from them [ __ ] every day since they opened up [ __ ] self checkout i do got in trouble for um scanning some a ps5 and some vegetables that's why they make that's why they make [ __ ] bite electronics in the back because y'all [ __ ] don't know how to be slick nope damn nah i'm not gonna go to library pioneer with like older generation because i knew [ __ ] who were in like my brother's age and whatnot bro and [ __ ] would just like [ __ ] said they used to just like pop open the like slide door and and just describe whatever they wanted yeah you know just like bro i remember one time and then [ __ ] go right to gamestop and sell that [ __ ] and that's why gamestop prices is [ __ ] so like that's why you can't get [ __ ] back for your game because [ __ ] like y'all diggers used to steal that [ __ ] from walmart and sell it to gamestop like bruh what you know one time i was in walmart but and you know how they had like the little like the wire things that go around the boxes and [ __ ] yeah it's like this let me just walk by [ __ ] somehow i don't know i somehow managed to slip it off off the beats somehow it like slipped off of it oh [ __ ] but i was with my dad so i'm like no i can't [ __ ] take that [ __ ] so i told my cousin that he went in there and grabbed that [ __ ] i think they ended up getting stolen from his locker though and this [ __ ] went to a white ass school he went to sarah padre i remember beast was like the first headphones i was trying to i'm lucky still trying to get some beats there's no cool he sold that [ __ ] for like a billion dollars or something a couple billion beer to google it's crazy that's chilling for the rest of your life too and i'm sure he still does like music here and there too so he's he's chilling [ __ ] dr dre these were the [ __ ] back in the day i remember i got some knock-off ones i didn't give a [ __ ] i'm still trying to get some beats bro i got some black and yellow ones and i know they didn't i went to this website it was like this chinese website brother that had like hella different [ __ ] designs and [ __ ] and our school colors are black and yellow my yup that one reflects them don't be [ __ ] white people aren't going to know they're fake yeah no you can't go to logan like that oh no i for sure definitely would have done that [ __ ] out here i mean but that's the thing if you went to logan you would have you could have got any color because the main colors they had was like white black and red yeah so i'm just like you would have been straight but still yeah i got the black yellow shirts then my coach stole your coach my coach this [ __ ] borrowed up and never gave them back nah [ __ ] i'm breaking your kneecap at practice that [ __ ] was he's my dad's best friend kneecaps at practice he's like my uncle that's just [ __ ] do what it's [ __ ] up they just won the championship too and football that's nice he still hasn't got him on basketball he's got three in football though for the state yeah oh damn it's a lot that's right i guess that's a lot i don't know [ __ ] i don't know well i mean like because when he first came in we went 0-8 in football for [ __ ] three seasons before we finally won a game this [ __ ] sucked not winning a game at all i don't that's tough that has to do something to your pride growing up that has to it made us work harder i wasn't like sixth grade when i first got there we didn't win the game until i was a freshman or eighth grader freshman i mean that's good that it made you work harder but [ __ ] i couldn't imagine it sucked i'm sorry but i think it's who i played but were nice at least basketball we we never that never happened to us in basketball thank [ __ ] god well yeah take the fact that i've never played no other sport it always happened to our girls our girls would beat the same team they would have three wins on the year because they would beat the same team they played like the same team three times and they'd beat them that would be their only wins on the year i mean they only won just because they was trashed in them yes and one year they lost to them [ __ ] that's like us losing to kennedy that one too in our [ __ ] our coach literally told us on their bus because we took a it was uh the morning game it was like the tournament type of thing yeah so everybody sleep so we went to watch the game and our coach literally like told us he's like hey don't say [ __ ] about like do not say because we're like the guys out there [ __ ] he's like do not say anything to them girls man like i said it could have magically loki though i'm not gonna say it was better than us but like we we will all make it to like the same like playoff range you know girls that was the oh that was that team's only win on the year that's well no our girls were buggies shouts out this shout out to them too that's not the best our girls are not the best they're better now but they were not they were not the best they couldn't even do the tip drill where you throw it off the backboard and like run to the back of the line yeah or like run to the other side of the court and then it's done you think we should do it yeah so they were trying to do that and they could not they could not do it some girls would throw it over the backboard some girls would throw it under the backboard some girls would grab it and couldn't jump and like gravity couldn't jump at the same time the coordination was [ __ ] up yeah so like so when they would drop it they would have to run i mean of course that's the same thing with us so they would get like two two in and then drop it i can run in two in drop it's like running they were running like for 45 minutes because they could not get the tip i don't think they ever got it down we literally like it was [ __ ] up we stopped practice to watch them tragic it's like a big-ass gym and there's a center divider that comes down which is like a big aspect so we were on the sides watching them trying to do you just look you just people on the side you just be like they still ain't got it oh damn they [ __ ] up they say [ __ ] it up we were real [ __ ] too because we uh we started doing it we started doing the drill y'all started doing it hella easy yeah just we're gonna just poop all right so chalk it up yeah let's let's get the [ __ ] out of this hot box man we have tastes high overall so taste for me i'm giving it a smooth ass eight because i am looking genuinely shocked that like i don't know what it tastes like and it doesn't taste like like i can't get the flavor on it but it just tastes it doesn't it didn't hurt my throat tastes pretty good with the hump wrap too i think if it was a joint that might we probably would have been able to really taste it yeah but yeah with the hip breath that [ __ ] was good i'm giving it an eight let me give it up oh yeah the seven wasn't like anything to it like there wasn't no like hints of anything really right um yeah seven because it wasn't like it wasn't like where it burned yeah or burned your throat or anything but there wasn't like a fruity taste or like a floral taste or anything like a woody or anything i would say more like woodier just because like i really couldn't like get a taste but it just tastes like a good like woody i just tasted the hemp mostly no i couldn't like if i'm getting anything it tastes like woody and smooth i just know it's smooth as [ __ ] like that's why i'm giving it a just because like it was very very very very very very smooth definitely give it a seven on high i'm gonna definitely give it a nine because it's smacking me right now i mean that might be the hot box too but i'm also yeah it hit me in the middle of smoking i was just like you ever get like those like pings of like highness yeah just like oh [ __ ] yeah i'm high it's like a movie where like you see like it'll be like oh that's weird but yeah nine for sure on the high and then overall experience i mean if i'm being solid like i like the two g's i just hated that glass tip it wasn't bad the glass tip is hella big bro yeah i don't know why they make them so big i know like i understand air flow and [ __ ] like proper air flow but you just gotta understand like what types of like valves they usually you feel me negative like [ __ ] you just gonna use a straight valve where you go um lower one sides like area so you can get more pressure going through you feel me like that [ __ ] that's basic engineering bruh how are you keeping your eyes open in here i don't think i don't think my eyes are open but i can still see everything yeah overall i'm gonna give it a that's an eight for sure would i say seven i don't know but i didn't even see anything i don't know you didn't give anything but that's a i can't get mine that's a good blunt though for sure two grams usually because when you get a bluntness use like one gram and it's like it's still the same size tip one yeah then it's not packed enough and then it's like all you taste is hemp wrap that i like the two two g's for sure gary payton i just gotta grab an actual [ __ ] eighth of it and try it so what did i say i said the taste was at eight nine and seven so 24 to 30 which is like what seven nine holy [ __ ] which is a b i give it a b eighty percent and what'd you say i gave it a 24 out of 30. same thing so he gave it a b huh gary pays a solid b blunt you can't go wrong with that [ __ ] shouts out to oh god i'm sorry i can't i can't i can't anyways shouts out let me close the [ __ ] real quick real quick shouts out to look at your ass oh shout out to cookies oakland shout out to cookie oakland man gary payton shouts out to bernie shouts out to all the [ __ ] who had to put this blunt together shout outs out to the [ __ ] who grew this power is up shouts out to gary payton to be from oakland california you feel me shout out to oakland in general and from that i guess we're calling it quits this is tk my boy stoner first hotbox video yes sir catch y'all next time", "O1RhgH2C1es": "hi oh please just done couple years there in a box at the time and the pensioner diesel said well your people was good obviously a bit for today I fought I picked up this a niche boys skills pre-roll they're gonna see a little creaminess trade skills 1.5 grams nature boys all that stuff I think this major points to get always pretty role I was just going to smoke it before you know what might do something a bit different much good it just to see what's inside it you know in the spirit of like you what some of pre-roll West case we reviews on a Instagram see that minding some pretty roles and stuff seen exactly what's inside in that and I see these native boys peels and put quite a bit hard round at the moment a lot of people smoking on them like you know the business and that sort of for you know what let's cut one op see exactly what's inside it yeah it's only gonna be a short video like there wasn't quite as I can see what's inside to make sure they like stem use and often show that which I really don't think that will be you know nature would do the absolute business so I highly doubt it's gonna be anything sort [ __ ] in here but yeah let's get this a pre roll out and see exactly the same sue there is the pre-roll to start of it's a case then I'll show you as well we do have like a little glass I've wanted to be a little bit of weed in mind just unfortunate looking this being a bad stuff well yeah come to my class which obviously I'm gonna keep and reusing stuff damn certainly looks nice certainly smells nice as well really nice or skittle smoke coming up there so sweet through II sort of smell Klim yeah just a as well be is raining outside so I do apologize about that didn't hear that stuff but yeah anyway nature boys skittles pyrrole as you see you there let's get this opened up see what's inside it oh just got that cut open as you can see look all our weed there let's go certainly on Thursdays fictions it's looking at the business Google drive's anything that shouldn't be that's all the pulp order stove our classrooms everything you'll save a little bit in the middle well yeah natureboy skits you know you got break your dad didn't roll really nice damn yeah well I expected just really nice ground-up flour doesn't realize anything in there that shouldn't be in there absolutely don't think I can see anything anyway find it all stem is that just a sugar leaf you know it actually is sugar leaf they're so round itself [Music] yeah maybe it's honey's best I don't feel like a stem nut feels proper song might be Tony's bit stoner part from that looking pretty [ __ ] silent it's a nice ground flour it's not amazing that I put it out suppose for some great skills yeah certainly some diggin dogs as well which is just maybe it's been hand ground other than I probably Grandal to be fair a grinder this certain is it's a nice and well ground and I saw some really nice flower I don't know what I was expecting but I thought we were gonna see obviously I'm a DS need to boys pre-order many boom really nicely and stuff I just for whatever to one see exactly what's in there you know I've seen in the spirit of lots of a pre-roll and West case we review them and an Instagram afford apron assault so we could have another loss certainly seems like nothing untoward at the ordinary there's nice ground or flower Labadie the specs so yeah Nature Boy skills pyrrole well I have to do is we roll this now actually gets focus making it but yeah I must see the flash run quickly as well just so you can see that what and where I'm seeing just saw some really nice brown flour yeah it's we the flash on not really helping us see anything who have already seen things this you see for some nice grams of flour really really nice I rise today from that flush is doing anything frizz really is it yeah natureboy stick it was pretty rolled 1.5 grams maybe those are tiny that was stemming now I'm still not even sure if that was the spending it was proper soft and that look it might have been a tiny little step in there but apart from that it's all obviously for fire very nice ground-up flower so yeah and I we see comes with you little lacerations well fun you know sort of forget about Rosie a nice little feature on the pre-roll yellow flash boots like that grieve that that will certainly get some use out of so time to roll this [ __ ] back up like I said that's your meter boy skills 1.5 grab pre-roll go in just to check everything's what it should be in there yeah sound is always bigger major boys as well ways bringing as that fire and yeah what we do this so maybe different if you wanna see me got some more pretty girls let me know its best pure whatever Gordon actually a lot what's inside but yeah there we go Nature Boy skill was lucky a real soon with some washing your people I just wanted to hop on really quickly so bringing into this video obviously I just got that skittles pre-roll I have actually smoked it now as well well I've actually a build-up to spliffs out of what was left of it to sort of nice press smoke one absolutely fire banging taste to it some of the nicest skills I've tasted and the skills are reviewed the skills of my channel was definitely a ladder flavor the UK grade one and boy I would have said wow this the skittles wasn't necessarily as quite loud a flavor of some skills of smoke before the actual taste was bang on like initially tasted like some skittles like the sweet sort of thing no absolutely [ __ ] banging so yeah obviously I just wanted to hop on and say you know end of this pre-roll video have you seen what's inside there even sorted all right that was a little stem I personally not even sure that was still estab if it was it was certain very small stem but it was also not mud softened but certainly didn't affect you know or wouldn't have affected I'd imagine the way the pre-roll would have smoked yeah because it was been him you made bright white ash as you'd expect from eh boys so yeah I just wanted to hop on and just sort of bring that to an end bring it to a close sort of thing you know like anyway actually fought to the flower when I smoked it what's absolutely banging and if you want to see me got more pre-rolls you know see what's inside him and stuff let me know because I can do that yeah I also just want to say we're nearly at 2,000

of 2k celebration sort of adventure maybe sort of video so you've got that to look forward to as well but yeah just want to hop hard and bring this video to a close let you know that that the skills

you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit

something most different today right we're gonna be doing one he's big boy dog walkers man big boy dog walkers right let me tell you something buddy big boys dog walkers if I can find let's go big dog walkers big dog the name of this one is black Afghanistan Lennie is landrace Afghani from con Dora I believe I said I can I'm saying that right a hashey notes of wood and fruit and rich with a touch of coffee and vanilla the effects are soothing narcotic working to relax the body and mind all right we're gonna read these numbers right off the bat THC just 26.8 THC or I'm sorry THC a twenty six point eight THC 1.1 C BT a zero point four CBG 0.1 terpenes just show you guys because there's a lot of terpenes in it yeah I had to run a test done it's Monday and two days before my operation I getting getting a little nervous so if I'm actin a little a little different I'm not gonna lie every time I get put to sleep I mean there's a chance you don't wake up so like I get a little I get a little iffy about okay so um okay with that said the ins is kicking up a little bit so that's why I wanted to sit down and try to try to smoke this whole thing it's at 0.75 grams and on the scale at 0.03 houses okay I mean it's pretty cool last time I had this this the second time I had this on the channel the first time I had these on a channel I said that everyone you buy it donates to a dog in need which that is pretty [ __ ] cold so yeah this was like $15 I believe yeah not bad at all like I said Afghani man so let's just go ahead and crack in this and you can get her started all right this is a hard percent indica to by the way just bad boy all right I kind of I kind of thought it'd be bigger but it's really really really tight I'm not even gonna try to like take it apart or anything like that I'm just gonna get get to smoke into a society a little bit I'm having [Music] Cheers let me doing the comments what you guys are smoking on if you're smoking on anything yeah and let me know if you guys are having a good week so far you said it's Monday two days before my operation I did my ronan test today to cobia test they do it real quick on both nostrils man and tell you it's like you're sinking feel it like to go behind your eye sockets and it makes your eyes water up immediately is it it does it's not like it hurt it's more more just like a weird kind of burning sensation I guess behind your eyes and you can feel it in your nose like like maybe 10 to 15 minutes afterwards too you can still kind of feel a little bit but yeah let's talk about this my first initial hit it kind of burnt a little bit to be honest with you guys I'm not really much used to smoking much fire anymore man I've been smoking a little a lot of [ __ ] oils a lot of rosin you know a lot of rosin a lot of concentrates the taste is definitely a woody maybe a little fruity I don't taste no coughing but now maybe low for now but I don't taste no coffee flavor definitely little fruity it's a nice subtle taste smooth taste too like I said it has a little a little burn on my throat there and I think that's just from [ __ ] smoking fire you guys in Pennsylvania I can't buy these pre-rolls I guess and I feel sorry for you is it [ __ ] sucks but uh you know hearing good old Maryland and you're allowed to and you can smoke your flower and it's pretty [ __ ] dope I'm not gonna lie I could have bagged a [ __ ] paper flower consoling I'm getting a better taste on it now depth that one was definitely fruity like I said it's it's a hundred percent indica so definitely want to be at nighttime when you're smoking this one and it's definitely good for [ __ ] uh like like pain and and effects effects for like the body and muscle aches and stuff like if you just had a hard day at work and you just want to come home and relax and sit here and just like be couch locked a half-black Afghanistan like Afghanistan one of the strange you want for you it definitely eases the mind it definitely relaxes the body relaxes the muscles like I said it's like a soothing narcotic and it definitely is I mean I've only took him for four or five hits of it so far and I'm definitely feeling it right and I'm telling you what the taste it's getting even better I guarantee when I wake up in the morning I'm still going to smell my room is still gonna smell like just [ __ ] joint head normally does been a try some of these joints any kind of joint really good see how nice and white to ashes - yeah yeah this [ __ ] burn him beautiful yeah nice wish I could do like slow-mo if we are yeah that what only $1 works hopefully see we get that fix here but I already got a couple recordings ready for y'all so like I said I'm not just gonna leave gone hanging man like I said the first time around it won't be no videos I'm not gonna go hang a man I got a couple videos a very pretty record for the [ __ ] time when I'm laid to [ __ ] out yeah so be definitely be on the lookout for them [ __ ] man I will give you all those deep video right this disc cartridge right here I open it up yesterday and at first they gave me kind of like a little hot flash whenever I did the review but I turn my ACS I think it was a big part of that puss breaking a bacon with the liquid live resin cartridge it definitely threw me in like a hot flash but afterwards once I cool down man the bus is really really [ __ ] nice and I'll tell you from a G leaf liquid live resin cartridge FS e cartridge whatever I think I forget it [ __ ] means um yeah it was pretty good so be on the lookout for that review blueberry scone just like the porn snap blueberry skunk fire bro blueberries Conchas fire I mean literally look I killed it I killed it it was that it was that good I mean I just the oil burnt really fast and I'm not gonna lie like I mean like on a normal Cresco card the oil would last me three four days the way I was smoking it this one here that was done within a day yeah like clearly at 24 32 hours time it was done it normally doesn't happen like that like I said alive Cresco car some [ __ ] last me for at least a couple days after me I have to only doubt for about the G leaf-like reliable riser cartridge so far so far cuz I only had one and take what this [ __ ] definitely um looks even like it has some like oil in it yeah my fur is nice man and to be honest with you the throat burn isn't even isn't bad at all anymore like I guess it maybe that first initial like maybe it was just from the [ __ ] you know what I mean I don't know maybe it was you know I'm just book search anymore August 17th to be here since I haven't had a cigarette so like you know inhale [ __ ] the gas anymore so like I said I ain't been smoking much fire to be using lighters and [ __ ] so I'm try to smoke this did that cough too much right nobody wants to sit through a video and fin just hair [ __ ] hacking and coughing stuff I think I'm doing pretty good SIGCHI Finn this [ __ ]

it is like my fourth time being uh put down and every time you just ask areas first the thought is always in the back your mind of not waking up right that can happen anytime again put down any type of surgery I don't get but what kind of surgery it is even it was the most simplest kind of surgery there is you could [ __ ] not wake up for it something could go wrong I try not to think about it too much this my friend my friends is definitely helping it out I'm sure I look [ __ ] smacked as I feel smacked I think this one's in the book boys I believe I had a black Afghani flower before buy it makes double you see I'm not sure where the hell I had that the black Afghani fire from but I have had it before and it was [ __ ] amazing and it looked beautiful as they called purple maybe it was maybe it wasn't Marilyn Allen I understand but maybe that's whenever they first started putting in their own [ __ ] jars or packaging or [ __ ] classic however it is you want to [ __ ] all I'm pretty good boys look this thing went out i'ma go ahead in the video here I'm feeling nice imma [ __ ] hop off go to bed get ready for work tomorrow and then after that you know it's time to grind boys I

good [ __ ] I'm gone I'm feeling nice boys like Afghani [Music]", "YCJpP6Nf3Mo": "what's up everybody welcome to another episode of sessions I'm your host Aaron Ghana and today we got a special treat I burner burner for 1/5 he's a white for those of you guys that don't know who burner is burner is a rapper he's started on the Bay Area he used to own like I don't know if he owned that we used to work in dispensary and he used to give weed to Wiz Khalifa so that's how they became cool and because he started to rap they kind of took the hoots and he's in a burner is in Taylor Gang Taylor Gang is Wiz Khalifa's little rap group Taylor Gang or die but yeah it's he he's been coming up in the ranks for a whole minute my I listen to all of his albums I [ __ ] with them a lot of them he has like three albums with be real from Cypress Hill pretty [ __ ] tight but anyways his brand is cookies and he recently just opened up a store in Oakland California where some I'm in the city next door to Oakland so it was pretty close to me it's downtown open but yeah he just released it it came out gonna come up December December 6th they opened today's the 15th so yeah like to be late but yeah it's on Broadway it's a it's pretty cool I really like the setup it's really it's really clean is one of them like more futuristic cleaner dispensaries that I've seen I really enjoyed it they had a well I'm smoking I got some cereal milk that's what we're sort of reviewing today this [ __ ] is some fire I gotta say this is some it was 74 for the eighth that's what Texan installation Texan installation of a [ __ ] idiot you're thinking of Autobots and [ __ ] yeah it was 74 with tags on my left okay I got some some wine in the black cup seven [Music] we're gonna be heading out the Cheech and Chong pipe got some loaded up also the song that was they got me we're gonna see what's what's really good with this cereal milk let's see this shit's so yeah I was 74 with tax included I also got some Georgia Pie yeah I don't really want to I'll show you some pictures with also oh yeah I got this so both of them together it was this one was 67 out the door I paint 141 for two aids you know it's kind of tough personally I don't think any eighth is worth $74 but I mean that's just me you know it just doesn't make sense to buy a $74 8th cuz I mean it's not that much better than stuff that I can get for $100 an ounce you know so it's like $50 less and get a lot Oh but I mean to each their own it's I like to get it on occasions you know especially good excuse to get good week because of the sense of the show but yeah it's 27 percent THC this one was packaged on November 1st like I said today is December 15th that's about a month and a half of I was setting it did feel a little bit of dry but um I mean what can you do they're not the most I mean they they are sealed pretty good but I mean in what the half is a month in either there's nothing like smoking it right when it's done curing but yeah cheers guys hope you guys are smoking along with me oh and the the big the Lobo big [Music] jiggers [Music] [Music] whoof that was a good hit let us hell it hit I really like the way this this bong hits it's good I needed a beaker but yeah it's like it's super dense this weed and it reminds me oh it makes the head its cookies what it is is cookies it's cherry pie and it's snowmen so it's those three together and when I had it I didn't know that when I bought it but when I started smoking in like I could smell it I was like man this this is some cookies it was like you know when you look at it you could tell it's like it has the formation of cookies just looks like cookies so I mean what it is is some top-shelf bomb-ass cookies but they just call it a cereal look which I mean I get it because brandings everything you know this is some really nice packaging you can't really beat it it's it's top of the line I mean you're talking about even in the folds have cookies in there and [ __ ] it's it's pretty good but I'm gonna grind something up give you guys a good good nose yeah it's really really pretty it's like you can see all the little purples that cookies usually have but it's like more of a darker purple because I think of the cherry pie astray pie is a more purple but all right let's see what we got in this nose see what it do yeah so it's cookies but it's like a it's like a sweeter cookies yeah but it's for sure some bees have some Cuban music oil funky as expected he got the harsh way with the pipe as always I really is tough I won't smoke but again is it worth paying the seventy four dollars for the eighth you know to a lot of people with tonight you know some people they got money and they got dough like that what sucks too is you can't even buy ounces they should if you want an ounce you have to buy hella little eight until you get your house so I don't really like that it basically charging you for packaging and overcharging with a packaging [Music] but it is what it is I mean they charge me like I paid like 40 bucks and just in taxes so that was fun what are you gonna do you know unless you know burn personally you can't get that discount but I mean he definitely has a premium on his weed because I mean this is pretty much it's probably a bit the highest eighth that I've encountered I mean it is 74 with tax included so I guess you could argue that it's it's probably the $60.00 eighth and then you just add the taxes come up 74 but still it's pretty expensive but I really like the dispensaries it's really clean it's like it's nice the way that they set it up I quite enjoyed it let me know what you guys are smoking on we are from you know just [ __ ] wanna see how much are your guys's AIDS this is a $74 what is your eggs looking like wouldn't you smoke a what are your someone what are you guys this favorite dispensaries well let me know one oh I'm gonna try other dispensaries across the world there's different weed in general [Music] oh all right guys so just recently um the MLB okay don't know [ __ ] him up it's a [ __ ] major league baseball they recently on December 13th they took basically they dropped marijuana from being a drug of abuse on the drug of abuse list so basically they're treating it as if it was the same as alcohol which is a lot less so before they used to be getting charged thirty five thousand per violation if they got caught with or high or on THC in their system whatever test they use but yeah it's pretty [ __ ] up cuz weed it's not like it's not bad for your health necessarily of course there's still more studies to be done and everything like that but I mean it's not us what do you say it's not an enhancing drug it's not gonna you're not gonna smoke a joint and start going making hell homeruns I'm just going batshit crazy it's not steroid it's not gonna make you better it's not gonna make me muscular maybe it's gonna make you focus a little bit more but I mean I think they did a good service with this with this making it just basically dropping it and I also read that the NFL's also looking into doing the same thing basically so hopefully all sports can can at least lower the penalty is from weed maybe not they don't have to allow it or whatever but people shouldn't have to be paid $35,000 especially if you're not making a lot of money in the MLB maybe you're not that good maybe you get paid a little less maybe 35,000 that's a lot to that player yeah props to them I'll be they [ __ ] go I'm not a big sports guy myself but I am a weed guy and I had to let you guys know about this little tidbit of information but yeah that's my two cents and I hope you guys have a good good smoke sesh I know I did a [ __ ] sucking fire I overall I'm gonna give it a I'm gonna give it a 9 this cuz this you know it's really good cookies cookies my favorite strain by heart and I love cookie so Cheers [Music]", "8xi6JrT6pH0": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we have this eight gram grenade xxl infused pre-roll from napalm with originals flower so uh this is definitely by far the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you", "NNQD4k3VQ0M": "what's up with y'all indian diver here i'm here by l.a out here for a week and this video is the thousand dollar

legendary [ __ ] in the making this is called the biscotti from the cookie family this is cookies biscotti and this is one of the sought out strains right here this is a frame a favorite of mine personally I [ __ ] with some biscotti on personal tip no I'm saying I keeps me a bit at home this is a favorite of Scott Storch legendary producer no I'm saying because he'd be staying lit with ample

like the fragrance is just like overwhelming you know instead of getting punched in the nose you're getting tickled in the nose by the full bouquet of this particular strain right here the trichomes are off the hook the the cure is insane you know it I got to tell you this [ __ ] is on blast man the bag appeal jar appeal I mean the Nuggets don't come big and blown out you know they don't be using the phospholipid this particular [ __ ] so the Nuggets are you know small and tight they're not huge sometimes those big nuggets are you know overblown and and it's not what they seem to be but this [ __ ] right here you know the power is in these little mid-sized nuggets that you got here you know any connoisseur knows that those little middle midsize nuggets you know not the big full-blown Cola style but the little ones that's the where they pack the flavor and the punch is very dense gonna need it grinder don't [ __ ] with scissors because you're just gonna ruin it use a proper grinder you know what I'm sayin this [ __ ] right here you can find in Maywood at the cookie store in Maywood cookies SF and any cookie dispensary or cookies dispensary that would be in your city so if you're in Seattle please believe they got the biscotti if you're in California here South Southern California or Northern California you got this [ __ ] if there's a cookie store there and there's new cookie stores coming about so if you want to find this train it's on blast now I didn't do the light up because this is a strain alert it's not a review no I'm saying we're just telling you about the fire

strength called hawaiian haze this is outdoor air dried machine trim all of that is on there i like these little bottles that they come in they're plastic so you don't have to worry about if you drop it you break it nothing like that also it comes with the proper paperwork for ups and for the usps let them know this help you dig this is not mary jane it's not that although there's nothing wrong with that this just ain't that it also comes with a your order has arrived and a personal thank you note it's the little things stuff like that makes you enjoy your purchase just a wee bit more i also

hawaiian haze let me smell it everything the light touches is your home simba dude look at this look at this look at that look at that look at that hawaiian haze from horn creek i'm gonna be honest with you hawaiian haze is just one of the all-around best smelling strains it always has this real real fruity citrusy smell mixed with a little bit of pine it's just always a good strength let me let you smell let me let you look at this again look at this look at those butts it's machine trimmed but they've done a good job you can see all the trichomes and everything you can see everything everything everything you can see everything i'm gonna get you know what i'm gonna put these big nuggets bike i'm gonna put those back in there oh what i really love you see you see that down at the bottom oh it's a boost pack so it's gonna stay fresh i'm gonna use this nugget right cheer it seems like it's going to be the perfect size i love the way the bootstraps keeps everything good and moist i can already tell since it has the boost pack in there i'm going to use the grinder because it's going to be incredibly sticky and it is oh it's sticky let me stick it the smell though it's just it's not even like that stinky funk smell i mean you can definitely tell this cannabis as soon as you open it but it's one of those good it's i mean it's just this is fruity it's sweet the citrusy hawaiian hazel it's a it smells good it's it's one of my favorite strengths per se of all time just it's just one of my all-time favorite strengths and one of the reasons why is that smell it i hope everybody

flower has won a couple of awards and i see why the first thing you're going to notice when you pull on it is how incredibly sweet it is it is incredibly sweet the next thing you're going to notice is just it's very smooth that citrus is coming through i mean you can just i feel like i feel like i'm from the islands i feel like i feel like i'm from or near the islands i feel like hakuna matata what

feel any stress in you like use that for a lot of stress what do you do for a living i said well i smoke a lot of cbd i do maybe that's why there's no stress there because it's loosening my muscles up cbd is excellent for pain relief excellent for inflation um i recommend hawaiian haze it's an excellent upper to me i think it's kind of like a sativa uh it puts me in a good mood a positive attitude it's smooth it's sweet it's i'm this is wild their lifter i think is the best lifter i've had i'm gonna have to smoke it again but because i haven't smoked any of it since the review i think it's the

you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it yo guys what's happening ska Bulls back again with the third review on his channel now this time you cable for you finally I'll say start up the 293 this time with just really gets jaffa cake cookies so this is one of my favorite strange to be fair had the last few years in a sense of I've had it a lot in the last few years I've got I know a god that particular tends to bird is it's a really good job a [ __ ] actually who this border he's off here and when he said the other particular batch I knew this ever people to storks I hope you know what all cost get a review of it review the moment sorry so yeah well that's probably the table or do like this [Music] to be funded you're going but there's a really nice border hopefully five came in one good thing about c35 really nice truck incorporated crazy pistols I threw out a bunch of stuff you know it's a really nice look look look you know a really cool book Scripture the reason why it's called Jack a cool to use for anyone's like a very personal film watching this jacket these are it's like a biscuit with like our in the sort of like sweet in the middle taste but you get off this is very reminiscent of this because this would take some real orders these tapes at college sweet it's hard to explain it well thing if you know what maybe this book it's hard to explain for similar to what sort of smell reminds me of again maybe played by the tile wall it is it you do you get the orange fruit @anjghie before I've reviewed orange happening sensor smoke but it's cooked before which cream for example it was they were more orange it's orange flavors or accessible flavors this is like own flavor it's really pronounced if you like flavorful put it really like this I recommend it raining outside anyway they're not gonna be chatting about the would you mind the steamy yet so I let me see the back unfortunate we give it a rating as usual yeah [Music] I mean the looks like a lot of cookies does that mean the smell of this but it actually is pretty crazy if you smoke of cake you'll know what I mean it has a pretty independence or pretty unique smell is what I'm trying to say nice really nice trimmed up on it as well I say to you capable of - it's crazy you can do some big things just you should know I was gonna be looking at you but yeah this you carry on so cool but to start with I said as a Jesse statement just what quickly get a video this with a flush on as well - good that was pretty billion to flush you see all the little trichomes there see the tripod a bit various lactase not crazy comedy track homes but they are obviously really present in Tennessee and the harem pistols which made this bullish nobody reading colors it's more like a light green okay it looks a bit dark and I've got a flash run even more alive green a real perp was about nothing but instead of [ __ ] nice-looking pudding like that think of the UK all day really see it up so yeah as you can see as I say before some really nice cops look at corporate structure and this is particularly fire but you know there's many punished once so clean very kind of nice why I should not you know I've enjoyed smoking it I usually do is Joyce make the job complete but this was a prime example of a teenage girl it's got a sweet sweetness to it do you certainly get some of the cookie saw through his fat cookies you do so haste with the cookies for everybody's and also I think a lot of structures owed to the cookie so as well it doesn't matter cookies but yeah really nice taste really pronounced taste as well written theme readable brain comedy tribe claims Italy UK but lacks a great channel really nice high get enough flavor because it's pronounced yeah yeah I've had so yeah this one if you haven't necessarily minutes was a bass you're part of my last squad hire this think of the batches what put it on there you know that 8.9 high school for UK yeah quicker for you to be the last one today we're still new to this restored - I mean testing the waters try to see what works what ain't working obviously seen in the videos you can watch them bigger yourself but if you do have any feedback first please let us know you're a stranger once you get a hold of keys know if you smell jaffa cake cookies if you're making it if you'd not let us know yeah you know I mean the comments are there for a reason yeah what's really really fire strange point I think next review it's going to be a very edgy today see ya in Harvey demands thing and hopefully after that well you know to the fight okay you be worn in okay so to me you wanna see a play i chef I know in your soul find a way yeah don't ever be talking about fasting not so you didn't push out those name and Yuto ji mu since he's talked about when this way I shall we were checking you back are no lay on my soul I stopped doing on my day enjoy the videos cookies tangey cookies UK good 8.9 really 5 good and yes they're coming soon with some more UK but the very next yeah", "iMucmioN7kQ": "yes yes guys it's Justin back in the house for yes you know it a strange review we've actually got a strain review today for you guys to enjoy a tear so do apologize but I have just I had anything to review we should be worth reviewing like saying you can only review lemon so many times so guys as you know from the lives this way did start off as a mystery but I've just identified this is guava dot guys yeah it's obviously this is a mixture of the trade dog and the dog very very nice and it's mixed with something else actually it's a three-way hybrid but it's a 60/40 indica dominant yeah and it's a hell of a star dog [ __ ] cross I can tell you [Music] please check out the butt shots on dr. Fong tinks channel so there are some close up top this yeah I was reading up on this little flower it is between 20 and 25 percent THC so packs a hell of a punch out there guys and as you saw me on my lives I didn't expect to be absolutely what date like that it completely just went fine to me I have not had a string that has affected me like that in a very very very long time it was [ __ ] fantastic guys absolutely fantastic so oh love it she's got real real gassy sort of smell to it again like you start dogs but there's something else there as well again you've got a little bit of fruit to tongue come into it and then there's something ours there's something else there it tasted quite musty to me but yeah proper straight review guys this is the other birds I got at tooth butts this is the smaller one so I'm going to review this but for you I won't smoke all of it because it [ __ ] knocked me for six I have a little bit of smaller but I haven't needed a lot more to be fair it is in cry fighting incredibly strong I'm not used to these types of you know weeds to be honest with you it's absolutely not be socks off let's have a [ __ ] pong let's stop talking so there's there perfect that look at that oh God really gasps hey now you've opened up real gassy really skunky really like yeah really offensive dude I'm saying but in a nice way guys like so you you used to put this around somebody who don't like weed they ain't gonna like it cuz it [ __ ] this is absolute cannabis this is this [ __ ] stinks just gas lots and lots and lots of gas more than normal start off but obviously that's because it's start dog trade dog and obviously something else is mixed in with it as well I will put that on on the notes basically I've got what it was now but I will put it in the description [ __ ] fantastic that's all I can say that's all I can say alright then let's just get this [ __ ] grind up and then we can [ __ ] it's all today I'm just growing that nice little nugget in there guys nice little nugget right spike down Lincoln frame nicely joins up really [ __ ] nice this that was buy half of that was put in there so roughly a fight a G maybe just under a G just under a G yeah look at guys find a B doors a really really nice really really nice you don't want to do nothing you don't want to do nothing Oh was he doing what's he doing oh yeah you don't want to move much is it nice why unless he's getting a bong and stop messing around there cuz I'm sure you guys are intrigued I'm sure a lot of you have tried this one don't think I've tried this well I certainly would remember it's very [ __ ] gassy that's all I can say nice like so I struggled to talk on the livestream the last livestream so if you missed that do you have a watch because it's quite funny is this completely just sucks made as I live on YouTube you'll see me just go and it's not very off there and I stopped talking because I always talk to like guys you know me alright cheers guys no you still fatty let's get it done Oh a pocket a spot so [ __ ] well again full of gas and a little bit of light I don't know there's something else there it's like a mustiness like me nuns like it's a backhoe smell like when you walk into your man's friend living room when she used to smoke whatever back in the day when you get that taste in your mouth I get back with this slide day along with the gas along with a little bit fruit [ __ ] beautiful I mean that is [ __ ] superb cannabis you know [ __ ] you very very high order there guys and it's a good one as well it's a good one it's not flat it's done very very well very very well I'm obviously quite pleased with it just I can't motivate I can't do anything with it I mean as far as it doesn't give me any energy to go and sort of do stuff it just makes me want to like sort of watch films and stuff like that which is quite good because it just sort of makes me chili because I wonder then guys hundred miles an hour it's hard to get me to [ __ ] chill and just stop for a second so this does make me stop I just have a breather for a second so it has been quite nice it has been quite nice absolutely spanks my ass and when when when used with an alcohol cause I was I had a couple of ciders an itch though I only had didn't even finish my second cider that's how much it affected me I couldn't [ __ ] smoke it but yeah that first one's nice I say danke gas a quite fruity and then I get like a musty tone to it as well and again it smells very very similar to the way I'm describing it to you now let's look at this next bomber and I've made a fatal error I forgot my lemonade so give me two seconds I need to grab my juice my [ __ ] throat is killing me now nice though really really nice guys really [ __ ] nice what two seconds and I'll blast that point you're at spit site that site [Music] [Music] number two I'm on the old lemonade this time guys are like users nobody a [ __ ] fantastic to go with your smokey jazz so doing quite sweet quite sharp like a cheers guys lovely when they smash this that blonde mmm I see what we think so as you say we've got quite a big one in now iris or skins it's a good [ __ ] size guys all right so let's [ __ ] do it guys roll up yeah spark it up get your bongs out guys yeah one left each and every one of you [Music] yeah you definitely get that dog with that you can definitely taste the dog in it you can definitely smell the dog in it but like say the strength for me is higher - you guys I know let's put me a lot of people like that who used to be 64 years but to me this does feel a bit heavier than a 60/40 indica dominant it really does it feels quite heavy now okay I know I've been smoking lemons for quite a while now you guys know I have so obviously my tolerance to probably this type of strain probably drop just a little bit I would say but [ __ ] you know I do find this strong I do find this very strong you know like when you're at burn you [ __ ] feel like you've had one job saying you really feel I almost feel like my lungs are quaking you don't mean it's almost like an almost pleasurable cough that you need to if you understand what I mean it's [ __ ] lovely really really nice really really heavy in the head I feel it all across the top of my head and my eyes I feel like I'm planted again I do you know me I do feel like I probably I've got energy to do stuff like gay men like watching a film and stuff like that but as far as going like for long walks and stuff like that and being energetic this isn't the one this is more of the kick back sit back relax it's the end of the evening yeah it's the later part of the day it's time to [ __ ] chill out now so all those [ __ ] worries all those aches and pains yeah they're gonna go away with this strain because it's very very heavy I can feel pain relief properties in it because again I struggled my shoulder I'm not feeling any any sort of issues with my shoulder at all that and my speech has noticeably slowed down I feel my eyes are heavy this is a proper proper stone this strain if you want to feel stoned this is the one my god I only had two [ __ ] hits there guys that is [ __ ] heavy I will have another within the set with that I'm just gonna let that just creep in a little bit cuz I did notice when I was smoking last night it was a [ __ ] creeper a bio time I was thanked about my sort of my second half of my cider I was feeling like whoa this is [ __ ] heavy so yes soft drinks only for me teach me a lesson quickly it's been pretty damn [ __ ] quick as well let me tell you that did spank my ass nice trainer guys have you tried this I've tried to trade dog I've tried star dog I've tried powerful dog I've tried all of those initially I did think it was purple dog and so I tried that and then the strength hit me cuz I don't think purple dogs that strong it's stronger Hesh you know there is some next to it but it isn't something that I can't handle where it's like well I out there so I have to come just really watch myself and space it out a little bit cuz I know that if I have too much you just get a [ __ ] soul mate Jeremy yeah you don't need a lot of this strain as well so again if you want something that's gonna last year you know if you're you know trying to save and stuff like that do the mean and you just you know you just don't want to generally smoke that much use one I'm a little tooth just to get yourself on a level this will do it a lot quicker for you and you're not going to meet your hits of it you know I'd say one hit of that it's probably like two or three hits of something else really jamming it's not the normal not for me anyway I say please stick at the comments let me know what you guys think of this string really really interesting apparently there's a lot of guava dog go and running this area that's why I can identify it quite easily by speaking to a couple people and show it and so yeah guava table guys what a [ __ ] strain oh my god oh my god sixty-forty I mean I've had some [ __ ] 88-90 indicus yeah and they have not felt like this you know mate like say my tolerance is sort of lower to these in because these days but [ __ ] you know I listen to me I'm just willing I'm just willing but wow that is [ __ ] strong Wang we have no one so you ready to watch me get really [ __ ] stupid now come on Gavin press that like already make sure you smash that likes guys yeah what the end of the videos plenty of like share plenty of first subscribes yeah let's get set to free enter it with tinkering on 290 in a minute we keep going down we keep going up we keep going down we keep going up get us up to 300 yeah let's guess 1 make my weekends boy as [ __ ] stoked this up I feel look at me look at me and I haven't touched any alcohol drinking lemonade look at me [ __ ] how man this is a powerhouse I bet there's other people like watch this going in and we can handle that you're [ __ ] light right but for me for me this feels heavy guys but I can tell you it is a very good one [Applause] I'll show you the bird again I will show you just to show you I [ __ ] just beautifulness don't spill it just don't spill it but you don't I mean how can you get better than that I mean just look at just the way it it just looks it's just it is a fantastic looking flower and it is [ __ ] solid it is solid let me tell you thanks cats yeah absolutely solid guys oh oh so we base strong for me I've gotta be honest with you but I like it I do like it it's only strong for me because I want to be productive and I wanna do stuff and it's not making me productive and it certainly not want to make me do stuff is just wanted me to [ __ ] chill out so again if you need something to relax you it's gonna force you to just stop yeah and just take a breath and get yourself together this is the [ __ ] strain let me tell you and for all you guys out there looking for pain relief properties I can assure you that this will be very very good for pain relief I could just feel it you and me are the fiercest tingling pain my napkin should I mean he's just got that field switch and I mean I feel proper like top stogies yeah probably Stoney you know your lemons and stuff like that they make you feel high yeah and people get stoned and high completely confused sometimes do it being so not as old as donors if we do it for years but there's a massive difference again speed being stoned being high and right now this is this is stone mate this is stoned right let's up this [ __ ] bond guys come on have one with me have one with me peace wouldn't have guys lots and lots of comments in this one yeah cheers nice one nice soon you feel like I've had one well I feel like a bad phrase that's sure I feel like I'm probably out of eight nine nice like Kennedy a cannabis for me I tend to get used to it quite quickly once I start smoking it so but like say because this is a prime mu g string i've not had anything like this for a little while good luck you feel it I suppose really really nice again stick in the comments let me know what you think of this strings it just made or do you find it quite strong as well but I mean yeah I feel warm and fuzzy all over I feel highly highly medicated I feel quite chilled I'd like say don't want to go to bed or anything like that but I want to go and let's say I'm just like Netflix is [ __ ] calling stop I'm saying it I'm thinking about what PlayStation games and getting on there and Jimmy getting on social media and just just being a bit like that job saying not doing anything like dude any more streaming or anything like that or going for walks it's just like it's a relaxation remain and what would I score it I mean taste is fantastic tasty really smells good you know it smells like a dog cross with something else do you I'm saying so really really really really nice really nice and I'm not I'm not keen on dog we've had a lot dog but this is not dog

all burnt really really nice it's tasted really good I just love love clean medicine you can't beat it but fantastic full of gas yeah full of gassy goodness absolutely love it and I've gotta give it a good sort of 9 out of 10 because the strengths there the looks they're you know I just like a little bit more energy this is this is properly a strain which you guys out there might like a lot more than me cuz I know that a lot of people like their there more of their indicus more than their sativas and I'm probably more the other way round yeah I like my sativa hybrids you know close to 2 D sativa signs you know it me rather than the indica side it's really really slowed me down I can feel it it's make my mouth incredibly dry the other thing I noticed last night and today and I haven't had this for ages cuz I smoked quite a bit cannabis and I don't get munchies yeah I don't just don't get it I don't I haven't had it for years it just doesn't do that to me anymore and I've been [ __

Ben's little round slaps and we've got the super her long slaps so we're gonna probably put one we don't know that's funny move some space move some things around one might go a super her was the top think about that and then another doctor then to go in now my Ali Bongo an ominous and the ruthless Mickey Mouse but yeah so that's them it's epic thank you so much then literally like make sure you go check out the channel to everybody on this channel if you haven't subscribe to dr.

Demi struggling yeah Cheers so now we've got it round up and the smell get that really pungent Starbucks now but instead of it being overpowering style dog as most like that initial chemical smell or like as I would say pungent overpowering smell like a gassing now it's more of a sweetie like sweet note with the Guardian now and you get back a bit of the herbal with a bit more skunky notes in this one normal style dog is like more pungent gassy this is more sweet horrible it's got like a distinctive smell to it you can smell the difference definitely I haven't looked into the cross breathe properly myself but that's going to be the description so you guys can check out the description but on the smell because this is a sweet one but it's still got that like gassy pungent nurse and it's not on the high range sweet sweet top range as I've got to speak to and top marks while going to most of the sweet strains this is on the pungent one so we're going to give this one we'll give this one eight five eight point five only because the gassy notes and the sweet notes mixed together is it is it weird to stick this mouth but a nice one to a certain least length so is one of them ones like as I can explain it gets up the nose and lock with the pungent gas he notes but it gets eight five only because it's not the sweetest one and it's not something that I would go for if I was in a coffee shop choosing suck the colors like black choosing Suffolk in a coffee shop so but anyways you've got really like a pungent gas no with a sweet horribly now then skunky notes coming through and you've got that point the old school pines in there so it's got some really nice notes and string but really nice notes and aromas in there in this strength so like it would be a old school one I would say in the aspect of the sweet earthy notes well piney notes and the skunk enos of the pungent gas skunk smell but we're going to get into the flavor now because we're doing it with one hand we're not going to make them as big as we usually do just so we don't suffocate ourselves and don't panic and ink off the wall are everywhere out at the bottom yeah I've had some awkward times with bombs there's a lot of people probably have right we're going to get into the flavor got up all packed and we've cleaned up bong so we've got an ice cream bomb to let you guys know the favor we'll see you guys for close [Music] that's really smooth quite a lot of white ash now definitely been flushed a really nice tasting one as well so for the flavor you get a really pungent gas you know with that piney sweetener straightaway that's the initial flavor then the after notes more like up skunky apparently also flavor and this one's really sweet compared to most other normal start off Springs you could definitely taste those different genetics kindness and the different prospered it's a really sweet one it's got them fruity notes a little bit to it as well it's a little bit fruity it's got a very tinge so it is like a bit like some sort of fruit and some sort of berries with the sweetener so it is a nice one but I find this coming from the stunk so they're like that the fruity notes coming like a what a stocky fruity note so this one popular lingers on the tongue proper sweet proper lip smacking strain as I would say so this one gets definitely a 10 out of 10 today sweetness and flavor I was going to expect it to be more pungent than more gaseum the flavor but that was nice because it's still lingering on the tongue and still got like gassy Fe sweet skunk would be horrible them piney notes as well there is an old school pining up so now we're going into the second one I'm going into the buzz see goes to the clouds Oh so garcy woman well that's what I was more expecting the garcy nose so when you have big ones you are gonna feel the chest eNOS but as a really nice one but sweats teary eyes put a feeling numb and the buzz is a really nice euphoric uplifting one but is it indica dominant and it's quite a high indica dominant so you definitely get that children feeling you get the shoulders you get the flip-top head because there's a bit sativa in it still so is that that bike you want to lie down but you've done did you still want to do certain things very like euphoric in the aspect of creativity as well so you can think about creative stuff and it makes you happy about thinking that you know so it's a really nice straight the buzz actually makes me feel nice makes me actually want to do stuff for the day I like this one I think it's as 75% in to cook and 25 sativa don't hold me to it the descriptions got to be in the video a really nice tasty one really nice buzz and it gets a 10 out of 10 for the buzz as well because it's the type of strain that I would choose something that I would feel nice and relaxed but still I can cut through today because it's not too much THC for me but have a tribe it yourself it's a really nice one anyways let's popped it me make sure you enter the giveaway it's all on Facebook and there's going to be one in February as well on here make sure you like subscribe anyways guys peace I'm out of here say",

strange so here we go man it's g13 is a very strong strain of cannabis indica that is the subject of many urban legends according to some accounts the CIA FBI and other agencies gathered the best strains of marijuana from breeders all over the world at a super secret installation at the University of Mississippi be they bred many new super hybrids in the late 1960s allegedly a single cutting of this plant was liberated and unnamed an unnamed technician and bred for the masses whatever that means although the legends are probably not through g13 delivers effects like no other if you have

i know this is a new format let me know what you all think when we talk about the most popular cannabis brands in the world cookies cannabis is without a doubt in the conversation almost in a class of its own cookie's cannabis is highly sought after and has an almost cult-like following a cookie's cult but who created this massively popular popular marijuana brand founder and chief executive officer gilbert milam jr more familiarly known as hip-hop artist burner and grow expert jai or jiga chang developed the cookie strain which became the foundations of cookies fam genetics in this video we are going to cover burner and has come up to being one of the most influential cannabis entrepreneurs on the planet if you end up liking this video and would like me to do another one of these videos on someone else please let me know down in the comments born and raised in san francisco's sunset district berner attended galileo academy of science and technology before he eventually dropped out but first let's go over his family so his father is mexican and his mother is italian his mother was an office worker and his father was a chef at a mexican restaurant on fillmore street berner has said that that his insane work ethic stems from seeing how hard both of his parents worked when he was younger when burner was 13 his mother and siblings moved to arizona where his father planned to meet them to open a restaurant but his father actually ended up never coming to arizona due to an affair he was apparently having with another woman when burner was 16 he told his mom that he needed to move back to the bay area to finish up high school so he could pursue his music career in his self-produced documentary 11-11 burner says that at a young age he knew he wanted to do something big be around forever and ultimately leave a legacy in his words legacy and immortality could best be achieved through either movies or music and while berner has indeed already immortalized himself as a hip-hop legend with over 37 different projects released to date he may only know now be realizing the scale to which his legacy will impact the cannabis industry after berner dropped out of high school his senior year he continued to work on music it started to become a frequent at some of the medical cannabis clubs and eventually got a job at one of them named hemp center soon burner was not just working at the cannabis club but actually managing it too for five years berner was immersed in the developing medical cannabis industry all the while continuing to make music and battle wrap in 2006 burner linked up with the bay area rap legend equipto where the veteran rapper showed burner the ropes of quality music production after forming his own label burn one entertainment in 2007 burner released his debut album track money and pac money with the crypto one thing that can be said about burner's entrepreneurial instincts is that he realizes the power of networking connectivism and collaboration after track money and pac money he did joint albums with the legends like the jacka and many others he understood that collaborations meant access to another fan base leveraging the relationship symbiotically this strategy would eventually lead burner that celebratism could be leveraged with cannabis and branding steeped in the entrepreneurial bravado of his family burner the mc and berner the businessman were destined to synthesize into a titan of success the first materialized in burner's cannabis club where patrons and acquaintances would meet to talk shop although it was a cannabis club berner and others that visited him would never shy away from sharing their other productive endeavors in fact burner allowed his club to be a space for both among other things the cannabis industry and the music industry this brilliant decision opened up the opportunity for creatives from different industries and backgrounds to intersect and collaborate in ways they may have not if it wasn't for spaces like burners if it wasn't for this many of us might have not even known who berner was or is and he may have faded into relative obscurity as we know this did not happen it was in the context that burner and wiz khalifa crossed paths in 2012 whiz visited burner's club and enjoyed the atmosphere berner shared his recent musical endeavors with whiz which was met with so much enthusiasm that wiz ended up signing berner to his highly sought after label taylor gang records after ingratiating himself in into wiz khalifa's collective burner quickly rose to prominence inside and outside of taylor gang assisting wiz in his development and launch of his own canvas brand khalifa kush if you have had your ear to the ground around this time then you would remember the wave of hype and controversy that orbited khalifa a lot of these moments such as the infamous kanye west slash wiz khalifa beef can be understood as just as pivotal for burner's career trajectory as they were for whiz wiz khalifa said yo man hit that kk and chill and kanye thought he met kim kardashian and then he just completely went off the [ __ ] rails with that thank you mr west to kk cells went crazy i had a great few months after that man i love you oh so so after that khalifa kush just just went bananas it was always going bananas but that [ __ ] just made it even go even more crazy because everyone's like it's weed you crazy bastard and everyone's going crazy on him and i just know that dispensary in las vegas went nuts with the kk after that when burner understood how the celebrity attention translated into building brand equity that could drive business to the kk brand this must have been an enlightening moment potentially giving him an understanding that very few people involved in the cannabis industry had at the time the power of celebrity and music it is here that we see berner develop his own strand of multiplicative branding and thus spreading his wings and establish once and for all that he is the entrepreneur's entrepreneur after this it's only a short hop skip and jump to hemp infused water hemp based clothing slash apparel and the ever so popular girl's cow cookie strains all of which would skyrocket burner and his brand cookies into the future of the cannabis industry [Music] cookies grew more and more popular and started to receive recognition all due to the continuous diversification of its production with the development of the legal cannabis industry and the imminent explosion of hip-hop into the mainstream it was obvious that berner was preparing himself to succeed in the business landscape to come burner would and still does to this day name drop his strains and brands in his own music building name recognition hype and a tailored brand perception for the public to receive let me ask you this what are some of the most commonly recurring consumerist themes in hip-hop designer clothes designer cars designer jewelry are you seeing the pattern hip hop has a hyper focus on exclusive expensive and high quality designer goods now if we have exclusive genetics high quality product that is enough demand for it to be expensive well do we have designer cannabis i would argue yes only does hip-hop create and or validate the designer cannabis perception for a company like cookies but it also amplifies the perception to a massive audience while burner definitely leverages his music to promote cookies and his other brands he is only one rapper with one fan base burner's skills at networking and insight to make strategic partnerships in the music industry allowed the cookies family of brands to be fully embraced by a large portion of the hip-hop industry it wouldn't be long before crowd favorites like migos and up-and-comers like nefta pharaoh would start to associate themselves with burner's brand even name-dropping them in their own songs and rocking their own rocking the cookie's merch burner said in a 2018 vlad tv interview that it takes him two hours to get out of the house every morning because he has to get cookies product and apparel ready to give out to other musicians or celebrities throughout the day while he's working as a musician when it comes to strategic partnerships berner has made i think a great example is when he made the partnership with the legendary hip-hop manager steve lobel otherwise known as we work in and and had him invest into the maywood cookies cannabis store in l.a now for those who don't know who steve lobel is well this man has been working in the music industry for decades and well this man is connected what up baby boy right here kendrick lamar my big honesty feel me yeah just a man yeah get the camera off me oh yeah yeah um how long is this years back waiting for the world even talking about hearing about me uh she's giving me the game i think he goes you know been a young cat in the game earlier so many times you got to bump your head to get where you at and you make mistakes you know being on that first tour with you made a whole lot of mistakes [Music] it was a lesson learned but when you have people like this uh right there over a 70 year old kid a 20 year old kid then you be in good hands by the time i turn 25 i know the game the biggest artist in the world i'm proudest guys kendrick lamar if you don't know i'm sure you know you know i'm the og what's wrong he's most known for being the manager of the legendary hip-hop producer scott storch and a legendary producer like scott storch is always in demand whether it be from the ogs or the new and young artists popping off on the scene [Music] so when you have a manager of a superstar producer that works with the most popular young and old rappers now invested in your cannabis company well those connections are going to come in handy in the same 2018 vlad tv interview i referenced earlier we see vlad bewildered at the long list of world-class features on burner's album that was coming out at the time to summarize burner's response to vlad when you have close friends like steve lebel to call up you pretty much can get any feature you want and burner is right leverage the cannabis into music and the music into cannabis he had garnered such a fluid and organic organization of business flows and ties that it was almost as if he was tending to a garden at this point it was just a matter of time before it would bloom into what we know cookies as today cookie's success was truly materializing as we've seen burner saw the potential in intertwining cannabis brands with hip-hop and celebrity culture now why don't we go over the cookies family of brands so cookies is obviously the flagship flagship brand which sells millions of dollars worth of apparel licensing deals cannabis sales and more he owns exotics and lemonade both of which are popular flower brands in their own right when it comes to cannabis accessories he owns santa cruz shredder a high quality cannabis grinder while he also has his own paper brand vibes then we have hemp duo and what is fascinating about burner's ability to expand m2o was his ability to successfully leverage his social media following he talks about in that same vlad tv interview that he showed a room full of 7-eleven executives the power of social media he went on live and he told his fans to go to the 7-eleven instagram and to post and say on one of their comment on one of their pictures and say please get m2o into your store five minutes later they had around 40 000 comments or so and that right there shows you his ability to leverage not only just celebrity relationships and celebrity endorsements but also leverage his own celebrity leverage being a rapper [Music] now he was also an early investor into weed maps and also owns g pen a popular cannabis vaporizer burner has also recently announced cookies is going to be launching an event services company that offers a mobile dispensary [Music] most cookie stores that burner owns makes 300 000 in sales a day and their flagship store on melrose apparently does 500 000 in sales a day yeah 500k a line around the block every day his licensing deals with multi-state operators have started to expand and spread like wildfire gage cannabis as michigan is licensing cookies green thumb industries is licensing the brand in a multitude of states cookies operates in medical and recreational markets across the country and has 17 retail locations in addition it also operates a medical shop in tel aviv israel and has a cookies clothing store in barcelona spain cookies cannabis has been extremely intelligent in their business expansion approach burner and his team brilliantly use the cookies apparel and accessory stores as a safer more cost effective way to test new market potentials for example they opened a clothing store in seattle almost three to four years before they were even selling recreational cannabis in the state of washington during those two years or so or three years cookies was able to understand and grow local hype for the cannabis brand laying the infrastructure down to have a successful cannabis launch cookies market entry strategy has proven to be extremely effective and their proven standard operating procedures now allow them to license and brand and scale the business at a much faster rate while still maintaining the cookie's brand's integrity and equity a really important point i want to note is that bernie's success comes from a number of different reasons but one of the most important is his ability to cultivate and build a solid team around him he has a team that operates efficiently brands meticulously and thinks uniquely a true entrepreneur knows the extreme importance of having a quality team around them again his tendency towards collaboration helps him succeed now has talked in a number of different videos about turning down 800 million dollars to acquire the cookie's brand you know uh is it true you turned down 800 million dollars to buy your companies yeah did you hold on saying because i got to think about this for a second how the [ __ ] did did you just say no or you said let me think about it and get back because how do you make a decision to say no yeah i mean look it still [ __ ] with me i mean i had to think about it for a while but i'll give you i'll give you guys some game because this is such a good interview i never really talk about business like this but i want people out there to be motivated and i want people out there to know that like the first deal is not the best deal i cannot wait to wait to write my book about it i want to write should write a book called the best deal and so all right i get offered 800 million dollars for cookies in general the whole thing but a lot of it's stock from a canadian lp a private canadian company that's on the stock market um i looked at like this if the first deal i got was 800 million bucks and it's mostly stock and the stock game could be like great and then drop and everyone's going public right now what what what would happen if i turned it down that that day makes me pretty pretty much a boss to do that so instead of taking 800 million i took 10 million dollars in cash for 10 of my company as a friends and family round to invest into infrastructure and the next round we're doing we're evaluated at 400 million and i'll probably take a small investment at that i'm gonna build it up and while everyone else is getting bought out right now with canadian stock they may win but i'm in it to get cashed out for real because i don't want some stock i don't have to learn how to sell stock or wait and play that game i want one of the big alcohol companies who has time to come cash me the [ __ ] out as they should i want heineken to come cash me out i want southern wine to come cash me out i want them to come with that check because they got it constellation just put 400 million dollars into uh canopy um up there in canada they put a check well they could have came and bought me for four no i'm sorry i'm high as [ __ ] four billion canopy just got 4 billion dollars we're talking about a publicly traded company in canada that doesn't have the most revenue i think the revenue was negative a lot or whatever it was they don't have hella money they just have the brands so i'm building a house of brands it's gonna be like facebook and when they come they're gonna have to buy us and they're gonna i would much rather a constellation come give me four billion dollars [Music] cookies is a private company so figuring out its true value is pretty difficult but what we do know is what is with cookies we see genetics and brands that are massively in demand selling at designer prices and this is only going to keep scaling it's hard to see a ceiling for cookies cannabis and its family of brands approaching anytime soon the potential value of cookies 10 to 20 years from now could very easily be in the multiples of billions money sounds great but when you want to be around forever slash leave a legacy like burner said you wanted to i can't think of too many more impactful legacies than leaving behind a company that has revolutionized not just the cannabis space but also the brand development space little more needs to be said to prove burner's prowess as an entrepreneur in this series we're going to continue to explore the lives and business endeavors of the cannabis industry's greatest minds we thought we'd start with burner after all he is a landmark success thank you so much for watching the first episode of the high design documentary series we would love your feedback please drop a comment down below let me know what's the next person you want us to cover and really appreciate y'all we'll see in the next one signing out you", "DzdDGu9Cdpw": "[Music] today I'm really excited we're gonna do an update to the cookies multi strain review and over I would say probably a two years I've been able to collect up 25 cookie strains some are better than others and if you go to into the store how do you know which one to buy so today I'm gonna rate the top 20 talked 25 cookie strains that I tried and we're gonna start with the one I like the least that doesn't mean it's not good just means it's not as good as the one that's above it to me but I will tell you once you get to the winners these are absolutely great flowers and some of the best in LA but if you're going to go into the store why would you want to buy number 25 when you could buy number one so we're gonna check them all out today and in the end I'm gonna load a straw of this flower and I'm gonna stick it in the paper cup and I'm and enjoy it with all of you and I'm gonna be the winner today because I'm gonna try the winner so coming in at number 25 we have a flower called Ocean Beach and this was my least favorite of all the cookie strains and it's funny when I reviewed this a lot of people made comments saying I almost bought that and I didn't buy it because of your review and I think that's why the reviews are so good it's not this flowers not good but if you're looking to go into the store to buy the best in cookies Ocean Beach is definitely not the best to me in my own if there's any people that like it I'm gonna heavy-hitter so for someone who's not a heavy hitter maybe they like this one this is a 22% flower and it's a hybrid and I talked about the THC not because THC makes the flower better or not better but I would say my experience tells me that the best flowers have between 22 and 20 the most euphoric flowers I'm not going to say the best cuz that's subjective but the most euphoric flowers have between 22% and 29 percent THC once you get below the 22 percent they're not as strong once you go above 29 maybe they're less euphoric so there's some sense of in that but overall I think I've tried a thousand plus flowers so I know something it's like Groundhog Day you lived the same day every day you learn a little bit of something so coming in at number 24 we're moving up the list is the wedding crashers and I looked through my notes on all these flowers and this flower really didn't do it for me was just heady and not really for me but it comes in at number 20 for wedding crashers has 21% THC and it's an indica and we're moving on up next up at number 23 is cheetah piss and cheetah piss has 24 percent THC in its hybrid and this flower got a lot of play on weed entertainment but it's so funny because when I looked online about it cuz I do look a little bit online to see what other people are saying it compared it to cat piss and I also did it in the video and the cat piss was just terrible to me and this one's also down at the bottom this flower has a nice cure tastes good but something something was just okay so it gets number 23 cheetah piss 24% flower it's a hybrid and now we're moving up we have something called sweet tea sweet tea is number 22 and this flower has 20% THC and since its Eva and it was my 22nd favorite of the cookie strains but we're moving on up to number 21 been coming in at number 21 is something called pineapple punch and this flower has 22 percent THC and it's a sativa hybrid and it was funny because you're gonna see there's another flower up here called peach punch and that flowers really great and we're gonna talk about it later but when I saw pineapple plants come on go there's another one but because they have the word punch doesn't make them great this one's number 21 when we're moving on up and coming in at number 20 is a flower called dosey doe and this flower has 22 percent THC and it's an indica hybrid we're gonna blow past this one and we're moving up to number 19 and then number 19 we have something called animal land an animal land has 27 percent THC it's a hybrid and it was my 19th favorite cookie strain and it's funny because I keep a running tab on these I do every time I get a flower I stick it into where I think it should go otherwise over time it becomes a blur how can you remember which one is the best but I'm pretty organized for a stunt person and I would say following these reviews will keep you on the road to better cookie strings but we're going to move on up and coming in at number 18 is a flower called wedding cake this flower has 21% THC and it's a hybrid but we're gonna move on up the list again coming in at number 17 we have something called purple Bubba and Bubba cush and purple Bubba some of these are really good some were just okay this one got number 17 23 percent THC it's an indica I thought this flower was good but there's better and we're gonna see him next we're moving on up the list coming in at number 16 is a flower called gelati and this flower I got two batches of it the first batch was I didn't like it and the second batch I thought was much better and so this found the batches are not consistent on this flower that's why it gets number 16 it's got 19 percent THC and it is an indica and we're moving on up coming in at number 15 we have a flower called watermelon it's got 20 percent THC and it's indica and I think this flower we're starting to get a little bit better right now this flower was good but you're gonna see there's 14 ahead of it that are better than it so number 14 excuse me number 15 watermelon so we're moving up to number 14 we have a flower called papaya this flower has 23 percent THC and it's a hybrid and it was good but there's better and we're gonna move on up again coming in at number 13 is banana bread and banana bread has 30% THC and it's a hybrid but it only got number 13 on the list this flower was heavy but it wasn't more if York and it wasn't better than the ones above it so we're gonna move on up and pass banana bread to number 12 and number 12 is something called millions oh gee and this flower has 28 percent THC and it is an indica hybrid and this flower we're starting to get a little better millionths og was a good one I liked it and we're moving on up to number 11 and at number 11 we are some called honey buns and this flower has 23 percent THC and it's a hybrid and we're moving on up in at number 10 so we finally made it to the top 10 and I would say all these flowers are good but I think once we get to the top let's say five or six it's even better but coming in at number 10 we have a flower called raspberry sorbet and this is one of those laughter's that's got 19 percent THC and it's an indica but this flower is really sweet and it's a wonderful of eight and if you like flavored cookies flowers this one I think on the whole it's one of the best on this list if you haven't tried rounder raspberry sorbet and you like flowers with flavor this is a good one to try but we're moving on up to number nine and at number nine we have something called Georgia pine and Georgia pine is 26 percent THC and it's a hybrid and I got a little bit of feedback and pushback on this flower because you can see I didn't give it the highest ratings I made it the ninth best cookie string and I think that's reasonable I think if you tried all these flowers and you're a heavy hitter you could probably come out with someone about the same so number nine 26% hybrid Georgia pie but we are gonna move up this list and coming in at number eight it's some cereal milk and this is another one of those flowers I had a lot of lore this is a 25% flower it's a hybrid but it wasn't better than other cookie strains and when I do these reviews I'm trying to compare all these things against other the best flowers so we're really cherry-picking the best so to think any strains gonna have all the best it's not gonna happen and cereal milk is definitely not the best this flowers number eight in my humble opinion on the cookies flower list the warm moving on up again and coming in at number seven we're going to have something called sticky buns and sticky buns actually was good they had the honey buns and they had the sticky buns and the sticky bun says 21% THC and it's a hybrid and this flour we're starting to get into better flours this flour was it sticky I think the names appropriate sticky buns this was a good one and it's number seven on the list but we're moving on up and coming in at number six we're gonna have something called London pound cake number 53 and now we're starting to get into the heavy hitters this is a 30% indica flower and this is a nighttime flower it will knock you on your ass I'm not that type person I don't really like the knockout punch flowers but London pound cake was so if you want to get something too heavy late night flower lend a pound cake number 53 wool hits the mark exactly right so coming in number six London pound cake and we're moving up to the top five and at number five we have a flower called pomelo and this is one of the most underrated cookies flowers I really bought this a lot of times and not only did it bite a lot of times I think I bought an ounce that I gifted to a bunch of friends and that's why I have a lot of friends when I travel around they show up in whatever is the best that I can buy at the time I'll buy an ounce and I'll gift turn around and lenda pound cake got gifted to a lot of people this flower has 24 percent THC it's an indica hybrid and I recommend it it's one of those ones it's in the store right now so if you see this video pomelos in cookies and dr. green thumbs and some are so if you get a chance pomelo is a good one but we're gonna move up on the list and dr. green thumbs had a drop recently and this was part of the drop is something called berry pie and berry pie made it all the way up on the list to number four this is a sweet flower it's strong and I gave it the nine which is a very high mark this has 26 percent THC and it's a hybrid and I would say everything up from here is really good flower and I would say the really really really good flower starts here you put mellows in there to top five and but anyway if you get a chance to try berry pie it's strong it's sweet it's a good one and it comes in at number four but we're gonna move up on the list and right now we're gonna stick a little more flour in the straw so you can see we just stick in a little flour just like that and then we tamp we're going to stick this right into the vapor Cup and I'm gonna enjoy it as the winner right so we're at number three right now and coming in number three in the top 25 my best cookie strains is peach punch and peach punch for me was the strongest of every single of the cookie strains it only came in at number three cuz that's not about being strong it's about the euphoria there's something something the perma-grin smile and peach punch was super strong and it was euphoric that's why I made it so up by list this is number three 24% hybrid if you see peach punch it's a winner grab it number three peach punch but we're moving up to number two and number two if you see this and I haven't seen it in the stores lately but this is a really good flower and I bought this a lot of times too and I gifted it so a lot of people got this for me j1p 322 percent THC it's an indica hybrid and this flowers a good one it's bright it's strong its long-lasting if you see J 1 P 3 this is a winner you should grab this flower I like that 22% and it's all that you see it grab it so we've made it to number one and number one is better than all these flowers and we're gonna bring it out right now number one is Gary Payton og he's looking very fierce on the front of his packaging and I would say that when I see what Gary I bought a bunch of this and I gifted it to a lot of people on all my Lots were good but I can see right now they have this flower has 23% it's a hybrid but I can see it's in the store right now with 20% THC and the 20% flower might not be the same as a 23% flower and I think a lot of these cultivations are gonna see as their building's age that it's really hard to keep the high THC because the bulbs degrade the air-conditioning degrades every single thing degrades so you keep [ __ ] to keep everything perfectly clean when you have a new building the leaves are bright you've got everything clean it's hot it's easier to get the high THC Gary if you watch this video you got to make sure that do you boutique-style keep you in a small room make sure everything is perfectly clean because I hate to see this flower go down Gary Payton og is one of the best flowers in LA I love the flowers euphoric it's gives you the smile this is a good one and today we're gonna take you out with a vapor cup hit of Gary Payton og and you can see I've got this cup set to 3:30 I've got vapor in the straw and I'm telling you Gary Payton og is awesome so let's enjoy a little bit it makes a lot of vape I just love this Cup you really can tell the difference in the taste of the flowers and you once you try Gary Payton og you know it's no gene you know what an OG tastes like this is a heavy og taste I love vapor Cup you can see it in vapor Cup calm want to thank everyone from joining in and I want to thank cookies cookies you have great flowers I really enjoy reviewing the flowers it was all respect I know how hard it is to do these cultivations I lived it I know what it is so congratulations to you congratulations to Gary Payton for being the winner again just awesome this is the doctor thanks for joining in let me do one more it's just so good if you want to see LA's best flowers you can see it on weed entertainment com there's so many lists up there really keep you in the land of good flowers if you like the videos please subscribe I'm the doctor thanks for joining in party all my friends [Music]", "o8iF7s66-0Q": "how you doing welcome to dan's boot of bodega where today we're gonna smoke mandarin cookies so let's just get right into it [Music] that's right folks today we're gonna be reviewing riddims mandarin cookies which is a sativa heavy hybrid that's made by crossing form cut cookies which i mean that doesn't even sound like a string that sounds like code for an internet trolls comments or in office managers farts but anyway it's made by crossing forum cut cookies with mandarin sunset with that being said let's go take a look okay first and foremost i don't know if i like this new uh packaging but i can see is how it's not as flashy and probably keeps it out of the attention of the kitties it smells like freshly cut grass and as far as looks go i mean it's got the green spots it's got purple spots red hairs lots of trichomes there are some uh yellow spots here and there that you know made me a little bit nervous but all in all this was a pretty good looking flower and it was it was pretty dense nice and fluffy too what do you say we go taste it all right well here we go mandarin cookies not strawberry slime cheese cheers salute pros here we go sweet and citrusy right up front and then on the exhale it's more of a sugary kind of herbal taste this is really good so it looks good smells good i looks like gti knocked one out of the park the only thing is [Music] it's a little harsh but man even after even after you cough you get that very fresh green tasting uh kind of herbal thing going on it leaves an oily aftertaste but i mean it's good i wouldn't mind that aftertaste all day all right guys well i'm gonna go ahead and finish this and then i will get right back at you with the effects all right guys i've given some time and towards the beginning of the video i described this strain as being a sativa heavy hybrid with the word sativa in quotations that's because well technically it is a sativa heavy hybrid however with the effects i would say this is a perfect 50 50 as the effects completely depend on your current state of mind it starts off as a very euphoric very cerebral and energizing head rush that actually left me kind of dizzy for about five to ten minutes afterwards once i was able to ride out that storm the indica side of this strain started to kick in leaving me not so much with a boost of physical energy rather it calmed the body and left me with a major boost to awareness like i was tuned into everything that was around me yet extremely relaxed making this a perfect strain for meditation to fight depression if you're new to cannabis just based on the initial head rush you may want to skip this one as it takes a little bit of experience with cannabis to kind of get past that initial anxiety but if you're not new to cannabis enjoy sativas or extremely heightened states of awareness this strain is for you all right guys well that just about does it for me here i'd like to thank all my friends family viewers subscribers i'd like to say thank you for the uh steady increase and subscribers guys that means a lot to me uh the comments the likes all of it is appreciated thank you and as always thanks for the view", "Xqi5JUhddyw": "one two three what's up pop peeps it's your girl pop mom 420 and i am back for another product strand review pot peeps you know i'm always excited so today is nothing different but i am like super excited i know i've said that before but today i'm doing a strand review on cookies the one and only cookies pop peeps now i'm pop mom 420 so i you know i ain't trying to brag enough but you know i i don't smoke a lot of strands especially being here in las vegas nevada i've had probably a good 200 to 300 in the last year but i haven't had cookies and and i'm trying to figure out why haven't i had cookies so shout out to burn on the team in california but pop my 420 never had cookies guys so here's the deal so cookies if you know is out of california by burner a lot of us know him from the rap culture he's the cannabis and culture guy i've been doing it for years and i must say californians are a different breed when it comes to cannabis when i say they know that [ __ ] oh my california pop peeps y'all know your [ __ ] i mean y'all been just growing this stuff forever and i'm just always so jealous of that cookies you guys i've seen in california stand in lines for hours before social distance before you know the pandemic you know you guys will stand in lines for cookies a drop of strand and you guys will be out there for hours and i'm like wow i have to get a part of this culture and every time i would go people would be like yo you missed it and i'm like it just came out today thank god bernie and his team they now have a grower here in las vegas nevada and it's called tahoe hydro or the hydroponics company but for sure is taiho hydro company they are out of carson city nevada so they grow there and now cookies i believe is a part of their growing uh family so this particular cookie strand that i'm gonna present was grown with tahoe hydro so shout out to you in the cookies family because now here in nevada we get to have cookies so i'm so excited so shout out to essence right here in las vegas nevada um i went there they seem to be the only one here in las vegas that has cookies strings so and they run out fast so i wound up scooping one up and the one that i picked up is this one it's just iconic to have the blue bag it's just ah it's just exciting so this one in particular pop peeps is called project 4510 um this one was just packaged on 5 18 so it's nice and fresh i wanted to make sure um when i called over essence that they had plenty of them so they had just dropped the batch so i'm like so excited that i got a chance for essence and shout out to essence team they really do me well when pop mom calls so i now have project 45 10. this one in particular is testing 21 we're gonna get into that because we got to go into some of the qualities doing this uh product review it has carol filing this is the terp profile six point four y'all know i love me some cara finally limonene love that 5.1 and it got a little mercy so it's looking like this might be a true hybrid so i'm excited about that and i'm gonna go ahead and get into this it says this is an indoor um flower now i do know for a fact cookies only grow the best kind of buds so i'm expecting that all of this is gonna be great so listen did my cameraman just smell that like seriously as soon as you open this up it's like oh my god like you literally i need a mask to put this on this is gas this is what you call gas people now i normally don't use that terminology because the young folks done ran that term in in a hole but this is gas this is so pungent i just had to get up close pop peeps to let y'all see this thing right here uh smelling of it gives you like the first sense of the high in a way so i like to do that then the next thing i need to do is touch it like i gotta touch it i need to squeeze it i need to see if it stays in shape does it fall apart and this right here is sticky the trichomes and all that good [ __ ] stuff on it so it feels like if i press this in my rising press i would get so much good oil out of this so that's the second part the third part is y'all know what i gotta do i got hot grated about that so we're gonna go ahead and test this out and see what the numbers are on our hot great device and pop peeps if you don't have your high grade you know what i'm gonna say get one now y'all know i'll be playing i don't lie about my high grade that's saying it's 24. am i wrong that's saying 24 now on the back of the package it's saying 21 now are we mad at anybody in this situation hell to the no this is saying 21 my device just said this took this up a whole another three points so we had 24 with the high grade so one way or the other this will knock us off our ass that's all we gotta say it's gonna knock us off our ass so i'm excited because like i said this is my first time ever experiencing cookies y'all know i got my trusty crystal pipe any pipes companies crystal pipes out there make sure you hit pop mom up because you know i'm always looking for a crystal pipe pot peach the reason why i use this crystal pipe because it never lies to me if i actually put a little small bowl in here it's disgusting it's going to taste disgusting when you wrap things up in paper that kind of mask everything so i like to keep my bowl clear when i'm first testing out that doesn't mean that every time that i'm gonna smoke my cookies gonna be out this pipe it's not but when i just wanna do it with friends and right like really just have that intimate moment it's just me and my crystal pike whoa i surrender whoa okay let me just explain what just happened first of all i went to go light it and i only needed to light like a little teeny piece so not having my hip wig definitely went too far but let me say something that that hit is and you know how you have that cough in your chest but it's not lingering in my chest like i got that little piece out that first like initial hit i'm sorry five people i just had to take a second because it threw me off anytime you hit a crystal pipe a bong it hit your head so fast is you ever had something that just took your breath away and then you got it back and you still didn't know what to say that's how i'm feeling okay i get what the rappers are going i get why they smoking cookies because that right there that one hit that's all i needed let me let me do that again cause y'all know how i roll pop peeps i i can't just do it once i got to hit it twice because wow look at my hand shaking jesus it's clean and you know how pot piece i said that gassy smell when you smoke it no gas like it's like where did it go oh that's good um essence can you make sure i get all the cookies from that one because i think that's all i want to smoke is cookies this is okay burner you got me i'm a cookie fan i see i didn't want to jump on the bandwagon because old frappus was talking about cookies and i was trying to do my own thing as pop mom but i think i like cookies y'all i'm a fan of cookies now i am and to show y'all i'm a fan i'm gonna get more of these cookies different ones and i'm gonna do strand reviews on those too i really like cookies okay so let me get back to my point because i i clearly don't know what my point is anymore um shout out the cookies maybe that's just the point and today's lesson is don't doubt burner and his cookie team because they they [ __ ] is quality even with it being in a bag is quality um cookies i do know is coming to a city near you pop peeps this is where you come into effect you have to vote for legalization so you can see cookies in your town i do know on the east coast um in my home town or near my hometown in philadelphia cookies has come to like the dc i think it's new york jersey area so that's exciting for all the east coast people with legalization happening cookies has already put their footprint on the east coast so actually when i go to the east coast i'm gonna see if i can find some more cookies but overall i'm actually impressed and maybe i'm saying this in the wrong way i want it to be unimpressed is that wrong okay even if it is it's high felt y'all i'm being honest i really appreciate this so cookies is definitely going in one of my top five uh as far as their growers um you all know i love a medicine flower and i love glp and now cookies gets to go into that group up there with their flour keep doing your thing tahoe hydro y'all are doing it have you had cookies so before you leave pop peeps let me end this with a question have you had cookies which strand of cookies have you had did you get it in california did you get it somewhere else let me know let's have a cookies conversation because cookies is the culture so i definitely want to have this conversation so pop peeps make sure you answer that question and i'm going to answer somebody live so if you reply back i'm going to go live and reply and respond back to your question or your response so pop peeps let's engage with this because cookies is here this blue is here to stay and now i know why all the rappers love cookies [Music] you", "90i9gwPVILY": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the canvas small ei I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews and our special episode series battle pre-roll were three pre rolls down from trailblazer they've been pretty good not great we've found a winner from these three already now we have one last contender in the ring and it's from tweed I assume TWD it's a pre rule we have sixty point four milligrams of THC and 70 milligrams of CBD so it is six point four percent THC and there's a little bit more CBD in there this is our first one Graham joint of the competition and warning do not drive so let's get back to it Krakauer duty seal see if we can get into it there we go and there is our joint it was the best protected but it's the most bent you will notice top is not twisted off and let's lock that up well the other ones took the tips off this one has it on so I will light it with the tip on to assess it the way it would like that's the raw King size it's been packed down quite a bit again it's a 1 gram joint let's check out what the top material is looking like all right so you can see some different colors you can also notice that it's a little bit dried out it's not a bright green or an exciting green in the hand it smells like old cannabis for sure kind of just a bit like a milk chocolate but you can't notice quite a bit of Keith in my hand actually so we shall see how it burns twist that back on I guess I'll get rid of this crazy tail even though they left it on there which is crazy to seem lighter same lighting process except a little bit of wind now so I noticed one thing right away that it's just not burning that well but let's give you the courage buff and let's go so as far as the burn goes you can you can clearly see how it's changed as far as appealing flavors go there are none it just takes like hot smoke its ran instantly like really badly none of the other ones ran like that this one really ran but you can see why because the air pockets in the bend not as definitely not hand finished or hand finished the same way the other ones were I guess I will fix the run a little bit and keep off and on it it's not easy to pull on it tastes like old wood as far as battle pre-roll goes and the actual need to continue smoking this and the grade that I want to give it I think we can just stop right here so this was tweed balanced TWD balanced THC CBD this was from which lot sorry lot 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 5 4 and of all of them we had a bar set pretty well 7.5 was our highest it tasted pretty good it burnt nice and white and it burnt straight what are we gonna give this I guess it gets 5 just for being cannabis but would I buy it again no I paid this was actually the most expensive joint of the entire battle at six dollars and fifty cents I believe I paid for it or maybe it was six dollars but I think it was 650 and it definitely leaves the absolute most to be desired so would not buy again five points TWD so I'll show you if you want to watch back you can watch the final episode and watch the conclusion and hear all of my final thoughts make sure like comment share and subscribe until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "UlV5EZ6ekdo": "[ __ ] Monday's phone goes crazy on Monday everyone's just working working working ready to get it so my name is Ari and I'm the founder of green house and green sheets go to coffee shops in Amsterdam and we created strain hunters short people what's happening in the marijuana around the equator especially with 204 million farmers we made a brand big in like Africa Europe we are in Canada now and for us it's time now to join the best here in California and make something great together he's being modest 97 98 99 9 yeah and you were one of the first time you came biggest winner ever was with super Silver Haze that's the father of the super Lemon has a project we're going into an hour together it was amazing an amazing plan biggest High Times Cup winner ever so one three and two and nearly six actually [Music] yeah for us it's actually the first time that we're gonna move into the American market it's great for us to be here especially after all the world burn already did here in California setting up all those cookie stores so it's a great platform late flower yeah a flower no yeah a flower yeah we see some nerves my name is Brett I'm the co-founder and breeder for lemonade I was a Santa Cruz grower my dad taught me how to grow and my dad was always about the super strong weed that's gonna knock you out I was young and I wanted to focus more on that sativa daytime wean started really focusing on the sativa line got the lemonade which was like a exotic strain in our Santa Cruz area burner just loved the flavor immediately reached out and wanted to do some work with that and now we're just got so many strains that we've bred if the lemonade and focusing on the sativa and so it's great what you taste eliminate it's got such a distinct crazy-ass that linger that we have lingers for a while just it just spoils your palate so you know it's a game changer shoot my boy tell me about Punta Roja Michael Corleone told me about that in Colombia they had that yeah I have two and manga v-chip Mongol Vic meds I'm a face stop my boy real good hold on hey look I'm with my boy right now who owns a strain hunters in Amsterdam telling strangers told me who tohe malkovich analeigh Monteverde [Music] [ __ ] all that man I came for the bag and the facts so good I had to save me a gram real Doughboy just the way that I am yeah I prayed to the man that I'm safe when I land this is my year don't judge my - you're blowing up that she's [ __ ] with [ __ ] down this one first act up but your boys still hungry don't smoke like this man I swear 20 joints in the air painting on a player life ain't fair pluses we just way too rare no there's not a lot of innovation in the industry right now everyone's money hungry and worrying about the next move for the bread we're trying to keep the flavors on the shelf and just evolution of fire menu is going so it's hella dope to be able to you know connect these two together and you'd oversee it and you know use my palate I think that we take we showed you guys earlier some of the London cello that's one to be one of the ones we want to hit with the super Lemon Haze first and yeah we're gonna document the whole process so just the very beginning we broke bread we had a little meal [Applause] [Music] I wants to throw the same [ __ ] I heard trying to cloud Chaisson with people other people are pumped that we just keep changing it you know yeah it's good there was a lot of different token profiles in that room for sure I want to get something that 130 are the 103 103 yeah sometimes 66 and and London cello [Music] [Music]", "cXOqbbEJSC8": "[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review it's coming to you by cookies the strain is the georgia pie i've heard a lot about it i haven't got to smoke it yet so i went down to burners in merced california it's a licensed cookies dispensary and i got me an eight it is gonna run you uh sixty dollars after taxes it is gonna be around 70 something bucks so it is a bit pricey oh the smell is really good it's very pungent smelly let's get a look oh nice big nugs dense as [ __ ] very dense smells very pungent and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out [Music] as you can see there it looks really good when i was breaking it up it was very very sticky and this is going to run you 29 on the thc and a 0.2 on the cbd it is an indica and how they get the georgia pie is they crossed gelati with cushman's 11. and this is an indoor flower like always and first let's get a shotty in full sensor no sense you know how we do it hope everybody's having a great day morning night whatever time it is that you're watching this review i appreciate everybody watching cheers ah that was a morning scent for me it is 11 a.m i have to get this review out early today oh oh shake it off okay i'm using my other bomb i haven't pulled this one out in a while so cheers let's get up on you then the georgia pie by cookies smells very promising oh trying to get that burp out nope ain't gonna happen all right baby one there we go cheers oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] strain is really good off the first hit the flavor is amazing it's very pungent it gives you that gives me that uh lung expansion i'm looking for in an indica my eyes instantly dropped but like always two for the review these bowls you can't suck them through because they got like little holes in them like ash catchers built in the bowl i don't really like that but this is what it is that's why i just have to blow the ash out because you can't it won't go through it's got a bunch of small little holes in it it is weird okay yeah of the first hit this [ __ ] is really smooth the flavor is amazing um i really [ __ ] like it it is a bit pricey but if you guys are shopping at the cookie store you already know that so but it's very [ __ ] good georgia pie had a lot of hype around it and i gotta say off the first hit it's delivering has anybody ever heard or seen of this movie it's called subspecies or bloodstone well it says bloodstorm but uh the old this is number four the first like one two i think they're called subspecies or bloodstone even not bloodstorm but anyway it's a movie about a vampire you can see him there that [ __ ] movie as a kid it used to creep me the [ __ ] out like i really liked the movie but or it didn't creep me out when i'd watch it but i that guy gave me nightmares like when i was a kid i used to dream about that [ __ ] he had long fingernails and talked real weird come to me father talked real graspy and [ __ ] but yeah i like that movie if nobody's ever heard of it or seen it subspecies it's probably hard to watch now because it was films back in the day and it's like a b b rate horror movie but that guy used to give me [ __ ] nightmares as a child okay let's get the second hit end so we can get the review the georgia pie 29 on the thc let's get it that flavor is just too [ __ ] good i can't pinpoint it but it's it's great that flavor is [ __ ] great it reminds me of like the great good strains from like the alien labs and connected and those flavorful [ __ ] companies that just kick ass on flavor wonder wonder brett wonder brett's great too but today we're talking about georgia pie by cookies and i gotta tell you this is a [ __ ] winner this is one of the best cookie strains that i've had so far if you guys haven't tried it you definitely need to go pick up some georgia pie let's calculate this up price yes it's pricey you get it from cookies it's always going to be pricey it's going to run you around 70 something bucks for the 8. the look and the smell is [ __ ] amazing the these bugs that i got in here were huge dense great looking great smelling when you break it up it's real pungent and sticky the flavor is one of the best that i've ever had from any strain the smoothness is there it does not [ __ ] up your throat at all and the high is definitely one of the best that i've had from any cookies period you know this shit's like gary payton and it's up there it's very [ __ ] good so overall for the georgia pie by cookies and you can get this at burners in merced california i'm gonna have to give it the 8.8 you know there's nothing to hate about this strain the 8.8 if it was around 50 bucks for the eighth i probably would have gave it to nine the only reason i'm giving it the 8.8 is because it's [ __ ] so pricey but it's a great strain if you guys ever get a chance to try the georgia pie i highly recommend trying it i'm giving it the 8.8 that was my review hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] you", "m-lZws7nvrI": "hey bro the content in this video is intended for educational entertainment purposes only this channel is not for children you must be 18 or older to watch with the legal homies of legal age good looks [Music] i don't even know what day it is but we finna get big let us go so i'm out here it's a beautiful ass [ __ ] day out here in vegas you already know i haven't really been like down to this trip a whole lot i went down like a couple times and [ __ ] but um today i think what i'm gonna do because i went to a dyspo and [ __ ] i spent 140 dollars on two eighths a while ago and i still have one of the eights left because i was like if i want to spend that much [ __ ] money i want to savor that [ __ ] so i still have one of these today what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna do a strain review let's go on some cookies out where is it bang bang let's go so i got some sour cream cultivated by tahoe hydroponics indoor flour from cookies but it's just the brand cookies like the actual like i don't know it was cultivated by tahoe hydroponics and i don't really know what the [ __ ] that is but hey it's their own grower that grow cookies brand i don't [ __ ] know i don't really get this [ __ ] it is what it is dude but that just shows you that like not every single cookies batch or like not every brand even like not every brand or batch or strain or flavor is gonna be the same because they're all grown differently that's what i tried to tell people before when i'm trying to talk about blue dream in a different video but let's let's just smoke it let's just get on with it gang all right i'm finna open this [ __ ] up the last one i opened up i'm gonna be real with you i'm gonna be real with you it's [ __ ] like the cookies in cali is way [ __ ] better like i'm gonna just put that [ __ ] out there like when i smoke the cookies in cali it like literally tastes like indoor flower this indoor flower from nevada because i don't know man all nevada is too dry to like really grow anything here so like outdoor so everything they have is indoor all of their indoor flower like everything you buy here is going to be indoor flour mostly and it's really not as great as the cali indoor i don't know that's just my opinion you tell me if you ever have nevada weed man i feel bad for people who like only ever had nevada weed because there's a big difference between nevada cookies and cali cookies is very different like what it looks like that it's gonna be really different it looks good it's like not that it doesn't look good it smells good it looks good it's pretty dense it's like nice density but it's super soft at the same time i'm not really too down with like really soft weeds you see how i just did that you can't do that to california weed at least not all california we because i mean like not all caliweed could just be really [ __ ] dense i've had some trash weed in cali no [ __ ] cap i've had some of the worst weed i've ever had in my life was in cali but it's because you're gonna find an array of everything there's growers that are just like starting off there's so much happening in california it's like a piece of hair in my [ __ ] grinder there's so much happening out there man i don't really know about out here it's so hot here i just feel like out in cali you could be like in la or anywhere and just be like i want to grow some [ __ ] weed and then boom boom get some [ __ ] plants some pots some seeds some soil and grow that [ __ ] outside on your porch if you wanted to i feel like out here it's just too hot it's too hot it does not have the right climate for this [ __ ] out here because it's it will kill it it will probably kill a plant yo was that a seed what the [ __ ] did i just grind up bro yo what i just grind up i just heard like a to god if there's seeds in my cookies bro that's gonna top it off i don't know what i heard i hope it was just a really crunchy stem okay pack that [ __ ] yeah yeah i'm gonna [ __ ] cry i'm gonna flip the [ __ ] out i'm gonna cry bro i just killed a f yo bro i just killed the stupid ass [ __ ] whatever that is and i knocked down all of my everything that's karma instant karma my icing the bongs melting oh dude i'm so tight dude i'm so [ __ ] tight gonna clean up all my weed now off of the [ __ ] ground this is ridiculous oh my god i don't even think i can smoke i'm just gonna pick it up directly off the ground and smoke it so all right guys sour cream strain review coming at you right the [ __ ] now i've been doing enough talking here's the smoking the ice is literally in my freaking mouth first hit he's really good he's not gonna front these cultivators know what they're doing when it comes to taste and flavor the smoke it doesn't i don't know describe it it doesn't have like that cookies punch it has like a punch from being weed but it's not like cookies from like cali or san francisco or whatever like it's not the same tell me you haven't been here bruh tell me you haven't been here at least one time in your life this is the worst and everybody's gonna be like get a vacuum with a sock and blah blah blah and all this crap bro i'm not doing all that right now it is like a hundred and [ __ ] nine degrees out i'm not bringing no vacuum and no electricity out here right now there's an outlet on this porch and everything this is so stupid packed another bowl all right all right floor rips let's let's do it um packing another floor bowl don't judge me guys this is what my life is turned into today and after this i'm gonna go kayaking because i love i love water man you know what you know what i found my place i'm just gonna sit here because i think that if i spill this weed like one more time i'm gonna get really upset so i'm i'm cool with being right here how's everybody's day we're smoking big [ __ ] bowls off the floor vibes too much ice i wouldn't got more eyes because [ __ ] melted down so hard i'm just like sitting here on the floor picking it off i'm so mad dude i cannot believe that we fell big clouds yeah so like this isn't so much of a review as it is a sesh you know me with the reviews i'm not that great but i really like this read a lot even though it's nevada cookies i wouldn't me personally it doesn't feel like cookies but it's still it's still decent weed yeah cookies is like really distinct in my opinion all the strains are distinct this is i feel like if i get the same strain the sour cream strain over in california versus the one i have here in nevada then it will be different obviously because it's grown different but i feel like it would be like 100 [ __ ] different the sun is coming in so crazy this is my life now i i feel like a little farmer all the weed was already plucked from the ground and here i am plucking it again you guys even see this treachery this is like the saddest this is this is what i do i should make like a song about it that's what i got for the bowl everything is off the floor yes sir last bowl let's get it i would say due to all my hard work and dedication this is going to be my last but not least floor bowl it's very nice [ __ ] that bee i love it but i hate it love your species hate you cheers all i know what i say i like this weed [ __ ] yeah uh would i recommend it to others okay i think you should all try i'm pretty damn high i was just like on snapchat for a minute and i went to go like take a video and i zoomed into my face and i started laughing and then i didn't say anything and i just started taking this clip again because like i don't know but i'm high as [ __ ] i i really think this [ __ ] gets you it's like all sneaker rubbers it'll slap you it don't look all that appealing but something something's in the water man [ __ ] up and i also don't remember what shop i went to for this i just really needed some weed when i first got over to nevada and i was like like where can i get weed no like dispensaries near me and i looked one up but i just went to it because there was a whole bunch that popped up so i really don't even know but next time i go i'll definitely let you guys know where i go if i get some bomb ass [ __ ] wheat out here because it's a beautiful [ __ ] place man like i i think everybody should try the wheat i'm trying that's it last [ __ ] rip of the sour cream from cookies yeah that's really

cookies pre-roll go watch the other video this entire finger length roughly half the pre-roll was dumped into the bottom of this i could literally pour out the dust and so what we did here to give the collins aven cookies flower an actual authentic review just at least on the quality of the flower i went ahead massage it out and forced all the weed that was in the top half of the joint on this side i shook it down and twisted you can see how much paper right how much space there really was so man already failed cookies on the quality of this cannot believe i just experienced that five years in the cannabis industry i've never seen a joint do that before absolutely unacceptable here we go the way we do the taste test pre-roll reviews if you guys don't know yet is one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits overall score now again i already failed this product because half of the flower had fallen through the mouthpiece into the bottom of the pre-roll just destroyed and when you pay 18 and then a 30 tax on top of that that comes up to a 25 pre-roll roughly unacceptable here we go still getting scooby snacks because they put literally just dust they just put dust in the whole pre-roll really just disappointed man it's super frustrating all right there's the first hit taste wise tastes like earthy piney gas it doesn't necessarily taste like gelato kind of gas or like a og kush kind of guys but for the collins ab strain it does have a little bit of sweet gassiness to it the ash is kind of light colored so shout out to them for that scorebox out of 10 i'm gonna give this a i'm gonna give this an eight flat it's sweet it's piney but it's not super super super delicious it's not like oh my gosh i really want to smoke this again uh kind of weed quality but at this point they've already burned the bridge because again i paid 23 four dollars for a joint that's just not worth it at the end of the day so overall 82.5 is the final score in terms of this smoking experience if it was a half gram indoor growing pre-roll for like 10 bucks but the reality is is that this is still gonna get a failing grade 20 plus dollar gram joint half of the flour was just gone disintegrated again watch the other video let me know what you guys think if you've tried cookies in chicago please be sure to drop a comment share your experience if you had a similar experience be

giving away some cool giveaways man it's got to be something to deal with weed since this is a weed Channel you know I see a lot of people gonna give ways on the channel man and it doesn't really pertain to what they're doing you don't say it's like if you're if you're a car channel why would you give away phones it just doesn't make sense when you give away something something on cars and why don't you give away something that you already have or something why don't you ask you your subscribers which you should give away you don't understand something like that let's get in here on this ball and see if we can do with my hair wait okay I taste a lot more than cake on that this has 2% of CBD it's 19.5% THC oh this batch is born date was to 1520 you can see all the information right there yep I don't taste let's see what this mix is again because I taste the cake but I don't taste see see that's why there's no kick in it cuz I taste the cake but it's real real model I do taste the Thin Mints I don't taste great pie but I've never had great pots so I wouldn't know where to put that up against you know I don't think I've ever had great pot I'm not a fan of the perps or the grapes or anything like that because those are just garnishing for the meal you know I'm saying that's just it's just flavor you don't really want to have a perp at your main as your main cannabis that you're smoking because you'll only be high for a couple minutes you know I'm saying but I smoked any perp on high for maybe 10-15 minutes the hot starting to kick in on this right now and if you haven't interviewed like I said if you're new to the channel you know that I always talk in between hits to give the high a chance to catch up yes see it's nice to know the flavors that are mixed with the cannabis that you're smoking so you can you know if you put it in your mind with the flavors are you want a brainwashing stuff like oh this tastes like ticks like Pines and bananas because believe it or not your mind is running everything so if you put in your mind that you're tasting bananas and make cookies and [ __ ] that's exactly what the [ __ ] you wanna taste bananas and mint cookies so I try to keep my mind open even though I read it from the internet first you know for you guys I try to keep my mind open as to the flavors but I definitely taste in men I don't know about the UM the what is it the pie what is it [ __ ] the great pot I don't know about the great pie because I've never had it but definitely it's ten minutes it's a good flavor I feel a slight burning on the back of my throat and I definitely noticed a difference of smoking with him thanks again guys I guess the first time I smoked it with him I had a closed mind I didn't want to smoke to him that's what it was because I had been so brainwashed that lighters was the best way to go but lighters is the best way to go to get the party started but you need to him to keep the party going ah now that was a nice mellow flavorful hit I got all the claims I needed our that hit that was beautiful so with that one there on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] Tim being that good [ __ ] we will give the flavor critique of this lava cake by the cookie fam we're gonna give it a we got to respect the LOB we gotta respect the cake I want to give it a nine but I don't taste the flavor of a nine so I'm not even disrespect the channel or disrespect my critique by giving it a higher higher rating because of the name we're not able to eight um I don't know it's gonna be really low eight it's flavorful but it's like you have to search for the flavors although I'm not believing the flavors just a part of the getting high you know I'm sorry you're home doing a lot of talking the flavors just a part of getting home I need a flavor the hi the smell everything let's get in the flavor kicked in on that one guys that was really nice ooh a nice even flavor mmm definitely Thin Mints definitely oh wow there's it deserves everybody the eight that I gave it though now the high the highest really started creeping in I can feel it across my forehead you guys know this is dispensary great when I recommend it to my friends if you guys run across lava cakes give it a shot so far the high isn't really intense I can start feel I can feel it like it's creeping up my nasal and it's like opening up in my head that's what it feels like this is definitely a hit my um yeah this indoor flower - it's really nice it's kind of a a mellow high it's not really intense of course I can go to the beach and frolic in the saying you know I feel like that on flight like 9 out or I don't feel like it's it's curbing any pain but um it's definitely a good but I wouldn't I don't know if I would call this part of the cake fan I don't know why they call it lava cake they should know they shouldn't uh deceived people by putting a cake on it because anything that has a cake gonna I don't give a [ __ ] the cake flavor always comes through always always comes through can you name something from the cake family from the wedding cake family that didn't taste like cake for me lava cake doesn't taste like any of the cake family you know I'm surprised like I said if they named it any type of cake without it being mixed with the cake why would you call it a cake definitely yeah delicious whoa I was gonna blow my nose I was gonna be rude for you guys I'm so sorry one moment please I thank you guys for all your support um when getting my mind right yesterday because I was concerned well I wasn't really concerned I was just thinking a lot about the guy that was hating on me you guys have you were with me from the beginning of the channel you know that there was a hater before that he was just talking mad trash like your bags are fake you don't know how to smoke every time you in here you look stupid all types of [ __ ] II didn't really say that last part but he was just saying all types of crazy I can't remember what he said and I was keeping a 100 with him like thank you for your critique bro I didn't ask for your uh your opinion on my channel but I really appreciate it and then he was like well [ __ ] you won't do only one but I was like I understand your opinion Dawg that's great I invite you to not look at my channel if it makes you feel this way you know if you feel some type of way when you're watching my channel man please don't watch it if I trigger you to do a different drug or if I trigger you to go kill yourself or hurt somebody please stop watching my channel I want to treat anybody to do that and he was like and we went back and forth like a couple days man and then finally he was like you know what man he was like man you gained a subscriber dude cuz he he was intentionally trying to piss me off and it takes a lot more than just your words to piss me off you know you'll infect me a different way you say [ __ ] you n-word you know it affects me differently like damn why would he call me that it ain't like what did I beat your ass today like that's just like why would he call me that I try to figure out why people say things if you don't know me why would you why would you call me out my name why would you say something odd to me what gives you the right to think that I will allow you to call me out of my name without any repercussions you know and if it goes any further then you know this is me working on my anger you guys so if it goes any further my anger kitchen that's a whole new guy you guys don't want to meet him I don't like that [ __ ] man he's an [ __ ] Oh talking y'all so much man I don't let the boat run out we're gonna pack and gifts when we get hot critique of this y'all uh-huh you guys can tell I'm really getting baked because I start babbling a lot you know start talking about some insignificant [ __ ] and say I'm saying but hey that's part of getting high don't you talk about crazy [ __ ] when you get on [ __ ] I talk about everything when I get on but here lately it's all been about don't think you can't talk about man and they're gearing it that way that that's all you can talk about there's only a couple topics that you can talk about in the world right now that everybody's talking about one is the death of black people the death of innocent black people too is a police brutality three is racism and four is Kobe 19 these are all the things you talk about them did you know that if you talk about Kobe 19 negatively on Facebook that they throw a fact-checker on you I mean I was saying some [ __ ] that was that was legit man like I was telling him that they're not gonna really release the real virus until the ball or the winner of this year um I was telling everybody this was a simulation I like that fact checkers hit me I have never had fact checkers hitting me on Facebook on Facebook they can hurry up to that [ __ ] down cuz they want it on everybody's mind they want you because it's a psychological warfare to you guys they're messing with your psychological by by introducing fear fear as a [ __ ] y'all feel make you face some crazy [ __ ] so I try not to subscribe to fear fear can

do another video here and um unfortunately the mailman hasn't arrived yet it's with my stuff so um wait a minute what the hell is that it's the plate of pot and it's got eight items on here and it looks like one two three four pre-rolls and four three point fives um well let's go through them i guess we've got edison ice cream cake we've got weed me mandarin cookies uh ignite crescendo that's a pre-roll no idea what that is scotia lemon dory then we've got canna farms super critical uh silver haze or something like that then we've got captain's choice it's some sort of mysterious sativa blend of pre-roll then we've got another new lp here dixtra green houses i think that's what they call it dixtra something like that um lemon pepper spice and finally we've got ignite gg number four pre-roll oh my goodness this is very exciting eight new items on this plate of pot right in time when i ran out just giving a shuffle here so it's all nice and random super random and here we go i'll take anything except a pre-roll please no no it's the captain's choice oh maybe these will be good i don't know we'll see it's the captain's choice here it is it's the captain's choice sativa blend uh 19 or 195.5 milligrams per gram uh and this is two pre-rolls in here for a total of one g and let's see here united greenery so that's who makes this that's who the captain works for and we've got the date is november the 3rd of 2020 so not too bad not too bad so if you're wondering why i got these four pre-rolls on this plate of pot here um when i made my last order i had like 20 bucks left over so i thought you know what i'm going to get a couple 1g things but there's not many of those around anymore so i thought i'll just get 20 worth of pre-rolls and i tried to get stuff that uh we don't normally see as flower right so this one here right you don't even have the lp doesn't have anything so i mean or the brand that's why i thought it'd be cool this one here for two dubs that are each supposed to be half a gram this went for four dollars and 38 cents which is not bad um for two half grams supposedly half ram joints we'll find out soon first we're going to check out the scale here because uh that's what we're gonna do so like on my last video we're gonna do it a little differently here we're gonna put this on zero it out because somebody suggested this and you know in my mind this would be technically slightly slightly even more uh accurate so here we put that on 50.00 perfect perfect see look at that [Laughter] i guess that's cool anyways let's open this up and see what these things look like and way holy shit oh my god that's not even a i thought that was a flip top i've been trying to flip it like this that would pop open but nope that's the hinge they hid the opening over here somewhere oh boy that is a little bit difficult to open but there we go we got it and hey you know what these are actually out of all the pre-rolls i've seen these are some of the nicest looking the filter isn't insanely huge it's big i would go half that size but that's it's not half the size of the joint like those quest ones let's see what they each weigh with filter because normally we don't check it with the filter oh my god 0.8 that's good what about this one 0.8 also wow that means that these might weigh the proper amount let's find out let's empty these in here and see if it makes uh oh and look at that nice little spiral we'll see if it makes it a gram look at that i just pulled the filter out all nice oh very nice and now i should be able to just just sort of go like this and empty it all here look at that 0.49 i did get a couple tiny little bits out so you know that's that's fucking close oh my god i've never seen one that was so accurate i'm impressed i'm impressed let's try this one i have no idea what strain is in here though that's a mystery [Music] there's a little bit in the tip come on get out of there come on get all of you come on oh my god look at this they actually did it the captain did it all right so i went and got this nice box and i'm gonna check out the uh we'll check out this stuff here with the microscope and see what kind of stuff they're putting inside here see a little stem right there hopefully that's the only one right well let's take a look at it we got this nice box it's black so we won't get a lot of reflection should be all right so one thing i didn't think of when i was getting this box was how tall the box was it's pretty tall i can barely actually know what i'm going to turn the box around and i'm gonna put this thing up on here and check there we go i figured they were so here we are looking at the captain's choice this is what the captain smokes when the captain's looking for a sativa apparently um so you can see some chunky trichomes in there you can see it it does look a little bit like uh it reminds me somewhat not as nicely of but somewhat like shred i i don't know if uh can see some bits of stem here and there you can see some trichomes they're kind of cloudy and chunky looking let's see if we can zoom in closer that's about as close as i can get without it getting all horribly blurry oh there we go a little bit nicer there yeah so that's kind of what it looks like there and you know i don't see a ton of stems i see some little bits of of stem and leaf like you can see right there the big reflection you see all the reflections shining so much off that pretty sure that's a leaf right there and so it looks okay it doesn't look as bad as that one time i got the pedros from color that pretty ready to roll garbage that stuff was horrible but this looks okay it doesn't look as good as shred but it looks okay so hopefully it is okay and i'm gonna go try it and then i'll be right back so i just got in from trying the captain's choice sativa blend oh sativa blend i didn't notice that before interesting at 19 so i first out there when i was trying i thought it was kind of weak but um after a while uh it's sort of sort of a creeper on there and it sort of kicks up to like maybe just below a medium for the high so the high on here is uh it's all right but at first it kind of was like it felt weak but there's a bit of a creeper there and it sort of creeps up to maybe a medium maybe just somewhere around a medium maybe just below a medium to a medium that's kind of nice and it's kind of like uh it's got like a i guess it makes it kind of alert sort of um sort of really awake it's kind of woke me up this thing it made me really um make me feel really awake and stuff i don't feel like energetic or anything but i feel really kind of like i could go and do some sort of physical activities or some shit um yeah so that's kind of all right i guess not that i want to go do anything like that but you know i guess it's okay it's okay it's a nice it's like kind of like um like a clear-headed kind of a buzz maybe not clear-headed but it's kind of it's not a couch lock at all we'll say that and yeah but this stuff is quite dry so i don't know if how it would burn in a joint or whatever there was absolutely no flavor no flavor at all and there was no smell too so that you know that sucks for both of those things unless i guess some people they they like it so it doesn't smell so i guess for you that will be okay but the high on here is okay um the weight i'm surprised actually had the proper weight on here for um pretty much for both of them they came up to well combined it came up to one and uh yeah and it was actually packed really nicely in here it's a probably one of the nicest pre-rolls i've seen so far it was a little bit large filter but it wasn't insane like some of them and as it came out it was all nicely packed it had it felt like there was no hard spots or anything like maybe there would be really good air flow through there there was no no hard spots or anything that was all sort of nicely nicely packed so yeah you know for five bucks and it's okay there's better for five bucks but you know whatever it's uh it's the captain's choice so [Laughter] if you like captains and maybe i don't know who knows i wouldn't i don't think i would ever buy it again but you know i had five bucks to spend and i spent it on this and i don't regret it because there was nothing else available so i would have had to have spent well i would have had to have less stuff so i don't regret it because it just gave me more stuff to try there how old was that i wouldn't buy it again though anyways though that's the captain's choice um this uh seven more things on the um what is that called there so we got seven more things on the plate of pot uh come check it out hit the subscribe button uh in the notification bell it'll tell you when the next um one of those videos goes up and that yeah that's uh that's all there is for this well we'll see you later have a good one i just remembered something that i wanted to add in here real quick because i just remembered it i was just stopped recording but anyways when i was saying there was no flavor in this there was no flavor but there's a little bit of an aftertaste which is not the best aftertaste and it's a taste i know very well and you guys probably know very well it's the taste of when there's a seed in your joint you're smoking it there's a seed in there and it burns that taste it's very unique taste that was the there was a slight aftertaste of that so i don't know if maybe a seed or two got ground up in this also maybe who knows but i did have slight aftertaste of of a seed you know that's unmistakable aftertaste it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was and then when i realized that i was like oh yeah that's that yeah anyways just thought i'd mention that because uh yeah anyways see you later have a good one", "jfx3Zxxtecg": "oh what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today i do got a weed review i got this from cookies it's the limited edition apples and bananas everybody's been wanting me to review it they just dropped it yesterday at burners in merced california at 4 20 yesterday i was standing in line with like 30 other people to get this strain so i did pick it up it smells fruity with some gas let's take a look at it and this is coming to you at 30 percent on the thc and a 0.2 on the cbd it looks really good the buds are real dense it was real sticky when i was breaking it up and like always if you want to see an up-close picture of the bud check it out as you can see there it looks fire as [ __ ] uh thirty percent on the thc it did cost me sixty dollars for the eight after taxes it comes out to 78 bucks at burners so let's get ahead of this this is some this is a hybrid they did not say if it was a indica or sativa leaning hybrid so i'll tell you guys after i take a couple hits how i feel so cheers the apples and bananas oh [ __ ] oh first initial thought it gives me that lung expansion that i'm looking for in the indica so i want to say this might be a indica dominant hybrid it's got an amazing flavor it is gassy it's got a little bit of the fruit in there but it's it's more of like a gassy and it did like hit me pretty hard off the first hit but like everybody knows two for the review and i did a little research on this and the only thing i can find is it said how they made this is it was a cross of granddaddy purple with platinum cookies blue power and gelati so it's like a four [ __ ] strain cross they're starting to do some crazy [ __ ] with the weeds these days i gotta tell you that [ __ ] hit me hard oh you know what time it is i haven't done a straw pedo in a while i've been doing the just the beer bonds but today let's get a straw pedo in i hope you guys are having a great day smoking on something good out there i have done a lot of strains for uh reviews for cookies in the past if you guys haven't seen those you can go ahead and go check them out but there's apples and bananas off the first hit it does not disappoint this [ __ ] hits [ __ ] hard it's nice and it doesn't [ __ ] up your throat i was coughing because that [ __ ] was [ __ ] strong shout out to the kyle homie that are the homie kyle that works at uh burners and blue see i'm all jumbled up today it works at burners in merced california that [ __ ] hit got me all [ __ ] up can't even do a review i'm over here cheers everybody it's been a minute i'm gonna hit that burp out don't want no stealth smoke [ __ ] up my next hit yeah there was a lot of people there yesterday getting this apples and bananas and i gotta tell you all those people that picked it up they definitely got a [ __ ] kick-ass strain because this is one of cookies top strains to me so far but let's get this second hit in so i can give you guys the review oh [ __ ] so far it's got me a cool ass head high my body feels relaxed let's see after the second one cheers oh got my nose running and [ __ ] this is a kick-ass train it [ __ ] hits you just the way you this has to be an indica uh dominant hybrid it's not one of those energetics this [ __ ] [ __ ] boom makes you mellow as [ __ ] you're in a relaxed mode after hitting this [ __ ] seems like the longer you the longer i'm sitting here or after i hit it the harder it hits me this one goes one of those creepers all right let's calculate it up at burners in merced california the price is the same price as every other cookie strain especially when it's a limited edition brand new drop it's going to be 60 bucks and after taxes it's going to come out to around 78 dollars that's just what it is so if you want these strains you're gonna have to pay for it the look and the smell is [ __ ] amazing the [ __ ] looks fire as [ __ ] it smells fire as [ __ ] the uh the flavor is it's gassy it's more gassy to me than fruity and i love a gassy [ __ ] pungent weed and that's what this is to me the smoothness is there it doesn't [ __ ] up your throat at all and the high is out of this world i really [ __ ] like the high and i'm not hyping it because it's a brand new strain or anything like that if it sucked i would tell you it [ __ ] sucks and this is [ __ ] a must grab if you guys ever get a chance to try the apples and bananas i don't know how long it's gonna be out there but if you get a chance to try it try it it's a must [ __ ] grab so overall for the apples and bananas by cookies i'm gonna have to give it the nine i finally broke into the nines this is a [ __ ] nine the flavor the high everything it's a nine it's an even nine i finally found a nine this is a [ __ ] nine it's mighty fine there's nothing to talk [ __ ] about this strain i can't give it higher than that because i know that they're only gonna make more potent and more badass strains so the apples and bananas buy cookies i'm giving it the [ __ ] nine if you guys get a chance to try it try this [ __ ] strain it's killer so that was my review until next time smoking with small town see i'm all [ __ ] up and just because i [ __ ] up let's do another beer you guys are you guys get a treat because i [ __ ] up on my on my exit let's drink another beer because of that so that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town bye",

strains og kush durbin poison and cherry kush it is a 60 40 indica dominant hybrid 60 indica and 40 sativa with fairly balanced indica sativa effects leaning slightly more towards the relaxing indica side girl scout cookies combines the body relaxation of an indica strain with the cerebral mind stimulating effects of a sativa strain it produces relaxing euphoric effects that promote creativity and socialization similar to many indica dominant hybrid strains with these balanced effects it could be used for day or night time relief of symptoms but as an indica dominant hybrid it may be slightly

to go all the way down to Melrose Melrose place to be exact to go hit up the burners cookies to see what all the hype is all about guys there's a lot of [ __ ] out there on the cannabis market a lot of brands a lot of misleading you know if you don't understand cannabis you can understand that your wallet is getting less and less so I'm here to educate you now cookies burner cookies he's been around for a minute he was also in the underground game before he went to the recreational game to get a bunch of what I'm saying is cookies let's see if it holds up to the test I picked up a couple different strains that are only really well how you say it can be found at the cookies locations I'm going to try one of the joint it's and then decide for myself if cookies that's what it takes to get on the baked menu [Music] if you're gonna be spending damn near 70 bucks for an eighth then that eighth better be some of the best dang candy dinky you have ever smoked so let's there you go thanks for the blinker [Music] not people don't use blinkers here how's it going [Music] yo what's up Louie what's up doing here I'm yeah you might like this dude so I went to the cookie store today I had to what I went to the cookie store because because I have we were talking about the marathon og and in the Gary Payton in and all this other stuff and I'm not trying to show you to hate I'm trying to just um like what do we have here we have this is from the top shelf cultivators established 1999 gar gar gar no molt garden moles okay [ __ ] that okay this is the thing it's called it's called white runts apparently this is what the craze is about white runts 21 percent THC all right we have the fire society with Frosty's HP Farms grown by the fire society I had regular runts overrated oh I bet dude um what's up mercy happy Easter to you or happy holiday what whatever you celebrate today I hope it's going good for you I'm just check I'm just showcasing some of the flour I picked up I'm gonna taste test it and see if it deserves to be on the baked menu we got um and thank you very much mercy thank you very much this is cereal milk this is Collins Ave Oh edibles uh I should have picked up edibles but I didn't i'm they did have some edibles there which and yeah i mean it might be good um I'm you know I'm a little um I had a lot of I have had this customer reach out to me oh no it's all it's it's flour just if they put some of the flour and the bags in the in these bags right here this is like the sun-grown flour okay so let me tell you guys the reason why I picked this up is because a client kept asking about cookies cookies cookies cookies well right now all right these eighths are on sell they're $48 they're normally $60 each but they're 48 dollars each right now because of kovat 19 so they're giving them a discount and after I go back on Tuesday I'm gonna talk to the rep at cookies so we can get cookies on the baked flours menu because I guess there's some of the better flour on the market and I'm gonna I was gonna I was gonna try it out with you guys that's why I got a pre-roll joint it's called it's called pancakes and I was gonna smoke a little bit of it with you guys here to see what the hype is all about yeah let's I want to open it up right now and see okay so and these are the exit bags that they give you think about branding right they've Bernhard knew what he was doing keeping the cookie simple okay I mean but but got done well you know what I mean like it's a it's like simple but done well okay let's open it up Lumi I can't wait until we can smoke one bro I hope your day is going good I okay so check it out guys I picked this up for a client and I'm not charging them any fees or anything on top of it you know what I mean I'm just going I wasted my own gas I drove over there I picked it up I spent my money ahead of time and now I'm gonna bring it to him with hopes that when I get the flower on our menu that he just buys it from us so sometimes you're gonna have to go out there and take some risks and you might not get any rewards but that's not true the reward always comes back there's no reward without a risk no risk without reward there's no okay anyway let's go I just opened it I'm gonna take off this glove okay so that way that's right Lily you're the man dude that's what that's what I'm hoping so this is the joint these are my nails that I bite so I need to stop biting my nails but it looks pretty rolled to me I haven't even I haven't even lit the joint yet and you can already taste it okay thanks buddy no uh 12 18 19 it's been a couple it's been a couple months but alright alright and then okay so let's light it up and and and this is for you guys [ __ ] oh so this cost I just touched the [ __ ] thing alright so this cost $16 um but it but it's uh it's four it was four dollars off it normally cost twenty but like I said they're doing a sell that means these cost about $8 whole sell that Archer okay okay okay I'm gonna try it I was just thinking [ __ ] dude this is gonna get me ripped alright guys [Music] all right guys it's dank but I don't know if it's indoor/outdoor 23 percent THC must be some ends well it's a $20 joint Matt you [ __ ] idiot of course it's a [ __ ] indoor joint sorry I just forgot like it do I not do this for work like goddamn anyway it's good um this is called pancakes hey guys what do you think about this you see how they have this little sticker right here it says cookie certified what if baked flowers printed out these stickers that say baked certified and we slap them on every product we carry to show people that it passed our test like like maybe maybe we don't like these like what I'm saying is okay like how you guys appreciate me giving my honest feedback well maybe the products that we carry need to have baked certified on them so when people see them with those of the baked certified sticker coming through Baker maybe it's a waste of money I'm just saying like you know like like somebody else that you trust is telling you that it's good so like you trust it you know what I mean like like it has our stamp of approval tops yeah top shelf stuff yes like top like top shelf stuff pretty much yeah it would be like the the cream of the crop crop you're right maybe not just on anything maybe just on the select few items that are just like the best of the best the white axe you know some stuff is overhyped because you're just paying for a nice jar and that's why it's up to it's up to me I have come across seeds i can't say i've come across seeds in in cookie stuff cuz i haven't smoked it that's why i'm i'm checking out the brand to see if we're gonna have the brand on the menu so far it's holding up the standards but you can find seeds and yes it's it's not uncommon to still find a seed it's like a needle in a haystack but you will find like occasional a seed and it's not a bad thing grab that [ __ ] has a tiger stripe put it in a damp paper towel put it in a ziplock bag put it in complete darkness for four or five days then it's gonna start to germinate once you do that you put that home girl or a home girl inside of a plant I mean inside of a pot with some soil and then you you you do your thing oh wow that's a crazy lookin seed alright umm Wow okay this is um holy [ __ ] I'm getting too baked right now yeah tiger stripes my dude um you should be you should be able to like pinch the seed without breaking it - they're pretty [ __ ] strong you should be able to be like so Thanks thank you buddy I hope you're staying safe out there yet again this has been a I went into the cookie store off of Melrose today a lot of people are saying cookies is some of the best top shelf tree so I wanted to go find out for myself before Oh also I went to go get some stuff for somebody but uh what's the idea if you don't mind excuse me uh III would try it maybe co vid 420 no Co vid for 20 no all right I'm gonna put this back for later movie yes and this passed the test cookies burner I hope you have somebody there on Tuesday when I show back up at your shop I really hope we can get this stuff on her shelf and to everybody watching today thank you for sticking around happy Sunday the cookies brands so far I have so much more to try but maybe the guy won't know that I'm gonna break into his stash you think you'll notice like the runts look pretty damn good them not gonna lie I don't know how you guys can see it with the phone the white runs sorry it's the white runs alright [ __ ] I really [ __ ] off my day already smoked way too much just gonna have to smoke some more maybe some more", "opwV0LO2kv4": "hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review uh sorry i've uh taken so long to to get another one up here okay so today we're looking at uh i'm excited about this one we've got another one from ignite um dan belzerian's company he's i think he's a part owner so this is their sour cookies sitting at 20.4 thc this one was packaged on june 18th so it's pretty fairly fresh sour cookies is a rare sativa dominant cookie strain bread from crossing classic cookies and mandarin sunset said to feature an earthy aroma with sour tangerine overtones that turns slightly pungent as you smoke it sour cookies is said to pack a sharp tangy citrus flavor with hints of rich nutty herbs dominant terpene profile in sour cookies are um carafeline limonene and piney sour cookies is grown and handcrafted by atlas growers in edmonton alberta so they're basically a cultivator who um i think ignite kind of uh gets different companies to uh grow different strains for them uh they source it that way uh if you're looking to uh if you're looking to invest the parent company for ignite is ignite international brands ltd and the uh acronym is bills we'll have that on the screen so i'm excited to look at this here i can't remember if they have a veda pack or a uh integra boost yes they do so there's a big honking boveda pack in here so that's awesome good job uh ignite i really like ignite i hope they uh keep coming out with uh more strains because everything i've had from them so far is really good i'm looking forward to trying out their crescendo which will be the next one i'm doing here so right away um impressive looking buds uh we'll get you guys a good look at that now that we've learned a little bit about sour cookies by ignite the last thing i got to do is test it out for a rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys after testing out the uh sour cookies by ignite i was really really impressed by it actually cosmetically it looks amazing it's really smooth it burned really well effects were really really good on it ash was uh wasn't dark but it wasn't light but it burnt really well and the taste was uh i'm not a big sativa guy but i'll definitely be getting this one again so for a sativa dominant i was really impressed it's got to be one of my favorites i've ever tried as far as the sativa dominant so the taste wasn't like exactly what i'm looking for but it didn't taste bad it was it was a good taste for sure so i'm gonna rate this one in 9.2 out of 10. until next time guys", "AGAZv69OwZ4": "[Music] what's happening guys my name is head and welcome to another strand review Saturday for the CCC 4:20 so we're looking at some platinum cookies today one of my my really favorite strings I must say again I really love this frame cookies is blown up all over the west coast I'm especially here in California where it's from and so I decided to take a look at it for you guys you know show you an example of some cookies out here in California so I'm going to take a nice rip here of the Platinum cookies before we get into the review just to nice and high it nice and plate and taste the strain alright cheers guys I really love smoking out this movie in stereo matrix one of my favorite pieces I have definitely an amazing fire piece super great diffusion super smooth and excellent flavor as well but that was a nice hit the Platinum cookies so let's just get into the strain so the genetics of cookies has been debated you know since the strain Girl Scout cookies hit the scene and this you know there was a lot of debate you know a couple years ago what the genetics actually were and the breeders came out themselves later on and really released the genetics to the public so they could educate everyone you know and sort of clear up the confusion but my understanding of genetics is that it is a strength called f1 Durbin poison that was crossed to a cut of OG Kush called the South Florida og or the flow rival gf1 Durban poison is a cross between Durban poison and a strain called f1 f1 is also a term for a hybrid between two parents you know it's the offspring of the hybrid but here is a strand so the cross the f1 to the urban poison to get the f1 Durban and then they cross that with the South Florida og which is supposedly a really original cut of OG originating back in the 90s so that's what the understanding of the genetics isn't now cookies is bred by a group of people called the cookie fam and specifically I think cookies was bred by a guy named [ __ ] and you might have had some help by a guy named flux but there's a High Times article on it you guys wanna check it out and also you can just follow them on Instagram I'm pretty sure jig as a big mastermind behind the whole cookies project but there's a whole bunch of other cookie cuts floating around in California right now animal cookies dynam cookies Thin Mint cookies and a whole bunch of new cookie crosses that the cookie fan is putting out but this is just the real deal you know original cookies were where the hype all started so this is the Platinum cookies cut of Girl Scout cookies to my understanding I think it's just a bad seed of the original Thin Mint cookies that's someone you know God that a seed a bag and then they grew it out and just selected a phenotype wow I can just say Ralph Everett guys that that tasted awesome really coats your mouth of the cookie flavor stuff to it great but this stuff looks pretty good I mean to be honest this batch of cookies is a lot greener than a lot of magic cookies that I've smoked ug cookies you know it gets pretty purple later on the flowering that especially families but the nugs to but this patches a little greener I did get one nut that is really nice and purple really frosted out so I think that the other green mugs possibly you know a nudge from the lower part of the plant that you know don't didn't get as purple over time just because the cookies aren't purple doesn't mean they're not mom I mean I've smoked a lot of cookies that have been on the greener side and they were just super potent but it definitely has that signature cookie nut structure very tight almost like og but sort of smaller calyxes but totally dense that's one of the main characteristics of cookies it's just just really really dense rock-hard the nuts weigh a lot o has a great nose this stuff you know I was looking at this and some animal cookies and the but tender recommended this I mean I've smoked both of them multiple times and the cookies this plan of cookies is really some it's definitely really some fire cannabis and in terms of the cuts of cookies you know thinman platinum animal I really like the Platinum really it's a dope it's a very doughy phenotype always I feel like puts out a really strong flavor but this guy's is a classic cookie nose I mean you crack the nut open just feel released strong feel I mean that's one thing else you got to look for on the cookies is really oh it always has a really strong fuel aroma when broken down but it's heavy on that dough like I said guys it just it smells like if you're making a homemade batch of cookie dough you know cookies making the cookie dough annular just stick your face and smell the cookie dough that's what it smells like because it's harder to smell it's hard to describe but it's also there's a lot of skunk in there it's pretty sweet as well does have mint in there as well you know there's definitely some mint that's that nice mint undertone this stuff looks you know pretty good definitely is not the best looking cookies I've had but the smell sprayed there when I when I smelled another jar it had a loud double Roma and the effects are strong let's take one more trip here I'm really feel the effects give you guys a good description all right Cheers [Music] well off that rip guys I can just tell you that this stuff has such a strong high for a while now like I said platinum cookie is probably since 2012 has been my favorite strain because it's it's so reliably get it when it's grown well and it just knocks you on your ass every time really one of the strongest cultivars of cannabis that I've encountered it doesn't add and doesn't even to be testing that high it's usually you know 21 22 I think the stuff tested pretty high like around 27% which is hucking a great test but it doesn't has a test high and you know whatever it is the combination the ratios of the cannabinoids this stuff is just hits you so hard really really strong cannabis comes in behind your eyes totally in your head you can just feel it waves coming down your head definitely is a strong indica that really gets you stoned it just smells great when you break it down it's so so dense really great resin production as well you guys can see there and it's got a totally unique smell from any screen you know that that doe enos is totally unique to the cookies so I'm gonna pack another nice script here to give you guys maybe an assessment of the flavor another thing of about the strain is it just gets your fingers so sticky and it gets your fingers smelling like like the terpene profile I'm taking another rib here of the cookies cheers guys [Music] pretty bum cookies later I've got to say I've had cookies that are a little bit tastier definitely have had cookies that just coat your mouth with the Dilla we labor doesn't even taste like smoke and this stuff you know you can taste it definitely is good but it's just not the best cookie flavor but you know I must say I've had a few batches that I could top this but you know some really good looking canvas for sure it was trimmed really well cookies as a strain where it doesn't put out too much families in the first place so it's not too hard to trim this stuff looks really nice though it's just encrusted with crystals you know that's just a typical cookie tray huge heads huge stocks just absolutely covered everywhere if I provide how to give it a rating in CCT 420 style I probably say you know eight eight and a half out of ten just because the flavor is really not something that's crazy or the bag appeal is not as crazy as a some other cookie batches that's why it's you know probably getting to eight out of ten so I'm gonna get some more fire cookies on here for you guys definitely some gelatos some sherbert and any other you know fires California cultivars that I can get my hands on for you guys but let's take another rib here of this platinum cookies [Music] crazy lung expansion oh alright guys well I hope you enjoyed this plan of cookies it's definitely a fire cut of pop-up cookies probably my favorite cut of couldn't use the thin mint and the Platinum are really up there so is the animal they're all great but platinum is usually the one I'm smoking on I hope you guys enjoyed this video stay tuned for much more and stay bait guys peace [Music]", "yM8uFHDSZtI": "[Music] Digital collective what is going on welcome to the show folks today I've got a really nice bun to talk about but before I got into that I wanted to make a quick statement about my green screen green screen is what it is to be honest with you it's a bit of a pain in the ass it's absolute pain in the ass this is definitely some sort of like evil sorcery devil finery it's not a normal thing and it's not easy to work with I do not have the proper lighting and this is my bootleg attempt to throw together a green-screen whether it works with all this or not I don't know but that's the reason for the more close-up shot of yours truly I'm still trying to sort out the lights the shadows like I say this is not made for normal people this is like science and wizardry to be honest with you this all this stuff is just like it's mind-blowing so back on the topic today I wanted to talk about a bug from the company grass roots grass roots I liked a lot of what they have to offer across the line today's Bud though is garlic cookies now garlic cookies before I get into it um I may have tried this before I'm not sure if I reviewed it or not I don't know but this bud has a 37.4% THC a and a 3 oh and a point seven on the THC so this is an indica dominant hybrid that is very and it hits in more ways than one and as I mentioned this is from grassroots I believe I had a quick pull up garlic cookies as a heavy a heavily indica dominant hybrid strain ninety percent indica 10 percent sativa created through crossing the potent Kendall crossed with Girl Scout cookie strains garlic cookies has a flavor that light the name suggests is reminiscent of garlic with a light cookie Diesel effect upon and then I would have to click on it but we're not getting into that and that was from leaf Lee I'll try to put the full description of what I just read down in the disclaimer feel free to click on the check into it yeah so um where else we had on that garlic cookies let's get a quick smell one you're not going to be able to hide this weed this weed is very pungent the the smell one it is I don't want to say overpowering but for this small amount of weed I have it's it's pretty bad the look on this the look on this I mean it just looks like a funky bullet it is covered in crystals in a thick layer of funkiness but it's not super crystal e it does have crystals but I would more or less say this is a bug that looks like it's sick in some fashion like yeah like a normal but it caught a cold and just you know is on the process of turning caustic that being stated this is one of the better bugs I've had so we're gonna grab off a little stretch of this and see how it goes yeah I can't say it smells like garlic but there definitely is a skunky easily kind of smell to it I got this grinder to from I'm not sure where the place was called it's a Millersburg behind Popeyes I am giving them a shout-out because I shop there frequently and they take care of it they take care of all kinds of things normal grinder but it's got this window on it that pops open I don't know if we could see that anyways yeah it's a little door magnetic so you can kind of use this as a bud dispenser you can keep weed in it and use it as a container if need be it's not airtight so we suggest keeping a lot of weed in there but yeah so speaking of that place of the bomb that I'd be using for today is actually uh hell it's the two-part setup so let me grab that real quick when this is dumb okay so this poem I got from the same place I just mentioned I honestly don't know the name of it I want to say it's tobacco related but this bong I got from that place now the the beverage is obviously this is a Stella R to use however [ __ ] you saved it's European and this is a cider bottle but the thing on the top drops down in there and I get these killer rips on this thing so that being stated yeah that's what we're going to use to do this little process here I might lean down off-camera to hit it because YouTube I know it's only a matter of time before my YouTube channel is completely gone bullets here I'm gonna do what I can to try to uh yeah and a message to other content creators that do a green-screen or are thinking about doing green screen if you want my opinion instead of just spending the however much money on the drop cloth I would instantly just go for the one hundred and twenty dollar up to like the two or three hundred dollar set up that has the screens both green and blue as well as the lighting setup yeah so garlic cookies from grassroots yeah that's why I like these kind of this is just like a chill that I've worked some parts on too but all of its airtight I love these pieces and like I say if y'all want a tutorial on that write it in the description and I'll try to get in order yeah and I also want to thank everybody that tries to offer me buds there was like a white sour they wanted me to check out the place that I go has a lot of buds but they don't have a mole in fairness so I'd really appreciate it and I do want to check out these buds I think strawberry cookies might have been another one so thank you all so much and um yeah if I see these buds I'll get them but today I've got four or five already so thank you much respect Oh lighters Oh oh that's really good that's really good like I say this is more of a nighttime bug but overall I really like it it doesn't linger on the it doesn't linger as much as I would imagine it to in the mouth now it was a fairly smooth toke to the majority of the bugs that are this high in THC I don't know if it's the drying process or what goes wrong with them but a lot of times they're a little bit more harsh they're a little bit more yeah just like a more solid strike to the back of the fruit for this being 37% thca this was actually a really good bug it was smooth I could definitely smoke a joint of this I got just enough left for a joint and it's almost time to go for a walk anyway so - and - yeah whatever anyways oh it's never good at math so yeah if I had to give this an honest rating across the line call yeah this hands up it has almost every marker that I would be looking for in the bud I like the smell I like the taste and I like to consistency and to be honest with you this is an indica and I've gotten the question before as somebody that reviews a wealth of problems what is a good bud you know like what does a strong hitting butter does THC really matter it does matter in my opinion more importantly though than the THC rating I look for the indica versus the sativa and if you can get that good indica because like I said I got a high tolerance I did get a feel that whole experience I felt the whole thing I felt yeah you know what I mean that was just one hit now in fairness I do you could hide the entire time I do other things true so but that being stated this definitely put a little bit of a you know what I mean it's just a little step but I felt it and I'm sure if I hit it a few more times they would just gradually step me back into not wanting to do much else yeah so honest opinion on this product I would give this I don't want to say a 10 out of a 10 but you know what I mean I'm gonna be honest with you and I might get some hate in here but I'm gonna give it a 9 and a half I think even the price was a little high but I mean for that price for what I'm getting here and what it does for me personally I'm going to give it a nine and a half garlic cookies from grassroots high five and um I think I already high-fived them once on Instagram if y'all follow my instagram my instagram is the same set up Maryland marijuana review with no spaces check it out hit me up it's a good way to communicate back and forth I post a lot of pictures on different things um I got my for jumpin run and I'm going to give another shout out but I found the place in Mount Airy that got me some steel I believe they're called Wally's I'll have to double check on that but I'll give them another shout-out when I do the rest of my Ford's video nonetheless folks I do appreciate everything that you all do and I really appreciate the camaraderie back and forth in the comment section so whatever y'all are getting into I hope you do it well and do it safe yeah high fives folks Steve Stephenson over and out peace you", "z_5Ee9if-5s": "I've got another exotic strain today guys ever heard of mochi if you all don't know you're about to find out coming up [Music] hi I'm strings and this is trains the bay if you're new here I review strains around the Bay Area I also have a second channel where I pretty much do everything else which I'll link in the description down below if that sounds someone yeah if that sounds like something you'd be interested in which I'm sure it does consider subscribing and hitting that Bell button to be notified every time I release a video and our goal for every video is 15 likes but I think is very possible so you can go ahead and do that now or whenever you feel like it and hey at any point during the video check out my links and show notes in the description if you're looking for bonus pipes or any other accessories such as those you can check them off down there and I'll link them down there so go ahead and check those out thank you guys very much so mochi is actually coming from the cookie family lineage so you guys know that it's genetics are top-notch its parents are actually sunset sherbert which I did a review on and Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies if you guys didn't know about those those two are equally standalone strains cuz they're great on their own but combining them to just kind of unheard of it's it's almost unnecessary it's kind of crazy to be honest with you this train is an indica leaning hybrid so you got to keep that in mind when taking it in or smoking it because yeah it might slump you out and make you pretty stoned so if you're looking for something to pick you up and really motivate you and boost you for the day this is not that strain yeah and as you guys can see the buds are incredibly dense they're very beautiful and have great great awesome appearance as you guys can see there's a bit of a purple color to it as well there's Jade green flowers and really really bright red hairs so this is a good strain if you're really wanting it to treat moderate pain and stress relief um it really does give you calm and creative vibes so if you really want to chill out this is that strain for you mochi is also known as gelato 47 or more to gelato so if you guys see any of those names just know that it's the same thing it's mochi alright some of the effects you can be expecting to feel on mochi are to be sleepy to be relaxed to be happy to be hungry and to be tingly as well some medicinal benefits are to treat depression to treat insomnia nausea cramps and lack of appetite some negatives are dizziness drowsiness anxiety dry eyes and dry mouth so make sure not to smoke too much because like I said this is a really strong strain leaning towards the indica side so you don't really want to smoke too much and the flavors you can be expecting a taste are minty flowery and pungent alright guys it is about that time I'm about to grind this up so if you have any bongs pipes blonde spore joints or anything of that nature go ahead and pull that out so we can smoke together so let me just grind this up real quick and we can go ahead and do the smell test [Music] alright guys it's done grinding so I'm gonna give it a quick smell see how it is Wow goddamn that's encrypt well it's actually a bit flowery to be honest with you guys it's not super gassy but it's a different kind of a smell a little bit fruity to be honest with you guys as well so I'd say flowery and fruity but very very pungent it is a strong smell but Wow credibly nice Wow yeah nice he just smells like candy actually it smells like tropical starburst that's exactly what it smells like it smells like tropical starburst tropical skittles something like that 100% so go ahead and check this out this is great the smell man even though it's not a gassy smell like I said I really enjoy this one this is a 9 out of 10 seriously this is a really new interesting smell for me so tropical tropical fruit flavors that's exactly what I'm smelling this is great alright guys I'm just gonna pack my bowl and take this hit so you guys should already have yours out by now and if you don't hurry up and pull it out cuz I'm about to hit this in a second all right guys here you go as you can see a pretty decent sized bowl so this is what I'm gonna hit make sure you guys have yours out and let's do it together alright guys Cheers [Music] alright guys I'm gonna go ahead and start the timer right now and right off the bat it's a little minty and extremely flowery and like I said it did smell like tropical starburst but the taste is not there at all it's more flowery and minty like I said but it doesn't negate the fact that it does taste good it tastes incredibly good I'm gonna give this a taste of solid 8.5 out of 10 it's not gassy like the og like I really like but good flavor is good flavor so yeah more minty and flowery than gassy and fruity but if that's your preference man this is far for use okay it's great I can kind of feel the the indica effect starting to creep in getting harder to talk now my thoughts are getting a little bit more sedated it's getting harder to think and getting harder to put my words together so when we just relax for a second and which I can interview alright guys it's about two minutes and 30 seconds in and before I forget I just won't let you guys know I got this strain at Secret Circle this is one I did not have to pay for myself again so thank you very much Freddy for that I'm gonna link their stuff down below they are my favorite delivery service in the Fremont's last Union City area I've been going to them pretty recently within the past couple of months but I do go to them consistently and I do actually buy flour from them just not this particular one so thank you again Freddy if you want to check them out go ahead and check my link in the description below and you can go ahead and order from them if you are an MMJ patient in California all right guys it's about three minutes and 20 seconds in so far and I can noticeably say that my brain is fried it's getting really hard to think I've made several takes of several of these scenes already because I've just been messing up so yeah definitely this is not the strain to take if you have important events coming up if you have to do a speech if you have to be you know in tip-top condition when you're talking to people yeah this is not for you it's even just talking to myself is pretty hard and really good in the constraint I can kind of feel the relaxing effects on my body starting from my head down it's really heavy on the shoulders right now everything else is not too bad but just sink it into this chair definitely a really strong in the car so if that's your thing this is the stream for you all right guys it's about 4 minutes and 25 seconds in right now and I think I'm gonna cut it off the effects are still slowly creeping up although it did hit relatively fast it's still kind of creeping up so although the effects are fast hitting it still does creep up a bit so keep that in mind when you do take this train and don't take too much because like I said you don't want to get too high this is definitely stoning me out I hope you guys enjoyed this review if you

this is a big beautiful bun of something called pancakes and it's from cookies which is a very famous California cultivator actually they're nationwide right now actually really worldwide there are a real powerhouse in flour and I have all the respect for that it's not easy to do that and congratulations to burner and all this success and we love trying his strange so this is a big giant butt and it's really nice when they give us a big jump but and we're gonna load this big giant butt right into the vapor cup so you can see I've got a little bit in the straw already but I'm gonna add in some more there we go and then we're gonna tamp boom boom boom and we're gonna stick this right down into the vapor Cup and what it does it releases the water vapor doesn't burn anything it just releases the water vapor so you get more of an incense experience but you can make a lot of clouds by turning up the heat I use it 330 degrees was just a low temperature because I love the taste it's incredible if you hear people talk about the terpenes that's where the terpene the taste profile is incredible out of a per cup so cookies comes in this packaging and this package yuuka-san some big pancakes on the front and this flour has 19 percent THC and it's not high THC but what makes it kind of unique too is it has 13% CBD which is a huge amount of CBD and so let's see how everything works together the Terps the CBD the THC let's see if it's pancakes is the best so we've got this cup set to 330 we're looking for super euphoric flowers so let's check out pancakes by cookies there's a very smooth flower very smooth just like a powdery weedy taste it's a soft weedy taste so I used the word powder because it's really light like powder this flan was a hybrid I got it at dr. green thumbs I love trying new cookie strains so what did we think of pancakes we're looking for the best cookie cents a whole huge line of strains well where does pancakes fall into place I would say I'm giving this flour an 8 to 5 it was this smooth day it was really enjoyable had big buds but it wasn't the most euphoric to me and actually I didn't even think it wasn't strong it's okay if you want to try pancakes go right ahead it's in the stores right now but for me there's other strains of cookies that I like better thanks for watching I'm the doctor I hope you liked the video if you want to see

"YrmZwVsrUTs": "welcome back to an iced mocha video with me your hosts Tyler Greene in the video today I'm gonna be doing what I do each and every Wednesday which is covering another cannabis strain for your enjoyment this week I had a strain which I've been excited to try for a while this is animal cookies it is a cross of Girl Scout cookies and fire OG and apparently is a bit of a strong one so without further ado join me for this week's cannabis strain with you exclusively on the ice moment YouTube channel really really excited to try this this is imported from the US I'm not sure what part I don't want to say California without known for certain pick up holy ground boys and I am looking forward to trying it out as always what I'm gonna do is cover four things about this but that is the appearance the smell the taste and the effect we're gonna get into it this is a hybrid Australian what I am looking for is a really powerful cookie strain looking at this but in detail is really frosty but not in a sparkling or a glistening way the bud is looks like it's just been covered in dusty trichomes the pistols are really not a parent at all they're wrapped around in within the Tri phone coverage the bud itself is really sort beefy really compact and dense that's probably gonna grind out into a fair bit coloration is a very light green dusty wire and the trim job has been done perfectly there aren't any bits here that I can get off it just looks quite different to some of the other but that I get it looks like it has been imported the way that I can usually tell is by some compression happening when you squeeze it all together and that does damage the or change the look of the the bud a little bit to me this has got the sort of look to it that I would expect from imported but as you can see it is a nice looking strain guys now covers the look next we are going to go into smell off the animal cookies let you guys know the whiffs that is giving me myself little smell I'm getting like this sort of cookie smell but it's got something else different in with it now it's difficult to gauge I think I need to break this open a little bit mmm maybe even grind some up to get really good idea at the smell of this animal cookies this is one that as I have been opening up the crop jar and just checking on it making sure it's okay it usually gives a really nice sweet [ __ ] and it's difficult now because I've had it open in my hands for a while that sort of disappeared a little bit so I'm gonna try and grind some up you guys know how it smells it's got very similar smell to the Girl Scout cookies it's reminiscent of that cookie smell more for me I haven't tried fire OG so I'm not sure I've had plenty of Wi-Fi OG which is white fire OG but how don't think I've tried to fire Reggie so I'm not sure how much of that site it will take mmm lovely cookies is the main thing I'm not sure where the animal comes from to be honest I'm just getting the cookie smell but it is obviously completely different color to like the blue cookies and it is a completely different color to the Girl Scout cookies that I tried out in Barcelona not a particularly strong smell er at the moment I might add is by no means filling up the room with that scent now I wonder whether that's potentially because the age of the sample but I am not quite sure interesting stuff of course we're gonna know a lot more about this bug once we get some incident bomb I have with me today the wheat star Vasavi line bomb discontinued that gave one of these away a couple of weeks ago to a very very lucky Teresa Nelson so congratulations once again this is quite quickly becoming one of my favorite glass pieces and today I'm gonna consume some of the animal cookies through this bottle this is the part where if you want to smoke along vapor long dab along you can get your bongs ready get it joints rolled need a breeze heated up and join me for this one as we go through to the rest of the animal cookies that you guys know how it's tasting and what the effects are see you on the other side guys Cheers has a really smooth bomb and quite a significant lack of intensity there when I was able to one can shave it all in one hit and to not ferrule like it was too much so that was actually really nice through the wig stylist I'll be lying bum how did it tight so I got a bit of that cookies taste coming through through the bung it wasn't particularly over a parent it wasn't something that was in my face but it was very smooth very nice taste in and I actually did get some of the flavor of the cookies coming through wow it was a bit in descript it wasn't anything that particularly stuck out it was enjoyable to consume through the balm which actually is still better than quite a few of the strengths which may become a bit too much intensity or don't taste right or aftertaste or taste gets lost it's not something that's left a particularly strong taste in my mouth at the moment and it isn't something which I could picked out from a lineup if I'm honest but it isn't bad tasting it's a nice strength to see now I've sort of left it in the pop chart for a pan I'm opening it I'm getting really nice a really nice sort of an almost less sweet cookie smell it slightly sweeter than the other cookies that I have smell it's not as nice as the Applejack not as nice as the object but I had from the US in my opinion the Applejack was a nicer smell and taste so far but I am NOT somebody that goes crazy for cookies I do like cookies strange but I wouldn't say that I particularly and so the highest bathroom compared to other strains they are nice and let's talk about the effects of the animal cookies guys this is a hybrid strain it is one which should give feelings such as happiness relaxation creativity that sort of stuff I love hybrid strains I love it when they hit you just in the middle and often you do find that they've taken on the other so I usually feel more uplifted or more chilled out as I talk to you the effect of the animal cookies are kicking in now and Wow is a strong one I am getting fantastic feelings of relaxation watching over me notably feel nice time just sitting in the chair good and I am yes I feel full effects at this strain I like the animal cookies guys but keep doing this to myself as much tolerance gone down my doing bonds that are too big and keep [ __ ] myself up quite a lot on the first hit this is great but yeah I can certainly feel the I'm stoned that's the best way to put it feeling good feeling relaxed and yeah feeling pretty happy about it I would put this on a very sort of high end of the spectrum in terms of how far that gets you one bong here I know it was my first bump it but wow that's taken me out of the game for a little while gonna go in Chanel in a bit I'll group what do I think about the animal cookies it is an absolutely potent strain across the Girl Scout cookies and fire roti one bond of it has left me feeling [ __ ] and I'm a bouncer here number one and yeah it's a strain which I really really like now in terms of the look it really compact and dense and dusty see it been imported in terms of the smell of it I'm getting a really nice cookies smell but it didn't come for it too much until I shut up job for a while and opened it up in terms of the taste didn't come for a lot but what did come through was enjoyable there wasn't that intensity there and I want me to do a nice big here and yeah in terms of the effects it has left me like this which as you can see in a pretty [ __ ] wood I smoked the animal cookies again I certainly would is a strain which I am now gonna be on the lookout for because it is a potent one guys what did you think of this review let me know in the comments and I will be back with another strain with you very soon guys have a great rest of your week and keep token [Music]", "Juedj9_iWiU": "first of all where you get it right and talk about something ain't never played basketball in his life he got an opinion that's all he got he got an opinion gay plus or minus whatever then you get out there and play and see if I bust your head wide open you know I'm saying I tell her I'll tell her any any reporter come play me there and I'll bust your here why did the white meat what's going on guys speedy morman here from complex and the guy sitting across from me you may have seen him before you may know him as Gary Payton the second pops you may have seen him on the pack of the weed that she rolled up last autumn as the glove he's an NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton is in the building admission my weed it's the way we always got a dance like that make you know that thing is hot too so fight yo I heard you here but I'm glad you got me here boy you got me set out over here so you got the old school GP and in an old school G but it's all good we only do that for people who are in being hold of Famers if you're an NBA all-star even nine times that's not enough but if you're a Hall of Famer then you get this tapestry man well and I'm Bank I'm not Hall of Famer so I'm good so we'll talk about NBA all-star stuff in just a second however your son is killing it right now has that feel not only to see him continuing your legacy but doing his own thing and making his own as well well you know what as I look at my son and the things that he went through you know thinking that he's gonna get drafted didn't get drafted and then all of a sudden you know going through the journey that he's going through right now I'm glad that the Wizard and finally stepped up and said yo let me get this kid what they don't want to where people don't understand is my son is not like me the Wizards for really understood that they made a choice they gave me a guaranteed contract now he's out there killing it when a kid can come in and for four games and get 17 steals is incredible you know what I'm saying and you know he's very athletic he's he's very long more athletic than I was and I'm proud of him I'm very proud of it but I lead him to herself you know I'm leaving to herself I'm a surprising in one game this year no I don't want to take the shine from him I'm gonna surprise him a little bit let him get that little shine on and and hopefully that you know I this can take off from here and he becomes somebody for sure now there aren't that many father-son duo's that pan out in a very successful way you are now I guess one of them how often do you keep your eye on some of the other father-son do us like maybe LeBron and his son or D Wade and his son you watch that no I really don't know get into that because we all fathers men and let them do what they do they've been talking about this LeBron stuff about how he be at his son's games and he's going crazy why not if he wedded LeBron you wouldn't be talking about him at your I'm saying I like what D way does he stays away from his son a little bit he doesn't take it as far as you know if you think about it how many superstars sons have been really really great not many not many superstars not superstar right there you go I don't think it's been one I don't think it's been one you know I'm saying we got to think about it superstars sons there's not been one I don't think it's been one at all I can't think of that there you go hey you know so we can't say curry because his father wasn't a really really a superstar we can't say clay cuz his dying son I started daddy wasn't really really a super strong it so that's how we got a we got to understand that and LeBron would be the first if his son come up and Andy way would be the first if he's uh and mine if he could pan out in the next couple of years so you know it's a lot to follow a Hall of Fame's dad that's a lot and then especially to be named after him you know I'm saying that that's a lot you were the only player I think still the only player in your draft class that is a Hall of Famer why do you think that is you know whether speedy I don't I can't I can't put my hand on that you know I'm saying Derrick Coleman could have been Chris Jackson was like move a roof right now but it's it's a god-given in the god-chosen domes and then nobody really know nothing about me you know I'm Shannon I became the number two pick and I was met I was all-american in college you know nobody knew about me coming from Oakland and in the town where they didn't know and then I go to a small school you know as Oregon State but it happens and it's just something that just happened because all of them guys were great basketball players and it's just something that I pan out and I became all of thing does not practicing or practicing less lead to a longer NBA career I remember hearing something about you mentioned it to someone yo listen if you want to play longer just practice less well that would that would that was working for me because you think about it as you look at what I did I played 82 straight games for six straight years in a row then that takes a wear and tear on your body and especially if I'm playing at 42 minutes a game out of 48 I'm only sitting down 66 minutes the injury's was coming but I was playing through the injuries because that's just the way I was you know I'm saying if I sprained an ankle or I'm not gonna tell you about it I'm gonna go back there and tape it up imma being in a training room all day every day trying to get it right they made up a chamber for me where you suck on action up and bring him your muscles back that was the way I did and I really didn't care about it but nowadays it's a mandatory now that you don't really practice like that they only can get you for two hours on the floor and then everything else is over so I don't understand why are you so tired what you're tired about now if I go back to back and I played two and a half hours in one game and I'm only really playing thirty minutes and then I come back the next day and only play two and a half hours again and only play for thirty minutes so I'm playing sixty minutes out of what is that 96 minutes so I'm not really really tripping so I'm missing 36 minutes somewhere so where can you be tired you know I'm saying so all this load management crap your arms play basketball man you're getting fifty million dollars a year so what you know go get your baby on the plane or something you know so I don't really get that but that's just the way it is in this era so that was my next question the load management you think a fluke like I'm done with that what are you lobe managing for they don't have double days no more they don't do none of that we don't have two a days in practice it's a mandatory that you only be on the floor for two hours two and a half hours you can't do this you can't do that it is what it is but this is like I said this is their error and this is what it is what makes it happen but the only thing I I'm tripping off of is that a lot of them are getting hurt more I see a lot of more basketball players getting hurt them and I don't know understand why that is we have to we have to do a study all know that you know what I'm saying is it because you're not lifting weights more to back you make your muscles stronger because you are playing a lot of basketball all year round right or is it that you know it's something that is the body is not the same you know I'm saying it's a different body you know Sam being younger don't understand how to take care of you like I'm curious as to all your opinion on these new self-proclaimed experts who speak about you know NBA analytics and you know the plus and minus and things like that does that mean anything to you a person who actually played on the court versus these people who have never played the game speaking on man first of all well you get it right and talk about something they never played basketball in his life he got a pinion that's all you got you got an opinion plus and minus whatever then you get out there and play and see if I bust your head wide open you know I'm saying I tell her I'll tell her any any reporter come play me there and I'll bust your head why do the white meat you know what I'm saying so that's what I tell them and they always think they know everything you know I'm saying you don't know nothing you ain't been out there all you do is watch a lot of basketball and you see us run plays so now you know about the game and then you ain't never been at that level ever in your life and you gonna talk about oh he's gonna be there he'll be you don't know what they gonna be you know what I'm saying put some sneakers on in there and try and let's see if you can do it you know Sam so that's why they really mess with media people during the time because they always want to critique you about what you're doing I'll be like man shut up you know what I'm saying cuz you really don't know nothing you know I'm saying you're just going opinion about anything that you do so I'm cool with it you know I'm saying but you know other than that if you ain't played the game shut up so when these experts say things like oh but when he's on the court you know he's - a door that means nothing to Gary - that don't mean nothing to me because the simple fact is is because you having a bad game you don't do assists or whatever your job is to make your team better and to make everything around you better you know if you struggling you're not gonna keep struggling why you in the NBA they picked you for some reason and they keeping you right and then when you look at these guys who made five or six points a year and then all of a sudden we give them a contract four years eighty million dollars they must be worth something you're all I'm saying so the plus/minus ain't doing nothing for me anyway because the office ain't really telling you not in any way cuz they awarded you with 80 million so in you only out of seven points so what are we talking about so plus minuses don't mean nothing to me that don't mean anything to me if you can make your team and do whatever your role be on that team be ok and you're fine no I'm saying it's about what the organization thinks about you and what they think your evaluates to that team and they're you good what was the best moment of your career aside from winning an NBA championship would you say the Olympics when I'm which one both of them really the first one was a major one because it was in Atlanta if you think about it if you get honored to be wearing a USA Jersey and we think about what's going on now in the world about people over in Iraq everywhere else dying and getting their legs blue off and to represent the USA to give us an opportunity to stay over here safe and play in these type of games and we're doing it for money and for free and they're there giving it and from the literal of nothing and they're getting hurt and getting killed and shot at and you think about how much is that a prayer a privilege to do that that's a privilege so when I bowed my head down and they put that metal over my over my head and I got that USA on my chest and I got millions of people watching me that's a bit that's a pleasure that's honor because I got other people that's protecting me that ain't getting them medals or honors all the time they get a medal as if something happened to invited them home right so we got to think about that and we got to understand that that's a privilege for us to be doing that and you felt that twice when they put their gold medal Weiss and and and then you know to become their know that we're the world's greatest we knew that from day one you know we just had to go out there crew obviously everyone knows Gary Payton for the trash talk I wonder though have there ever been times where you got into it with fans maybe celebrities that were sitting courtside yes I got it toward everybody I didn't care who it was if anybody opened their mouths you'll get it were there any celebrities that come to mind or stick out celebrities knew what's happening they don't know what they don't want to get out like that because you know that we got to go to the club afterwards we don't have a problem I'm saying I don't care about no bodyguards and nothing like that cuz I had a lot of bodyguards a lot of dudes from missoula hit me so it was all good so I didn't really worry about that and they knew I wasn't about all that talk you know once we get in the club it's gonna be on you know what I'm saying so I didn't care about no bodyguards and all that none of that cuz I had some dudes from the streets I was like bodyguards to them we didn't have to do all that obviously it's a different era where players are a lot heavier on social media no such thing back when you play at KD and Kendrick Perkins getting into it I know you've seen it what do you think about the whole Kendrick did what he wanted to do he became he became he became a blow-up icon right now that's why we talking about you know what I'm saying he went at it only thing I don't like is you did you talk about what you did in the locker room when we were teammates whatever I tell you in the locker room between me and yours is personal don't go there you became a Allen it's now I became that too but I keep it real if you've trashed you trashed I'm gonna tell you trash you know I'm saying I ain't gonna say nothing else about nothing else but if you trash your trash you know said if you're not playing the game the right way I'm gonna do it I think that they both went over the line by saying what he said he has opinion his opinion was that he thought that Westbrook was the best player in Oklahoma City okay that's fine Katie went out and said you average two or three points man as a center you should try to do you build your confidence or build your whatever it is what it is you know I'm saying they going back and forth but they got enough time to do that crap you know saying that that's crap to me you don't saying come talk to me personally you know I'm saying talk to me head up we don't even have to go around everybody you we can just go in that little room right there to see what happened you know I'm saying it is what it is it's going to room and talk it out you know what I'm saying they both 7-footers yeah you know but Perkins might be a little bit more heavyweight but you know what I'm saying okay [ __ ] might be a little yeah but if you got them things man and bangs we'll let you have it back pitching your nose in your mouth you you feel it your own concern so let the bangs go loose you'll be all right do you think that Westbrook is the best player everywhere okay see well you guys got to understand that if I actually this you you think do you think we're better than the Durant I don't think okay me neither so but I'm not taking that as personal and I don't know if you know I don't want people I don't want Westbrook the thing is personality is what it is you know what I'm saying Katie's is the better basketball player really you don't and but Westbrook is our outstanding basketball player but that is just a way people's opinion is that's a pinion you know I'm saying and Kendrick subpoenas because of what ktd a lot of people and I don't think you approve of what Katie Did when you're down to a team 3-1 and then you lose and you go and add Nate you going and join a team we wasn't cut like that Michael Jordan beat me in 96 I was up for I was up for free agency who did I go back to I went back to the Seattle SuperSonics because I wanted to bus Michael Jordan he had opened because I wanted to go back and get at its a party's opinion and that's just the way they are that's him he wanted to do that find Andy that's his choice so that's what people make a pinna bout things I don't have opinion about that we have to talk about the party pack GP you are on you have some sort of brand relationship with cookies and it seems to be pushing you know a lot of people to have a good time how does that feel to be in a whole new era not err a whole new realm and arena you know this would have been a problem in a day because they would have thought about the cannabis business in a in the marijuana being a negative situation now that is turning legal a lot of people are understanding I didn't get into this business because of the smoke there to smoke this cannabis and and it be partying like that I got anything to it to help people my mom just passed away three months ago sorry I wanted to wanted to get into this business so that I can get my mom off of medication and get her to just start feeling better and not being in pain all the time and marijuana was coming and cannabis came to my mind it came about when some of the guys in the hood in San Francisco said you know we just made a strand and he came out to 2020 and it was like nah we gonna honor the og and og is me so they put it they put my name on that and it's a guy in a guy named burner who everybody might really know about it cookies he's one of the young guys that got a mired me and wanted to do with this stuff and I just went into business with them and and I'm gonna get something started I'm gonna get something started it's not all about that but it's about the life now that but I'm gonna get into other stuff I'm getting it trying to help people get off of medication and do other things with it with medical cannabis and and it's a business that is is booming right now and I'm happy of it I'm just happy because they honor me the way you know they did they just gave gave a guy to dare Mart and they called me the OG and they put my name on there in it and became popular for sure I know you don't smoke but have you ever tried your own strand no no will you ever try it no I don't think so I mean no um I'll just be honest with people I don't I don't smoke you know I don't think that's that's something for me you know sanneh if I look down at my chest and I see my chest beaten and I think my heart coming out of it I don't think I should be a part of it you know your party you know what I'm saying that just the way it goes so but to be a part of it and have these guys enjoy it and be safe with it that's what I want to be Oprah or around be safe with it you know it's something that's happening my kids do it I can't stop it you know they've grown so uh but you know you guys if you want to try try you know what I'm saying it is good I just try to put a product out there that's gonna be really good and that's all I do I don't want you to be if you paying your money for it I want you to have a good problem NBA all-star weekend is next month it's shaping up to be a goo and I'm curious as to your thoughts on just NBA all-star as a whole why's it such a monumental tentpole event for culture at large well basically because what we're doing now you know you got music you got clothing all that stuff is starting to be big part of of the NBA you know as you see the Westbrook's you see the hardens they coming out here with these clothes you know you see the d-wave they coming out with different fashions the music is starting to be a big part of it what do you see all the time into all of the all-stars you see all the performers you see all the rappers you see everybody that's what it's becoming this culture is becoming that and I think for you to be named top twenty four players in the NBA and it all started I mean you're you're the the one you're the one and you're going out there and having a good time and this event is a big event this is probably the biggest out of all sports cuz you don't go to the pro bono mo you do nothing at the Hockey Hall star you know I'm do none of the baseball we don't see we don't look at the home run derby no mo what you look at you look at what you're gonna see on at the NBA all-star because you get to go around in these guys then you get to go to different venues and do today parties do it all they stuff they they collaborating with Rick Ross and collaborate with P Diddy they collaborate with Jay Z fans want to see that that's what they want to see and that's when you having parties with these guys and you hang with these guys you get to see them one-on-one that's what all these young people want to see nowadays and that's where the hip hop and all the stuff and the clothing comes involved and that's what it is the NBA all-star is probably the hottest one of the hottest sports you know one of the size if it's in sports right now and that's what it is the fan voting is open now for the starters for Eastern and Western Conference my last question before they kill me over here MB lb quad now don't kill him over here we got a lot of time over here you're hurt they're telling me we have no time left no we got time go go past time all right NBA all-star weekend is something that you've been a part of for nine years I know that you or you are an all-star nine times rather I read that you used to prank people during and B all-star weekend is there a prank that sticks out besides the caramel own story which is a class that was the biggest one you know he's we used to call him gaiters and jeans that's all he did because he were too tight Gators with the jeans on he's real country you know I'm saying but no we used to just I used to just they'd used to just give me the camera and I just prank everybody man Shaq was a big part of all this stuff because he's a big prankster I used to do a lot of things man come out and catch everybody when they were if something happened to him in the days before and I would hit him with it I got Jake he'd one year I got Kevin Garnett another year but it was just about fun it was just about coming out here making people laugh you know because I'm only gonna do it once because after that after that three days is bad like the war cuz I'm like you know more your arms and because the next part of the year I'm going show don't I'm going to hit with every all the time so have fun during that time and then get to introduce yourself to him and get to know him as a person and do that so that's what I thought I wanted them to understand that I was a jokester I'm funny and I'm cool but when you see me on the court from now on it's over for sure as a story defender maybe one of the best defenders and the only point guard to ever win the Defensive Player of the Year when you watch today's game who's somebody out there who you know that you'd be able to lock up well it's - I think I got I think I got Marty smart and then I got Beverly and then you know how to put my son in there so M three into is something that I think that's gonna it's close to me and not on both ends of the floor they on that defensive side because the office is thought I was pretty pretty good so I think they are close all right all right Gary Payton thank you so much for stopping by appreciate you all-star week in this next month will you be tuned in I'll be Tooley and I'll be right there okay on to maybe Chicago use okay all right thank you for sure [Music]", "y-euSNlMtZY": "but there's no yet yeah why don't you do more expensive weed well I got to show you guys some budget strains I say budget strains and I really only mean the difference of ten dollars so far air rise has taken that place as the hey I'm going into an Illinois dispensary and I don't want to spend sixty to sixty-five dollars on an eighth izes there with that being said I've noticed some of their strains have a lower THC percentage I think that we can see the math there they're not exactly going to offer that 35% you know punch you in the nose make you [ __ ] your pants buds oh no oh oh no no no I don't want I'm so sick [ __ ] there Jesus Christ fine I'll get on the [ __ ] ground ah this is this is what it takes Tropicana cookies by air rise I've seen y'all post about this all over Instagram waitin to get my piece well it's finally here I I'm really excited for this one this is a fifty dollar eight this is not one of the usual top-shelf ones I grabbed from Verano I think it might start storming out here I'll hit you guys with the genetics on this one because to be honest on have no idea but with the name maybe it's cookies crossed with Florida orange that would be really funny if I got that exactly right it's time for the first sniff you already knew that with a name like Tropicana I'm hoping for some really nice orange Terps let's check it out [Laughter] it's even better than the mimosa Oh enough talking you just got it I can't hide this little secret in here from y'all any longer before I grind down these nubs of Tropicana cookies into a first taste I wanted to point out look at this guy holy [ __ ] now I don't know anything about Tropicana's lineage or genetics at all but it's got to be mostly sativa with how these buds are formed very loose but oh my goodness they are so so incredibly frosty pushpop Flintstones pushpop is the smell I'm getting off of this I really wish you all could be here well it's absolutely pouring rain over here in Chicago we've got some plans to go out tonight and there's no way leaving this house without trying the Tropicana cookies I can't be smelling these insane citrus and fruity chirps and not get a little bit of a taste so I'm very lucky to have the MJ Arsenal cache as my smallest piece and thankfully the one that I can really use as a taster man so he'll Bonet and try this out what you think about that bag hmm oh man that's that's the Terps I'm looking for in smoke to God let me go ahead and tell y'all worth it absolutely worth it the Oh little musky little gassy almost little fermented fruit and a lot of similar terpene profile to the forbidden fruit Tropicana cookies air eyes let's go wait last thing I'll say the Tropicana cookies is so aromatic that just being over the bomb right now really all I can smell is that like Flintstones pushpop orange guava GRA penis coming off of the buds seriously some of the most flavorful buds I've had gun fruit gum dude oh love it went ahead and grabbed that round two of the Tropicana cookies by air rise look what I'm greeted way it's gang those are some yeah that's a real fruit salad right there that's a real fruit salad of colors textures shades but I mean it's been a wild ride it's been a ride with this air rise Tropicana cookies who doesn't want to see such beautiful colors in there bud but more importantly this stuff is pure jelly it's absolute fruit on the musk coming off of this right now is heavy fruit punch heavy orange I mean come on yeah that's about what I thought we would be a fool to not notice those beautiful hairs that are joining out of the top of that gosh look at that that is crazy I'm getting real Mac vibes off of this with how dusty is we I've been [ __ ] recording man dog threw up in the second bedroom like in the bed but I moved into a two-bedroom one-bath place and my family never comes to visit me and it's for my dog I essentially got a bedroom for my dog all right so uh Tropicana cookies well as we saw it's been a while since I've hit that beaker and especially anything gosh I'm confusing the beaker with this beautiful son of a [ __ ] the Voyager so switched over cuz throw it's a little raw after screwing up that hit let's see that triple percolation of this can help me out no not even a cough that is why I [ __ ] bought this here from me to you just to let you see how [ __ ] stoned I am offer this Tropicana cookies taking these two hits come on that ruined me hey THC is [ __ ] no it's not [ __ ] but when it comes to quality cannabis to make a large assumption of a sub 20% strain can leave ya looking like me I didn't think the 17% would really affect me at all dang this stuff is awesome I'm so relaxed I cannot wait to eat some lunch even though this is a sativa dominant", "EMydbZjVuIY": "[Music] guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane I'm Dan so and we are doing a little straighter view today were actually checking out some dance [ __ ] from his little personal girl this year yeah tell us a little bit about this some cookies yes some cookies throughout like three plants this year and turned out pretty good actually I didn't get too crazy you know I just threw in some super soil and pretty much just gave up water and a couple base nutrients ago pretty stinky though it knocked up frequent it didn't get that good of sunlight but it's definitely good pretty turkey definitely does have a pretty nice smell to it you kind of smell it from the bags around it's kind of it's an interesting smother not really like any cookie cut ever smells good cheesy yeah it's got that like critical smell to it almost those are super dense and real large yeah actually shape which is sorry guys I'm watching the Bronco game right behind you not really intentionally watching it but opportunity anyway yeah we're smoking weed damn grew it and it looks good yeah I'm sure she's nice yeah oh yeah that's what I was saying no it's it's pretty dense which is I wasn't expecting because it only you've got will smell a little bit different are those it all like this is all weeds in the same plant telling same fee no I'm not sure if it's the same fee no I definitely see what you're saying I think they're like one of them was a different fee no there was definitely had more of like good yeah you know this one has a little bit more goodness yeah but it's kind of more skunky at the same time yeah it's you look at the close-ups is actually pretty frosty and I don't know house definitely pleased for me from how low light it got you know yeah good job I mean cookies is a plant that does grow good in low light so but that's just how did he deal this bar so you just had a couple of plants I've read I don't have to turn the pots my groom in thirty gallon smart pots and you know the yoke was pretty good I mean the price didn't get more than five feet tall and I think [Music] we're gonna grab an ashtray yeah this month we've actually been smoking quite a bit of good outdoor lately just a season seeing some good outdoor this year I actually what I love outdoor if it's fresh this girl right it tastes and smells just as good as any indoor you know it's just might be a little bit we're one leg slightly different or maybe I'm just kind of picking up different part parts of the Senate each time yeah there definitely was one planet that was a different feel like I said and I just mixed it all not going back looking back out not approach it or separated it to see the difference yeah there it was just these personally is just an experiment it does burn really well though this is good whatever nose you picked a good distance yeah this one is the one that tastes new that smells the way the bubble has tasted yeah actually made some pretty good bubble from it to ya know stuff that we did in the episode yeah yeah rumors all around good straight made great [ __ ] full milk and gave me lot more wheat than I expected yes sorry this is we're trying to bang out some videos today for some outdoor you know I got a great outdoor differently than I would endure you know just based on the fact that like it's not gonna turn out as good eats you know the indoors climate controls all that [ __ ] I would give this like a solid 8 out of 10 for some outdoor you know but it's it's kind of biased but I mean as far as the full milky not full more chaotic yes sir game on it's bomb obviously I'm coming with a don't get a dream did a lot but really you're gonna have that size because you knew you're gonna smoke this and you're just gonna pull it out I mean I guess yeah taking that into account I like the Terp you know don't like the smell on it yeah or the yeah that's it that's pretty fair seeing a lot of good outdoor yeah I'm just kind of comparing it to the other outdoor that we've seen this year you know whether we've got faceoff needs in that was not some killer outdoor that we did it yet episode it's obviously not something like that you know because it's very definitely some good we're good what are you seeing you boys on these points together oh my gosh we're gonna finish smoking up this hog leg and we will see you next time for the CCC I'm [Music]", "o8CnGuYserk": "yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __

beach og or even ocean beach kush so it's not always called just ocean beach i do got a bong load packed hope everybody's having a great day smoking on something good cheers everybody the ocean beach by cookies oh first initial thought it's got a great flavor it's very smooth it doesn't give you that lung you know that chest expansion and lung lock that i'm used to off a good indica but this is a 50 50 hybrid so so far not disappointed it is really smooth and great flavor but like always two for the review i want to give a shout out to a friend of mine uh tim flint he hooks me up with my shirts and everything he gave me the sticker right here it's [ __ ] dope as [ __ ] it says uh presidents are temporary wu-tang is forever that is dope as [ __ ] i thought i have to leave here right

for being patient with whoa to get that burp out before i take the hit there it is oh one more there we go okay cheers two for the review [Music] oh that second hit got me there that one did it that one dropped the eyes give me that feeling cookies overall is a pr uh as a brand has some really good stuff i know it is pricey but you know it's not for everybody that's why they have budget brands cookies overall as a company is very [ __ ] good yeah there are some strains that aren't as good as others but that's every company i feel like the ocean beach is a is a very good strain i didn't expect it to it's a weird you know it's a weird cover weird name i never heard of the strain ocean beach before i was kind of skeptical on it but i've reviewed most of them so i was like let's try something new let's calculate it up price it is pricey because i'm getting it at a cookies uh store you're never gonna get really a deal at a cookie store you get what you pay for so 70 something bucks for the eight it is a little pricey the look and the smell is amazing it looks really good it smells really good the flavor i really like the flavor i can't really pinpoint it it's not like like sweet or anything uh it's not super gassy i don't know maybe earthy it but it's really good it didn't like [ __ ] up my palate the smoothness is there my throat's not all [ __ ] up and the high is definitely there off two hits i'm i feel [ __ ] great so overall for the ocean beach i'm gonna have to give it the 8.3 it's a [ __ ] solid ass strain uh i would recommend trying it out at least once seeing if it's for you the 8.3 you know that's that's a pretty [ __ ] high score i'm still searching for that nine i'm still searching for that ten but today i'm giving the ocean beach by cookies the 8.3 that was my review hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] you", "F2-BhzE59rQ": "a widow for 20 family today we got some lemon cookies a well-balanced sativa dominant hybrid cross with lemon haze and Girl Scout cookies the THC is out of range between 18 and 21 percent which is pretty fired the buds are slightly dense with green and yellow hues that are coated with an exceptional amount of trichomes the nose on the string is powerful and potent with the fresh lemon fragrance ash is out of this world man the smell alone is pretty intoxicating the

that wavy fam welcome back to the channel if you guys are new I'm cat I'm trippy and today we're gonna be reviewing Gary Payton buy cookies and powers genetics yeah if you guys haven't heard about coke Gary Payton but to put you guys on it's a new strain that just was released like about a month ago - yeah and this is honestly the second ace we picked up some and we did try it first just because we like to try the weed and see if we like it right yeah before we like even shoe with you guys could lose we want to share the best with you guys yeah yeah we thought this was pretty freakin good so we're gonna let you guys know a little bit about it cheers by the way let the spark up a little nice swing this is a little wake and bake for us right now [Applause] if you guys are watching this in the morning make sure you get a little breakfast a little wake and bake baby eat a [Music] and cut all the smoke so this is a cookies and powered Z collab guys don't know who power diseases it's like a one of the known growers in the barrier it's known for like so why the Sun oh man all the exotics that you guys you know see on Instagram that burner that burner smokes himself yeah so it's a cross of the Y and snowman it's hybrid testing I like about 24% THC it's pretty high ya know CBD in there but it's gonna be more of a calming relaxing effect right kind of right in the middle not too [Music] and the nerves are gonna like look so fruity and color for y'all you're gonna have like a little bit of orange cookie pears in there some purple some [ __ ] crystal like all the time 1/8 like this goes for $80 75 to 80 dollars you guys always ask us what did this go for that's what it goes for out here y'all yeah that's typical I think like at the club's now ever since its recreational before top shops didn't used to be $75 $80 so used to be like $50 60 the most you know none of the things were tested longer we to assess it it was never sent to the lab check for pesticides I think that's the reason why things are more expensive now it's because it take like the companies have to pay a lot for them to get this stuff testing so whenever it does hit the show yeah I just have to be a little bit more expensive because they put a lot of money just to get it onto the show I guess it's like that's worth it you know you're smoking good stuff especially right now a lot of people are just making fake stuff and you know even bad we can even look good like I had an egg on my snap and I told everybody if they will sum up this and everyone's like yeah I'll smoke that just it looks hella good but little did they know that I was holding was like a London money one mug like who didn't know you know like that's not easy it is to get manipulated with the Wii and cards y'all that's why everybody like that why wanna know if before you know so quick to say y'all smokey or you know be like no like before just so quick to smoke things but I feel like not a lot of people know like hi they supposed to know bosz good weed looks like if they never had good weed you know or like if the best weed they had it's like not even I mean like not somebody else like I thought the weed I was getting fired like I was like damn getting some fire ass me and now that I like I know my [ __ ] I'm just saying what the [ __ ] was I smoking and why was I flexing that you know like why did I become so cool I mean it was fire though back then yak when your flood was so you lead and like it came in little baggies yeah and it wasn't like shake or like dried up even was actually like good meg that's crazy how much weed has an balls yeah and that's why prices are the way they are not for like yeah it's just crazy how like that's something like I can't afford a $75 ate every day you know yeah we can't afford that how much is an ounce of that it's like $600 an ounce right all right that's crazy the like just living in San Cisco already is expensive it's like why don't my wheat have to be expensive as well everything food you know you want to eat good food yeah I think every now and then you cheat yourself to be like this yeah you know and then you're gonna get super high but I don't know I feel like it's better to know get it straight from the source I wish I knew powers hit me up because I need to fresh it I don't need this [ __ ] up and sitting in the show for me to buy it that's the Gary Payton I want but this guy paid in this other good so it's good yeah but you know we taste different with this fresh than when it's been having to go get tested and getting the cookie back getting some to different places what about the only you testing they say they do know you can't lie baby let us know if you guys will pay $75 for India yeah in taxes to there's something you know don't forget about taxes [Music] but it takes hella good it's getting me we were hired doing the job we're about to start the day and I don't think it feel tired no for sure I'm loaded I totally took hybrid I like smoking hybrids a lot just because it gives you a mix above I gives me a mix of both and like it still keeps my mind like running I don't know it doesn't like it doesn't shut my brain down like indicas shut my [ __ ] breakdown like once I smoke that I'm like I can't even think anymore [Music] shut up Howard these cookies for making this goods train get it paid in check it out I don't know Gary Payton is it's an NBA player born and raised and I think Oakland but you know shout out the bay you guys can get your hands on it cuz I think it's limited to like the cannabis club I don't know let me know if you guys have tried it you guys seen it but I've heard about it nothing cuz other stuff we're about to try for you guys like some more exotic sorry just just came out to hit this shelf that you know we're gonna put you guys home you know yeah let us know what else other strain you'll like us to try as well [Music] like new strains I know there's hello strains out there that we haven't straightener because you guys want we're gonna go more in depth about the feelings the facts the pricing smells like Frank seems so there's something you guys

what's up everyone this is Drew,\nowner of Connoisseur Concentrates, and we are back to do another terpene profile\nbreakdown video. I am joined again by my Chief Lab Technician; Professor Matsumoto\nand my Media Director; Audrey and we're gonna be doing a breakdown video of our\nGirl Scout Cookies terpene profile. Now everybody knows Girl Scout Cookies. One\nof the most important things is that I searched everywhere to get a perfectly,\namazing sample of the weed and then do my tests from there. Girl Scout Cookies\nin case you didn't know its lineage is a hybrid and it's a cross between OG Kush\nand Durban Poison. Very unique smell it is the parent for a lot of amazing\nstrains. I won't even go through them all I know a few but quote on everything\nright here on the spot. We nailed this one. This one you know we put out the\nThin Mint Cookies and it was okay, this is far superior, far superior in my\nopinion. Smells exactly like the strain. So first thing you're gonna notice that\nthe Girl Scout Cookies is clear and that is because it falls under our organic\nline of products, meaning that all the ingredients are organic terpenes blended\ntogether. There is nothing synthetic and nothing artificial in it. First thing\nyou're gonna do when you see this bottle, buy it, is you're gonna open it up and\nsmell it, so I'm gonna give you a walk through on what this bottle smells like. It's very mild, sweet, but not too sweet.\nIt's also, it also has a gassy flavor. One of the things that I tell everyone in\nevery single video; you should never buy terpenes based on what the bottle smells\nlike. A lot of people go to stores and they go to fairs and whatever expos that\nyou go to and you smell the terpene bottle, you buy it from there, that is the\nabsolute worst way to do something. It is a rookie mistake. All the terpenes, I make these terpene profiles, inside these terpene profiles\nare 20 different terpenes. When you smell a bottle you are smelling whatever\ningredients, however many a few of them are evaporating off at room temperature. That's creating a different smell than if all of them evaporated off at the\nsame temperature. Which is the way that we create them and the end-use of the pen. I'm gonna let Audrey explain that a little bit better. Right so when you are\npurchasing your terpenes the most important thing you have to keep in mind\nis that the pen almost never tastes exactly like what the bottle smells like (That's true). A good example of this is vanilla. To smell it, amazing. Would you put it in your\nmouth, probably not. You have to know this when\nyou're buying terpenes because at the end of the day your customers and\nclients are gonna be tasting that pen, not smelling your bottle. This is what makes\nour product better. We spent hours formulating these lines and terpenes for\nthat end-user and end-taste, rather than smelling it at the counter. Absolutely\nour bottles don't smell that great because we're not making perfumes, we're\nnot making colognes, we're making flavor ingredients. It's the taste that is most\nimportant to your business. That's why the Professor is gonna explain to you\nexactly what this pen tastes like when all the terpenes are being evaporated at\nthe same time. Thank you, thank you so I recently made up a pen of that Girl\nScout Cookies and I'm gonna tell you what it tastes like. Oh man one of my top fives, definitely on\nthis one. I initially got an earthy note in there, followed by a clean, sweet, mild\ncannabis flavor. You know basically tastes, basically like the strain that\nDrew was talking about. We really hit the nail on the head on this one. And you\nknow this goes without saying it's a mild cannabis profile meaning that\nyou're gonna get that earthiness and that sweetness before that little bit of\ncannabis. Yeah definitely, the Girl Scout Cookies has a flavor that's all it's own. That's why it's so recognizable when you smell it,\nyou're like either this is it or this isn't it. We nailed it, it-it's right on\npoint. One of the ways that we differentiate our strains is, excuse me our terpene profiles, is based on whether they're blended profiles or\nseparated profiles. A blended profile is your gonna taste all these flavors\ncombined; the same thing through the inhale and the exhale. Separated profiles; first\nyou're tasting gassy, then you're tasting sweet, then followed by a little bit of\nearth at the end. Where does this one fall? I would categorize the Girl Scout\nCookies as a partially blended terpene profile, meaning that you're gonna be\ntasting some flavors at different parts from the inhale to exhale. So partially\nblended means that it's still separated but still blended at the same time. I\nmean pretty much exactly like he said. The flavor, so when you take the profile\nof how much it actually tastes like weed, that's gonna be different from how\nstrong the profile is relative to other profiles. Audrey's gonna explain a little\nbit more about that. Right so every terpene profile varies\non how strong the actual flavor is. Girl Scout Cookies for example, is\ncategorized into our medium strength profiles. We designed this profile to be\nan enhancing agent, rather than a masking agent. Meaning, when you're smoking on\nthat exhale you're gonna get that cannabis aroma still enhanced with the\nfeatures of this profile, rather than that smell being masked like it\nwould be if you were using Banana or Bubblegum. So I can tell you if you've\ntried our Thin Mint Cookies this is far superior. I've reformulated this, this is a\nlater generation of terpenes. I'm actually gonna retire that Thin Mint\nCookies. So if you want to try this go to MrExtractor.com, we have samples and\nwe have any size that you want. We can accommodate any size order of this.

the merch drop let's dive right into it so today's video we are talking about a growing problem that I have been noticing more and more in my DMS we're talking about fake exotic now some of you guys out there might be wondering what the [ __ ] is fake exotic but I assume most you guys know what I'm talking about here we're talking about those cookies packs the runts packs the jungle boys packs that are obviously not real those are the main three but there's a bunch of other like fake packaging brands where they aren't actually real weed brands it's just packaging companies that sell the [ __ ] to anyone right now for those of you guys who are uninformed there is a very large trend going around in the weed smoking community where people will take some fairly decent weed and put it in a fake knockoff dispensary look-alike bag and then sell it for $50 an 8 which is unacceptable absolutely ridiculous so today we're gonna break down how to differentiate between a fake and a real bag and we're also gonna talk about some information that you guys probably need to know about this now first and foremost I'd like to say here that if you were cab going to buy weed from your plug and he's ever got some some quote-unquote exotic that is prepackaged in a bag like this you should generally run to the [ __ ] hills you should fly as far away as you can you know what snitch on that [ __ ] guide you'd call twelve six nine that dude bro [ __ ] that guy alright he's selling fake [ __ ] and here's why 99% of the time this is exactly what happens people will go on sites like DHgate or Aliexpress or Amazon and they will buy a bunch of these fake bags these pre-made bags from [ __ ] Wuhan or some [ __ ] right get them mailed to him open them up seal them all you know fill them up with some decent bud and ate the bud seal them up and sell them now there's one dead giveaway to these bags that really tells you right off the bat that they're fake right and I don't here's the thing before I ever made this video I figured that a lot of this stuff is like really self-explanatory but ever since I made my reviewing subscribers weed series I've received a concerning amount of DMS of people like flexing these fake bags like a shocking amount of DMS which I feel need to clarify this the number one way to tell if your cookies runts or jungle boys or any kind of pack is fake is to look at the coloring that is the number one way the best example of the throw on here I think there's two in particular that are always a really easy way to tell we're gonna use cookies as our first example here we're gonna use the gelati and the sticky buns bags now you look at sticky buns in gelati right the colors are very vibrant the legitimate bags the colors are super vibrant popping gelati in particular it's a different color for each letter of the word right super vibrant colors and you guys have to remember that with all of these weed companies with all of these legitimate real-deal packaging's right the colors are always really gonna stand out the colors are gonna pop like crazy like it's meant to draw your tension in right so they're gonna use high quality coloring high quality printing on the real bags on the fake ones now the reason I use sticky bouncing gelotti's because it's so easy to tell with these to write the colors always come out faded or dim and worst case scenario they're not even the same shade right but essentially every time when you're buying these fake bags you have to realize they're printing these in a lower resolution right they are printing these with very like just worse material worse quality then the real brands are using right and that's gonna reflect in the print right and the best way to look is just honestly even go online right go on if you guys live in Cali you know go on the cookies website and look at some of their information on there or watch youtube videos where people have some real packaging and do a compare and contrast and you'll note it's almost right off the bat that the colors are [ __ ] I mean even from the images that I've thrown on screen in the past couple minutes here you guys should be able to tell in my side-by-sides that yeah it's it's a pretty blatant Lorde particularly the sticky buns and I I did my research here pretty much every single print of the fake sticky buns I could find had this [ __ ] coloring right and all of them do cereal milk is another really bad offender a cookie strain and then you move on to other brands right let's look at runts and jungle boys for a minute right runts is another one that is pretty obvious because runts their packaging is arguably even more vibrant and popping than cookies right their packaging is just color just Bank Bank BAM right and with them once again just look at the brightness in the contrast of those colors right look at the look at the resolution of the print actually look up close and see okay it is that resolution bad you know is it almost like blurry you know when you when you look at it real closely because you know if I were to take for example I've got a cookies bag on my shelf actually here if I take this bag and I look at I hold it really close to my eyes that text doesn't look like it's bad quality or blurry like I don't have to hold it far away from my face to read it as clearly as I could imagine right 20/20 I can hold it as close as I want and that text still looks great quality with a fake bag that will almost never be the case if you look very closely at the bag you'll notice like hey that image is kind of blurry right it's not looking good but moving on from comparing the bags like I said there the comparison in looking closely at that that kind of blurriness is the best way there's another one that people seem to look past quite often I don't know if people look past it or if they just don't give a [ __ ] but the second one here now this is how it is an Illinois right with every bag that I've gotten of cookies in the state of Illinois yeah cookies did recently come to Illinois it's a very new development but mine dispensary guided him for the first time like two months ago I think but either way with my bag it says resealable at the top right but there's a little like safety seal that you have to pull to actually open up the bag to make it then resealable right that's how the real bags are for example think of like a bag of beef jerky right you pull that you pull the little tab off the top little strip that you have to peel like a bag of cheese from the store right peel that little strip then you can open it and reseal it right it's the same thing with real cookies bags as far as I'm aware now correct me if I'm wrong in Cali but the Illinois bags which they are actually a little bit different from the Cali ones they are like that right and that's what I've seen from a lot of my friends who are in California too now I'm not up to date on packaging I know cookies changes their packaging a lot as do a lot of these other companies to try to outsmart the you know counterfeit so of course but as far as I'm aware that is a thing pretty much consistently on almost all of these bag companies right these companies that use bags instead of a glass container right these fake ones won't have that these fake ones you'll be able to just no safety thing to pull you know nothing to avoid it you'll be able to just yank it right the [ __ ] open right there will be no thing right there will be no thing to peel off that's like a safety thing typically bags will have that and some bags some real bags you'll be able to open without that I'm not saying all bags are like that but most bags will have something like that to indicate to you that it's already been opened if there isn't anything like that that is a huge red flag and you should really really look closer at that bag but moving on from ways to tell it apart from being real or fake let's talk about the real problem with these kinds of things the biggest problem that I have with these fake cookies fake runs fake exotic fake cally packs is that half the time the weed that people are putting in these isn't even bad that's the thing with a lot of these other fake branded things like edibles or concentrates a lot of times it's bunk or it's fake but what I seem to be noticing is a common trend is whenever people put the weed in these bags it's actually pretty decent right it's not it's not always swag and by the way a little tip here I've gotten a shocking amount of UK viewers European viewers who are sending in cookies bags and runts bags I hate to break it to you if you don't live in America you're not smoking cookies I'd nobody is [ __ ] importing the Gary Payton to the UK all right nobody's taking the gelati and shipping it on a boat past customs over to UK all right I hate to break it to you nobody's doing that for a bunch of eighths all right I just I hate to break your heart right but either Webb back on topic you're only UK viewers put the cookies back down right now throw the bag away take the weed out of its decent but back on topic here a lot of the bud that these people are putting into these bags is not bad and that's my problem see back in high school when I first started smoking it was never like this there was no fake Cali bags there was just like carts were just hitting the market in Illinois when I I like was starting smoking right like like carts were just starting to become a thing in Illinois as far as I remember like nobody was hitting them right like like I got lucky and got one early on when I was younger in high school right but like nobody was [ __ ] hitting them and all of a sudden as times gone on right as times progressed these fake bags have become a thing and I miss the good old days when you could just go to the plug and you can just get that bass that gas right out of the plastic bag I don't know I just had passed I'm baked as [ __ ] dude that's like a fat dab of some mag landrace dude I'm like I'm tweaking right now but either way back on topic here so I I just I miss being able to go to the plug and know that I'm getting the best [ __ ] he has straight out the bag right nowadays it's difficult to find a plug that isn't sound this kind of [ __ ] an a in bet here come all the [ __ ] heroes of cannabis who are gonna come in the comments like Mary a goblin huh makes me laugh that you don't have a plug my plug hundred pounds of Kali Zaza ten dollars right hey keep that [ __ ] out of the comments but really it's become a lot harder for the average smoker to find a plug that isn't selling these [ __ ] bags whereas if four years ago that same plug was probably selling that same weed but for a better price and out of a plastic bag like it should have been done and that's my biggest problem here and I want to make this little segment of the video here a call to action all the plugs out there everyone cuz listen this is the Goblin viewer vase okay if you guys are gonna sit here and act like you're not drug dealers you're wrong I know a good chunk you guys sell drugs right so I'm gonna lay it out right now all you plugs out there sell your weed out the bag don't sell it out of the fake [ __ ] sell it right out of that vacuum seal right out of that ziplock dude sell it the old classic way scale it out put it in a plastic baggie give it to your cost to you don't prepackaged this [ __ ] dude and harass and shame other plugs who do cyberbully them if you see a plug selling this [ __ ] swipe up on his story and say damn dude I didn't know you sold schwag in a bag nice bro just absolutely ruin his [ __ ] day because listen the plugs you sell this kind of [ __ ] they always have like egos about their bud they're always like man I'm selling real Cali all the rest of y'all are selling fake so if you guys just [ __ ] cyberbully I'm a little bit and tell them it's swag in a [ __ ] bag they're gonna lose their marbles I guarantee it it's gonna be content for everybody so chat not I'm so used to streaming dude I said chat Jesus Christ ladies and gentlemen the comments section harass your plug selling these fake bags and remember two important takeaways from this video 1 get your bags from a dispo there's no real reason that anyone would ever sell an authentic cookies bag on the street and 2 if you really are in the position to buy one of these if you're in the position where this is your best option before you give that plug money ask him to take it out of the bag and sell it to you for a real price because I guarantee the plug might even respect that a little bit a I'm not trying to get y'all killed out there but hey I've had I've had experiences where I've had bad times with plugs and

that is in these and they rotate the extract or live resin that is in this depending on what they have at the time so you can't you can't bank on it being the same flower every single time you buy it there's a good chance that that the insides will definitely change and rotate depending on what's available but i absolutely love this idea i think it's super freaking cool to just like do a package of five joints and you just brand the box and then slap a different sticker on the back for like what's in it and this is your this is like the five package joints that you buy you don't know what kind of flour you're getting or you just like ask before you buy it um in this case it is gmo root beer and lemon bean resin this was a super [ __ ] good combination of like strains or flour and extra or live resin they balance it so there's a 93 percent herb and 7 percent live resin in each joint and they all weigh half a gram each so there's five total in this package they come in a like this really nice metal tin you can see silhouettes and mountains there's a moon on the front and then on the back there's it says blazed blazed glazed blaze totally cosmic um inside if i can get this open inside so normally there's five joints i've smoked a few of them already but inside you would have all five of your joints carefully packaged my favorite thing about this or this package is i can carry this in my backpack if i go on a hike i can put in my disc golf bag if i go play disc golf i can put it in my pocket if i'm just walking around town and i don't have to worry about my packaging being squished i know that my product or my joints are going to be safe and i can't even recycle this now and put my own hand rolled joints in it and have a perfect tin for carrying those around with me they use field extracts in there as their infusion pretty sure they grow their own flour um but anyways these are our space coyotes sativa or five sativa infused joints be sure to check them out on

today we're going to be reviewing the alien labs one gram pre-roll strain angle 41. let's get into it all right so just to give you guys some information i got this from um pcf it's dispensary around here in the 209 in the valley in california um i got this 14 out the door and i've been seeing a lot of comments on my other videos from my cartridges specifically uh just because i get them for so cheap out the door from the dispensary it's not just me like i'm not cabin you know you could go to the comments this is these dispensaries they're known around my my area like for being really [ __ ] cheap um alien labs the eggs they used to be 52 out the door but they recently bumped it up to 72 out the door so basically just like any other area now um but we do got like marathon g for like 52 out the door we got a corova for 29 out the door um a lot of cure come just the marathon of g just because it's like nipsey's weed rip nipsey man but uh it's not that good bro 52 bucks that's the only reason they made this [ __ ] 52 bucks it wasn't for that all the other care company aids their um 29 out the door and the indoors 25 out the door the light depth which is greenhouse 20 out the door outdoor 15. i'll make a video on on um on the dispensaries i go to so whoever cares about them um you know you guys could watch them anyways i got this 14 out the door okay but anyways i got this 14 out the door um i already tried one it was a scherbassia one that my homie jober got shadow joker we split it between three heads got me pretty lit so i'm kind of curious to see how lit this will get me smoking into the dome and although i think the other one was like 24 or 23 percent csg this one's only 19 tsp 19.38 and 0.04 cbd it was manufactured 51120 and package 60220 um and yeah that's it so one grand p roll uh let me know how much you guys get this for out the door where you guys are from i paid 14 out the door and let's get to it man oh so honestly i was telling my homie i was like um i was like bruh hella dumb the alien labs ace now go for 72. you just get three of these [ __ ] for like what 36 bucks you know fourteen dollars each 40 bucks whatever you know get yourself an eighth right there and three three p rules but uh all right let's open this [ __ ] see what the [ __ ] is about i'm already smoked like i said i already smoked it so i know it's good but um just give us a little little review and also crack the seal crack the seal [ __ ] sings bait that [ __ ] pisses me off bro cause i spend my hard work my hard-earned money on this [ __ ] just a [ __ ] just from [ __ ] i call it fake bro hmm [ __ ] all right mmm you see the weed pop out in labs one grand pro sick comes in raw cone like i said if you guys are if you guys been sticking on my channel you guys know what that noise means good air flow gonna start heating up your rig right now and give you some seconds part of the video if you got a car get ready to hit a [ __ ] blinker get your lungs right let's [ __ ] do this i'll turn my ac off right quick burn that x's paper off sunday i'm about to upload this video right now play some gta i was supposed to go on the hike but um there's some family [ __ ] going on right now so just rather be home you know just in case bro wear your [ __ ] mask she's not a joke two people in my family already got that [ __ ] so i'll stop playing around with that [ __ ] bro way different so i mean not that the shabbat show was bad and it was [ __ ] amazing this is amazing too not that this one's bad either it's just good to know that they got the [ __ ] together they really care you know making sure it tastes different oh you can see that rosin ring already look at that it's gas bro already the taste for a gelato gelato is a safe bet you know you want to get a wheatie never try you want to try a wheat bread you never tried before and if they have a lot to get the gelato it's going to be guys you go same for cards same for wax just get gelato it's always going to get you lit so it's going to taste fire that's a good thing about gelato and um this strain cross is actually uh gelato 41 hence the ariel 41 and some type of og so it's a really good mix because the gelato is there for the flavor the og is there for the high just like girl scout cookies how it's um urban poison and uh what's the other one i know it's og kush but there's like a third straight um but yeah taste [ __ ] one through ten i'll give this [ __ ] like a nine to be honest yeah that's a solid 9 out of 10 for sure for sure um the high i'll get to y'all at the end of the joint see what's see what he's talking about so i'll get to y'all when i'm about like right here about it about us turn it off and um i'll let you guys know let you guys know how i'm feeling man i'll give you my final final results but so far bro guys look at the ash though it's kind of black that could be the paper though because look the the like middle is white it could be fake raw much cones be maybe i don't know fire though i'll be back i'll be back in a bit i'll tell you guys my final thoughts so all right bruh just to give you guys an update my highest forgot my [ __ ] keys in the car [Music] no i'm not going to give it 10 out of 10 i'm gonna give it a nine just because the ash is not white and that matters when you're raising a joint but i'm being picky okay guys shit's fired if i'll give you something a nine that's almost perfect you gotta realize that like a seven is something that's like like you know that's something like you know you just smoke most of the time but once and then you'll find that unicorn and then just get you high different red so um yeah definitely [ __ ] recommend to shave you guys thinking about copying this copy it almost out of pay i'm gonna say that this is better than the [ __ ] uh cookie spiro [ __ ] that [ __ ] was 20 bucks so definitely recommend this over cookies pre-roll everything is about that everything you know about corova i recommend this over corrobor p rule i recommend this over basically a lot of heroes so i would definitely say these are my top three not number one uh pre-roll so far the alien labs period um i would recommend the scherbassio just because it's a whole different taste but if you like gelato definitely get the air before every 41. great taste um it's gonna be it man i'm live as [ __ ] put the ashtray i'll catch you on next video bruh and", "jIoLKXUGSIM": "[Music] hey everyone it's clint from canadian cannabis culture back with another review uh today we're looking at jb cookies by quest so this one just came out recently i'm really excited to try it it's got a strain in the lineage that is very interesting to me so first of all this one is sitting at 27.46 thc so definitely pretty high up there so jb cookies is an indica dominant hybrid bread bread crossing um girl scout cookies and romulan so it's really interesting to me that they've got romulan in the lineage on this this cross romulan is something that i'm very used to especially back in the day growing up here in bc it's definitely got a kind of a it's got a really good flavor so i'm looking forward to this jb cookies is said to have a pastry aroma similar to apple pie and supposed to taste just the same so that's really exciting because i love good flavor quest is a small batch high grade cultivator located in the creston valley in the kootenai region of british columbia they hand trim and hang dry the plants all plants are nourished by glacial water which runs naturally through quest's cannabis estate and the glacial water happens to be perfectly ph balanced to the level cannabis thrives on and if you're looking to invest in quest cannabis they're under the parent company decibel cannabis company which i'll have on the screen and i just wanted to mention this one was packaged december 16th 2020 so pretty fresh definitely an interesting aroma right off the bat and they do have their terpene shield in here which is really nice to see we'll definitely get you guys good look at that okay so now that we've learned a little bit about jb cookies by quest the last thing i got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right everyone uh after testing out the jb cookies by quest uh this one was a little bit of a letdown i was definitely expecting big things as far as like a really flavorful strain and i thought the effects would be pretty pretty strong considering it's a 27.46 percent so it's not like it was terrible but uh i expected more from quest so overall the taste of it was okay nothing nothing special the burn on it was okay good like nothing nothing special um the effects on it again were okay good like definitely not super overwhelming or anything like that especially again for 27 thc as far as smoothness on it it was it was pretty good as far as it being smooth uh but the the one bad thing about it was the ash was uh was not very light uh it wasn't super dark either but it definitely wasn't light i wanted to mention i also noticed uh when you grind up the buds of the jb cookies there's a lot of like i don't even know what you call them calyxes or like empty seed pods so basically when you bust it up there would just be a bunch of like stuff that you didn't want to put in there so uh didn't like that at all um i definitely won't be picking this one up again um but again it wasn't terrible quest does you know quite a bit of uh really good strains so you know for someone who's not a connoisseur they'll probably be fine with it uh but it's not something that i would purchase again um so i'm gonna rate this one an 8.6 out of 10. until next time guys", "TlLe0W_JMq4": "welcome back

10 rolls our net weight is 3.5 grams total thc percentage in this weed is 16.42 that's not bad this is a sativa the strain is outlaw and outlaw is a cheesy phenotype of amnesia haze that's what it says on their website um we will see how cheesy it is i do like the cheese i do like the cheese cheesiness says to me more sativa it's always kind of had the higher up more energetic lower thc great for the day [ __ ] just spin them up all day long and not have to worry about too many repercussions package date so package date is may 8th 2020. now may is not too bad we are in july today is july 14th or 12th july 12th today we'll say okay so the package on may 8th i don't know what that means because if you can make these pre-rolls in january and just have the boxes sitting on your shelf and then put them in here on may 8th and then put your package date may 8th but you're smoking january dope that's what could be happening we don't know that's just an unknown let's open it up see what we get here's that little sealy sealy sealy sealy so boom we're getting in there what do we get oh it's a little package there's a thc picture on there and then there's nothing else on this pack this is a nice little slick little pack though i do like it i'll slot right in my pocket yeah ripped off the plastic there let's go for the open opening oh some little tinfoil wrap there like a cigarette pack normally you just pull okay oh yeah there's there it is there it is pull that away and then we have ten readies up in this batch boom look at that there's your retican ready now the marijuana inside you can clearly see there's marijuana inside that's good that's good that's what i'm hoping for let's do math real quick here the package comes with 10 pre-rolls the package weighs 3.5 grams of dope so in each pre-roll you got .35 of marijuana i paid 24.99 for this package that makes every pre-roll about 250. so 250 for .35 grams of dough now let's see what's in the pre-roll just for fun that's what this is about we're recreational we're just doing things for fun i'm gonna rip this batch open let's get you open let's see what we're smoking on is it sticks is it stems is it seeds we don't know let's see it's not dry and crusty i will give it that you know you're not uh may 2nd package date the weed that's falling out is not dry and crusty there is a bit of humidity left in there that's what you want yeah yeah we'll do a little dance for that okay so there's .38 of dope in this pre-roll that's on point perfect ah do another dance you're getting dances today now let's see what's actually in here so it's not too bad look at this this is a stem here okay that's something you don't want to really pre-roll right here that's leaf okay so there's a bunch of leaf getting in there this is definitely bottoms okay this is bottoms this is the bins after it's handled weed you're going to grab all this bits and you're going to put it in your parel that's what's happening here but there is flour in there too it's not all sticks and stems it's not all leaf matter you can see the leaf matter there's chances you know when i roll my joints i report all the stem all these little bits that affects my smoking goodness these are i'm pretty slick i mean i am slick but i'm also pretty happy this is a little slick pack um i'm looking forward to getting all snapped up here it's [ __ ] 420 right on the dot too hmm not bad not bad not a whole lot of flavor there's really not a lot that stands out on that taste i know i'm smoking weed but there's nothing to complain about either right i'll just start there so good good good good in the past i've had two other radicands actually have them right here i have the waffle and the god bud done both these they were both 29.99 which is a great price and they were both quality dopes they passed the test they're rebuyable they're suggestible check them out check out redican this is gonna be perfect for me throughout my day a quick little snap snap i'll take my i'll take bowl hoots throughout the day just to get my medicine so i can keep going that's what this is very convenient actually and for 250 per joint all i need is one and then i continue on my day this one's almost going out though i need more than that so you got a second one going right away before this one goes out and you just gotta keep her going it's smokeable but it's not flavorful that's what i like to say there i smoked my second one i'm getting down there i'm getting pretty snapped up i am feeling good i'm starting to forget words here you go friends take one of those put it in your mouth later later as easy as that smoke three at once if you want whoo [Music] you can like two up and give one to a friend if you want that's how easy that is to they're quick lights that is nice it's not like uh they light like a cigarette you smoke you know one two three four five there's five more somewhere one two i lost three okay so no i have four i have four in my hand and i got five six seven eight nine i lost one when i threw one to a friend but the neat thing about these this is really cool let's say you're like boom out on the street you're like hey bros guess what i just got i got some reddit cam readies you want one do you want one and they're like yeah we'll take one and you're like boom there you go friend there you go other friend and then you're [ __ ] flying now all your friends have your own little pre-roll and you carry about your day i actually have all the pre-rolls going just a big fatty right now here that's the way just get ready if you're a lightweight one will get you go going if you're a lightweight one we'll get you going but if you need a little more than one light up seven they're they get going good now you know you light them all or you can light one all right so it is smokable weed there's no way i do that if there's no way i could do that if this wasn't smoke but we this is decent weed okay there's there's not a lot of taste there it really just falls in the sativa category that's what's going on there so there's no point for really enjoying your bud the weed needs to be better but the convenience and the actual product is fantastic straight up fantastic these are quick you want to go out on the boat you want to even [ __ ] take a rip on the sea-doo you want to go up in a hot air balloon grab these like wherever you go you can just have these with you have these in your car have these in your glove compartment i just smashed through 10 retican readies the overall smoke was a little harsh a little dry there's not much flavor in there at all but the pure convenience of having smokeable weed rolled up into something like this to just have on you wherever you are and blast

another mastermind hit what's up everybody boy mastermind here for ohio cannabis live and we're talking about garlic cookies by riviera creek it's at 36 percent cac terpenes are lemony mercy and pineapple and as you can see it still comes in a bag this time we didn't get the box i still think riviera creek should change the packaging to maybe some type of jar i do like the box riviera creek this is my first time trying the garlic cookies at 36 percent i've tried many other batches i think i've bought like 15 bags total of garlic cookies since october of last year so i've definitely had success with this particular strain it's been good for my pain and anxiety and it's also been useful for me in the evening the buds are pretty much average size buds for this type of product as far as with frivolour creek they're not bad but um they could always uh be bigger but uh it's only 2.8 so i say they're pretty giving me some pretty nice size nugs here the smell is pretty much the same even

ago and totally forgot the smoke glad i put a stick in it that'll help a lot with the airflow my favorite thing about these is the wood mouthpiece but also you can fit a lot of weed in this [ __ ] towards the top of it i put a little bit of sour diesel crumble so i'm hoping it'll burn slow and evenly but i figured i'd spark this up and answer a couple q a questions that you guys left me on my youtube channel [Applause] probably gonna lit this with a lighter but [ __ ] it [ __ ] that's so smooth damn that's like rancid in a good way for some reason gmo and all these like garlicky and skunky strains have just given me like a newfound appreciation for horrible smells i don't know what it is but have you ever like driven past a skunk ever since you started smoking weed and you're like damn is someone sparking up some fire or did someone just run over a [ __ ] skunk oh yeah that's where the oil is [ __ ] all right let's get into the first question okay this question is from kane williams he asks how quickly can you roll a backwood very slowly i can roll one as slow as backwood burns i've probably only rolled like two or three in my entire life i'm not a big blunt guy so if i'm smoking it backwards chances are somebody else was rolling up i know everybody knows backwoods and everyone's on the backwood craze right now but personally it's just not for me i love good joy i don't know why there's just something about the pureness of just like the paper with the weed like all you taste is weed you don't get that russian cream [ __ ] taste it's like just straight weed that's what i want when i smoke i won't weed crypt asks what do you think of brands marketing their products as desired effects rather than by strain and genetic from a marketing standpoint i totally get it they're trying to market to the least educated and most confused consumer because especially if somebody doesn't know what they're consuming and get something that they don't want they might have a horrible [ __ ] time like if you're trying to chill out and you have really bad anxiety and you don't smoke a lot you consume a sativa you might freak the [ __ ] out or if you're just trying to like be high and enjoy yourself and you have a heavy indica you're like [ __ ] couch locked and you're like oh we just makes me lazy and useless like there's different effects that these different strains get and sometimes when people hear indica and sativa they don't really understand it i thought it would help for a sec definitely not but i think you still need to understand that the heavy users are the ones that are coming back every day and those are the ones that understand the difference between sativa indica hybrid different terpenes etc so as long as they still put like indica on there i totally understand if they write relax on the cover just so the inexperienced consumer can kind of get an idea for what they're getting this is gonna get me lit as [ __ ] it's only nine o'clock in the morning this is gonna be a long day super breezy 100 asks is youtube your full-time job or do you have another job youtube is not my full-time job but like what i do here is kind of my full-time job like i don't get paid from youtube if you watch an ad on my youtube channel i'm not getting that money i don't know who is but i make all of my money in the cannabis industry through marketing products or advertising or selling glass through my snapchat i also help companies with their marketing and branding not just advertising myself i'll help run their pages for them but it's all weed related like all of my money has come one way or another through the cannabis industry we got a long way to go there's about four grams of wheat in this there might have been a little bit more actually but these luxe rolls can fit a [ __ ] on a weed kalili 1997 asks what's your favorite temperature to take dabs in degrees i use a timer so i don't know the exact temp but it's somewhere in the like 650-ish temperature probably i really want to get one of those terp thermometers that you can like put on your banger that like tells you the exact temperature you're dabbing at one of these days well dude asks have you ever grown your own or have you ever had any interest in doing a small home closet grow i've never grown before but i do want to do it but i want to do it when it's like actually illegal because i want to do it publicly like i want to grow for my first time and make it like a series on this channel or on my snapchat or something where i post the progress and what i'm doing and people can kind of chime in and you know if you have had experience you can kind of give me some advice or if you've never done it before you can kind of do it along with me but pennsylvania has not legalized the homegrown laws yet but hopefully one day they will because these prices are [ __ ] stupid so [ __ ] super smooth stream i totally understand the hype in gmo whoo this shit's great all right i'm taking too long on these questions we're gonna be done this thing before we've done the questions justin asks how long do you think it'll be until weed is legal in all of the us probably like another five years i'm gonna say at least i don't see either trump or biden putting it into effect honestly it's probably gonna be legal in all 50 states before it's federally legal our only saving grace is that coronavirus makes it so that the economy is so bad that they just have to legalize weed to give it a boost but i don't really know how much that would help because economy is going to be [ __ ] zomboys88 what's the best tasting strain of weed that you've ever smoked probably kosher tangy i've said this before a million times but i love the fruity flavored strains but especially the ones that have an orangey strain there right up my alley and kosher tangy is so fire danny asked do you prefer smoking on flour or concentrate more and have you ever thought about doing a meet-up for your followers to smoke and chill with you [ __ ] that was rough i dab more but i honestly prefer smoking flour i just dab because it's kind of more considerate but there's something special about flour like that's how i was introduced into weed and it's just such a beautiful product i just always have to say i truly prefer it overdabs and yes i have thought about doing a follower meet up i've actually wanted to do like a smoke sesh lounge in colorado where it would have been totally legal but then corona happened so it just was out of the picture maybe in a year or two once all this coveted [ __ ] cools down and people can like do that and maybe pennsylvania laws even cool down i would love to do one in philadelphia like that would be my dream if i could do some sort of like fan meetup in philadelphia legally i would love to do that so maybe one day but really right now it's just not in the cards okay this is getting rough [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah this shit's like super super roachy and i got a little ways to go so i'm not looking forward to the rest of this definitely loving that gmo high though just medicinal ass have you ever tried medical cannabis in florida also what would you say contributed to your success in the cannabis industry i have gotten medical weed from florida before it is pretty fire i only smoked it once and i was really [ __ ] up i was in atlantic city in a limo going home with the clout crew and some random person in our limo had it and i don't even know who they were but i remember seeing it and looking at it and smelled good and we smoked it but uh i can't like really digest the high of it like i was [ __ ] up at the time and i probably only had like three to four hits you know it's not like i really have delved into the medical scene in florida but a lot of you guys snapped me and it looks pretty fire over there so hats off to florida [ __ ] oh and uh to the second part of your question honestly i feel like it's mainly the connection i have with the people that watch these videos i love talking to you guys especially on snapchat i feel like i really get to know a lot of you guys and i it's weird i pretty much could like go to any city in the world and have like someone to sesh with it's it's like a really weird like friendship i have with you guys and a lot of you guys have been watching me for a long period of time like shout out to the new guys too y'all to homies but but the guys that have been watching me for a long time you guys have continued to support me there's people that have bought you know dozens of glass pieces off of me there's people that have you know i have messages saved from three four years ago on snapchat like that you know i have some people that really support and watch my videos and that's what's contributed to my success so far is that i got those real ones out there and i appreciate you guys for real like i'm not trying to get corny but uh that's really what's contributed to my success anyone can get a camera and smoke weed on the internet but to have a group of people that like watch you and like anticipate your videos every day or like you know on youtube i'm not every day i'm sorry i want to be but i'm just not right now but to just have a group of people that like anticipate your videos like if i don't post for three four days on youtube i have people commenting like yo where the video is at and if it's not for that you don't have success because if people don't want to come back you're not going to have success i don't know i don't even know if that really answered the question but thank you to everyone that's watching this let's just take a minute and say thank you to you guys if you're watching this for real thank you all right next question and joins out we gotta realize like this [ __ ] okay so pascal asks what's the most intense way you've ever smoked weed just curious um probably that stupid-ass gas mask that was pretty intense i'd say more intense than that like i've hit a couple heavy rigs that were like you know thirty thousand dollars that i was like all right this is like insane if i drop even his carb cap i owe him three grand ren s the question we all wanna know go to munchie um i've been actually struggling to find like my go-to munchie recently i've been mixing it up but you know what you really can't go wrong with like a reese's cup that's probably my go-to something like chocolate that and like wash it down with a soda i think i might have answered this question before and that might have not even been the same answer but i'm high right now and i just was like you know that's what i would go for leave a comment below and let me know what your go-to munchie is santos asked what was your dream job when you were growing up when i was a little kid i always wanted to be an actor i don't know why it just kind of seemed like a fun job so i always wanted to just like imitate movies and stuff that i've seen but then when i was in middle school and stuff it actually changed i wanted to be like a professional like cinematographer or editor that was always like my dream job but then i just kind of turned into a youtuber i don't really know what happened you guys could still chase your dreams don't let me disappoint you i'm just [ __ ] around honestly like the film industry's kind of [ __ ] especially with covet i'm not mad that i turned out the way i did this thing keeps going out keep talking too much [Music] ziki asks how's piper doing how's she liking the house in pa piper is great i'd show you her right now but she's not here she's with my girlfriend at her parents house she's loving pennsylvania she's meeting all my friends but honestly the only issue was our house is a little too small my girl moved into my condo with me and like it was the perfect size for just me but for the two of us it's just not big enough she has a real job where she doesn't just smoke weed on the internet and go like hey guys check out this bong so sometimes if she's like having meetings and i'm trying to smoke weed on the internet it just doesn't really work out well but we actually just bought a house i'm so excited it's so much bigger than the house we're in right now i love the area it's in it's not too far from where i'm already from but that house will be even better for piper so that'll be nice and it will also be nicer for my girlfriend and i because i can film videos and be allowed while she can have her serious meetings in her office and i can be in my office and we can you know do our own thing but that means i'm going to have a new studio i'm totally going to switch it up i'm not totally sure what i want to do yet but i've had the table that i'm on forever really since i've started popcorn this has so much nostalgic feelings to me but it's honestly like covered in weed and dirty as [ __ ] and honestly kind of ugly looking so i want to get something a little sleeker so i'm going to change up the entire setup so i'm excited for that you're still gonna have a couple more videos in this setup because we don't actually move in for a couple more weeks but the days of the videos in this room will be coming to an end we will be getting a new studio and i'm super excited to bring you guys along for the journey putin asks lmao randomly spotted you and his zach goes to vid are you cool with him yes that goes is my good friend he's a good guy candice asks what type of camera do you use for recording or type of software to use for editing i use a canon g7x and for editing i use final cut x it's really not that intricate it's a pretty simple setup for the most part i am going to upgrade the camera sooner or later or at least add another camera but while it's one-man show it's just so much easier to use the canon g7x jessica s and this awful iso drought what are you using to clean your pieces i've been buying all the expensive [ __ ] i know there's cheaper options and people have been telling me acetone nail polish remover just warm water which i just don't think does the job well enough for me i've just been buying the expensive cleaners because it's a [ __ ] all you can find is 70 rubbing alcohol right now and even at that point 70 is scarce christian asks when will you accept fan mail i've honestly never considered that but if that's something that you would be interested in leave a comment let me know i'll open up a p.o box and maybe we can make that like a fun little series on my channel alright last question and we are definitely at the end of this ryan asked how did you get into the industry i filmed myself and posted pictures of weed on the internet and uh i grew a following so that's how i got into the industry i'm not really like certified in the industry i just have a account where i smoke weed on the internet honestly but if you're looking to get into the industry yourself find what part of the canvas industry you like and get into it if you like doing retail you're going to need to get a license but it's not that hard to get if you like growing and cultivating that's a little bit harder but you can do it take a couple classes you know just just do it bro it's really not that hard find what you want to do and do it i personally have always loved making videos and creating content and there's this little niche of

Valentine's Day welcome back to Fremont care I'm Nicola today we are reviewing cookies khush it's a free review for high integrity caregivers so we have reviewed this one before but it was the bottom of the batch so we are gonna go for it again this is a very fresh new batch of cookies squish mmm she's a beautiful smelter she has a sweet floral fragrance II type of smell let's see what we have going on with this strain so cookies cush it is a indica dominant hybrid it ranges which with a 70/30 indica its THC is between 15 to 18 percent with a CBD of 3% and remember as the CBD goes up you're gonna find that the head euphoria is gonna kind of come down some so it does help with that cookies push is an indica dominant hybrid strain created as a cross of the delicious Girl Scout cookies and Rolex push strains this a bud was bred to be sold in coffee shops in Amsterdam and offers a moderate THC levels that range from 15 to 18 percent average with the CBD levels from 1 to 3 percent the high brought on by cookies Kush can be slightly confusing to some as it involves the coming together of opposite effects upon the onset you'll be hit with an immediate sedated affect that leaves you red-eyed and lethargic hmm sounds lovely this accompanied by a sativa cerebro stimulation that gives you a mellow waves of energy in other words you'll be lazy and at ease yet energized enough to function if need be because of these effects cookies Kush is said to be ideal for treating patients with stomach cramps chronic pain muscle spasms and depressant depression these have a medium-sized to grape sized bud so I would actually like to point this blood out to you these buds are actually pretty good size they're pretty good density when the pictures go online you'll see this particular bud weighed about a gram and a half so they're they're very dense and very nice this bud has an aroma sweet pungent lime taste of sweet lime with the after akin of sour Granny Smith apple it sounds interesting so let's check it out smells so yummy looks amazing that's amazing I left the colors all the way through that's what I love the most about being able to cut these or break them open and see those greens this one's kind of a funny strand it has like four different colors of green in it just ranging in the different you know between light and dark dear I've got a pretty good stem to it please healthy I like that oh yeah you can really smell that lime in there it's the sweet it's more of a floral limey type of flavor herb smell flavor we got so now that I have a beautifully clean bomb clean Bowl so the way I can get a perfect test out of this let's pack this baby I love this bond you have such a good Bowl to it so do you guys up to today anything fun that's lighter yep there's a line I remember correctly this one had two highs to it so it had this first cerebal where you start relaxing with this particular strain I can feel it relaxing in my shoulders before I can feel it anywhere else every strain is kind of different with me some of them will hit me right between the eyes some of them in the sinus areas some of them in my neck it depends on where I'm carrying my stress right then so um this one I can feel in my shoulders this one doesn't have a real harsh peppery taste or peppery burden to it which is really nice [Music] pomegranate kind of like a little bit of a pomegranate taste to it okay now I can start feeling it in my throat it's not a bad throat it's not like a burning feeling it's kind of a little tightness which is I'm kind of glad that that happened this time because I've run into some people that have that have had this problem and they thought that maybe they were having an allergic reaction or it freaked him out and that's not the case it's just the way that the strain hits some people it hits me in the throat as soon as I let it relax I can get my throat to calm down and relax that's when I'll start feeling the cramping to start calming down it's kind of what signals me to go okay it's time to relax when I can feel it in my throat kind of a weird thing I just had to learn over the last several years with the different strains on what the starting effects are like because they don't all feel the same which is kind of funny because you would think that they would be pretty close but they're not I've had some that'll knock me on my ass and then I haven't had to have that had that happened in a long time I said but I've had strains that have given me enough energy to go out clean I've had strains that have taken me out of almost out of complete pain and that's why I keep a tasting journal and I recommend that you guys do this as well I'm gonna put a little sample on the website so that way you guys can kind of see but my tasting journal has all kinds of information in it and then what I do is I take and I print out my reviews and staple them into my tasting journal this was given to me by a really good friend I think um see you're awesome but something like this is really kind of a a great idea to kind of because I know that when I go to the dispensary or when I go out night I do reviews I've done so many that sometimes I can't remember when I'm standing at that counter what something is and what it has done for me we all know our our our Safety's but if we wanted something specific I could never remember when I get to the counter so with this little book I can take it with me and go through and I'll be finishing this up today each little tag is for each review each one will have a colored dot on it to signify its place what I like the most and that's how it is each one tells me who grew it so I know where I got it I know the date of which I got it from tells me what it is is it indica is it a sativa is it a hybrid I put the percentages the breakdown down it so if it's a 70/30 I put 70 and 30 in there just because I want to know it I want to know who the parent strains are because I'm trying to finish learning the rest of this with infusion so I I document all of this you don't have to go that far you could go as easy as getting a journal writing down the name of the strain and then just writing a quick review as to it you know hey I really like this one it caused you know the pain to stop or it really really stimulated my appetite and I needed that I really really suggest that especially for those of us that are getting a little bit older those of us that have been through cancer treatments those of us that have chemo fog and fibro fog and just freakin being a live fog we all need a reminder and it's easier this way than it is to sit there and like scroll through an app at least this way I have it all organized I can flip exactly to where I want to go to and it keeps me there and this is how I keep all of my stuff going I've n write little notes in here as to if I want to infuse it into something because I think it would taste really good with the terpenes because you're terpene guides are also in here which is really neat so I will match them up in this book as to how I want to do the next let's say batch of caramel or the next full dinner I want to do I want to do a Mexican dinner Mexican food I'm just I don't know anybody who doesn't love Mexican food it's just so good I love it and I'm gonna infuse all of it and so I start with my ideas here I start going oh yeah this would be really good in this and so I'm gonna go back through here when I go to do my entire Mexican food spread and I'm gonna infuse from these journals so that's how I keep my mind straight it's not easy anymore so as always if you guys have any questions throw them suckers down below if you guys liked anything we talked about today hit that like button

cannabis critique here on the channel this is what the channel was made for that's why it's named cannabis critique this is the very first strain review I'm finally through the Mandarin cookie strain and I got a lot to tell you guys all about it first let's break down the basic info Mandarin cookies is actually a pretty rare strain it's a sativa dominant strain about 70 30% from what I found on the internet I know my bottle claims it's a 50/50 but if you look closely at my bottle you can see that they just put the Mandarin cookies sticker over the top where the name is so this 50/50 hybrid thing doesn't apply to the Mandarin cookies string I purchased it over at Rhys Effingham I gave you guys a great review over in my last video talking about my experience at Rice Effingham it was great the strain was grown by Nature's Nature's grace and wellness there out of Vermont Illinois who knew that was a city in Illinois I had no idea I tested in at 22.8 3 THC a and point four nine percent THC for a grand total of twenty three point three two percent THC and from my experience from this strain I felt it was kind of a little bit weak for the percentages I love the high was a good mix of relaxed and uplifting which is what you would expect from a hybrid strain again not a very strong long high in my opinion but it was a good high a lot of medical patients rave about this one for its pain benefits I don't experience a whole ton of pain so I can't tell you a lot there but for me it did induce a lot a lot of munchies and I don't know if that's because I'm at home more with the coronavirus but I was definitely snacking pretty heavily on this weed and it's a great it's a great strain if you want to get things done this isn't a strain where you're gonna smoke it and be like I just need to sit on the couch it's a it's a very it's a very mild high it's a good good strain to smoke at at home if you're trying to get some stuff done at the same time I tasted very fruity on the inhale and on the exhale it tasted very very rich it almost like a baked good so I thought the name Mandarin cookies very fitting for this strain the smell of it was sort of odd it kind of smelled like a firework to me when you opened up the jar when it was full of flour it smelled exactly like the fourth of July or something there's a very kind of an odd smell the break up for this weed was a little bit iffy as well it's kind of hard to break up with your fingers I know a lot of people are like oh my god you're breaking up your bottle with your fingers that's normally what I do this bud was a little bit hard to get apart into like smaller pieces to get it nice and smokeable if you put it in a grinder it did grind up very very well but it kind of got a little bit too fine some of the time for my liking overall the appearance this bud was very very very very pretty in my opinion you saw the shots of it at the beginning of this video I had a lot of purple in it a lot of light green and some orange hair so definitely a thumbs up on the appearance for me there overall I give this bud about a seven point eight out of ten seven point eight I think a slightly above average bud but nothing that blew my socks off again this is the a mandarin cookie strain from nature's grace and wellness out of mont illinois and thanks for sticking with me through this very first strain review

they're people", "ZE78XtwbN1A": "[Music] guys welcome we're here in corona california at the next master smash lab we're uh going to roll you a two ounce can of gar something i like to enjoy on a saturday afternoon with 20 of my 20 20 25 of my closest friends um and what we have here to start the tools that we have are all sitting on the table we're using another smasher touch for our our rosin extraction we're going to extract 14 grams here of rosin we're going to coat the uh can of gar and a blank de brasil and put a snake on it and we're going to wrap in our thca isolate here and then we're going to drop in rosin droplets throughout the layers of our canagar we're going to start we're going to pack it with four different strains to give it a variety of layers we're going to layer in some diamonds along the way wrap the entire canigar with a hemp wrap at the end and we're gonna put a wood tip on it okay so we can enjoy it it takes about two ounces of flour to make this canagar i guess it'll last for about three uh three and a half hours get 25 to 40 people about as high as you ever want to get and a great conversation piece so stay tuned and follow along all right guys so to make this canogar what we have here is we have a parchment paper uh nug smasher dab tool we're gonna extract uh seven grams at a time in a 37 micron gram bag and that's what we're gonna do first to get this started then we're gonna grind uh each of these up uh with our grinder here and start to pack our kindergarten [Applause] all right very good that's that good make sure that was set right while i packed the bags i'm going to pack the bags bottle text style inverting the bottom corners you can see here as they're overlapping here and i'll get a little smaller yield with the uh using a 37 micron not much but i'll get a super clean product and that's what i'm hopefully after so hopefully the flour is pretty nice pretty fresh [Music] so basically when i pack a bag bottle tech style i want to just pack it even i don't want to be real forceful with the flower i'm not trying to smash the trikes into the into the plant material at all i'm just trying to fill all the voids so that i get a real even extraction and that it maintains that even surface area that i've initially intended for which is a bag that collapses directly down on itself with an accordion-like effect i want to make sure it folds up like that so it's a nice little present you can see how how the bag looks that's one bag again what we're using is 7 gram 37 micron bags for the extraction here that's what i'm packing up [Music] i like to use something like that just so i hook the corners in nice that gives you again your even surface area that is predetermined [Music] [Applause] all right so now we got both our bags packed just gave it a trim there and we slide that in like so once you get one in you can stick the magnet on it holds it up nice you get the other one in you can tuck it down like a little present here and most people don't realize this but you know common sense thing you want to make the last fold the one that's on top that wants to slide in like this [Music] again it's all about holding that surface area and now at this time we're gonna check we're gonna go 700 material psi we got two seven gram bags and 205 degrees [Music] looks like a real nice color real buttery like i'm after oh god it's gorgeous looking though [Music] okay beautiful material [Music] nice smashing touch all right so we got our rosin let's see what it weighs 2.7 grams okay we're starting with the first strain here we're gonna go ahead and grind up the first eighth here [Applause] so this is the base for this canagar it's um it fits in seven grams fits real good in this and that usually if you layer it right and do it right it usually makes for um like i said somewhere two and a half plus to three and a quarter hours of uh good smoke and they'll stay stay going the whole time get everybody high as hell all right so basically what i got is i make a piece of parchment take a piece of parchment and i like to use kirkland parchment from costco and i cut it to about that shape you can see about the size of it and then i i curl it roll it like this and i roll it around the tube that i have this little stainless tube also a straw from a drink straw or a you know one of the yeti cup straws work great but anyway i roll it around that and um stick it in the nug packer and then i make sure that the when it's rolled at the bottom of the parchment's all the way at the bottom the material will stick to the inside of the nut packer so you need this parchment to remain intact all along the way so you got to be careful of that and if it takes you one or two times so it does it takes me one or two times often you know too so just is what it is it's the nature of the beast so i stick the uh the uh hole in there make sure it goes all the way to the bottom and i start packing flour in there i'll go on one side and i'll go back to the next and i like this little card that the nug packer comes with the instruction card for the nug packer to scoop my flower it's real good so it gets it all back you know gathers it back up now you have to be careful in the beginning you can see how that the rod slight slid right through once i start packing it in it won't do that then i like to take a straw once i got a little in there i'll start working it down real gently like i said you want to watch your uh your uh parchment and make sure that your rod's right in the center as you're packing it down and also if you have if your flower's a bit dry you want to make sure that you have a steel water and this will help the flower stick and it'll help it compact all the way through and take your time with it you know work it all the way around and this straw has a little serrated side on one side and then it has a straight flat side on the other but you want to pack the hell out of it you want to be a tight good pack and like i said sometimes it takes two or three times you can take your time with it right so let me see what i got working so far okay so what started to happen here and this is great that's what i want to show you guys what started to happen and often will and people give up on it is the bottom of the parchment started to pack in see it there and it started to compact at the top but the bottom it was all loose so what happened was i put too much flour in in the beginning and i didn't pack it enough in the beginning so we're going to redo this one this is a do-over [Music] all right so it takes a few times to get it right sometimes but what you do it's usually pretty good [Music] [Music] i suggest doing this if you're going to do it with the very best quality flower you can find or grow [Music] okay so we got three more flavors to put in all right flavor too [Music] it's a little morsel here i'm gonna give it a little juice on it [Music] it's thick enough here that we can get that down there won't stick to the stem and cause that some turbulence when we're pulling that out [Music] also i like doing that i wasn't in there too around a little isolate there but it also glues everything together nice once you get your base formed you can be a little you know a little more or less fragile with it as you can tell and things start to go a little faster still don't get too cocky just take your time with it a little at a time pack it in thin layers are good [Music] okay now we're almost at the halfway point you know this is the talked about point at this point once you're down this far everybody that's involved has already got a pretty [ __ ] good buzz going so i'd like to put a little zingers in here and there and throw a little diamond here and in there and just drop it right in keep packing away [Music] like i said you'll fit right at seven grams compact a little more eight nine you can get [Music] we're gonna go to start we're starting to go to some of our fruity flavors because that's how i like to engineer my candy go [Music] okay so at this point i'm gonna add a little more of the rosin droplet in there with a bath and thca [Music] fish it down layered up it's like baking a layered cake you know [Music] exciting isn't it [Music] okay now we're headed to strain number [Music] four labor four baby [Music] it's right between that one i like to drop a couple diamonds [Music] all right that's our last flavor going in the top here [Music] [Music] so yeah this might take you 20 minutes or so but it's well worth it [Music] we're close i think we've got about eight and a half minutes so far [Music] all right so let's see what we got here [Music] guys okay [Music] it's going to be a long snake and then the other is going to be a wrap you can see how brittle it is [Music] you gotta go relatively quick with this because of the consistency of the material being so shattering yeah it's nice to and then once i get it kind of funnel shaped like that that'll wrap nice i'll stick it up where it's kind of warm up here just so it's plow palatable if you will because of the the consistency of the material so you gotta get it warm to work with it so now what we're gonna do is we need long snakes you just gotta kind of work it everybody's got their own secret to this [ __ ] but [Music] [Music] so [Music] okay so i gotta heat it up cool it down heat it up so i like to stick it onto the edge here and then start to roll it [Music] and then when you get it about half rolled like so you a lot of times can take the if you could see that how that that's separated there so a lot of times you can do that and then you like to just you know keep it warm as you're doing it and then kind of roll it up so it's kinking the paper if you will like this again see how it's kinking the paper there and then you can kind of hold this here [Music] pull your rosin off [Music] so now you got your can of gar completely covered in just beautiful top shelf solventless rosin okay now this we're gonna get the rest of this because at this point we're gonna have to put a hemp wrap on this thing to wrap it up and put the tip on it i do like hemp wraps um i don't like to taste the tobacco in this at all the blunt wrap at all but everybody has their own preference now these wraps are kind of um they're fairly dry and to really cure right and hold everything together you need to get them kind of wet so don't be afraid to get these things wet and work the distilled water you have and you know don't soak them in water but get them nice and wet with the sprayer work them in with your fingers you want to make sure your tips on there nice and straight let's start it here you want to work it in take your time with it if anything's not quite wet enough stop and get it wet again that's our first initial seal on there um now obviously i don't like the paper any thicker than this i try to keep it just one layer up here where i'm smoking it but when i get down to the tip you know these these are often handed around to many people so i like to take some straps as you'll see and i'll strengthen the tip up where we're not going to smoke [Music] yeah it smells great i like that little fruity flavors on all these things you know it's just that's a lot i like it that's why i put the fruit at the end so you taste it first off so it gets you warms you up like oh that tastes nice so people that may be otherwise turned off from it or turned on to it so it was like that okay so now what's left is to strengthen this tip here [Music] i might need to use one more like i said i usually use two and a half or so [Music] sometimes [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so that should make it for a real nice smoke so now we're gonna let that that uh the water evaporate and dry let it set up okay now we need to make a snake and we're gonna make a snake uh wrap the snake all the way around it once it's dry and then roll the snake in isolate and then we're going to line the tip with diamonds all right no really easy way to roll a snake with [ __ ] shatter so you gotta use warmth and a lot of parchment [Music] just upright temperature and i'll start moving you like my snakes so far it's more like a worm there we go there we go there we go oh there we go don't stop me now it's still a worm slightly bigger one but i finally got my count okay so let's zero this [Music] 1.2 that's close right about a gram okay [Music] [Applause] so now i got some thca some isolate just gonna get it warm between the plates here so then i'm gonna wrap this in isolate [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] so guys here you go that's the uh that's the kind of guard it's going to last you two and a half to three hours um gonna get 20 to 30 of your closest friends high as hell and uh this is an absolute key to the life of the party enjoy and make sure you smoke daily",

oh that's a conspiracy theory so they can actually have a alien talking to somebody on the news hey telling you some some alien [ __ ] and you go back and I tell y'all a man this alien was on the news and sent some alien [ __ ] y'all gonna say what conspiracy theory the government is not stupid y'all so just pay attention everything they put the two right in your face manner right there everything is not conspiracy theory everything is not completely the truth but everything is not completely false either you understand what I'm saying only then is completely false is the [ __ ] that they're telling us that's only that's completely false which leads me to believe that we have to do our own research so when I give you guys this information I'm just giving you information you decide for yourself whether you want to believe it or not and run with it do what you do is it I'm not saying whether I believe it or not but a lot of stuff that's coming out it's from people that are directly involved with the situation at hand either news reporters or people talking about news reporters or doctors or whoever they are those are the people that are involved anyway you guys I'm going above time I got to get you guys out of me because y'all got to go to work y'all have a beautiful blessed purely legendary day pure positive energy to every one of y'all man made all of y'all be blessing me everything you put your hand to be successful you only got to go home but you got to get the hell out of here and stay back", "T21vOKfgJ34": "[Music] i love multi-stream reviews because i think of all the videos i do this one really offers the most information and today is a special day because we're gonna review cookies one of los angeles's or i should say california's most famous marijuana brands and they bring endless amounts of strains and so far i've been able to collect up 33 different strains from cookies but they're not all the same some are better than others and i'm going to go through all 33 strains that i picked today and just briefly tell you about them just a little bit and tell you which one i like better because if you go into the store we're really looking for the best and if you can pass by some of the other ones pass by them right why do you have to try all 32 to figure out the top five and really we're looking for the top best cookie strains and this one is the winner and this thing is just beautiful it's sticky grinds up real nice we're gonna pull off just one little piece right here i've already got some in there but just to show you how you can see it just breaks up like you can't imagine it's like meat off the bones i call it but we're going to grind it up and people ask me what kind of grind i use a couple times but you can see it's right on the bottom i'm using a santa cruz shredder and this is a really really good grinder but for people who get vapor cup there's a really good grinder that actually comes with it the same exact size as this so you don't really have to buy a grinder i just haven't used one of those because i've had this for a lot of years so i just keep using it but the the grinder that actually comes with vapor cup is incredible anyway we're gonna load just a little bit of this winter into vapor cup straw i've already got some in there we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this right down into the vapor cup and when we talk about the strains today i'm going to use vapor cup and in the end i'm going to disclose who the winner is and it's crazy as you go down to cookies and you can ask the bud tenders tips but most times they don't know and i would say that the strains change all the time and they don't let the blood tenders drive everything and i've had people even say to me we have so many kinds of how can i know but in the end of the day i know something and i think a lot of the people that post here know something and our aggregate knowledge is incredible so today i'm going to go through my 32 strains and people can make a comment to see where they if they agree with me don't agree with me or if i'm missing something here so anyway coming in at number 32 and my least favorite of all the cookie strains is something called ocean beach this flower has 22 percent thc and it's a hybrid and this is one of those flowers that really didn't get much attention from me i tried it it was just okay it was my least favorite of all the cookies strains i tried coming in at number 33 is ocean beach but we're moving up to even better flower and coming in at number 32 we have something called wedding crashers and this flower has 21 thc and it's indica and this flower was a little bit heady to me i actually didn't like it and i don't like the poopoo flowers but this flower i remember it being heavy meaning i felt it in my head i didn't like it and this was my 32nd favorite of all the cookie strains but we're moving on up and coming in at number 31 we have something called cheetah piss and it's funny because pistoring in general is very stemmy this actually wasn't very semi but this flower was just okay to me it has 24 thc and it's a hybrid and it was my 31st favorite of all the cookie strains but we're moving on up again and coming in at number 30 we have something called sweet tea this flower has 20 thc and it's a sativa and again it was just okay for me and it's funny as you looking for these better flowers for me the good flowers are heavy enough with focus they don't make me a [ __ ] and they'll just grim me out i don't want to feel anything in my head i just want to smile and go oh my goodness and that's what we'll win and sweet tea for me was just number 30 out of the 33 that i tried so there's definitely better than this one in my opinion but we're moving on up and coming in at number 29 we have something called pancakes and pancakes had gave me a real big beautiful giant bud this flower has 19 thc and it's a hybrid but for me it was just okay meaning all these flowers were good but there's some that are much better than others and for me pancakes was just that number 29 for me but we're gonna move on up on the list and coming in at number 28 we have something called pineapple punch and this flower has 21.72 thc and again this is one of those flowers it was just okay for me coming in at number 28. this is a sativa hybrid pineapple punch but we're moving up again and i think the key to this whole thing is we're going to get up to a level where these are better flowers and then the best flowers but for me these are at the bottom of the cookie strains that i bought so far but we're going to move on up coming in at number 27 we have something called docido this flower has 22 percent thc and it's an indica hybrid but we're still going to move up to better flower coming in number 27 is docido but we're moving on up coming in at number 26 we have something called the white runts and this flower has 19 thc which makes it the lowest of all the thc flowers i think on this whole list and including all the wrench strains this flower is a hybrid and i remember when i tried the other runs i tried a canopy crunch it just made me forget everything i tried a pink wrench by fire society was a killer but this one actually was not a killer and nah just okay coming at number 26 you have white runs by cookies but we're moving on up and coming in at number 25 we have something called purple drank this flower has 25 thc and it's an indica hybrid but we're gonna move up to even better flowers coming in at number 24. oops let me get this to stay coming in at number 24 we have something called animal land this flower has 27 thc and it's a hybrid but we're gonna keep moving on up because i think really this list the main point to get take away from this is what are the top 10 flowers what are those flowers that you didn't try that are at the top of the list that's the main point to pass by everybody there's so many good flowers to try coming in at number 24 animal land but we're moving on up coming in at number 23 we have something called mac and cookies this flower has 27 thc and it's a hybrid but we are moving on up to even better flowers coming in at number 22 we have something called wedding cake and this flower has 21 percent 21 thc and it's a hybrid and you can see i got a big mess going on over here i'm going to move stuff around a little bit and then coming in at number 21 we have something called purple bubba this flower has 23 thc and it's an indica and we're stolen just the good cookie flowers but these aren't the better flowers we're moving on up to even better flowers coming in at number 20 we have gmo cookies and this flower has 20 skins wait a second gmo cookies 27 thc and it's number 20 on the list and i stuck this straw in a very long time ago and i'm sitting over here and i haven't done anything on it so let me check it out you can see there's so much vapor i've got to be real careful this thing's going to kick my ass if you haven't tried vapor cup i'm telling you it's a game-changing item this is it's just unbelievable this flower is incredible now you gotta figure cookies gotta know something and to be the best cookie flower you really gotta be something ah let's keep on going all right coming in at number 19 we have something called gelati and i bought this twice you can see i've got it in a bag right here and i also bought it in a jar and this flower i think if i'm correct has 17.74 thc and the jar has 19 and what's crazy is i bought the jar and i forgot about this and i didn't really give it a very good score and then i bought this and this flower is actually better they're the same flowers same name look the same but it was just okay this flower got number 19 for me but we're moving on up and coming in at number 18 we have something called watermelon this flower has 20 thc and it's an indica but we're gonna move on up to even better flowers let me take another coming in at number 17. we have something called bundt cake and bundt cake has 27 thc and it's an indica but we're moving on up and i'm gonna blaze through these because i want to get up to the top ten coming in at number 16 we have something called papaya and it's got 23 thc and it's a hybrid but we're gonna blaze through it and here's where i think the flowers start to get a little bit better is number 15 we have something called the snowman and this flower got a lot of play from people and for people who liked it that's great but for me this was the 15th best of the cookie strings this flower 26 thc and an indica but we're moving on up again and coming in at number 14 we have something called banana bread and banana bread 30 thc and it's a hybrid but we're moving on up again coming in at number 13. we have something called millions og and millions og 28 thc and it's an indica hybrid but we're moving on up again coming in at number 12 we have something called honey buns and honey buns has 23 dhc and it's a hybrid and i think this is the next stop point and what i mean by that is the buds are about to start to get better again so let me do one more quick draw on this thing and it's funny for the flowers i like i'm telling you if you can get this flower with this thc this flower is one of the best of la i made the top 10 list coming in at number 11. we have something called raspberry sorbet and raspberry sorbet has 19 thc and this flower is an indica and you know what's crazy this flower gets no play but it is incredible out of vapor cup the flavor is good the feeling is good 19 thc which is really low and still really wonderful if you see cookies rubbery raspberry sorbet it's worth a try coming in at number 11. so now we're to the top 10. and once we get to the top 10 you're into cookies better flowers and i'm sure most people agree that these are the best cookies flowers just depends on the order so i hope people will comment below if you agree or don't agree everyone's got their favorites but i really went through these flowers and i think the best are the best so coming in at number 10 of all my favorite cookie strains georgia pie this flower has 26 thc and it's a hybrid but we're moving on up now the difference between all these flowers is as you get higher up on the list they become stronger and more euphoric both so when you get to the top of the list it's possible you could have the perma-grin smile i mean you're just so happy you don't really think about anything other than happiness and that's what the winner can do coming in at number nine we have a very hyped string called cereal milk but this flour was only my ninth favorite of the cookie strains 25 thc and it's a hybrid and we're moving on up coming in at number eight we have something called sticky buns this flower has 21 thc and it's a hybrid and we're moving on up again and now we're even coming to better flowers number seven now we're really getting into cookies better better flowers most big cultivations only have a couple good flowers and then over time those will go south because the mothers go south so you really got to take care to keep your good flowers good and number seven is somewhat is a lot of people's favorite it's number seven for me because it was just too heavy for me london pound cake number 53. now i know a lot of people are talking about london pound cake number 75 but mine is number 53 and for me this was a super heavy flour now for all the people watching the video that want me to get number 75 i'm going to grab it when i see it i want to compare that to myself but number 53 with 30 thc this was the heaviest of all the cookie strings for me coming in number 7 london pound cake and we're moving on up now we're into cookies for me the better better strange that i really liked and coming in at number six we have a flower called pomelo and this is an underplayed flower this flower has 24 thc it's an indica hybrid and it's really good i bought a bunch of this i gifted it to a lot of friends people like pomelo i think it's an underpaid excuse me an underplayed strain if you see it it's a grab pomelo coming in number six but we're moving up to even better strains coming at number five the top five of all the cookie strains oh my goodness coming in number five is berry pie by cookies and this flower has 26 thc and it's a hybrid and this is a stoney bologna flower super strong and it's funny as you look like a name like berry pie you wouldn't think it would be so strong but it really is and it's one of cookies very best strains coming in at number five berry pine but we're moving up to even better cookie strains and coming in at number four we have something called peach punch and i would say of the non-couch lock strange because like uh london pound cake for me was just a couch lock it was just too heavy it's only a nighttime stream for me but peach punch which is another one of those strains if you go down to cookies down in melrose and you ask what's your strongest they might say cookie because they said it to me this flower peach punch and there's other punches but it's got to be the peach punch 24 thc it's hybrid i think it's cookies strongest active flower of everything it's a really good one coming in number four you want cookies heavy peach punch but we're moving up to the top three everyone's trying to guess what's the top three what's the top three well we've got a newcomer coming in coming in at number three and this is in the market right now and i think everyone should run out there and try this flower you have something called blue cookies this flower's got 31 thc and it's a hybrid and i'm telling you this flower was real good it was strong it had focus i could think i could do my stuff i could run around it was strong it didn't grin me out but i'd say it was really a very active good heavy strain and i liked it and it's the best cookies in the store right now that i know of is blue cookies wow if you get a chance to buy this 31 thc this is one of the best flowers in the market right now congratulations cookies this is a good one blue cookies coming in at number three but we're moving on up the list and now we're at number two and this is one of my old favorites people don't knock it off the list i haven't seen it out there but it is incredible coming at number two j1p3 by cookies 22 thc this flower is an indica hybrid and what makes this flower so good is it just makes you feel alive you can do your daily chores you can be stoned to the bone feel good it's a winner i haven't seen this in the market for a while but i actually bought i'm gonna say an ounce to two ounces of this i gifted it i used it a bunch of times i still probably have a bunch of these old jars that i could stack up in one of these videos i have used so much j1 p3 by cookies it's just fantastic and it's number two but we're coming to the winner and here it is this is going to be the last draw oh my cup went off so you're going to see the cup went off it goes off every 18 minutes automatically so this way if you happen to fall asleep it just goes off it goes to idle actually and you can see this cup is heating up it's at 323 it's already back up at 3 30. and i'm gonna take one more draw this that's gonna heat up again in a second so the winner and number one of all the cookie strains the fierce the glove gary payton og this is that i'm doing today this is an original uh july 2019 drop with 23 thc i was able to get my hands on a couple bags of it it always makes me feel great i love this flower good job cookies good job gary payton it's such a winner if you see gary payton og it's definitely worth a try but check the thc also make sure it says maywood there's a little box on the back that says maywood you'll know it's grown in their home facility and i would say the best scary peyton what i'm told comes from maywood my batch is 23. if you see something let's say 23 up grab it i've seen gary payton og as low as 16 and then you know 16 23 it's not the same flower anymore right but if you see 23 of gary payton it's a winner and it's cookie's best flower that's what the doctor says thanks for joining in i'm going to take one last draw on the vapor cup if you want to get a vapor cup and i'm telling you there's no disappointment in this it's a game changer once you get this you stop smoking in time and i would say there's no you're like you're missing something this thing draws great the flavor is unbelievable the best in anything in the world and most importantly this thing will stone you to the bone with weed savings with flavor with no burnt throat incredible thanks for joining in i'm the doctor if

and topping them in top of them G so I mean they turned out really [ __ ] good but I think I stressed him out a little too much and that's why they came out besides they did but honestly this genetic was not much of a stretcher it doesn't yield very much so I mean I'm pretty happy with what I got out of this strain right here the quality is top-notch the smell is ridiculous let me show you another

__ ] set those right there finish untying these hoes hell yeah your boys mad exciting right now I mean I've been growing these ones for like almost four months for here they took quite a while they've been through a lot of [ __ ] like three different gross faces if I would have started them in this 8x8 they would have been [ __ ] massive G like I was expecting like five foot plants but due to my space that I was using man there was no way no possible way they were gonna get that [ __ ] big okay all of these plants were smashed in my tiny ass veg - in like my 2x3 they were smashed in that [ __ ] I had nine plants in there G like getting fat so um I moved him to the closet got him a little bit bigger and then I finally put him in here in this 8x8 and honestly they started stretching out even more once I cut the scrog but look I'm really excited for this next run I can't tell you how excited I am for it we're running all Auto flowers we're gonna be using seven gallon pots at least I picked up a bunch of cocoa and perlite we're gonna be switching from the soil sometimes I have problems with this Fox Farm soil being a little bit hot like my pH will be off quite a bit just from the start like I'll just use tap water when I first watering my plants and I'll still get a little bit of a burn I think that's just because sometimes a swell comes hot so we're switching to cocoa on this next one we actually received a sponsorship from Lotus nutrients so you guys can be expecting a video on that like I said homies in my return video nobody wants to like [ __ ] get at me and [ __ ] pretty sponsors and [ __ ] they say these weed tubers they say that we aren't advertiser friendly and [ __ ] so if you guys want sponsored you guys go out there and [ __ ] get them you know I'm saying you hit them companies up you let them know like you I got I think I'm saying I put in serious work you can check my reviews out of [ __ ] and then you will get a sponsorship gang you know I'm saying so if you guys are trying to make it out there on your YouTube channel make sure you guys stay active post a lot of reviews and [ __ ] and that'll really help you out you already know I support all my

thinking it looks a lot like animal cookies man I have no idea why they came out looking like this different than the rest of them but this phenol just the way it's stocked look just the way the bud

good vibes you know life hits you like crazy like I said my video you know life eats you out of nowhere you know it's just random [ __ ] that you don't expect you know you could be doing hella good have a good ass job you know have all your [ __ ] in order and all of a sudden something like that happens you know just like your whole world just comes crashing down but you always got to stay positive and just know that things will get better you know in life happens you know a lot of people I've been through a lot of [ __ ] just think about all the people before us you know they've been through a lot of [ __ ] you know and they're still here they still did it just think about your parents and stuff you know that's what I always think about because if they did it then we can [ __ ] do it you know we lose people and [ __ ] but I know we'll see him in the next one at least that's what I personally believe homies I believe there's another life out there I believe there's like another stage you know I believe this is just like a transition stage you know this is where we learn our lessons and stuff for the next life but that's just my personal opinion on that you are getting some rare talks right now from your boy king-chavez just get to chopping plant number wood five or six yeah this is plant number six all right play number six homies let's go and I still have one more plant because I had nine I have one more plant finishing up it has a couple more weeks on it's our forbidden fruit it stayed pretty [ __ ] small I was gonna do a solo cup challenge in it but I moved it up to like a two gallon pot so I kind of failed the Solo Cup challenge but are we going this one this one's a little smaller I don't like the structure on this one but this is because this one was way back before I had any of the good lights okay also I only started with two lights and they were shitty I only had a total of like 330 watts so with this upgrades all the upgrades that we did do the next girl is gonna be [ __ ] crazy only woman only want to stay too much about it homies but the next girl is gonna be just ridiculous I have some special some special packages arriving today that I am gonna be shooting a video for as well there's gonna be video all week so I'll just be expecting that it's got something special arriving that's gonna complete this grow tent and is this grow tents get me on a whole another level man I ain't gonna have to worry about my environment at all everything is gonna be in lock my temperature my humidity all that take these ones right here after I chopped this last plant gang your boys gonna hop off the stream and then we're gonna finish this video for you guys um it'll probably drop tomorrow or Thursday so just make sure you guys stay tuned today today's Wednesday so yeah Thursday we're Friday I'm already stoned to the bone boys okay so this one right here y'all can see the structure on it this one's more like a rib cage or something like a [ __ ] skeleton i lollipop the [ __ ] out of it at the bottom and that's why there's no buzz down here but that's what most people do but I was expecting these to stretch a lot more than they did so that's why I lollipop them like this it's Thursday G today is Thursday huh holy [ __ ] gang your boys stoned to the bone that's what happens when you'd be grinding non-stop geez what [ __ ] day's be blending together I've been smoking non-stop Bobby blazing even Warren got all this personal weed right here sweet our last plant right here homies I hope you enjoyed this little livestream I

of King Chavez video I show my whole setup from like start to finish you can get a really good idea of what I'm working with we started out super low budget and now we are pushing up towards like the intermediate yeah I'm saying because I know some people are rocking it like $10,000 tents and [ __ ] so I ain't pushing that yet but we will get there homies you already know elevated gang is nothing but evaulation made that [ __ ] word up and we're gonna keep using it all right geez so last plant rare plant number eight our sunset cookie put this thing right here because I actually took this look how I took this for some reason I don't even know why I did this I actually tucked the plant inside like the [ __ ] handle since I had to be in high when I did that it's alright I'll just cut it don't matter I'm replacing these pots and I'm actually getting seven gallons these ones are five gallons the last plant homies there we go and y'all see it right there elevated gang chopped down all our

cookies by moxie [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so today we're checking out orange cookies by moxie starting off our Hashi Halloween and I couldn't be more excited about it yeah I'm stoked I haven't had some moxie in a while and this stuff sounds delicious just with the name and you know that they always kill it so really start to check it out Halloween being one of my favorite holidays couldn't be more excited we are gonna bring you guys a few special episodes in a row here we're doing a hash eating magnet foxy so we're gonna be doing a few constant trig reviews I'm gonna be all Moxie for the next couple of videos and you know we couldn't be more excited to be dabbing the best of the best in town so we're gonna go ahead and open this up give it a smell [Music] hmm yeah yep yep yep mm-hmm so right off the bat you know you got that out of that orange just coming straight through I can tell right away this is either made from Orange Crush oranges ADA or L'Orange you know I'm thinking Orange Crush by the way that they named it don't have the proper you're not genetic so forgive me moxie but that orange tangerine flavor is coming out full force on that oh yeah that it's like tangi over them but you get some sort of you get something different at the end of them it's like an earthiness that comes to Romo's like it's not a full tangi like it's almost lead Angela at the end it's that little hint of earthiness that's gonna mmm that's got some really really nice citrus smell to it and yeah I could definitely feel that little earthy undertone on it but mostly just getting a nose full citrus yeah I would say like it's like 70% on the orange and maybe 30% on the cookies in there maybe even less than that yeah but it's actually I mean you know there's a lot of batters and I smelled and really haven't had this strong of a odor yeah it's very very pungent in that sense it's got a lot of smell to it so this makes me even more excited to try it out for sure I'm hoping 100% that translates over to the taste all right so we're gonna check out the consistency on this now one thing I did want to know um a few minutes ago we actually got our dabs ready this is one of the more dry batters that we've seen you know Moxie's batters kind of range and kind of a GUI to a straight up just kind of dried out almost like a I don't know how would you guys describe that I mean it's I mean it's it's it's son unique texture it's a little bit like crumbly at points but then you it's a little bit more malleable in the sense that you can really kind warm into your dab tool right but at the same time it is a little bit of a pain to work with it's not my favorite consistency yeah I would say that if you have like a dabbler with a sharp edge on it you know like a traditional titanium tool like a kind of a flat edge this is gonna be real easy to get out but if you have some kind of a blunt a burr like my pencil here or something like that it's gonna be a little bit more difficult to manage so basically in this situation you just need the right tool for the job and you'll be fine but overall you know the color on this is phenomenal it's you know completely uniform throughout it I don't see any splotches of color any streaks in it it just looks super clean yeah I think that describes it perfectly it's like a sense of like almost like a butter mix or like a crumble because has that butter like texture to it but the consistency of that like crumble but yeah the color on that is just and just beautiful it's so light and just it looks like it's going to smoke so well and sorry I don't have to really get close up on this I'm so blind ya know that is a gorgeous gorgeous color on it it's like this like mustard yellow almost you know well as Nick mentioned there's no imperatives in this it's very clean medication it's very uniform across and it has you know one of my favorite parts about the the butters and batters to come out of Moxie is that they have this like perfect little rectangle shape which is nice if you're trying to you know adequately dose for one and then for two it just it's you know aesthetically pleasing for sure unlike my big stomach in this white wife-beater so let's go ahead and check this stuff out I want to get down to business let me get one more they're not showing yeah yep mmm yeah yeah mmm yep mmm all right so let's uh let's get to business here and uh get these bad boys fire it up [Applause] 17 bears I'm gonna kick your ass and I smell her panties well all right guys time for my favorite part it taste test so as always fire the hole [Music] [Music] [Music] is wonderful like talk about a terpene assault did you guys get that same like shotgun blast of citrus and not it that like literally completely enveloped my mouth and like went into my nostrils like that's just how powerful it was I mean like instantly you're greeted with a army of orange soldiers blasting orange ak-74 and just rain to the face but it's that is something I don't mind that I don't mind being absolutely massacred by the orange army you know no no this case tangerine grenades yeah you know I mean god damn I mean it's it's literally like I just walked into a giant orange and closed the door I'm not really getting a lot of cookies at all no it's it's just straight orange coming through there with that being said tastes amazing [ __ ] is phenomenal that orange like you said isn't it a complete annihilation of your palate but I can immediately say I didn't taste the cookies but I can sure as hell feel them like I just felt like kind of set back in my seat nothing too crazy like it it hit me like super and knocked me out but it slowly sedated me and came on like my heist like crept up and I just overall felt awesome and that taste just lingers my cup yeah you know I'm definitely for me it's a little bit more cerebral I'm having like a nice sativa buzz going on about feeling very focused and energized you know I could absolutely you know talk about propane with you for at least the next 15 minutes like that's how I feel Hauser's propane and propane accessories dim the hoods propane and propane accessories thank you and the I have them a little bit of that bomb body high but what it's primarily giving me as far as the the medicinal aspect there's a little bit more tension relief than the the pain relief in my opinion it's kind of relaxing me and my tensions gone but I don't necessarily feel a level of body pain relief and that's an analgesic in this case yeah I'm getting a whole lot of the sativa side from this one for sure I'm still tasting it by the way um yeah the sativa I mean it's just kicking my ass for some reason on this one I'm gonna take a little bit bigger of a dab that you guys I don't know but um I definitely feel pretty strong effects right now I got a nice sativa dominant high however I definitely feel a whole lot of body high in there as well which is nice I can feel that cookies coming through on that one but definitely you know a good balanced nice hybrid effect here still tasting oranges and you know I think this would be great for you know a day time medication great for someone that is looking for something to kind of get them that kind of body buzz but not a complete you know like matt said full on pain reliever i think this is more of a social thing i think this is definitely more of an uplifting get stuff done maybe you got stuff to do around the house you know you got a got the car to wash you know or you're actually just wanting to chill out watch a movie or something like that i think this would be a great kind of just cerebral nice feeling hi that would get you through your day good you feeling good yeah absolutely I couldn't agree with you more than I definitely think that this is a morning and daytime smoked something to help get you up and going I would this would be fantastic for me before a hike specifically that's what I'm thinking of right now see beautiful weather outside definitely recommend going but we're right before a hike if I had this nice level of energy and that there's also I feel like there's a nice sense of euphoria attached as well it's a nice uplifting feel a little great overall yeah thanks very good yeah so like the combination of that energy and the the euphoria would be perfect to start a hike out with but this is this has a lot of abuse for it I think that like you said if you wanted to focus like let's say you wanted to do bunch of homework this would be a great option and you know this would actually be kind of fun just thinking it back to the musician days like jamming and doing something creative this would be a great medication for yeah I can't agree with you more as far as that aspect of like a good social smoke this is something that you want to just have out with a bunch of rakes your closest house music just what's that shot you know and just this is such an uplifting high that gives you that sedation that you want that's not gonna walk you down but keep that euphoria going and just keep you upbeat because like you said I overall just feel great like I think we're all on that like that same that same plane for sure definitely you know for me guys it's it's hard it's hard not to give Moxie a Private Reserve you know I mean it's just they kill it they absolutely kill it you know I went into this with my hopes and you know what and not disappointed whatsoever 100% knocked it out of the park I am Golf Private Reserve for sure on this one guys yeah that's a no-brainer for me as well man from that translation from flavor to our the translation from the smell to that flavor that I felt was spot-on there's a lot of concentrates that we've tried that that just doesn't try this like you'll get sort of hints of it here and there but do not translation like that that's a direct crossover and the effects that's just that's the type of high that a lot of people seek and though that's the type of high that a lot of people really want to be able to be social and being out and about with friends and so overall like you said man killed it private reserve for sure yeah I get after grief you guys give this Private Reserve the aroma was excellent on this stuff and again like I said I really don't get that pungent of a smell from a lot of butters and this stuff was just on point the the taste was amazing I mean it was that nice Triss orange-like slap to the face and the effects are very heavy I mean it's a very heavy sativa feeling for me but at the same time you do get a little bit of that body high aspect from the cookie side but I definitely think that this is a very solid medication I have to give a private reserve yeah you know so three prior reserves across the board moxie you guys killed it you know I think that as far as anything that they touched with canna biotics ingredients in it you can't really go wrong we're gonna be checking out some more in future videos here and we're really excited just to see all the different terpene profiles and everything that they're doing I have a feeling everything's gonna be pretty good yeah be a nice hashey Halloween for sure that's gonna be a great happy Halloween thanks for sitting down with this while we checked out orange cookies by moxie again it's young fashion calm we'd like to thank you guys for watching and subscribing if there's any strains in the Las Vegas market you'd like us to check out leave it in the comments below again I'm bill I'm rusty Shackelford a long time juices roll", "8eCiY7TSj8s": "welcome to the shed this iced out images coming at you with another product review I've done a review on flower for this company one time I've tried an edible it ruined me that's all I really tried through this company as a whole ever so today we had got Troy gross extracts this one is cookies 3.5 premium flour the Detroit growers right there and says hashtag flavor kings so it says it's an indica hybrid took a dab probably like half hour 45 minutes ago so I'm still feeling the effects on that a little bit but we're going to a twist that and crack it for the first time it's gonna take me a minute to roll so bear with me let's see what this smells like oh oh yeah that's the [ __ ] I'm talking about pretty compact jump all the nugs olives just so I can look at him kind of has a sweet aroma to it roll up in the juicy journey sticky candy one of my favorite Juicy J papers two more packs on deck out of all of them I like that I like the cotton candy ones they got bubblegum I think those ones are good I tried a bunch back in the day when they first became like a bigger company or just hid around here more my buddy used to love them get Mike marshmallow ones all sorts of [ __ ] but I don't remember all the ones I tried tried watermelon blueberry probably a peach one I said I'm pretty sure there was a s'mores or a watermelon one that he tried just lots of them but I prefer the sticky candy I think they taste really good I didn't quite like the watermelon ones as much the blueberry ones so great they weren't like horrible don't get me wrong but if I go into a store to pick them up myself again I won't pick up those ones I'll stick to the ones that I've been enjoying hopefully you guys are enjoying your Quan team I guess we could call it hopefully you guys are all staying safe doing all that good [ __ ] hopefully you guys didn't run out of your weed rations already know a couple people that said oh we ran out of this I'm having a hard time getting some I have someone coming to pick up a car for me tomorrow um just because they keep they're having a hard time getting the stuff out by them so that's all my said hey I don't have any of the 4 400 deals because that's not the deals I've been getting I just been paying what the guy charges me so 40 you know 40 a card is what I'm paying so I'm told I said I won't raise the price on you because you're coming to get it yourself but I can't I can't give you a better deal because I'm not getting the deal and I said you want to go to a decibel right now you can get these for 400 I didn't buy him for 400 I bought him to it 40 apiece I'll cost me 80 bucks almost ready guys almost almost but uh what's everyone smoking on today even if you don't see this video today and you see it within the next couple days no what are you smoking on well bud what when tax what this all that good [ __ ] so just tasty candy Detroit growers cookies smells delicious hmm I'm getting a little the sticky candy on my lips unfortunately but uh kind of a sweeter taste from the dry head you know in the bud you can see notes of the orange [ __ ] tons of crystals lights and dark grains as I said pretty pretty condensed compacted all that good [ __ ] here we go as you can see I can't have a new setup I brought this out got some of my [ __ ] set up got a paint all this and or just put up some artwork got my board behind me now I got a set up better lighting and a little shop for these you know these um harvest house premium flower jars and now these Detroit grower extract ones I've done motor breath of Detroit extract so far I've been keeping the jars I think they look cool so this is like you know ghostwriter on the cookies ones pretty cool looks like the the labels peel peeled away that's pretty dope yeah pretty pretty sweet flavoring not really getting any like crazy earthy tones or pioneer would hear any of that [ __ ] I would guess at what this is but I already know it's an indica hybrid same with the other one I got which is alien rock candy but I'll do a video on that one excuse me so I'm gonna work it getting uh like a shelving system kind of thing right here so I can put some pipes bonds some of the jars things that I've been smoking on lately although you're on Plainview so that while I'm doing my video you know there's some other things you can look around like this silly little thing that I got from Luke right but I think a dope little old-school Nintendo cartridge little face with the beat I can't find the arms it came with little arms back to the future basically that goes with my my nerd type [ __ ] so yeah come along come along slowly but coming along I'm still gonna put the wall up over here once I do that then I'll suction it off and then I'll have my own specific office here we had the rest of this being storage and put a lock on the door on the inside of here put a lock on the outside and make it way harder for somebody to get in here like you're gonna you're gonna make a lot of noise getting in here if you want to steal my [ __ ] so but progress is better than no progress so we're starting to get it worked out obviously eventually this will just be a normal desk or I'll just use a chainsaw or something and I'll cut out the bottom of this so I can get my knees and [ __ ] I'm good whatever I'll figure that [ __ ] out there's the tongue coming on desks gaming desks aren't that uh that expensive to 300 bucks but this shit's fire the motorbreath was [ __ ] fire the cookies right now that I'm smoking on is really really good I would recommend it to [ __ ] anybody so Detroit grows extract 2 for 2 on this channel unfortunately I would say 3 for 3 but I didn't do the edible on this channel and the edible [ __ ] murdered me so I'm not gonna say that's a loss and I'm not gonna say that's a game so I didn't review it so that's two flower strains that I've tried to for too [ __ ] amazing fire and [ __ ] known as I said I've got one more to try and this [ __ ] looks really really really really good so when we do this one maybe after I'll do a dab from my mic lops join the same video but I want to keep you guys any longer peace out thank you for watching and hopefully you can go get your hands on some Detroit grower extracts bud and comment below let me know which ones you've tried which ones you want to try things like that I'm just curious on who else has tried this brand as a whole so comment below like hit the logo and sub comment below hit that bell if you don't mind and I'll catch you guys in the next video hope you guys have a blessed weekend and have you smoking please", "e_SyivTcaDE": "konnichiwa RSO SOS a and today with our [ __ ] Japanese ain't we

Knight don't you worry about that good night people good night", "shqs302Ci4I": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're checking out this white Tahoe cookies by new day cannabis and with that let's go ahead and hop right into the numbers so THC a comes in at 21 percent THC max comes in at 18 percent which I don't believe the last one I got from them had their THC max so I do appreciate that it's on here now and with that let's just get right into it so first of all I love this little like the branding here is just oh and then it says grown and living soil with all organic ingredients in Newport Washington alright so let's go ahead and pop this open so as you guys know I like cannabis I prefer cannabis that's in a glass container just because in my head area in my mind I feel like it's it's like it cares better or it's the shelf life is extended a little bit more versus just like a regular mylar package in my opinion alright so we'll keep that right there let's see what we got going on so we've got a couple decent little nugs these are all nice and still have plenty of life and I'm pretty sure they're sticky stuff yeah so let me zoom in real quick alright so as you can see nice light like green on the outside will bust it open on the inside nice and covered in resin and try crumbs and as you can see it was sticking to my hand there and my finger let's try something that I like to do here I hope sticking to my fingers more than anything else yeah so my fingers sticky let's see and then as far as the smells concerned let's bring that up to my face see what we got going on here oh so this has a skunk enos with a little bit of a piney bite so it's skunky with a with a really strong bite of pine towards like the middle end so at the initial like sniff what the first smell or scent that hits your nose is that like skunk enos and then right after that that's followed by this really good kind of like deep almost pungent pine enus so with that I'm really excited to go try this and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried the white Tahoe cookies and as far as the flavor is concerned it was really really good so I had a nice skunky you know the dank sourness that I really enjoy so it was nice skunky and then on the inhale on the exhale that skunk eanes kind of stuck around for about a minute and a half or so it just kind of kept building in there so the terpene profile this was amazing as far as the highest concern this was a very very stony high so right away as soon as you take your hit you're gonna feel it if you're a newbie I'm not gonna tell you stay away from it but I'm gonna tell you you need a corner you know corner your bowl and make sure that you just get enough to get the taste and feel the effects before you go there and like you know finish an entire Bowl yourself obviously as you guys know or if you don't know you're not gonna see anything cannabis doesn't make you hallucinate or anything like that but this is definitely something that's gonna take all of your motivation you're gonna want to just kind of hang out relax watch TV not do much of anything you might be able to have actually this is a pretty clear headed you know body high so you'll be able to have a good conversation this would be great if you're gonna have like a movie night with a bunch of friends pass this around and you guys they're all gonna be there sitting quiet watching whatever movie you guys are watching and that'll make for a really good you know enjoyable evening so with all that this has been recreational 420 if you guys are watching this on YouTube go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "eyQ1s0VAolk": "hi stu's reviews here i've got fuzzies again i haven't had one of these big ones in a while absolutely this is the fun

cookies and then one platinum banana OG that I threw in because I was one plant short to have 24 forum cuts you can probably tell from the color of the plants that things are really starting to get dark still the leaves are still green but they're a very dark green Annagh they probably just looked purple to you guys but really they're not that they're not that dark they're not purple yet some of them are like that one is that one back there some of them are purple but for the most part they're just dark green right now we have started flush we've given them straight water one time now like give them like three more straight waterings between before we harvest we harvest pie right around day six and three maybe day 64 depending on how fast the Green crack gets harvested but yeah the plants are doing awesome [Music] of course they're nice and frosty beautiful bud structure well actually it I don't know I said that it's not beautiful but starship I don't like the bus starts for these I like the bus structure at the blueberries you know or Romney my nice round fat buds these are pretty small and oddly shaped but for for I'm cut they're there they're perfect they're exactly what form cut should be we'll just what is leave it at that anyway yeah we are getting some a couple little signs of flush me get some yellow leaves down here things are purpling out you know we're definitely starting to see it just this little bit of flush we still have you know over a week to go though we can have to go and by the time we harvest I think these are gonna probably get pretty purple you know I haven't I haven't done a big crop of this yet this drain saw it I don't know if the leaves get dark purple or what but some of them are starting to for sure so I'll expect that first size goes don't see that they bumped up anymore since last week just kind of look the same to me darker leaves more purpling [Music] yeah everything is looking good nice color nice crystal production really pretty alright guys I really don't know what else to say here so I'm going to cut the video but I'm definitely excited about this and it makes me want to talk about next round because what I've got coming the next round guys is is gonna be so unexpected and so awesome it's like everything everything came at once let's just put it that way everything's gonna happen at once next round it's

it out it was a real sweet flavor on the tip of my tongue I tried to say I said oops Weil couldn't even hold it in that was definitely a sweet flavor oh my god there's nothing like that first hit of the day I'm not talking to you crack is I used to say that when I smoked meth and smoked up cocaine I used to always say that man I can't wait for that first hitter today why so you can chase that [ __ ] all day you know what I'd rather chase and you don't even chase it some weed in this instance anything that's white ain't right that's only in this instance dealing with drugs you guys anything that's white it ain't right if you got some green but it got white crystals on it okay that's cool but if you got some white [ __ ] that you need to shoot snort smoke or whatever the [ __ ] you do with it that [ __ ] is not cool y'all that's drugs please you guys I implore you just say no to drugs please if you don't cocaine seek help if you're doing crystal meth really seek help if you're doing heroin please seek help all those drugs are not here for you guys they're here for something else they're here for maybe our operations you know to numb people down and [ __ ] they're not here for [ __ ] personal use you guys cuz that [ __ ] destroys families it tears people up and he kills people man don't mess with that [ __ ] man I was so mad at myself when I was hooking up on crystal meth I was so mad when I was on cocaine I wasn't looking because I was hooked I wouldn't be able to stop but I don't have an addictive personality so I can't stop anything that I want to one side deem that it's not necessary for my body you know once my mind goes hey man this [ __ ] ain't necessary for you just like I used to always drink Don Julio I still like Don Julio but my brains like hey man you don't need this [ __ ] all the time it's [ __ ] your body oh and once my brain does that everything shuts down it's like no you don't even like that [ __ ] no more no flavor for let's smoke you guys I always tell you guys I talk a lot so I give the buzz time to kick in that first first hit it netted me a little buzz not too big this is the flavor that I can't quite put my finger on a gift um I definitely taste a sweet flavor but I don't know what the sweet flavor is I've never had to drink grenadine so I have nothing to base it on but there is a sweet cherry kind of synthetic Berry estates it is sweet it's really nice it's actually quite pleasant I had a nice buzz coming on I can feel the buzz like right here top my head kicking in y'all see my head started boy mom hate starting for you you see my head before they started to sweat yo it started get a little shiny molestation eating wigs I drink a lot of alcohol and water it's all that drink gods alkaline water I don't drink any juices no sodas no coffees none of that [ __ ] I had sodas when I went to a Chicago where only drink 7up Drake 7up but that's because my stomach was upset I also think that grenadine so far deserved that slow dramatic clap y'all notice there's really tasty and delicious guys Oh see if I can get my ear right real quick Simon I mean over Lulu if I do say so myself pretty soon I'll have these shirts back online you guys right now I'm currently haggling trying to get the prices down for you guys the prices really don't affect me because well they do affect me but money is not an object with me I don't know I don't really I can't say that I did I don't depend on money because I do depend on money everybody depends on money but money is not a problem I should say I have no problem with money I have money I'm not broke so I don't know where that was going I lost my train of thought because I was enjoying the highs so much oh we need to get off the money tough subject anywhere I'm like talking about money so let's get back in you guys and I feel it really creeping behind my eyes and it feels like it's coming back from here ain't going up to my forehead but it's got my eyes and it too as far as the high goes whoo that is really nice I can tell definitely that it's an indica because I don't feel sleepy but I feel that drawing downside you know decide it don't let you go to the beach you know when you hit it's a teammate you feel like you got feel like Walter a beach I feel like playing some ping pong some bad mini knitting some volleyball me some kickball some dodgeball it's like playing all that [ __ ] when I'm most atiba but what I'm on of indica something because depending on what time of the day it is like I'm gonna smoke this at night if I was to smoke this last night I would probably passed out Ida problem in the sleep but see how I just woke up my buddy's full of finger and pull it energy and pull a light baby every time I hit this I get more and more high well I try to go for the lighter move didn't go for the hip move mild expansion rate in your lungs okay so that's producing a lot of coffee and off the of them born with that perhaps it's too strong let's try and put a little piece of this in the bowl and see what happens y'all go come on yeah I'm good all right hey I employed you guys to please look at all the videos I think I'm like 280 watch hours away from being monetized you guys watch all these videos man watch the whole thing yes I have I have my nephews of YouTube and I have another YouTube that I'll watch I turned the

subscribe with all your accounts I wanna see all y'all in here let go okay let's get this going yes sir [Music] okay that sweet flavor that really flavor a little bit more now but mmm ooh okay you guys on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the flavor critique of grenadine from the cookie fam we're gonna give this flavor a seven it's a strong seven it's a good seven I would give it an eight but it's lacking that sharpness in the flavor you know it's kind of like biting origin and tasting water in inventing your orange you know I'm saying it's like water down the ships it's like I taste the fruity flavors or fruity flavors want a pop about it and they want to come but it kind of shy the flavors kind of lingering back in Sinking back my god I want flavors to burst in your mouth you know what I'm saying man I want that [ __ ] to just come and be like oh never smoked it this is like we're smoking we're high it's a good high but I'm high you know to meet you guys you guys feel what I'm saying can you smell with the rum Pookie okay all right that's a little too much but let's go with it [Music] okay so now you guys see why I actually call so much let's get back to this this beautiful baby here back to the bone ain't my glasses sleep down making like old man be like good so hi all right [ __ ] out here I ain't that old [ __ ] you ask me old I was how old do I look how old do I look like I am y'all how old do I look okay all right let's get back in but going in this Muslim oh sorry [Music] okay we're back in the mix oh thank you oh geez blow to my face from the hip why does the hip keep burning waits to mush yeah okay all right so we've got the playwright of seven it's really a beautiful bouquet of flavors that burst in your mouth although it's white you're limited on the flavor just kind of feels like it's like something's holding a flavor back like mmm but we're gonna go move on to the hi critique so as you guys can tell I'm getting hot because I'm starting to get up a little philosophical I'm something a little more yes it's brilliant it really does taste good you guys maybe it's just that anything from the cookie family's got my complete attention my undivided attention and like I told you guys yesterday you guys know the cookie from the cookie placing tally got busted in to make rated so uh I'm selling a piece above of stuff from the cookie fare for her one hundred and fifty dollars I'm just playing yo but yeah that's probably why did she call someone only paid $60 for this one that's the normal price for the ACE there you know I've never in all of my life paid 60 bucks for an eighth until I till I got to Florida even back in the day but eight was never sixty bucks the most that I paid for eight was fifty five dollars that was in I think it was 35 we may have just been 50 because you guys know the age were $50 back in the day if you're a longtime smoker like I've been smoking 40 plus years kind of get my age away huh I've been smoking 40 plus years man she's a smoker I'm gonna tell you all but here we go we need to find a way to make these hips burn longer because although they burn out up a pretty good rate and they need to burn longer only be burnt if you start at the tip you just dig tips if you started at the tip you get a nice nice little burn but it'd be starting to [ __ ] in the middle of sulphur swamp and there's some on my [ __ ] that was weak weak as hell that week that's we detail okay we're gonna get back in here and we're gonna go ahead and um pack it one more time for you folks in the back and then we're gonna give you uh I always keep feeling like I'm feeling deja vu which lately you guys like I already gave you the flavor I mean the high protein okay even if I did give you the high critique we're gonna [ __ ] give you another one there uh uh I'm just playing I'm just messing with y'all man obviously you know we didn't give it to you so we're gonna give it to you now come on baby come on baby hey you guys no no no no bring it no no we got a call over this son of a [ __ ] come on man yeah I guess I asked with the burn slower and there it goes I want you ready wait oh my god okay we're back in there we have together I think that's enough of that so on a scale of one to ten one being a wanted one being that [ __ ] ten being a good ship full of the heartache of this grenadine from the cookie pan baby we're gonna give a name we have to give it an eight this is a hot eight you know what I'm sorry you guys please forgive me I'm gonna give grenadine a nine for the high I'm giving it it on because as I'm speaking the highest is steadily creeping up so hot right now I'm just you know so what I recommend is to my friends if you guys run across this dispensary great from the cookie fan grenadine grandma [ __ ] a roll that [ __ ] I'll light that [ __ ] wait a minute and smoke that [ __ ] I want to thank you guys for joining me for another episode of

this last time and the back one says contains marijuana for medical use only keep out of reach of reach of the reach of children and pets sorry very tired like late again cuz I have to wait until late to do my video this is quiet but before we get into that looking forward to China flavors and everything I can't wait oh we done a moon rock video and I have to put it soon and put it out we've got a bit reclaimed wax it's got a few impurities in there few little things because it was off a moon rock so there's pollen in there there was a bit wax even bits of resin of the blood but it was just floating in here so we redeemed it back up I'm gonna dab on it before you get into the room so he got the mail get everything off new and the box we don't wonder get any nasty crap yeah how's everyone doing they could put in the comments and as a video Dalia about a newborn work basically so make sure you go check that video out because it's up videos or something so it's not this bond ring isn't similar one just a circle to me when I sleep Lauren [Music] what wax is the purple diesel it's really tasty before I got another one or two oh yeah get into diverse no just dinner a quick one I just to see if the flavor was still there and it's quite nice first I made my girl from you can you enjoyed our talk there I fall instead of doing loads of them against you I offer dabs cause strong THC content nice a lot more stronger than kind of this yourself yeah it's still quite hot so we're gonna let it cool down a little bit don't anyone else do that it's only because I'm used to heat so if you're used to heat then you can do it you've got steel fingers as people say steel skin and carry on go ahead look I've been setting fire and he don't bother me don't from blister me if it got onto the scarred and obviously I've got a scar there they've gone to that wood blister straight away but my fingers they got bird tune they don't wanna be mister at all so be careful when you do move them so I'll get into this and you are gonna see the little bud to have a little look at as we can look at yourself but we can't show you guys asking what is like receive basically video stop cuz like I said before hunting in high definition so because I'm doing high definition I've only got ten minutes before he sets up so that's why you see a lot of my videos in jumbled together and there is breaks I'm not actually taking breaks myself or video and my phone is doing it itself so but yeah forever that we've got on my sticker and medical stick on the back so nicely again see if we could smile the smile in the pop if not we're gonna grind it and let you just notice Bob hmm first off you get really chemically smell very chemically smell there's pungent smell to it really cannot pungency well definitely I mean you get sweet not gonna say this didn't look great but I'm gonna take out the extra turkey needs a bloody storm in there so when one knows it's good enough to go into the little bit so before we do doc we're gonna go up our scales and weigh up and double-check all right with the stairs now and we have got the big scales they're a bit dairy industry predominance from over kind of this because my batteries died in my small ones so we're using these ones again pardon me [Music] we already have some pictures of this in as well so pictures look gorgeous I did post it on Facebook and few people commented on the pictures I like the pictures and that's a of 1.01 so like it's 10 milligrams over again well one yeah 10,000,000 console yeah nearly got confused I think it's ten milligrams yeah we've got one tweezers again so try to pick up this blood without breaking it see you guys come on nice look at pictures of it we'll try getting some micro pictures shape up there yeah back done cuz we're cutting into it and then because it's for me and my girlfriend this one is we're gonna split we're gonna hold it with the tweezers and cut it I'll put it over here when I'm away house we've trimmed it up and cut it so I can give my girlfriend pass No didn't think it was but wishful thinking that was copied over yes so my girlfriend's in medical so close it's so far away Matt you collect every bit of it yeah because I forgot yeah hopefully you enjoy smoking that babes and what I see this is quite a bit of crystals on this and pistols and there is purple colours not much is in between the buds so there is like perfectly cut out stuff just telling sent that so we can keep a nice but to show you guys in a video a little close-up video about governing two pieces again so don't muck around we're gonna tweeze this again if you're wondering what about you to go down like a dimmer [ __ ] she's are dying so yeah so we keep that but actually we talk cause I'm you there we go this way in now she be up to ya 2.5 so Aquinas now we're gonna top piece why I said I put in the top because I hate people to put in the bottom piece because like there's a ring around the edge put in the bottom piece and you squish it against that it's gonna make resin on the edges you're going to get things stuck yeah because why is she wonder why is like jammed up and stuff it's because I can't grind coffee as well but there was grill of glue in your last if you're wondering on the video why shot at us because she's got a headset on she's watching videos right yeah she opened it bless her she didn't hear me tell of of tires but yeah that wax was quite nice quite nice to start the video off of it works Oh basically what happened is the video cut out who's going to knit and I just asked my girlfriend to open up the grinder for me so we set about a small now like the appearance is a beautiful beautiful beautiful blood like there is a few Leafs on it that you can see it as a trim job being done to the bud but the least that's on there there's a lot of trichomes on there a lot of my bones um you can still see the colorations there's a few dark at least and you know the dark Elise they've got like a purpley black tinge to it and you know that's the purple Leafs and the purple bits and they're kind of yes um I can't really notice it much miss grounder there is a few little specks but not amazing specs it's not loads like anyway so we've covered the smell and we just covered the appearance so we're going to now he's going for the flavor so do a smallish one as I always say leave her so that's why it is tiny because we want a nice favor of this instead of you know Choki house flavor Samuel can bulk uneven startup can be quite harsh on the back of the float so that's going for this I say meet yourself at once with was V any type of fearing hit something with me I'll see you seafood a close and we'll go in for the kill [Music] [Applause] that's a different flavor it's a really chemically hit in the back from definitely lingers on the bucket of rope in the bucket um you get like a lemony grape so this like a grape and then it's a lemon or sometimes when you taste you get the lemon first and then there's the grape that's how it changes up and I reckon it's really sweet really really sweet and like I said it is definitely skunk that's more of a skunk and very skunky this is the old school skunk after its well if that was in wax I reckon the terpenes would be amazing because stem terpenes just off the bird alone it's crazy I'm shocked about her I've definitely just for the flavor I can rate that already as a 10 out of 10 and I think we've got another run up on the flavor so if you never like example the flavors are still there that needs a bit more woody there's a woody for you though the hatch it's quite clean wrap - should I say it's quite clean it's a few dark bits but I think that's where I didn't find it well because I didn't want it to pop through and director bong straightaway yeah so but the flavors definitely yeah a 10 out of 10 but now I'm starting to feel the high already but I won't give a rating out of the high yeah because like I want to have another bomb just to see Wow is fully cuz I can feel it creeping on me when you know it's creepy it's good it's a good strain good flavor good aroma and good appearance so he's my commander because the smiles definitely turned up 10 the appearance he's definitely turn out tanks I love anything that's got pregnant even if it's got a couple of specks of purple it's cool just to see and then my like I said the flavor 10 out of 10 let's see what the buzz gives us I reckon we should glad to get three or four pills I like this so we'll see where we go see if we end up in space through the clouds anyway and make sure you hit a bomb [Music] [Applause] [Music] not gonna end difference in space it's going to be put them in a coffin will get my breath back two seconds but that both it's incredible I feel relaxed as people would say slump so what that means is just relax slouched down feel like I'm moving as slow as the sloth but yeah but huh look at my eyes I can feel myself just getting more more higher is indicate dominance as well so it's really nice I'm gonna kopteva huh that's why we choked in that first one tried killing ourselves yeah but to go tiny bit that last one but roughly to order that's crazy but yeah all wrong screen the appearance pin out of town the aroma I don't attend even the bus ten out of ten it's all wrong distraint told me is crazy ten out of ten for the whole lot so the aroma the appearance the flavour and even the bus the whole lot purple gem dog is a crazy screen I feel high as a kite I thought I can go to sleep but I feel floating at the same time it's crazy proper dry mouth David's a cottonmouth I would like to try this in some wax see what the terpenes are like but I'm not used to these bulbs I do like my trumpet balls I don't know what these ones are called [ __ ] my trumpet ones and my green one it goes into the water these ones they write you off so anyway I'm gonna say smash the like button as much as you

quick just smoking on a pre-roll from saterra of b98 which is bubble kush 98 which supposedly came out right before the whole y2k thing just said that i think 197 but i will tell you it has a nice sweet smell to it i can smell it i got a five pack of pre-rolls i can smell it through the the packaging and if you can and i'm going to tell you like this if the pre-roll smells you know some good flour because most pre-rolls smell like grass and ass but this smell good nice sweet smell to it taste wise more earthy kind of kind of gassy a little bit kind of earthy almost like almost like dirt but i get a bad weight can be a little bit of a rough smoke as you guys can tell but overall it does the job and it's a good feeling it's an indica but it's nice man i paid what was it i think 30 something i think 30 for the pack of five so not too bad it is what it is i just thought i'd get out here real quick just let y'all know what i'm smoking on let me know below in the comments what you're smoking on where you got it from even if you're out of state i mean we're all just one big [ __ ] smoking community anyway so but stuff is nice man i like it um i will say i'm in the process of getting a job right now so there might be a little break in between the the strain reviews um as the budget's not there right now but i will say that in the meantime i might post some workout videos or i'm just vlogs or stuff like that in the meantime because just because this is a better water channel doesn't mean that's what we got to do all the time but b98 give it two thumbs up it's a mid to high kind of high but definitely definitely worth checking out if you're in the indica you know um so yeah like i said there might be a little break in the stream reviews um which is kind of good because i feel like i need a little bit of a tolerance break anyways because i'm flying through eighths like it's i'm clearing an eighth in about like two days so i definitely think it's time to chill out for a little bit you know i wouldn't mind if the [ __ ] wasn't so expensive but like you know anywhere between unless you're getting minis which are even hard to get down here because always sold out the minis are 27 and then it goes like 43 dollars and up and like that's just crazy you know i'm better off just probably buying an ounce of something and sitting on that but either way i love

babies have pretty much been sitting in the door use my bathroom so they've been getting about 23 hours of darkness if you add it all up I probably use the bathroom I know a couple of times a day off and on so subtract about an hour but yeah I've been having about 23 hours a life these are the orange cookies Chronicle a movie this plant right here really didn't do all that well this particular kind of Skippy the one in the middle got tall nice little little nuggets here in there started popcorn a little bit Fox talent here in there especially on this one we've got the Fox tails and then we have another Fino over here which matured a little bit faster as you can see the red hairs on here a little bit more vibrant the knees and their more hairs in June yeah there was three different phenotypes witness here bats are pop3 he's in three different types if I had to clone one my party would have counted either this one with the it's the smallest of them all chunkier nuts or this one

hanging out waiting I'm gonna chop them down I start the hanging but they pretty much been in here dying in the dark for the last week and they got a hold out frosty psych home protection is a plan to

both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about through watching the previous shows on this channel this is a productive cannabis connoisseur a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and older so hello welcome one in all today what I want to do today for this show is have a cannabis strain review on the strain called animal cookies so yeah I just got this strain yesterday and I thought I'd find out more about it and tell you more about it so yeah I wrote down the review from wiki leave I'm gonna read that to you and you know give you my take on it a viewer subscriber or new of your subscriber mention something about wiki leave that he suspects about it you might be true it might be true about it I don't know for the reason why I pick wiki leaf as far as reviews go for strains is because Leafly and all the other ones don't seem to have as much information on each strain like wiki leave does and so that's why I pick it I don't have experience with all so many different strains that I know them that I don't need to refer to a review for it I refer to review to see how much it lines up with how I feel when I partake in that specific strain so so that's what we're gonna be smoking today is animal cookies and this is what it looks like I didn't get that much of it I can't look forward so much it was on sale I'm out here in California the cannabis is very expensive even as a medical cannabis patient it's expensive to me it is especially coming from someone who used to be a grower I grew cannabis with my husband for five years or for four years more like and we both had cannabis recommendations at the time when we were growing we're doing it all legit by the law and [Music] yeah we just don't grow anymore because we live in an apartment now it's not feasible to do that here and I wish that we could grow along because it's ends up turning out so much better when you grow your own because the plants are attuned to your own vibration and your own energy so that's what I experienced when I grew my own medicine and you could check out those grow videos that I have in the past videos meant to go back a little ways but I suggest people do that if they're new to this channel just in general so that they just don't know only a bit about what I've experienced as far as cannabis goes some questions lets me know that people have not seen many of my videos we've watched one or two or three videos and think they got at a down pat of what I'm about and what my cannabis consumptions like I'll you know the list goes on so definitely check out the older videos for those who are new to this channel for those who are familiar with this channel if you haven't checked out any older videos maybe you should too and then I'll give you an idea of what's going on because I've covered so many things so many topics regarding cannabis so I'm gonna show you what it looks like I'm gonna be smoking on it's called animal cookies so I'm gonna get into the review I think I still have some in my bowl though actually so I'm gonna smoke on what's in my bowl and get into this review so thank you for joining me today and cheers everyone whoo very nice Oh have some of my team I'm using my I think I moved the camera a little bit I'm using my mug to keep it hot cuz it's been cold lately it's been colder and gray here in California oh oh excuse me so here we go animal cookies strain review this is it so eddo cookies a potent strain with some famous genetics animal cookies sometimes also known as animal crackers is relatively oh sorry animal cookies sometimes they're also known as animal crackers is a relatively recent indication for hybrid bread by Canadian seed bank BC BC bud Depot it is a cross between perennial favorite girl scout and Girl Scout cookies and indica hybrid fire OG fire OG is also when i've grown before it's very good huh animal cookies has definite has definite for consumers with multicolored flowers and a complex sweet sour scent I don't know what he meant by has definite for consumers maybe they're trying to say it's definitely for consumers I don't know what they meant by that maybe it's just a grammatical error so it has it has heavy almost narcotic indica effects providing pain relief relaxation and sleep cannabis lab analytical 360 has tested samples of animal cookies and measured its THC content at between 18% and an impressive 27% animal cookies is marked by small to medium sized popcorn like buds with a dense bud structure typical of other indicates leaves are a yellowish green some phenotypes can express subtle purple hues this purple was brought out when colder temperatures stimulate pigments called anthocyanins the process is similar to the way foliage changes color in autumn when chlorophyll breaks down in cooler weather that happened to us with a few strains that we grew during the course of those four years that we were growing we had a strain to did that we just named it tall purple it was a really really strong strain and it turned purple because we left it out and when it got cooler and we were growing just outdoors at the time we had to switch over to doing indoors but you can check out my past videos and see the indoor growing that we did what little bit we did the buds are very sticky and in white cloudy amber trichomes perhaps lending the leaves their yellowish appearance orange hairs which are actually pistols to collect pollen from male plants I stand out against the colorful flowers animal cookies has a scent that is simultaneously sweet and sour with a dank skunky edge breaking open the sticky flowers yield some more notes of pepper and thyme interestingly the strain is not known for having a grape like taste although its pigments bringing out purple hues in the right conditions this does not result in a corresponding change in flavor when combusted animal cookies have a thick harsh smoke that often induces coughing this smoke has a sweet and vaguely spicy taste when inhaled animal cookies has a high that settles in fairly quickly for a predominantly indica strain smokes may not have finished coughing before they let they hit with a weighty and palpable stony feeling that affects the entire body emotional well-being accompanies this relaxation so that users typically feel remarkably comfortable and contented without any cerebral intensity this strain does not confer the kind of rapid Association thoughtfulness that comes with more pure sativa varieties the extreme at relaxation the animal cookies provides can melt into a powerful couch lock if users continue to indulge in its potent bud these physical effects also make animal cookies an effective painkiller with medicinal application those suffering from both mild or more chronic nerves based pain report and easing or a total relief of symptoms this strains happiness also makes it an excellent treatment for users who struggle with insomnia mentally animal cookies can also be beneficial in helping treat stress and anxiety as it renders users happily oblivious and its stony Hayes side effects include the typical dry eyes and dry mouth along with some appetite stimulation more recommended for nighttime than daytime use animal cookies is not usually praised for helping users accomplish work this strain can be difficult to grow and is not recommended for newcomers to cultivation better nurtured indoors and out animal cookies plants tends to be a synthesis of indica and sativa varieties with plants that grow tall but also have bushy and horizontally spreading lateral branches fortunately it responds if users bend and trim the stems and branches growing accordingly to fit the surrounding space growers should also be sure to trim in and what trim neo2 trim any broad fan leaves yep growing near the top of the plant so as to allow light and air to circulate to the lower branches and flowering nodes animal cookies cookies animal cookies reaches the flowering stage within nine to ten weeks when grown indoors and offers a higher than average yield broiler should keep in mind that this is a very pungent strain even in the vegetative stage and those looking to keep their operations discreet should put odor control measures in place like carbon air filters animal cookies can be grown as clones from clippings taken from mature plants all seeds of this strain can be purchased online from breeder BC by Depot so with well-rounded with well-rounded hashey taste and a heavy body stone animal cookies has the best of what indicate varieties have to offer its memorable name conjuring nostalgia for childhood snacks also means it is likely to have continued popularity strong and enjoyable even for experienced cannabis aficionados this strain is best enjoyed alone in quiet surroundings or with a small intimate group of good friends so this is what they're saying about the common usage usually for nausea pain depression and loss of appetite so for nausea they give it a 10 out of 10 for paying 2 out of 10 for a depressed depression they give it an 8 out of 10 and for loss of appetite a 6 out of 10 so here we go for typical effects you for it 10 out of 10 creative 2 out of 10 relax 8 out of 10 and cottonmouth 2 out of 10 so for the THC content the highest test was 27% strain average is 23% indica Everage 20 12.5% 12.5% Wiki leaf average 18 percent wiki leaf highest 35% I don't know if they mean by liqui key leaf average and wiki leaf Hayase is the people that work for WikiLeaks what they tried and that's the highest that they've tried and so that's their experience with it I'm just guessing so yeah so that's the that's the strain review that I found on wiki leaf are an animal cookies and what do I have to say about it let me get myself back in this I'm sitting on a stool balancing myself on a stool but what do I have to say about it I say it's a really good strain I I really like it I've been having experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety lately as of late with regular run-of-the-mill type of things that happen in most people's lives trying to budget your bills and all of that great stuff during the holidays has been very challenging for me especially we don't have much money to budget so and being able to afford a good medicine to help alleviate the stress and the pain that I experience every day from having arthritis you know my knees and my ankles and just being able to have some sort of medicine to help alleviate a lot of these conditions can help greatly and I found the disraeli is really helpful I've been feeling really kind of panicky so I've been doing a lot of meditation chanting in the morning putting on really relaxing soothing music and and while doing that smoking this animal cookies has been helping me not freak out too much and give my heart rate to a level where it's not like critical like I'm just gonna pop out of my chest um that kind of anxiety so yeah cheers to animal cookies and cheers to you guys for joining me for this medical cannabis review I hope you enjoyed it and please feel free to tell me what you think of this strain oh that's really good I do like to do straight reviews available online because not everybody can be a grower not everybody can you know have that space where they can grow and feel safe to grow even though cannabis is legal additionally for those who are eighteen and over if you get a medical cannabis recommendation and is legal recreationally 21 and older here in California but that's only on the state level they haven't made it cannabis legal on the federal level so that's why I still don't feel extremely comfortable with smoking like out at the park with no care in the world I've done it but I don't do it like right next to the playground I'm totally way away from it as you've seen in my past videos but I won't feel totally comfortable and at ease with smoking outside or you know or just smoking a joint up front of my house I'm in my apartment whatever where I'm going to be living in the future when this happens when it's legalized on the federal level when they take it off a Schedule one you know that's when you don't have to worry about it and then we get people out of jail for who we're put in jail for growing cannabis for selling cannabis for partaking in candidates by having it on their person they were arrested for that and I think that's a really ridiculous crime it's a crime based on discrimination you know and calling out people that they seem deemed to be undesirable in this world people that are artists free thinkers people that have creativity creative minds people that aren't sheep so until that day comes when they start freeing people from out of jail getting everybody out of jail for those those crimes for what they call a crime which I don't think is a crime I'm not going to feel that cannabis is completely free it's an illusion for people that it's free here I mean like free it up it's to the point where it's just put up put out here and give it to the public not free but taxed and making it harder for people that don't have a lot of much of an income to afford it so that's all I have to say about that I really enjoy this strain animal cookies luckily and fortunate I was fortunate enough to find this a sale on it at the medical cannabis dispensary delivery service that I found I was feeling lucky that I was able to to be able to afford it so it's it takes a lot of digging and trying to find just the right one with the right prices so anyway that's another story and another show for another time but they for joining me thanks for subscribe to my channel thank you for the likes and shares

because I want to something both differences that are just a good old normal bic yeah there we go Cheers hmm deafening taste is citrusy the citrus scent definitely earthy now I've been to bed last night probably around like 10 o'clock and I ain't get up this morning around like 9:00 and I tell you that I can sleep in little longer but my back just will not allow me to do it my lower back just screams at me get up get up you lay her too long like lower back just [ __ ] aches like imagine there is like a bomb like a nuclear bomb and all things just radiating a [ __ ] pain yeah it's it's crazy so that's why I wanted to get on here and try to Startalk out and see how good the effects are now but that said I smoked a lot of carts and a lot of oils is the we going to do the trick anymore I don't know if it's strong enough I mean maybe I had to smoke a couple bowls or [ __ ] like like a grand to the head of flour before I get to that level where to concentrate gets me I don't know maybe maybe this is the test you know maybe with this little experiment here I'm not smoking any concentrate this morning just straight-up flour maybe I could see maybe uh maybe I can do us all a little favor and see what's up right so a buddy of mine is sick and he's getting tested today I'm not no saying your names but I like don't like hang out with him I want to talk to him I get he's a buddy of Mines cousin I talked to him to Facebook so yeah so [ __ ] as citizen man like like if you guys don't like personally know anybody that might have the cove at 19 I hope he doesn't but like if he does test positive well hey I know my first [ __ ] positive you know like personally know somebody so I mean [ __ ] is [ __ ] might be real it might not just be some oh it's just the flu you know I just hope everybody stays safe and I know if any patients at Brown out the venison or a couple days ago they had a closed-down to sterilize the building now with that said hopefully hopefully nobody come up positive that works there I'm hoping that's not the case hopefully they just took precaution just clean just did like a nice sterile cleaning just just because you know like I'm not trying to scare anybody it was just the thought of my head like why would awesome they just clean the dispensary like that you know the main just I know I just it did it really uh make too much sense to me and you know all right mumbo down I uh I got a slight buzz right now the taste is good it's got it it's got a nice nice taste there's no like harsh harsh don't burn as maybe because I'm using the wick instead of the BIC yeah so as of now it's not bad on the taste not bad on the like like breaking it up of course I didn't break it up by hand but I mean that the bud to look the thickness the dents the density and all that good stuff it's definitely a good hybrid bud and I think I believe it it's a huset Eva hybrid dominant and just because of Kim Dong I believe Kim dog is a sativa I believe don't don't quote me on it but yeah Cheers second ball who is he that almost [ __ ] up maybe I should do that see they're stubborn let's see see there's a difference definitely a difference right right in there definitely a difference I might must be just because it's a butane from the lighter but oh yeah that's crazy the difference between this this faman and this flame it's just crazy I got to order me some of this [ __ ] I forget who sent this to him I think Peter sent this to me Peter John one of them said it to me but the look like a little goodie bag or some [ __ ] I know Cheers so one thing one thing I do want to talk about real quick is a ex-con John talking about he's giving up he's falling back and stuff you let novembro if you're watching this you're letting them win all the haters they see you happy they see you enjoying your life they see you doing things you know and they don't like it people who is not happy with themselves do not want to see other people succeed and be happy in their life and it's [ __ ] up so the people who are doing that to John I just want to say y'all [ __ ] ignorant y'all ignorant I mean it's his stupidity for taking it to heart don't take the [ __ ] to heart they're just trolls you know [ __ ] them you guys don't get me to hate I love to hate I eat it up I eat that [ __ ] for breakfast uh-huh but when you kind of get personal you know like like threatening the man's freedom [ __ ] that's not cool at all not cool at all and I would probably do the same I would probably terminate my channel but I'm not on parole probation or anything like it so I don't do anything wrong all my all my reviews is [ __ ] straight [ __ ] from the dispensary besides like the hemp from kilowatts farms which shed Sean what's up Sean can't wait to get my hash or whatever it is you're gonna send me but anyway obviously I'm buzzed because I'm just talking away just jabbing Javid so my back is starting is up - I just realized that whoo-whoo if y'all heard that man I'm gonna give this one I'm gonna give this one a good rating yo just just because my pain has been from like a [ __ ] 8 - like like a 3 um I got a nice buzz going on it took 2 bows to do it but stay on there I am there yep so if your kid but this would go pick it up star dog ran out to be honest Center oh no this is from dealey I'm sorry Angie Lee Gigi from Frederick yes so start dog is a good is a good one man obviously I've had I've had concentration started all going to so uh that ought to tell you something anyway I'm gonna go ahead in this video I'm feeling really nice I'm sure you guys can see it in my eyes make sure y'all smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yeah turbo Tom's out make sure y'all muhfuckas smash that like right now boy", "kxwxypjidU4": "what's going on your bumbaclot sushi boy captive smoke man continuing this I'm back in this house doing strain reviews of everything I got next up we got the cookie wreck last thing we did was the caramel candy cush I still have a little chill them with that left over here so we'll probably take that to get that you know get this episode started but let's look at a couple of mugs I haven't got still oh damn all right this is cookie rig all right so Girl Scout cookie crossed with you know some cut a trainwreck but anyway guys going in on the cookie break let's see what it tastes like Cheers it definitely has some complexity to the flavor I'm not gonna lie to you like there's something there are something on that back end of the exhale I don't like it there were different notes all the way through on that one like I gotta gotta go in on another hit on that let's see if we got any left in here [Music] all right so when the inhale you do get a little bit of citrus like a little tiny bit of citrus a little bit of a little bit of spice a little bit of kick on the exhale but it's just really earthy all the way through and that's what I was getting on that back in like a just a real strong earthiness which is typical and you know cooking cuts you know oh yeah I can feel yeah definitely feel the expansion going on Bo let's pack up another one even Loras isn't that then Mint cookie yeah even though this isn't the Inman cookie I am getting a little bit of mint eNOS not at the flavors been you know sitting on the palate for a little bit more grand I did just brush my teeth and gargle so that could have a lot to do with it to be honest the second bowl yeah this cookie pack-a-punch bro it's cookie right yeah they should yeah that French inhale yeah I felt that [ __ ] all you know you how you not get that nice warm fuzzy feeling in your face and head like you can tell us a nice sativa dominant hybrid but you know it doesn't lose out on those indica effects like a lot of hikers do that's what I like about it alright guys well cookie brick another one of course I'd recommend it oh [ __ ] I'm sleep I still go to the action going on in there I'm sleeping well she might as well just pop it off right yep ooh getting some little pastry something-or-other in there I don't know I kind of wanted to say I kind of wanted to say I got a little touch of chocolate dough like like like cookie dough almost so yeah guys all in all cookie rec man two thumbs up can't say much more than that I'm like I took like three balls feeling pretty good good flavor like I said it packs a punch you don't need much to get you to where you need to go I could see bringing this in the car to the movies and just you know packing a ball or two before going in and then just add to my packs inside like I normally do that would be the nice this would be a nice addition to the packs because you know you can walk in pretty damn stoned already and then you know get the packs eaten up as the movie progresses and [ __ ] like that so anyway I'll be back with another string review shortly but until then cap the smoke out", "Z968yB0wSrg": "what of YouTube YouTube missed owners around

New York City I hotnewhiphop and I'm going to show you how to roll an uncle burn right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] you have an assortment of marijuana in front of us right now we have the London poundcake - lemoncello the gelato the snow Montana and the cereal milk I'm going to roll up a cereal milk right now please before you smoke marijuana and make sure that your your bud looks a little something like this I mean this has been squished a little bit you know and it's travel but amazing I'm a rollup uncle burn today no crutch needed we are rolling up in the Vives paper yeah I mean I like flavorful weed I like weed that is something that people remember so like today when I leave here you guys are gonna remember this [ __ ] out of me I was in Arizona I was in my boys backyard and we didn't really know how to smoke because we were young and we got a Walgreens receipt and we had some Bammer weed cuz we're in Arizona at the time they didn't have any of this good [ __ ] floating around yet and we smoked two fat-ass Bamber joints in a Walgreens receipt and all I remember is saying I want more I don't feel it and and we just we smoked another fat ass joint at Walgreens receipt and I think my throat hurt from the ink and the receipt but that was the first time I ever got high I was in Arizona I'm preparing this huncle burn you know you have to excuse the pack of vibes papers this was a sample sent to me from France we're just making sure that packaging was okay we made a few changes to it so excuse you know the beat-up package this is a sample it's not what it looked like but right now I'm preparing it I put two papers together I'm taking off some extra paper right now we're gonna roll this with no filter so I kind of fold the bottom real quick and then put a little lick on that muhfucka I peel the peeler back I don't wanna smoke too much paper now when your [ __ ] tastes this you want to taste all you want to say is all of it you might have to make sure that the paper is cooperating with you so if it's not all the ways sealed you got to give a little boom you have to make sure the paper is dry if it's wet and you try to roll it it will rip it will tear we have the weed grounded perfectly by the Santa Cruz sweater perfect fluff and I'm saying and we're gonna roll uncle Bern the reason why we call this uncle Bern is because when I was on tour a few years back I started rolling these and not gonna pull us down and I don't I don't know it's just uncle Bern I guess I'm someone's uncle I don't know to [ __ ] it but that's why we called it that uncle Bern holds around three to seven you know it just depends on how lazy I am like right now I'm a little lazy cuz we're doing press in New York we've been moving around I smoked a hotdog stand outside that smelt amazing and just in a rush to get to it no I was playing now this is probably about I say about a four grammar maybe a five grammar cereal milk you guys will be some of the first people to taste it um when I was a kid bong you know I'm saying not many oils I am old-school og cat I like to smoke papers and I like to smoke weed out of Apple violin got no papers that's just why I'm at my crazy age in life and being in the business that's how I like to enjoy my herb is with either a joint or with the apple an apple only when I just need a quick little puffy puff and I'm in the hot ass area so if I'm in a hotel that's a little snooty or if I'm in France or you know somewhere that's not really the best environment to get high I'll hit out the Apple but I mean this right here is is a great way notice it got rolled quickly you make sure that ends is just a little tighter than the top now the way that you can tell if you rolled it uncle Bern properly is if you could take your finger and stuff in the rest so if your finger doesn't fit in this hole then you have not you have not rolled uncle burn I kind of crushed the top like that a little bit push it down and then I take my pinky and make sure there's no excess you know boom I kind of twist it a little bit this is just my own like I'm not gonna say it's a perfect joint but this is just my lazy boss weed weed man joint right here so it's it's it's fatter at the top it's got a shady little twist on the bottom and I'm saying I've got the lighter thank you Oh beautiful you know in comparison and the most important thing about the uncle burn is the airflow so without having a tip in there or a glass tip it's [ __ ] gonna rip like I said prepare for your panic attack I meant I meant that this gonna hit right here if you don't make that sound you should slap your Weed Man yours tell them to go suck someone's dick because this is how we should taste you should always make that sound and and enjoy every every breath of it so yeah man this this uncle burn hand rolled by yours truly right here with the vibes paper you know I'm saying this is important too we're launching that this month would be real when I first linked up will be real I brought my bags he brought his bags we sat down and we had a [ __ ] roll off and we just got stoned and we must have smoked about 26 27 joints I don't know what it was and I just remember leaving there and going to STK Steakhouse and walking in and they're like yo you smell crazy we cannot see you here I'm like why I'm so hungry like why would you do this to me like sir we really like we appreciate you coming but we cannot see you here I'm like [ __ ] oogle me I'm like I'm somebody like what do I look you smell like way too much weed go sit down this business next door is like it was like a bar like a lounge or some will bring the full [ __ ] menu over you can order whatever you want we never do this for anybody enters so going okay cool and I remember ordered a steak and potatoes and some crazy-ass dessert and went home and fell to [ __ ] asleep that was a high that's the most we ever smoked I remember being so defeated when they told me I couldn't sit down and I knew I smoked crazy because we just smoked so much and I had a backpack cookies backpack just like this full of heat I suppose must have felt like a [ __ ] plant a pound [Music]", "Yx6XvqHxJP4": "hello you two I'm Austin and I'm Kailyn and this is buds in the bud room so today we have an episode of Bud reviews we have a couple strains of Private Reserve that we went and got at the shop House of cannabis today with the theme of the today's episode is cookies yeah we got some holy cookies candy got some holy cookies and you got some nightmare cookie nightmare cookies one of our favorite strains um we've had a couple batches of this the last couple batches were like why can't you her whole Nog's to the nuns were probably as long as my finger and super thick nose with lots of bourbon yeah definitely the the later the earlier batches were definitely more purple these ones you are looking more like animal convinced they're looking a lot lighter and more hairy for sure they're not a lot lighter but a lot a lot less purple and a little more hairy but when you break them up you can definitely see the indica purp on the inside there it's a great color I'll break it up for you oh maybe the the track comes with my deep in there oh it's sticky very sticky stem looks like it's that smell as you're breaking it up is reminding me of like when I first started smoking but he's very nice let me break this big fat nugget man that's just glistening stuff is super super pretty really really nice to break out like memory foam cannot wait to smoke it right here that's that's the nightmare cookies and then that's a let's look at this this holy cookies let's let's smell it what's that smell like to you smells like cookies smells like chocolate chip cookies hmm that was extremely sweet ooh very flowery it's a light but it's very sticky very sticky with big dark hairs also extremely pretty it's really really like detailed and like intricate it's not a very compact and solidified button at all very sparkly though it's white it's white in a lot of places it's really pretty it's nice to break up it's it's sticky but not too sticky let's open up this fat nug here super sparkly and they're getting white some trichomes all up in there with the big dark hair is looking like some good but for sure it's looking great these are both some more Private Reserve from from House of cannabis when our piece for today is a this diamond glass will be smoking out of the snowflake here we pack us a bold you want to smoke this slowly he's first holy first yeah sounds good let me see the nightmare cookies really clear Oh break it up while we're doing that oh man this is the smells like it doesn't smell like to you celery so this nightmare cookie smells a lot like celery when I smelled it in the shop and super sweet super like clean smelling but I definitely have a super engine interested to smoke in this second I smelled it okay this this holy cookies is uh it's good to go yeah it's it's packed in here if you want to am I gonna take greens yeah go for it kind still picking this up this nightmare cookies as I'm breaking it up feels like play-doh you can tell that's a cookies yeah it tastes it tastes like one of those buds that you smoked when you first stop smoking but you know it's it's very very sweet very weedy it's a good but for sure it reminds me of just when I first started smoking that's a good buy mmm yeah it's oh wow it tastes divine yeah tastes extremely good just pour that out and get a new bowl there's no more cookies in here we got it you want to pack that yeah sorry it's all right here it's all ready to go and then am I getting greens of this uh yeah sure if you broke it up sweet solid too bitter let's go Cheers like a really really good

good for here that's a very good tasting bud you can take that rips and be completely okay with it sweet dude what's up it's chewing if these under the light get these under the light and then give our official review sure yeah because afterwards we're actually gonna be putting these in salad days which is our blood tank here our dank tank jar kinda thing I'm thinking that the nightmare cookies is probably just about 9.5 that's not soup overall you smell with the great look the smoke was great it was super clean and super super like aromatic really nice I like the nightmare cookies a lot with with dark hairs and a little bit of purp to it I really really liked how the nightmare smoked and felt after I exhaled yeah absolutely really filled my body with a look really nice boy yeah look at look at that nightmare Sparkle super pretty but this is you can tell the Purple's down at the at the root of it alright and let's give this holy cookies another look looking like it doesn't look too dense it's got the the super spread out but thick dark orange hairs with the light green but it's it's a really good smoke tasted like when I first started smoking bud for sure I would I would give that a 9 out of 10 God would smell was also good I would agree 9 out of 10 for these I'm gonna say nine and a half of the nightmare yeah yeah yeah I meet you there with a nine and a half and a nine on that bat holy cookies so actually let's take these holy cookies listen nightmare cookies here and then worth when we get top shelf in Private Reserve we as you can see there's barely any bud

go a freshman or some stuff for star yeah the key chain gang you gotta come with the 4 star logo on it is a pretty city it's very fine but any band it was definitely nice little like the sign was cool real chill there a little late but that's whatever though but definitely definitely pretty cool house that Jeana tasted so far man he's a nice now it's a really neat flavor smokes real trying to distinguish out the characteristics pretty hard smells that I some of that yeah I'd say absolutely real nice little potent puffs a powder puff you always liked those nice Leah this came from relevance / in a thousand palms definitely nice shop yeah like quality bud tenders quality service quality bud I just very like this medication in general they got you know good edibles nice hash in some wax election but just really having a nice greenish-gray reflection on the top shelf mid-shelf blanco show yeah pretty much everything we've gotten it from there so far it's been pretty nice and that judo

thing bombing to the moon wanna talk to Sampson yeah just to the stuff out of there we're big dave chappelle fans oh yeah definitely was a bummer window panel [ __ ] went out like on the way today on the way to the four star from the siding stop by relevance again picked up a little bit of some meds grab to the happy hour pre-roll it's from 322 520 think we're there around like roughly around for

first time I went they have stood up with the top shelf makes for my like you know happy hour pre-roll which is completely awesome yeah how's the nice pre-roll both them both I'm so nice basically was

smoking a cigar j-just whole finger that same like this gene man geo is gonna really nice just a real nice high quality throughout body nice head no not one hundred percent sure on the genetics on that but from what I found it looks like it's a g13 and start out but I believe the guy the shop was saying something wrong garlic and something else yeah I think that makes more sense it definitely

main [ __ ] was it like I try and tell you most really good companies that love and put a lot of time and effort into their flour get a really good bud each eighth and then the rest just to kind of fill in the weight to make it 3.5 or hopefully more but you always get one treasured nog for every eighth and this is the cereal milk right here the cereal milk cookies and here's your gum help cookies it is super sweet tasting like some candy or something just like the bottom of the cereal bowl when you're done with it just the milks leftover from the cereal with all the goodness of the bottom that's what this tastes like so definitely recommend any cookies that comes in the bag it's all on your preference oh they have so many flavors so it's all what you like but I definitely

goodness where can I grab it from okay look at it it's so beautiful right cookies in Korean I suppose one of my favorite look at the frost look at the [ __ ] try cons the trim job looks beautiful besides maybe this one little a little sugar leaf right there all right well surely right damn guy all right oh man you smell the smell it's really good really skunky hmm actually take her game go -

1.79 cbn 0.2 - all right here's the Terps I'm leaving off the top three tips real quick let me see might find it real quick Carlene 59 0.59 human 0.23 and delimit lene lene lene 0.17 so there you go pause it you guys know if you don't know I'm not going to read off the terpenes anymore you guys can pause it and take it yourself all right boom there it is all right so let's try this vaping out like what John does huh I see you this actually [ __ ] works I mean I'm sure it does but he'd be blowing out [ __ ] clouds sometimes though I just never seen it so when I first seen it done this way I'm like yo she's really using this banger all right let's uh if those drive but not like it's not like crispy crispy you know what I mean so uh that's good I don't think he like really breaks it up to too much yeah I think he leaves it like not like like big but for him but you know what I mean he doesn't break it up fine fine like the grinder does um I think that's that's enough I'd say get my grinder out dresses butt up yeah I'm like in love with this grinder guys cuz like there's no magnet to it at all no magnet at all see all right I love it I think I paid like 14 bucks 13 bucks for it at some gas station in Virginia yeah so Disney world man I [ __ ] like all Florida you know I'm I'm asking like hey do you guys like takeout state cards how does that word yeah we're gonna take out state cars well I'm [ __ ] the net so I caught the green house docks where I got my mouth card I said well I'm going on vacation like it was there any way like we can I can get like a temporary card for Florida that I could get medicine down there or how's that work he's like no only way it's gonna work as if you move down to Florida and do the whole process over again well I mean Dan if I won't be doing that so there's two things that's gonna happen either a I'm gonna take it out tolerance break or B I'm had to like sneak in um maybe like I was talking about the jewels or jewels or whatever they do they look like the dart pods right but someone to a reviewing - anyway try to pass them try to pass this off as as the jewel or whatever it is or just get like some edibles right she makes that it blows him I can sit back baggie or some [ __ ] with some gummy bears gummy worms I don't [ __ ] know something I have to figure something out or if not there just be a tonic break but anyway I think that's a cool little whoa little tip so if you guys going out of town or whatever and like you know I had a state and like man I can't bring the [ __ ] Medical Marijuana and to cross state line you know that's a federal offense so like yeah you're pretty much [ __ ] you got to take a tolerance break or bring you sit with you don't get caught but I'm going on the inter plane and I'm not I'm not feeling the [ __ ] take the chance to wife saying that you know like she would hide it you guys go to them saying and like I don't want to take the chance not full enough for [ __ ] medicine bro that's crazy all right so I got my carb cut where's my car kept bad I need for this I'm gonna use my new one here this right here okay crab cap being like that I take it maybe I should use just this guy here this guy works better I guess this guy I use the one around all right here we go sorry guys I know they're [ __ ] right over men's I'm 13 minutes into it and I haven't smoked [ __ ] I'm actually very curious on how this works I mean I know it's same thing as vaporizing you know heats it up to combust and causes vapor like god john be saying this it be tasting good yo every time I had a vaporizer and went to babe it it tastes like bait [ __ ] and flour to me smoke let's go the bitchin start cuts on fire broke as it does this good job I don't know if you guys like seeing that not

good side me though i watch your [ __ ] nobody I see it starting to get a Giri in there so that's like [ __ ] straight of combustion dude I think I'm getting it too hot to be honest with you I don't

smoking you guys see me smoking I smoking but I think it's like what it does taste pretty I'm good I'm not gonna lie it's different it's definitely different my Fuhrer I still see green in there so

last little menu thing that he had I was like oh you know as soon as he gets one of those batches in that smells a little bit better that isn't like never he gets his batches in they're not necessarily still like wet but you can tell okay it's like one more day before it's like prime all the way dried out ready to smoke everything so sometimes I'm like oh okay like I'll go for the strain that I know that you've had for a couple days you know versus like some new stuff and ever he reloads give it a day or two so this other stuff right over here now I see it on the second batch oh my god this stuff's crazy now I know you guys remember I had that chapo breath and then I had this other what was it a crazy type of cookie [Music] so let's see I had that choppa breath right there damn I saw many what was it oh the el m\u00e1gico I had that el m\u00e1gico and that el m\u00e1gico looked crazy as hell right so so I got this right here it's this Padrino cookies there's Padrino cookies my boy didn't really tell me obviously he didn't really know he just got it so I didn't do the research really on it cuz I didn't even know if that was the first sure name but give me one second I'll open this up see sometimes these names I don't know if it's really like true you know or if they're just BS strains so right here I think it's supposed to be this uh might be not the LA cookie but it's looking like Padrino per strain Platinum og not necessarily that there's another one that says Godfather og aka Godfather dawn of all oh geez that could be it Padrino that's probably what it means in Spanish [Music] um let's see it's not looking like it's coming up real quick I'm just seeing some BS uh Padrino perps not pervy no perps they're just saying it's granddaddy makes a Larry og and that's that purple punch so that's what I'm saying you can't really can't really take any really a word for can't take a count ability for anyone whose word you know can't really hold responsible and be like oh yeah that's for sure what it is well I'm just gonna get straight to it so that's what it's looking like inside the bag it looks crazy it is some perks now we're gonna open it up I know it's pert but there might be some men doper or whatnot and Petrino per there might be some granddaddy and larry OG and it's just some crazy-ass triple punch going better his smells how a purpley yeah smells just like all those berries and [ __ ] I was looking for that Laker balls my buddy had some other it wasn't Padrino cookies but he did have that Laker balls and I told him I was like hey hold

them little stones but ya know this [ __ ] it was either this or I was gonna get the dough see lotto I've already had the dough see lotto he didn't have the Laker balls but obviously I was like well I haven't tried this so I want to get it and try it out so I can show you guys obviously this is what we're about trying to get the most of most out of these reviews different strains and I mean if my boy had that Gary Payton I might I just had to rerun with to run it back with that Gary Payton cuz it's so far it's probably one of my favorite strains right now but this shit's impeccable straight impeccable like crazy [ __ ] that's what all does Hellboy oh yeah as crazy as [ __ ] krisily [ __ ] that's what I like is to see that [ __ ] layer it up with whistles damn hear what the Ronson the

flap in the comment section have you take a look at the date pre-roll cone today we're looking at vibes and this is a rice cone oh the rice paper kind of burns up completely the word doesn't really leave a s I'm hoping that it also doesn't have that process of rolling paper taste we're going to do and get these out the pack so you can see what they look like alright burn club these are the vibes rice papers pretty decent papers I'm gonna go ahead and run all our chests on that one census looks kind of funky so we're going to use our lean green machine to hold this in place gonna stuff it up with some of this week and see how the smoke so let's get this thing filled up and see what it do [Music] [Music] hi Bertha got this vibe rice cone rolled up and it's real easy to feel we use the lean green machine that's like one of my favorite cone filling devices you're gonna do your own sapphire on in front of this and see where smoke-like begin I'm hoping that their taste of process paper isn't that strong in this but we'll get some firewood see what it do all right bear claw I think it's a fire oh just buy rice drink just raining so my dear to hear that but I do like to smoke on a rainy day so go ahead get some fire on this why be drink see what the first size to each matter was like [Music] all right well there is the descent of process paper um it's not that strong but it is definitely here we're going to take the first poll to see what the smoke actually tastes like I'm thinking that it might not taste that strong because it's not that strong in this ice cream but again I never want to get ahead of myself let's see what this thing you're doing yo now roads up there is a a fine line of paper taste going off the side street but it doesn't show up that strong in the taste other side of smoke like light I mostly just tasting the bud and it's a very Turkey but and that's really all just coming through right now there's very very light very light one of want to taste of it now I've had other rice papers and they perform basically the same way there's a very light underlying taste of rolling paper or both seniors who taste when you smoke powdery rice papers is weak now that side strength as it comes off of the earth is gone into my nose that smells just like processed paper does yeah there's no way of guess around that scent coming off the side string because all of them have that same thing but again the taste of this paper so far is one of the least strongest process paper tape again it doesn't mean that it's not there because I do still taste it it's just a very minimal we look at the ash on this what you see on there is really just the weed this burning of the paper that burns completely to where we look at it you can't you can't see the ash of it at all first bleep well hurry up there winds out there howling right now through trees a very good smoke coming dry like I'm I feel like my esophagus is very dry whoo Smokies that is my bra cubes I brought you a drop it is smoking with them mama daily say this when you see these do me try they know to think if you try them how did you like me again it taste for me it's minimal compared

from purple star they delivered to us so let's check out what they gave us so we're gonna look at phantom cookies you guys have seen allen wrench below show you again for those have that have not seen it I'm telling you it's one of my new favorite strains great great upper stuff and they give us a free joint and some matches as usual so let's uh let's go straight it to the phantom cookies alright alright alright let's take a good look at this so here is our phantom cookies off top opening it up it wasn't that impressive but when you look at the frost that it's it's uh it's not dense it's more fluffy so for it being fluffy sativa dominant we eat it it's good I like it although like I said I don't really like when I have this little much I like I think your nut should never be smaller than that one right there but but that said let's weigh it out see what we get alright see I'm not mad if they give me some scrabble if it's over you know 3.7 that's nice I've never mad at them so let's do a macro I mean from here look at that that looks amazing it's damn-near redonkulous damn near redonkulous so let's macro attack that right now I think that looks pretty damn lovely though the purple here is Wow wowee-wow-wow so let's macro that it works on me alright well well we well as you can see i mean i never post anything that's not smokeable really I should I wish I you know I don't you want to say a wish but if I ever come across some real crappy weed I will post it and let you know that it is crappy weed but for now I mean we're gonna be smoking the fire all day all day so come to San Francisco like I say I always mentioned purple star because they're down the block for me and mmm they really have the best of mid grade to hot top-shelf bud so I love them they're great look at those orange hair is beautiful beautiful problem purple frost let's go to the next bud next we have the candy train I ordered this because I I really love the allen wrench and I ask them what is it another good but they'd recommend this is a $39 a the phantom cookies was a forty seven dollar eight before taxes um with that said this one looks you can tell it's definitely different from the phantom cookies still looks like some damn foyer that flaming yone mmm juicy like God's titties with that said let's let's wait out see what they hooked us up with go ahead it is it is Kenny whoa ooh wavering three point four three point five never in my life never have my life has purple star done me like that but it still looks like some fire so I'm not mad at them they gave us the free joint and some matches you know I you know I I like this I like it it's orange II it's it's it's different from different views for sure let's see looks good guys yeah let's macro that right now oh man this one's really golden yeah the golden boy for sure I mean this one right here is something else you know the texture wasn't dark green it was more of an orangey color I'm really liking it I'm really really liking it anyway too close to you there we go man golly what's the best tree of you guys know cuz this this is some you know like it's that's it's that it looks like that we are gonna do a smoking sesh after to try them all out now that we have our new car we can just go in there hotbox it up and just you know no worries no problems uh so let's go to the next well we did allen wrench I show you guys a quick a quick look because that shit's always [ __ ] flame allen wrench coming up damn guys look at all that frogs you get soon all right and here's a gram of allen wrench one of my favorites so far really frosty with every I'm in watch I touch it right there frost on the fingertips guaranteed let's see little frost I hope it got crystals let's see you know I asked for a grammar let's see what they hooked me up with this does look like a gram although the allen wrench is dense so let's find out oh look at that surprisingly one point to this this didn't this look like it was gonna barely hit one but I'm a man good job purple star appreciate you guys always I'll show you guys a quick macro this as well mmm-hmm so I mean we had a couple different textures and I this one's got that really light green the candy train had some really orange and that uh phantom cookies was very kind of purply so with that said which but would you guys smoke I'm gonna show you guys all of them again side by side my question for you guys YouTube is if you had to choose which strain would you smoke first oh and the allen wrench is those also a forty seven dollar eighth if you want an eighth that well thank you for watching again stay tuned we are going to have a session like right now", "ATrjd6DFuXY": "what up what up what the [ __ ] is up YouTube it's showing on Mustang boy 420 and welcome back to the channel guys today what I got for you guys is a straight view and we're gonna be doing that review on finest farms or finest cannabis cuvee cookies it's a cross between cuvette and cookies who hasn't had cookies you know great strain I'd say it's in my top 15 never ever had cuvee though and I just looked the [ __ ] cross up and I can't remember what it was but it said that it had a very prominent taste of cherries in chocolate so taking that you guys take a look at a steel shot let you take a look in the little video I did and then we'll come back oh we don't get into the review you it looks really good right so let's open this up it's good good with that's hmm like of you know that taste of cherry in like Cherry Coke or cherry Pepsi or something like that that's the cherry flavor that our or st. I'm sorry not flavor but that's what I'm smelling along with like a spicy peppery so got a three different methods we're gonna try this will tack a little bit up in the bowl we're gonna pack a little bit up in the bone and I got a little bit of rosin here that I pressed out we're gonna take a bag for that so first off let's give us some nice Lord get out of your [ __ ] what you guys smoking on tonight I say tonight because it's like 9:30 9:45 something like that you know I wanna know what you guys are smoking also put on the comments let me know decided not to use the grinder and just in case there was cuz um I'm also a couple of strains that I'm smoking out and I've been grounded or no you know you only get the purest flavor we can [Music] [Music] you guys spicy the exhale okay if any of you guys have ever had bittersweet chocolate my cocoa nibs anything like that you get a faint taste of that but it's more of a peppery spicy cocoa like bittersweet cocoa flavor so tastes still kind of runs right along with this man it's a like I said it's a little spicy and when I say spicy I mean the best way I can describe it for me you know that sneezing feeling you get where it kind of burns your nose you know kind of tickles and burns your nose at the same time something makes you want to sneeze kind of like pepper I get that so take this bond rip it's I'm really guessing it's gonna stay true to the first you know the boat it's gonna taste the same little [ __ ] out of me but it's gonna taste same it's not I'm used to that gassy and that's totally muddy it like oh you can kind of taste the cookies in a little bit but I would love to love to try so convey it so I can because for it to be a complaint no for it to be conveyed cookies barely giving any cookie you know in any resemblance of cookies like there's a frame that mistake that unmistakable taste of cookies you get a faint taste of with Mike on your exhale along with you know the other flavors I said it but I'm barely getting any so after that bone and after first boat and bone I can start to feel the effects with that unmistakable tingling you know behind you as a change of slope but it's coming on let's uh looks like this there and then I am that's gonna conclude my review hope you guys enjoy what I picked this up with you probably not just because I'm not I don't like that every like if we lean more towards like a cookie feeling then yes probably but that's obviously really strong ku fatty you know [Music] but like I was saying when I hope you guys enjoyed this little review of mine it's been a while since I've done one I think the last review I've done was on the CBD flower or the sour space candy which we'll be doing some more CBD flower reviews as well eat it toes read what a minute and then go what I like to do and to go damn I'm gonna drop weed in my banger it was weed on the bottom of this that was surprising because in my experiences the doesn't change it drastically but whenever I press rocks out of a flower the taste seems to slightly change just a little bit I stayed the exact same so would that be a say it man I appreciate you guys hanging out taking time to watch", "KRgKWpN1bME": "well some of my YouTube and homies how's it going how's it going here we are in this beautiful tag the garden of Weeden Maine with yours truly farmer 420 grower guy you know wait we here growing staying medicated you know but other doctor night she was here to talk about was I got to show you guys uh ended up getting some more that blue cookies that the seed came out of on that check this is a blue cookies from the exact same guy that uh I found the two seeds that way are now in my garden hence one and hits two and not jus Pikachu no no no really not so yeah these oh these blue cookies seeds came out of that which we still have no idea male or female and their branches are staying pretty tight she's growing you know pray sixteen to eighteen inches already and no sign still waiting still waiting but was pretty stoked to be able to come across that uh blue kick used to show you guys whatever what but I came out of and really hoping that whatever crossed with it is something of equal strength it that it's definitely a strong playing its she is insane they're super solid super dark just like whoo here we are with the revenge yeah there we are with the revenge that's a lead - yeah it was pretty looking at yesterday's sin porch looking at it do that thing it keeps going that way and I keep it keep it keep all right it's hard to see with everything back they keep it all right that thing's a perfect bonsai ball it's awesome it's just gonna be one big ball which is dope you know I'll take it so it's be longer to go back out but here's your sister Helen one see this is what happens if you don't flower it out to see this exit like that which is firing out too sexy it's to me I'll wait come in here yeah perfect this branch ain't gonna do me nothing if it does barely anything so take this cloning sexy and then you know you just keep going on as you know so what I'm gonna do I don't want to wait because I'm really super stoked about these blue cookies I don't want to wait to see for the branches to get big enough for me to I have to put them into the 45 so I wanted to go to 45s and then you know fingers crossed you know that all goes well and they at least one goes female for me you know and then I'll just clone the heck out of it and finish it off outside you know we'll see here's a Skywalker og from seed she's only been topped once not sure and I just see the sun's on my phone so the video sucks today I'm apologize they suck every day I apologize but uh yeah so yeah literally took everything off that was down here and just left the floor and then cleaned up all of this I got about six inches of stock up to where you know there's only whatever healthy healthy notes where they'll start so imma what I got one two three four five pushing six right now on all of them going up and then once they see this one's probably about 16 inches itself as well but once it hits about two feet I will end up topping it again and doing a lot of LST to her for sure it's the Platinum cookies she's always just kind of surprised to be you know she was old - damn - nothing and from nothing - I sure the quality of the video I'm not that tall I'm just raising my phone hoping you can see but yeah yeah she filled out its feeling out nice I almost took this branch and cloned it because it drops all the way down I had to tie it so to bring it up I didn't want the middle to be him deep maybe we'll clone it later right now it's filling in the middle and I like it his mystery is hopping on here the other day can't really touch already going back so yeah yeah decided oh she will not be going into a 45 I'm gonna put digits leave her in this 5-gallon smart pot and just don't want to do any more stress see ya with that really big windstorm oh crap sorry with that really big windstorm we had I don't know if you could see but she split right down the middle literally cuz it's all the way down to here you know that's what the green tapes in there for so I'm sure she'll bounce back fine I just don't want to stress it out anymore and she has been in her life I mean just tight tight I really wanted to put her in a 45 but she's gonna do good should do just fine in a 5 then we hear their Skywalker og bouncing back really nice from the lollipop give her a little bit more time a little taller and I'll start pulling her over I'll st it I might because the note spacing is becoming the gap out quite a bit I might just do per copy let's start everything just Boop is I don't want to top it I've got plenty of top stopping this I'm completely done with that I don't want to yeah we'll see you know you never know you're gross season goes as it goes so we'll go with the flow you know don't forget to subscribe and hit that little bell get the notifications

yeah sorry the Blue Dream just talking over her yeah actually cleans her up pretty well the other day took off the two lower branches that I said I didn't know if I was going to on the previous video I did take those off and they're sitting in water I'm gonna clone those they're too nice of a specimen not to clone you know and if it does you know if this site this round again doesn't work for me on these you know there's always somebody that it's gonna work for so just came in and cleaned up all the inner stuff if it was too smart and just cleaned up the core bit she's getting pretty lanky I end up giving her another two three notes hi and then I'll top her yeah sorry for skipping over you yeah Walker I don't know if you can see this hole it's getting so big that windstorm and we had a while back messed up a lot of my plane said I guess just weren't ready for that kind of abuse their strong stocks during healthy I with these because I just got into doing more organic so with all of these well except for the seeds because as I started going organic this year this season so but the Platinum cookies Skywalker og this Skywalker og this platinum cookies I had fed with nutrients for the first part of their life and they you know I used I used a fox farm organic or organic farm nutrient and buy tonic here so they're you know I use this for my silicon and then I also use their their version of or their brand of a cow Mac and this is not organic either and I also use this and this stuff kicks ass guys this stuff is awesome very well the whole fish cycles kicks butt and I'll see use super thrive this is organic I do clean up on aisle three I do use you know the your fertilizers that are not organic but give you this I have cut back a lot from using only you know bottled liquid [ __ ] wrong nutrients or advanced nutrients mmm using all those chemicals - using just that basics I guess or whatever you want to call those eventually I'll wing all the way off and new to the whole organic ruining organically this is platinum cookies so it's kind of a learning curve for me I'm going as I go you know learning I'm actually thinking about making me a trellis for this underneath like what are these other guys I watch other youtube yeah he's growing on an aunt Anna super dope so he's got the antenna laying that a horizontally and he's got the but on literally in a milk crate on its side and he's growing it sideways it's really cool so we gotta do something like that you know he's endure our Blue Dream clones Platinum cookies another Platinum cookies that I talked the other day Blue Dream Skywalker and another Blue Gene there he goes that another see the rope-a-dope you got one on her clones took a clone offer her got a cloning and i'll be sexing that reasoning - here's the topsy turvy but he said topsy turvy yes sir he did it's looking beautiful just so beautiful really stoked I said I did this before just never in an actual topsy-turvy so yeah so

] pretty so pretty um and i'm so excited to show you guys like i'm so excited to show you guys as i was saying i'm not sponsored so i'm going to be giving my honest opinion but i'm very thankful that they hooked me up with this with these products like that's so amazing but this wouldn't have been done by myself i wouldn't be able to do this on my own like you guys have also helped me get like these free products so y'all deserve to see me smoke these and it's like i'm smoking for you guys okay we smoking virtually hopefully one day we do get to like have like a big ass smoke sesh together and like a lit ass day like that would be so fun you know nice view type of [ __ ] but this is how the packaging looks hi 90s super nice super yellow definitely summer vibes has the palm trees right here they're wax infused cannabis pre-rolls each of them hold 1.2 grams and you all know like most of the time i be smoking like joins priors once in a while backwards but it's like everywhere not rare i would say but it's not i don't smoke it as often you know because pre-rolls um are definitely much healthier since they're nicotine free and let's just take a moment thumbnail these are so cute i can't i cannot oh my gosh so we have right here the um flavors that it has we have strawberry it's sweet and juicy strawberries straight from the fields we have watermelon the refreshing watermelon you crave after the beach peach so juicy and delightful you'll want seconds definitely tropical punch oh i love the the color for this one i love the color for all of them but this is like my favorite color a blend of sweet tropical flute flavors gelato oh my gosh you guys are you guys seeing what i'm seeing the packagings are so cute super [ __ ] cute sugar cookie ice cream better than grandma's pink lemonade like a cold glass of lemonade on a summer day definitely for the summer days pineapple sweet pineapple sprinkled with sugar and double cup a candy lemon lime soda your favorite rapper's drink okay hi nighties i see you guys you guys the packaging oh my gosh i can't even decide which one i want to try out first because they all look so cool and you can tell like the packaging is good quality i like glass containers like this because i can usually like stuff this pre-roll if i didn't finish it in the um back or like if i have another one and i'm like i'm gonna save it in here so it doesn't reek my room like these are just pretty cool containers and like i like that they're colorful that's super cool and it's vibrant and it makes me like happy and it's so summer vibes definitely summer vibes i really like it like i don't know i'm just so excited i can't even choose which one like i think i'm gonna have to like grab them all and do like any minimizing well because they're all too good so guys i actually didn't record a lot and i was actually talking a lot about the product itself and i'm already i already had sparked it up too and i was not recording uh youtuber fails look it it's definitely burning pretty nice we have that white ash i just [ __ ] up the burning that's why it's like but it's burning very like nice and even not even but smooth because i didn't burn it even but yeah as i was saying i was talking about the product i really love um i'm smoking tropical punch and this one has 29.7 thc i just chose this one because it matches my nails to be honest nothing specific in particular but it's hitting pretty good their weed is indoor weed they don't use no um no trim nor shake which is like number one like a big thing most of the pre-rolls range from 30 to 40 so far as i'm hitting it it's super smooth i can taste it that tropical in there these are so like on the gold and cute as [ __ ] like hey you're going to freaking grocery shopping or something you want to smoke right before let me take out aha 90s super cute super fashionable just spark it up ready to go so far i actually like the weed it's hitting pretty good and for it being small like it's hitting pretty good and as i was saying when i was unboxing packaging um they are wax infused heroes and h holds 1.2 grams so these little shits hold 1.2 not bad at all oh i did try fuzzies and it has 0.5 and i just feel like last time in like five minutes or so and this one already has lasted me like okay decent time and although it doesn't have the wax out on the outside it has it in the inside it tastes like pretty enjoyable versus the fuzzy i just felt like i don't know it just tasted like straight up wax like i don't know how to explain in like straight up wax and it also i don't know if it also could have been like the weed too that fuzzies carried because i know that the packaging date was pretty um it had been like since the end of march that they had packaged that [ __ ] so i was like [ __ ] but i already had paid for another great thing about these free rolls each of them comes from a natural blend of terpenes but i really like these spring rolls like i feel like with two i'd be like pretty cool two or three [ __ ] smoke on eight right now [ __ ] it it's all down maybe smoking like how many do you want me to smoke in the session because they do have seven now left i have seven all left so let me know what you guys want to see with the rest of these pre-rolls because yeah i don't want to be reviewing each flavor that's going to be too many or maybe i can i can do a series on this high 90s let me know down what you guys think i should do seven pre-rolls in a sitting um a series of like some flavors or like i don't know don't let me know some creative ideas i sometimes don't i'm not really creative i'm not creative to be honest but i do enjoy making videos for you guys and for the people that do enjoy thank you so much like i said i wouldn't be able to be doing this without you guys and we all go make it here i [ __ ] burned myself with a lighter but definitely i [ __ ] with it i also loved like it is a pre-roll i'm usually you guys always know i'm usually smoking joints free rows once in a while i'll be smoking some backwoods or whatever but it's an occasion it's not all the time because they are nicotine free so they are healthier which is it benefits you you know but i hope you guys enjoyed this video and say hi to the [ __ ] sky and until next time bye", "C1bewEWpRYI": "why so why why Joe why what of YouTube YouTube

out to them the best weed selection in town but without further ado let's go ahead and pop this open and get right into it has a very sour sweet smell it's fantastic don't want to smoke any leaves here's what it's looking like nice and hairy god it smells so good but without further ado the to do the toy decays [Music] [Music] Cheers [ __ ] I like it so far it seems right down the center perfect hybrid between indica and sativa I love it although I wish I had a weed that would knock my dick in the dirt because I'm way too [ __ ] hyper all right so far this is gonna get a strong 8 out of 10 strong but you know I think it's time to get into the whole bowl so that way we can really figure this [ __ ] out yes and without further ado my friends let us get this bread gamers definitely like a salary salary herbal taste now sour sour floral sour floral taste for sure I'm liking this new lighting by the way let me know down in the comments below what you think wow this this strain has definitely just transition trend transitioned from a really nice hybrid to a really nice indica I always like strings like that where you can take a couple hits and like be nice and energetic and uppity but then smoke a good amount of it and like be able to chilling do bad huh holy [ __ ] cheers my friends Cheers now it's this or this Taylor jeddak when you're smoking a good-ass indica this is a ten out of ten mellow weed that's for sure Cheers that one touched my mouth [ __ ] so you Cheers [Music] so overall review of this [ __ ] I really liked how it started out as a very euphoric uppity energetic strain which means in small doses it's great for like midday smoking but then once I got more unto the whole bowl it turned into an ass-kicking indica which is phenomenal I really like how this gas smells and looks I really like when my hair or when my weed is hairy gives like that really nice contrast in the nice greens so I think overall I'm already a solid 9 out of 10 for sure a solid 9 out of 10 I'm definitely gonna keep this [ __ ] in the rotation for sure but with all that being said let me know in the comments down below if you're gonna pick up some of this sour cookies

sweet smell to it like a homegrown escape of smell but it still smells pretty good you know it's pretty dry it looks nice seems like it has a good taste to it so it kinda has like a sweet kind of like it does kind of have like a bit of a cookie taste actually but look nice sweet sweet flavor tastes really nice so it is a sativa and it is 19 percent it's not too bad it's a little less for the price for cookies compared to most of them but so it's not too too bad you get a little bit off so it is worth it especially has a nice flavor it's a good amount of THC in it so I give the taste rating a big knife I have done the same strain before so I thought I'd redo it again might as well keep up to date do it a little better too so last time I tried cookies looks pretty good too so if you ever get a chance cookies in your neighborhood go and try it out but it is one of one of the good types it's definitely a good one to get a couple packs of it talked around you know what I mean go up and do some [ __ ] we'd go to the mall smoke a couple joints or take your dog out if you got one take them down play by the water stuff like that smoke a couple joints man it's good for anything really whatever you may like to do in your own time yeah I like to chill with my loved ones my animals they said go down to the water play by the water both side he has that my little boy my dog he has the light he goes he chases it everywhere she goes nuts for that like every time I shine it so that's fun it's getting a little off basis so maybe feel like do you get to know me a little better but yeah

let me think about it and get back because how do you make a decision of saying yeah I mean look it still [ __ ] with me I mean I had to think about it for a while but I'll give you I'll give you guys some game because this is such a good interview I never really talked about business like this but I want people out there to be motivated and I want people out there to know that like the first deal is not the best deal I cannot wait to wait to write my book about it I want to write you should I'm writing a book called the best deal and so alright I get offered 800 million dollars for cookies in general the whole thing but a lot of it's stuck from a Canadian LP a private Canadian company that's on the stock market I looked at like this if the first deal I got was 800 million bucks and it's mostly stock and the stock game could be like great and then drop and everyone's going public right now what would happen if I turned it down that data makes me pretty pretty much a boss to do that so instead of taking 800 million I took ten million dollars in cash for 10% of my company as a friends and family around to invest into infrastructure and the next round we're doing were evaluated at four hundred million and I'll probably take a small investment at that and we'll build it up and while everyone else is getting bought out right now with Canadian stock they may win but I'm in it to get cashed out for real because I don't want some stock I don't have to learn how to sell stock or waiting and play that game I want one of the big alcohol companies was time to come catch me the [ __ ] out as they should I want Heineken to come cash me out I want a Southern Wine to come cash me out I want them to come with that check cuz they got it constellation just put four hundred million

about a publicly traded company in Canada that doesn't have the most revenue I think the revenue was negative a lot or whatever it was they don't have hell of money they just have the brands mmm so I'm building a house of brands it's gonna be like Facebook and when they come they're gonna have to buy us and they're gonna I would much rather a constellation come give me four billion dollars I'll look at that eight hundred million dollars like thank God I didn't do it or maybe I won't but that's that's the risk I was willing to take", "9KgT2KtwzcA": "in the cut welcome back everybody to a

white fire star dog or white dog yeah so online as i was looking up it's uh like a 60 40 indica dominant strain so it's got some good potency on it and the main flavor you've got coming through there's that og fuelly flavor mixed with like the sweet floral star dog flavor it's been a while since i've done one of these sunday strain reviews it's difficult describing the flavor of smoke but you can tell this is a very high quality strain but good like white ash on it yeah the key production on it's pretty good and yeah the nugs and everything look really nice on it big nugs it grinds out quite a bit and yeah it's nice and it's just few it's just potent man d it's fuelly it's kind of like a diesel e strain which i which is one of my favorites but it's like a twist on star dog you know

in live respectmyregion.com i've got an official west coast we tour review today featuring ember valley one of california's most popular a bud tender favorite across the state i'm very excited today's strain is the berry jack hybrid thc listed at 23.1 percent we've got cultivation date march 2nd 2020 packaging date may 7 2020 so we're looking at cannabis that is you know roughly five and a half months old packaged on may 7 so roughly packaged uh three months and two weeks ago so definitely something that should be good should be terpy should have a lot of flavor i'm personally excited so let's dive right in i will give you guys a one hit review and then two hits with the score per how i usually do it in my joint effort pre-roll series i open the tube as i smell it there's this slight fruity chemically smell but unfortunately it does look like there is a bunch of flower cannabis outside of the pre-roll and in the tube so let's check this out here yeah there's definitely definitely some good some shake coming out of here it looks like it's probably coming out of the mouthpiece which would make sense because as you guys can see there is a complete open circle in this joint mouthpiece there is not a crutch super interesting that there's not a crutch here hopefully it doesn't impact a smoking experience but i'm definitely sure that cannabis is floating out of this and into this too because there's you know because there's no approach we've got a nice evenly stuffed j that is how it came in the joint i did not unravel it yet so i can see that is as this is bouncing around in the tube because it's not twisted flour is leaking out of the joy tube so a little bit of quality control there but it's hard it's tough with the pre-rolls it really is because so much happens um you know sometimes it's only done by hand sometimes brands only use you know machines to stuff them etc i'm not sure at the details so let's just dive right into the smoke shall we the dry hit has flavor but dry hit us flavor and i didn't get scooby snacks in my mouth when i just did that dry hair so that was nice all right here we go you guys ready so on the first hit right there very smooth um not much flavor the aftertaste right now [Music] it's just really that of burnt smoke burnt paper uh a little bit of burnt earthiness i'm not getting a huge terpene profile that i would think would come with berry jack so second hit usually we get the better taste let's check it out yeah so per usual second hit much more flavorful you guys can see i got the cough that time um let's see i'm getting notes of berry i'm getting limonene i got a little bit of pinene again this is the berry jack so i would expect a little bit of that terpinoline a little bit of that pinene the limonene that you would get in a jack herrera cross or a dutch treat or an amnesia hay something along those lines but this berry here gives it this earthiness and those these berry tones i'm really liking it let me hit it one more time and i'll give you guys the official score out of 100 simply because that first taste did not that first hit did not do this justice the second hit was so tasty a third hit is necessary here we go all righty so i have 10 categories for this uh pre-roll review the west coast we tour official official rating system does 100 points ten categories each uh presentation first you know i look at the ember valley tube and i think you know it is a basic joint but i really enjoy the logo the font and the white and red coloring i think it pops so although it is a standard joint tube um you know plastic not glass i'm gonna give them a decent score uh probably you know somewhere in that eight to nine range um simply because you know i do like their red white and black that they do i think it's attractive appeal same thing ember valley has lots of respect and clout here rightfully so and rightfully earned in california so i do feel like the appeal is there again i'd have to go eight to nine closer to a nine the color you know you talk about the color what is color meaning canvas well when i look at the joint and i look at the color of it you know if this joint were wrapped in the same paper and i could tell that the wheat inside was brown well then the color would be bad so color on this is appropriate for a flower pre-roll there's chunks in here i can see some some good bits of pre-roll is an attractive color you know it could be barf brown or green it's just not attractive so the colors there the smell when i opened the tube i said that there wasn't really a terpe smell but to correct myself there was berry notes there was this you know slight gassy musk maybe not gas but this muskiness and i think that's evident that it is one of the very uh notes or natures of this strain the berry jack so smell i'll give it you know maybe a high six maybe a low seven now when i talk about the taste the first hit not so great and as a consumer that first hit is usually everything that's going to determine whether or not they really want to keep smoking it or how impactful that that experience you know how powerful that memory really is so taste with this i'm gonna give it an you know a nice eight to two you know eight point two five to a five probably closer to eight point two five i like it i wish there was more jack to it um that first hit kind of gave me a little bit of a sour puss taste you know what i mean it just wasn't the best so i'll give it the 8.25 on the taste for this uh it tasted good i don't want you guys to you know be get this get this the wrong way it does taste very good um potency potency potency potency when we're talking potency that's thc 23.1 this is a sativa i'm talking talking talking i got lots of energy i think the potency is right on point um it's hard for me to give it at a 10 out of 10 when the thc scores are low but i do feel that the thc the terpenes are you know creating a nice entourage effect i can feel my heart kind of racing and pumping due to the sativa nature the sativa hybrid nature of this so potency i'll give it the i'll give it the 8.75 maybe even the nine i think it's right up there with where it should be potency-wise for this strain um experience you know i'll give it a nine i'll give it a nine because you know these pre-rolls can range anywhere between 13 and like 18 bucks sometimes you might even pay 20 for the grand but that's that's pretty rare so with that said the experience for me i feel is appropriate for the price appropriate for the smoke the strain i'd say the experience for me is a perfect ah maybe you know i'll give the experience a nine i'll give the experience a nine and the reason why i give it a nine is because again there was some some scooby snacks throughout the j it wasn't twisted perfectly uh the ash is looking good um but that first hit was rough now more information available is a new category this year for us the reason why we added that is because as a consumer i want to be able to look up more information about the strain or more information about the brand you know instagram facebook linkedin etc so lamber valley has a strong internet presence there could always be more information about the strain and pre-rolls you know helping me to guide it you know lighter versus you know the hemp wicks etc so more information available i'm gonna give them a solid eight uh i do feel like more like i say most brands can improve on this more more information should always be available the day that a brand gets a 10 out of 10 is the day that i'm celebrating and filming a video just shouting out that brand hasn't happened and what i recommend i would absolutely recommend this berry jack hybrid from amber valley i feel like it's worth smoking you know 10 out of 10 times i just wish this particular joint was a little bit more less messy you know the pre-roll being kind of undone at the tip kind of impacts it but yes 10 out of 10 i would recommend an overall score for me ah when i taken things all in consideration and just to give it an overall rating i'm gonna stick with a solid nine um i think you know the strain the flower the actual cannabis side of things made it a very positive experience but i definitely feel it's important to highlight some of the other things you know the scooby snacks um you know there could always be more information available online uh there aren't actually any terpenes listed here on the joint tube so i feel like that is kind of a missed opportunity that could be still capitalized on over the you know next few years so overall score 9 out of 10 this is a high quality pre-roll i highly recommend you guys visit any of the dispensaries in norcal or socal that carry amber valley there's literally i believe 150 to 250 dispensaries that carry amber valley maybe more if you guys have any questions about this product any of my ratings or rankings please feel free to drop a comment and send me a dm i would love to talk with you about my thinking about why you know why i chose these numbers and this you know the strain et cetera so appreciate you guys

pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website packcase.com i'm sorry packcase.shop you can get there from packcase.com as well um and now they're we're starting to be available in retailers so there's a whole bunch of distributors starting to pick these up so you should start seeing them in retail stores over the next few months and if you're a retailer and interested in picking up our products we have a wonderful wholesale section on paccase.shop so make sure to stop there put in a little vendor request and we'll make sure to get to you so you guys can start selling pack cases yourself cool cool yeah same thing for boveda um we're on amazon we're in the retail stores uh we have a direct site businesses we have a wholesale site too um yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's change that [Music] you", "YE0ybIVUu6E": "Joe Avella: Lowell Herb\nCo. is one of California's largest marijuana companies. Lowell specializes in producing\npacks of pre-rolled joints. Last year, it rolled and\nsold over 4 million joints. In order to do so, Lowell needs a lot of cannabis. This is David Elias,\nCEO of Lowell Herb Co. David Elias: Right now,\nwe're selling about 1,100 pounds a month, soon to be up to almost\n1,300 pounds a month. We're rolling 25,000 joints\na day out of this facility. Joe: The recent legalization\nof cannabis in California for recreational use has allowed companies like Lowell to grow at a rapid rate. David: As of last year, our revenues have\nincreased just over 300%. Joe: Lowell let me take a\npeek inside its facility to see how they make\nso many joints a year. Thank God, because I roll\nmaybe two or three a year, and they're all terrible. Let's check it out. How you doing? David: Right now, we're best known for our one-eighth pack of pre-rolls, which is seven pre-rolls\nin one-eighth of an ounce. We also have a quarter-ounce pack, which has double the number. We have jarred flower, which we sell one-eighth\njarred flower as well. AJ Fay: So, this is where\nwe store all of our flower. When it comes in, it goes\ninto a quarantine container, which is where we do our\ninitial R&D lab testing. When that comes back clear and it passes our\nquality-control standards, it moves over into these\nother two joined containers, which is all usable material. Joe: Each container\nholds about 2,000 pounds of marijuana. My new LinkedIn profile pic. Joe: Strawberry Banana, Mimosa. AJ: Some Gorilla Glue. Joe: Silky Johnson. AJ: The Rude Boy. Joe: The Rude Boy. You got any favorite strains? AJ: Sour Diesel. I love Durban Poison, and I love that Strawberry\nBanana; it's a great indica. Joe: All right, cool.\nAJ: Really relaxing. Joe: You seem like an indica guy. (laughs) The cannabis is put into this shaker to separate the big buds\nfrom the little buds. The big ones will be\nput in jars like these. Employee: This is 77 eighths in total. Joe: Seventy-seven eighths? Employee: Yeah. Joe: So... that's... gonna be 7 pounds? AJ: No, that's, like,\nless than half a pound. Joe: The first step in making\nso many pre-rolled joints requires this machine: a knock box. One-hundred paper cones,\npre-attached to filters, are loaded into the machine. Lowell starts with a blend of flower, which is added to a loading tray. Each tray holds 1 gram of cannabis. The tray is placed on top of the knock box and the machine vibrates and bounces, pulling the flower down\ninto the paper cones. Once the joints are filled, the trays are brought over to a roller. AJ: So, we have about 40\nrollers working each day on one tray per hour, so 100 joints per hour per roller, and that's where we get our about 25,000 joints rolled per day. Joe: Then the joints are\nbrought over to another station where they are placed\nin packages and sealed. David: When you think about pre-rolls, pre-rolls are very convenient. It's easier for the user; they don't have to buy the flower and roll it and then put it into a joint. Joe: Lowell also sells flower in jars if you like to roll your own joints. David: Here in California, we test for pesticides, microbials and potency. So, when a customer gets our product, they can actually see the\nTHC potency right on the pack and know that it's been tested for all the other items that are mandatory here in California. AJ: So, once everything's\nproduced and packaged, it moves into this container, which is our quarantine container. Joe: Gotcha. AJ: So, the lab comes here on site, they send their reps, and they do a random sampling based on the batch size. Joe: So, they just go in,\nthey grab one of these. AJ: So, this was a box of 25, they took two or three out\nof there for lab testing. Joe: Yeah, \"lab testing.\" AJ: And in a few days\nwe'll get the results back, which means if it passes it's able to be labeled and sold to the retailers. Joe: OK. How often do they\ncome through with tests? AJ: We test every single\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday. Joe: After it passes, the products are labeled, boxed, and shipped out. Got his newest product. They're coming out with 17-pound joints.", "9at3Iiw5VPs": "[Music] hello and welcome to the north coast journal preview where we take a look at the stories being followed in the upcoming edition of the north coast journal i'm your host dave frank and i'm joined by north coast journal's news editor thad greenson and arts and features editor jennifer from mikko cahill welcome guys david how are you doing right on doing well a little sunshine out there today and got some good news friends family news about more vaccines in the pipeline so i think people are starting to look towards that fourth of july weekend as a potentially uh you know fulfilling and rewarding date on the calendar where we might actually have some degree of normalcy so hopefully that's permeating your guys lives as well fingers crossed yeah stay optimistic right as best we can do um so that let's dive right in what's going on on the cover this week of the north coast journal well this week is our annual cannabis issue so um it is about all things uh all all things cannabis news um recently um but occupying the actual cover space of the paper is a story um following up on some reporting we did a couple years ago about the roanoke park public safety department to the police department at roener park and um some cannabis interdiction activities they'd been doing that became raised a lot of questions from the article it looks like there's been a federal indictment handed down on one of the local police departments in the 101 corridor can you tell us a little bit about the background on that and kind of what brought us to this point yeah so two two officers have been indicted in the case so far um and their indictments were unsealed friday um and so that's a lot of the documentation was was the actual charging document that we built the story on but the story takes root back in um in december of 2017 when a man by the name of zeke flatton actually a movie producer was looking to dabble in the cannabis industry visited humboldt county bought three pounds of cannabis and was transporting it south to a lab in the bay area for testing when he claimed that he was pulled over by an unmarked suv and by two officers who were wearing kind of tactical gear but no badges no name no name tags no patches kind of affiliating them with a specific agency they identified themselves as being with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and um asked if he was carrying cannabis he said he was asked to search the vehicle found the three pounds and basically said we're taking these you can expect to receive a letter from washington dc and we're going to go now um and zeke flatten is is a former cop himself um and um and a really sharp guy i mean just from interviewing him he's one of these people who has a pretty meticulous memory and an eye for detail and he said that it just didn't feel right um something felt really off about the stop he noticed that the officers never ran he gave them his license but they never ran his name um back to dispatch to see if you know there was any warrants or anything out for him didn't seem to run the license plate of his car um and didn't give him a receipt for the seizure of his cannabis um and so he said pretty quickly he came to feel that he was robbed he also noticed that while they said they were from a federal federal agency the car that they were driving had california exempt license plates which didn't line up again he's a pretty sharp guy who picks up on these details and so um he pretty quickly came to feel that he'd been robbed by what he figured were actual law enforcement officers but out acting outside the scope of their duties so he made a complaint to the fbi um and to the mendocino county sheriff's office because the traffic stop happened in mendocino um and that's kind of what got this ball rolling that now um you know two pl two and almost two and a half years later has resulted in these indictments almost three and a half years later so one of the things that he said was that um it wasn't the actual loss of value um that really triggered this it was his thoughts about something bigger must have been going on if this is how he was getting treated that maybe other people were getting treated the same way so you said he reached out to federal um law enforcement but there were he also reached out to local media is that right and kind of what element did local media play in bringing the story you know the momentum that built around this original complaint yeah it played a huge role and certainly zeke zeke flattened feels like it was it was crucial that it was really the tipping point um but i guess to your first point yeah he said that he really felt like um it wasn't the loss of three thousand dollars worth of weed it was the the violation and as somebody who'd been a police officer previously i mean he kind of understood that oath of office and he also just started wondering like if these guys are so brazen that they are going to impersonate federal officers outside of their jurisdiction and stop me in broad daylight and steal my weed like what else are they doing and who else are they doing this type of thing too um so worry you know he said that he made the complaint to the fbi and felt like it was initially kind of taken seriously or whatever but he was worried that it would just kind of die quietly that it would make it from kind of the the the main fbi office to the field office and then just kind of be quietly go away and so he decided um i think about a month after making the complaint to contact kim kemp a reporter based in southern humboldt and um to her credit she she took it very seriously um and um and started you know vetting his story and making calls and one of the last calls that she made before kind of going public with his allegations um was a call to the to atf just saying hey did you have officers in the field this day in this area and were you involved in this traffic stop and um while some of the other agencies had kind of been um i'd say a little bit evasive or a little bit squirrely or not really you know didn't seem terribly interested in her inquiries um atf did and atf i think seems like really kind of its ears perked up but the the idea that somebody might be out there impersonating its officers and so not only did they they give a statement to kim but they also um immediately kind of reached out to zeke and asked if they could contact zlatan and i think he said that they were on the phone with him within an hour of kim contacting them um and then come to find out they then exerted some pressure it sounds like on the fbi and on local agencies to kind of saying hey this is something that needs to be taken um seriously and and zeke really believes that that you know kim's inquiry and her subsequent reporting really got this ball rolling um and after she reported i think one or two stories on um on zeke's allegations um the um the lead roner park officer um who's been indicted uh or former officer uh jc tatum who headed the the roanoke park interdiction team um took a really kind of interesting step of issuing a press release kind of in response to kim's coverage trying to explain away zeke's allegations um and um the fbi the f the indictment certainly says that this was a fraudulent press release in a fraudulent police report designed to kind of cover his tracks um that's the allegation anyway um but there were some things that just didn't match up about the press release and from just a journalist who's seen gobs and gobs of law enforcement press release releases it just was strange it didn't have an exact date it didn't have an exact time it didn't identify the kind of car zeke was driving it didn't name him you know didn't have his name in the press release didn't identify a quantity of marijuana seized it was just it was atypical and i think a lot of people noticed that and then it brought a new attention to this case so the uh the charges are cons for two officers tatum and huffaker are conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official rights and then officer tatum former officer tatum also faces additional charges of falsifying records in a federal investigation in order to cover up alleged theft right so what and then also a charge of tax evasion as well oh right exactly yeah like uh al capone the tax man will always get you um so you know what kind of transpired in this investigation um that that you know what are some of the elements of the story that kind of sent out to you like that you said he was the head of a of a interdiction task force yeah and so yeah what what are some of the details that kind of stand out in terms of the 101 court or interdiction team so i think there's three things i'd want to hit on there the first it was actually not in in the indictment but was uncovered by kqed in an investigation it did after kim kemp's initial reporting in this um and they requested gobs and gobs of records from from roanoke park and and they found two things that were kind of interesting one is that roanoke park was kind of nationally awarded for its interdiction efforts at the time um for just the amount of the quantities of cannabis it was seizing and the amounts of cash it was seizing this was from a law enforcement perspective an enormously effective interdiction team um headed by tatum and then um they found that um basically when when a law enforcement agency seizes say 50 pounds of cannabis it's kind of impractical to expect them that they're just going to hold all that as evidence until the case goes to trial and so what they do in these large drug seizure cases is they hold on to a sample of it but then they destroy the rest and there's a really meticulous process they have to follow to do this of getting a court um destruction order and then they're supposed to you know um transfer the the drugs to a specific officer who's then um uh kind of ordered to destroy them in a very specific way and then document it with a destruction um with destruction documentation and so what kqed found is that for at least 800 pounds of cannabis over like a two-year period rohnert park was unable to actually show documentation that it was destroyed they had court orders telling um the department to destroy it and they had documentation that it had been handed off to jc tatum the sergeant in control of such things but there was no actual you know proof that it had been destroyed so that raised a lot of questions um then in the um in the indictment itself um federal agents um reviewed lots of body camera footage from the roanoke park police department and they were able to document numerous cases i think they identified five or six of them in the actual indictment itself but where officers seized cannabis or cash from drivers i think tatum was involved in all these traffic stops and did not provide them with any documentation did not provide for them with a seizure receipt and then also um for which the agents were unable to find any other documentation of this traffic stop so within roanoke park police records it was as if the stop had never happened it never existed there's no police report attached to it or anything like that um but they have this footage of them actually taking custody of cannabis from people um so that raised a lot of questions and then the last aspect is just the irs investigation um the irs did what seems like a pretty exhaustive investigation over several years of um officer sergeant tatum's um financial records and what they claim to have found is um hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash deposits um into his bank his and his wife's bank accounts and family members bank accounts um all of them in sums less than ten thousand dollars which and if you over if you deposit over ten thousand dollars in cash the bank is required to report that to the irs and so the they're alleging that this is very much a pattern of somebody trying to conceal illicit profits um and so all of these three things together i think really raised questions about the scope of what was happening in roanoke park um over this time period and um while the indictment is really related to two specific traffic stops in december um and um and then for um you know for sergeant tatum the um you know the tax evasion and the attempt to cover up as well i think the um other information indictment really kind of leads one to believe there might be other shoes to drop and there might be other actions coming gotcha well there's so much more in the article um hopefully people check it out thank you for sharing uh your insights on this with us um i know these officers are facing a lot of time and and it you know we'll see how it plays out and we'll see how you know i'm sure you guys will follow it down its uh path um yeah so what one other thing i wanted to ask you about um there today actually breaking news uh happy st patrick's day there's breaking news in the sacramento bee about the eureka police department a few officers communications can you tell us real briefly a little bit about that breaking story yeah real briefly um a reporter for the sacramento bee um obtained from from an unnamed source um screenshots of group text chats with six epd officers that include um just lots of very vile things uh misogynistic and um really dehumanizing language um directed at uh people that um that these officers were in charge of protecting and serving so it really raises a lot of pretty alarming questions absolutely something that we at the journal are following up on as we speak and we'll continue to do so and hopefully uh bring more of that to light well fantastic thank you yeah that's available online like like north coast journal sacramento b's also online check it out um how about you jennifer what's going on this week on the arts and features beat with you you know so for our cannabis issue um i you know i had wanted to include something about you know people infusing foods with cannabis for a while but i'm not sure if you're familiar with jessica ashley silva if you um she's written for us before she covered the guy fieri barbecue contest at the fair the sweaty meat fest i believe she called it and um i i saw that she had posted a while ago a fail and you know i love a food fail but this was an infusion fail and so i asked her to jump in and write about it and also i want to say that i feel partly responsible for this fail um i asked jessica to write about a cannabis pairing dinner which was a virtual event usually you know cannabis dinners you go and you get a whole infused multi-course meal that i don't know how you get home from but um you know when people do these really fancy-schmancy meals infused with cannabis but this was a virtual one given our times and so she cooked at home along with a chef who was you know using fancy oils and swirling things on dishes and it was you know very very fancy and it it gave her a sense of maybe hubris and so she and some friends dove into some cannabis cooking and everything was going great and then she had this very cheesy burger that was so great on this some sort of infused burger thing and then she was like why don't i just make some infused cheese and she made this attempt and to her credit she made a really beautifully formed three fresh mozzarella balls and um you know they look great if you look at it in black and white if you look at it in color and she wrote about the you know the the hubris the fall the tragic outcome of trying to infuse it because it came out sort of the color of silly putty sort of a brown gray unpleasant and um when she described trying it she was like you don't taste brown please don't taste brown please and it tasted so brown it tasted as she she describes it as tasting like dirt hay and dead plants yeah and then of course you know like a good you know growth raised in the right family she tried not to throw out food and she tried to apply it to a pizza with a lot of garlicky pesto and hope no no nothing nothing could cover the taste of of swamp from that mozzarella but um you know she talks about sort of the basics of of how you infuse food and um it was a learning experience for me to read about um but also i really like her attitude um uh if you're if you're in humble foodies you know her it was one of the admins and um she's very funny and even honestly i always enjoy when she you know blocks someone or kicks them off of the side it's always great fun but she talks about the value of food fails and most of the time on something like humble foodies we're sharing you know our successes look at this amazing rack of lamb i made look at this fantastic fettuccine i made and people don't really share like oh jesus what did i do to this poor piece of meat but here she is and she was saying that she learned something which is that okay mistakes were made and here's what she could do instead next time like maybe a flavorless uh instead of working directly from flour maybe she could use you know a flavorless extract would be better next time or you know maybe mozzarella is meant to just be a mozzarella right it has that cure maybe we infuse other things um but she you know she took it as a learning experience and she also was like well you know what i did figure out how to make some cheese so hopefully she'll be back to do that again but um yeah if you've if you've ever tried failed or tried to smile through someone else's failed infusion meal i strongly recommend it i mean the only thing that i forgot to ask her is if it's i mean i would imagine that the thc quality was still there but despite that i think um despite the effects of cannabis it didn't make her enjoy it anymore which is too bad that's yeah which you know i i get the boost of um the boost of enjoyment that people get from you know having cannabis infused foods i i totally get the draw if it's a tenth of what i experienced when i was pregnant then i don't know why everyone's not eating cannabis infused food all the time but other than having to drive um but yeah it's a fun read and you should definitely check it out and definitely not do what she did that is amazing yeah so it sounds like mozzarella should be left as mozzarella you don't need to infuse it it's kind of i mean isn't there already a high to cheese isn't cheese its own drug so it takes more and more yeah speaking of uh own drug um you did a satirical piece maybe not so satirical uh cannabis strains we need in 2021 and wish were real tell us a little bit about that because that is hysterical i'm gonna say it's only barely satirical because um so i've done this for a few years in a row and i have had a couple of people who were like so i don't understand where can you buy these yes actually there isn't one that makes you feel like a disney princess that's not real i made it up um what i what i like to do is go through and look at real strains and look at their descriptions and how they describe the crosses and whatnot and look at some of the really hilarious names that they have and i must say that one of the challenges is coming up with names that aren't already strains so you know when i was looking up like there's a there's a strain that um a fake string that is for people who are really upset about dr seuss you know if you're like really upset about it which relax relax what happened on mulberries or what was it i can't what i saw on mulberry street i have a copy it's not great it's no cat in the hat but people are so upset about not making more of them you know the ones that are out there are out there but people are so upset about and i thought well i should have a strain that helps people cope with that stress and i looked up and i could not believe there isn't already a strain called who hash [Music] but evidently an opportunity missed um and there are a few other ones that are some of them that are meant to help you through the stress of the pandemic like darth vaxxer which is sort you know sort of my little tribute to thaad who is a very big star wars fan as you can see from his background um and uh legion of zoom which is meant to help you feel more more like you're really in the room with people when you're even on screen um which i personally don't want [Laughter] but some people might you know it can be very draining having all your interactions remotely she says as she's having a skype conversation with someone that she used to sit in a studio with truth but it's fun to do so there's one um q-tips which i think was really funny about q and on and there's some other contemporary uh references but others are just more like um you know broadly uh appealing i suppose like tell us about sofa cushion uh sofa cushion is for when you just need to ride out the rest of the pandemic just keeping it mellow you know a lot of people have tried to be really productive during this and personally i feel that's a mistake it's been you know it's been so emotionally and mentally taxing for us to go through the ups and downs and the sort of national grief and personal grief and all those things and yet we have all these things telling us you need to hustle you need to be working on your side gig you need to be and some of that is survival financially but some of it is just the social pressure of always be productive always be doing something and so this particular strain allows you to just uh what do i have that it's it's um a couple of indica strains inertia and lazy boy to help you sink deeper and deeper into your couch until you become one with it which you know let me help you with that tap into your inner fauchy one kenobi yes somebody feel free if people want to make these strains um you know just send me a small fee and we'll be good yeah you got to trademark that stuff well right on there's a lot more in that article definitely folks check it out that's just about going to do it for us this week it flies by unfortunately uh north coast journal is available on newsstands now available online uh pick one up stay informed stay safe jennifer thank you both so much and we'll see you guys again next week see you next week [Applause] do [Applause] you", "lvrvXkDctnM": "what is up Kenna Pham and welcome back so check it out for this video right here I have some different flour for you guys I'm going to show you guys now all this flour right here is different price points this is all different levels of prices some of them actually might be around the same level of pricing but we have you know the more budgeted stuff down here going all the way up to the more expensive stuff and I'm gonna show you guys this as a comparison video so you guys can't compare the really cheap stuff to the really really dank bom top-shelf stuff and then that way you guys kind of got a good overview of what the flour scene is like here in a state of Oregon okay so if you're coming to Oregon if you already live in Oregon this is a great video to kind of give you a good layout of what to expect you know what I mean if you're coming here and you're like hey how much money do I set aside that what do I want to get blah blah blah blah this video can help you so without further ado let's just get into it okay guys so first up let me set some of these ones aside because we're gonna get to those those are not where we're going to start off we're gonna start off with the lowest the cheapest ones and work our way up so the cheapest one I have right now here is this misty mountain days coming in at 16 percent THC this is an indica and this is by green source Gardens okay now this right here runs about four dollars and fifty and over 4.4 dollars and 20 cents sorry so this is a four dollar 20 cents a gram so just imagine what you could get for like a quarter or even an ounce of this stuff because you can't pick up ounces here in Oregon so but anyway that is what it looks like okay [Music] that's what that's what we're dealing with for the $4 20 cent section really cheap really really budgeted I didn't want to go really lower than this even though they do have stuff that is lower than this they do have stuff that's like three dollars a gram two dollars a gram stuff like that but you know this is just I figured you know this is pretty good budget like four dollars come on so anyway I'm gonna open this up so that's what you're dealing with okay [Music] okay not too bad I personally wouldn't smoke this just because that's my personal preference if you are somebody that's on a budget or you don't really give a [ __ ] you just want whatever you know you can get the most of most bang for your buck this is something that you should try out then okay if that's your preference if that's gonna work for you then more power to you however my personal preference I would not waste my money on something like this okay I don't smoke this kind of butter this is really really low grade Bud really really low grade but okay however it's not the worst I have had like nasty green bud that was just awful anyway up next this is at the seven dollar price range so seven dollars a gram so we jumped from four dollars to seven and this is Sookie's by Alta crest and this is a 50-50 hybrid which I kind of doubt that I don't believe that it's a solid 50/50 hybrid it's probably more like 60/40 or something like that anyway 23 percent THC with pretty much no CBD I mean it's going got a point one percent CBD so there you go that is that there's test date let's open it up and take a look at it alright alright so we're just gonna show this big nugget here or vamo it's really dry oh I just lost some of it I just lost a little chunk over here oh shut those right there anyway there's really dry guys this one's really I mean you guys could probably hear it it's just snapping dry and it's not bad I guess it's all I definitely stepped up from the $4 gram you know at least it's more of a dense nug let you know but that is the $7 section so that is what you're going to kind of expect if you're you know looking for that $7 budget-friendly strain you're gonna get stuff like that majority you might you might you might get lucky and find you know something here in Oregon from a certain dispensary that is really bomb at that price point but most of what you're gonna find at the $7 price point is going to be something along those lines okay now we're going to move up one more to the next tier which is I believe here this $10 yeah so we're gonna bring in the $10 ones alright so first up for the $10 actually you know what I'll do this one first actually since this one's opened here at the top we'll do this one first alright so $10 a gram this is probably let me just say this before I get into this $10 and up is probably as far as quality goes as far as good quality this is probably the best bang for your buck $10 now these $10 strains right here I'm about to show you would go like I've seen firsthand in places like California and Nevada I've seen strains just as dank as this if not a little less dank go for like 15 18 dollars a gram in those states so being able to get what I'm least three right here on a buck show you 410 that's phenomenal within itself okay can't beat Oregon prices telling you anyway so look at that this is the hypnotoad 20% THC headrush hills is the farm this is one gram and just look at that purpleness man look at that purple old [ __ ] I dropped it anyway let's do it pull these bad boys out of here oh look at that just beautiful nuts frosty as hell man yeah look at that frost on those nugs beautiful purple in there nice tints of green just what you want when you're looking for nugs and the smell I know you guys can't smell none of this but holy [ __ ] guys this smells great the terpenes are on point with this okay this is some really really good quality for ten dollars a grand okay same with this one this is a 10 gram one two when we open it here so this is the Donnie burger 13 okay you green no-till [Music] and again $10 a gram for this one and I mean just look at that Oh smells phenomenal it's very pungent guys as soon as you take it right out of the bag I mean just phenomenal smell just nice dense nuggets break up nice like if you're rollin blunts or something with this you'd give me you'd be the joint lovers and blunt lovers would love that flower right there it breaks up really nice all right so again Donnie burger 1325 percent THC and then here we go this is the garlic breath now this is probably one of my favorite strains out right now with the GMO if you ask me hey what are your favourite strains right now what what do you recommend uh it would either be the GMO or these garlic breath sorry this garlic breath or the garlic mince uh really I mean I just love stinky strains okay I really do I love that gasps that pungent nest that smell through the bag that's what I like that's what I look for now look at this is a big note look at that Oh beautiful how does one want you to know you're my favorite girl I didn't look at that nice big nug fire ten to ten dollars a gram again I'm telling you that's what to expect here in the state of Oregon okay now so those are the ten dollars set those over here now we're gonna move on to the 12 to $14 arrange now I have a twelve dollar one and then these other two or fourteen so I'm going to show you guys the twelve dollar one so this is the m4 twenty nine percent THC this is super dense that's like a rock I mean that is super dense guys smells great though smells really really good but super dense and just very nice lime bringing some bright orange hairs very nice bug like listen to that listen that listen sit yeah it's dense but so twelve dollars a gram twenty nine percent THC top shelf now we're moving to the last two which are these two $14 a gram and if you ask me my opinion right now they're not that much better than like these are like when I showed you guys these ones that are ten I mean they're almost there they're really not better okay they're kind of the same these just happen to be more expensive I don't know why oh I really don't maybe it's just the flour company or whatever but this is voyager number one from seven points oregon twenty nine percent THC with pretty much no CBD and i'm going to show you guys this 14 dollars a gram for this [Music] or get that nice snug again dents really dental if you you're liking those hard den snugs then you know you want to go for the 12 to $14 sections because that's where you're gonna get a lot of these dents nuggets the smells great phenomenal smell very chirpy very very chirpy I guess maybe that's why it varies in price why this is more expensive than the other stuff is probably because maybe it's more chirpy I don't know but then here we go another $14 gram one strawberry cream 25 percent THC again by seven points Oregon which is a good farm they make good product wash look at that beauty look at that beauty it's the cutie with the bootie I mean seriously though like just nice dense little little tents little very very little tents of purple in there you know just frost it as [ __ ] I mean it looks like somebody took like a salt shaker of tri Chrome's and just shook it all over this bud I mean just drenched it I mean it's super trike City here and I really like that I enjoy that again smells super good it's got like a fruity strawberry smell so that that's really good so there you guys go this has been a comparison video of the cheap budgeted stuff versus the more expensive stuff here in the state of Oregon now let me just end the video by saying this okay guys here in the state of Oregon this is kind of the norm of what you're gonna find at most dispensaries now there are gonna be some premier dispensaries I like to come from your dispensaries because they're more high-end so you will find stuff at those kind of dispensaries that are maybe like you know 16 to 18 dollars a grams stuff like that however this is what you're going to find add just your average basic dispensary that you're going to be visiting in your local town or wherever you're visiting a hatch or anything like that this is majority what you're gonna find and you're gonna find dank bud like this at good prices okay here in Oregon we have the cheapest weed in the United States okay I know there might be some people in the comment section that would like to argue that point maybe they're from Colorado and stuff where they also have cheap weed there as well but Oregon is the cheapest in the United States we have the cheapest and the best bang for your buck okay as you guys can see these $10 grand ones you can't like that's phenomenal that's phenomenal okay so I like I said I just want to do a comparison video show you guys comparing the budgeted stuff the cheaper stuff the the B stirs the whatever you want to call it the low end low grade cannabis versus the high grade you know top-shelf stuff you know that way you guys can get a good idea of kind of what it is you're dealing with here in the Oregon cannabis market okay now I've done a lot of videos on the flower here in Oregon I've done videos if you guys check my channel out I've done videos where you know it's the budgeted but a bunch of different cheap stuff I've done stuff what top shelf looks like here in Oregon I've done this video now that you know kind of compares the two so I'm going to be moving on to dams I got a bunch of dabs here we're going to be moving on to a bunch of different products and stuff like that that we're gonna be moving on to and I'm gonna go show you guys in the next video kind of a comparison of cheap dabs what are expensive dabs and then kind of doing the same thing where I'll show you guys comparison of both cheap and expensive dams alright so I hope this video has been somewhat informational for you guys if you love Bud if you love cannabis

ingredients with that i so i n g r i n in gradients as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys tony robb here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're up in my car and we're about to review the wiz khalifa og by pure1 and just thinking about it i could have done this in my room because like vape cartridges don't smell that much but before i start this video i just want to give you guys a little disclaimer to watch out for fake cartridges when i looked up the pure one wiz khalifa og i had seen that there's a lot of people out there that had been scammed with fake cartridges so when buying a [ __ ] cartridge buy it from a reputable source and just don't buy it from somebody who's super [ __ ] shady so please watch out and with that out of the way if you guys want to see more vape cartridge videos drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below and without further ado let's get this video started whoop all right guys we got the pure one wiz khalifa oh g over here which is a indica strain i got 1 000 milligrams which is equivalent to 1 grams of concentrate and i bought this from a reputable source so i don't want you guys saying in the comments down below that this is a fake cartridge and just looking at the packaging the package is very beautiful you know with that gold tint on the side um with the warning label on the back which i will be reading for you guys on the back of this package it says wiz khalifa og the best hitting ceramic cartridge disposable cartridge 1 000 milligrams it says ingredients and i just want to [ __ ] point out which kind of scares me you know because i just said that this isn't a fake card they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n ingredients whatever in the ingredients it says cannabis oil natural terpenes all right instructions for use screw the cartridge onto the battery to ensure the best vaping we strongly recommend the pure one battery blah blah blah that's just advertising obviously for the brand inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat they're not saying how many times you should inhale and exhale repeat but i'm assuming like three to four times should get you gently or modestly baked um if you want to take it to a whole other level obviously you're gonna spam the [ __ ] cartridge up until you can't feel your brain but i would not necessarily recommend that as a natural product the color of the oil may have a slight variation without sacrificing quality prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat will cause the cartridge to leak now the government warning this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which is not the case in canada because it is 100 percent legal keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours i have never taken a cartridge where the delay is two hours it is generally like two minutes right like very rarely no actually it is i think impossible to smoke a joint or hit a cart and the effects hit you in two hours it's not inedible right cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery please use extreme caution and then there's the final warning which is not the government warning this product can expose you to chemicals including pulagon which is known in the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm for more information go to www.whatever blah blah blah blah and then you have like the purevape website and purevape instagram with that out of the way we're gonna open up the box over here and i don't want to destroy it right because it is a very beautiful box so i'm just assuming you either push it up ah yeah wow a beautiful push feature wow and i could keep this because this is actually a beautiful packaging so i'm gonna put that on the side and now we got the pure vape cartridge wow the color of it looks amazing like it's not too clear right but it's not too brown it's a right in between color we got one full gram but we got it over here and this is what it looks like it is kind of transparent if you put it up in the sunlight honestly and the color isn't too dark right it's not the darkest i've seen but it's not the lightest color and it is obviously not the same color as the packaging as they said on the back the color may be different blah blah blah blah blah we got the vape cartridge turned on now and i will be putting it oh i turned it off oh [ __ ] i will be putting it on the lowest setting and going to medium and then going to high and i will be telling you guys like what best setting to hit it because there's different types of vape cartridges where if you hit it on a high setting it just burns completely the car other vape cartridges if you hit it on the low setting it just does not hit and sometimes you know the middle setting just doesn't work so you got to try it out all right i'm on the blue setting which is the lowest setting and we're just going to follow the instructions that are on the package so for best use inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat so like i was saying i'm gonna inhale for three seconds exhale repeat three times for each temperature setting and then i'll be able to judge which setting is the best and tell you guys if it actually tastes good and then finally i'll take [ __ ] blinker because i know everybody wants me to take [ __ ] blinkers right but now the moment that you guys have been waiting for let's take the first three second puff so let's get it guys cheers what the [ __ ] [Music] why did that taste like dry pasta that wasn't the taste i was expecting what the [ __ ] like it literally caught me by surprise bro like i was expecting some sort of like stronger taste because it is like an indica and i was expecting like something you know a little fruity because like you know wiz khalifa og kind of a tropical fruity taste you know but no it tastes like dried [ __ ] pasta but i'll be taking another puff because like i said we're gonna repeat three times on each temperature setting so without further ado let's get it cheers guys okay on that second puff a little bit more fruity maybe needed a little bit time to you know heat up and activate um there's not much of that like you know tingling sense in the back of your ears and like inside of your eyeballs when you're hitting a cart there's not much of that to be honest with that second puff there's like a mix of like dried pasta and like fruity taste so i'll be taking the third and final puff on the lowest temperature setting so cheers guys well i'm just gonna be 100 honest after three rounds on the low temperature it did start to kick for me right i feel as if this was like a productive type of indica buzz because it's not really a body buzz it's not gonna like slouch you it's not gonna get you tired it's kind of like one of those productive ass buzzes in my opinion that's how it's feeling right but we will keep going up with the temperatures but we're on the [ __ ] red setting so that's the medium setting so let's see what the medium heat see if this shit's gonna start smacking and yeah let's get it guys cheers nice three second hit and wow okay the taste is way smoother so with a low temperature low setting it tastes like [ __ ] dry pasta with this it's just a fruity taste to it honestly it's maybe because the combustion is a little quicker but yeah i'm going to take the second puff on this one because it was super not harsh so cheers guys [Music] them three second puffs are very blessed [Music] overall this [ __ ] started to hit man you know the indica feeling is starting to creep up slowly maturely upon me right and i did get a full night of sleep so i'm not tired in that sense alright we will take the third and final puff of the medium setting let's get it guys cheers got that one all right so just overall the key difference with the medium setting is that the hit is a little smoother and it tastes a lot less like [ __ ] ala dente spaghetti you know what i mean so we're going to be moving on to the final heating temperature with the which is the highest temperature of the battery so we're going to be taking the three puffs off of this if there's a key difference or there's something to add i'll add it or else it's gonna be like some sort of i don't know three puff montage or whatever but let's get it guys cheers okay yeah i do have something to add with the high temp you can really taste the full amount the full flavor you know what i mean which is pretty sick so medium and high is better for for this strain there's like i said some other strains they prefer i guess low temperature to hit better but with the wuz khalifa og is tasting pretty pretty good so we'll take the second puff cheers guys nothing to add on that second puff so we'll go directly to the third one cheers just overall nine puffs in it really fries you like nine puffs in i was expecting to be a little slumped like a little you know all right guys this is future robin and i'm currently doing the outro because i just checked my computer checked the gopro and i just cannot find the rest of the video like for some reason it's just completely deleted maybe it got corrupted i don't know but i will be taking the blinker because obviously i promised you guys a blinker so i'm not gonna beat around the bush too much cheers guys alright this is like post post editing rob and i just gotta say that like i did hit a blinker i tried my absolute best to put my finger in a certain type of way where the camera would capture the actual blinking but like my dumbass kept my finger in front of the light so it did not appear in the video so you guys gotta take my word for it that i actually did hit a blinker and like i wouldn't be coughing uncontrollably and not being able to hold on the hit if i didn't take a blinker trust me on that take my word for it this is like post post editing rob i'm like on some omnipresent [ __ ] yeah okay i think i'm gonna leave now but god damn like i was saying the strain is very very like uplifting and it's not like a super indica for some reason like this train doesn't get you couch locked it doesn't give you that natural indica feeling it really uplifts you and it kind of gives you a boost of energy like i just took a blinker and i'm feeling up and at it right and i've been awake for like five six hours but besides the fact that the word ingredients is misspelled i really didn't join this cart and i do hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like please and hit that subscribe button if you haven't already check out all my social media

you know what i'm saying he did hook me up with some flour this isn't pixie stix flour by the way it's just a jar that he gave me but you know what i'm saying so far from you consuming these popcorn nugs what would you say you prefer would you say you prefer these popcorn nuts exactly i'm gonna get into what strain this is and everything you know what i'm saying oh do you prefer to get like a full-size nug or full-size zip or you know what i'm saying with regular-sized nuts if so i'm like all right well first of all you have to explain what type of popcorn next okay right right right okay let's look this isn't ordinary popcorn eggs okay this isn't like popcorn nugs from like you know what i'm saying you're alright harvest that just kind of came out these popcorn nuts specifically are from the bags of exotics like the entire it's a salad you know what i'm saying that's basically how the plug sells these it's a [ __ ] salad that's what it calls them and this is a combination of like zerber skittles a [ __ ] gelato all kinds of [ __ ] that this [ __ ] got bro he gave me like a whole list it's like seven strains that are basically put into these now i feel like these come from 400 to 600 zips that's something to take into consideration so it's bomb popcorn nugs it's like as bomb as it gets you know what i'm saying because you're smoking still from 500 600 zips but it just happens to be that they're popcorn nuts you know what i'm saying and i feel like oh my god it smells so gassy bro like bro like i was spending like 300 on zips that were like hit or miss like three hundred dollars on zips like you were like halfway through the j you'd be like yeah this is all right but you wouldn't be like you're stuck with like a whole half zip or a zip you know yeah and you wouldn't be like oh like every single hit is just so enjoyable you know what i'm saying it's just like you're left with this like i don't know man it's kind of like disappointment i feel like with some of these other zips that i've bought you know what i'm saying so to buy this and like to be at first when like when at first when they sent me the menu and they're like it's a shake and then it's it's 200 a zip i was like i mean it's not shake it's a popcorn nugs and it's 200 a zip it's like popcorn eggs for 200 is hit but you must be [ __ ] out of your mind bro like i was 200 a zip for like gas pack you know what i'm saying yeah for some gas pack so i thought this was crazy but right now bro like especially in california the game is really [ __ ] up so yeah you can like the homie was like bro i got 120 ounce but probably with like some greenhouse like i was like all right bro like i get it there is cheaper butt out there okay so before all the critics come in here like nah i brought my plug got it bro like you look bro these are real growers these strains aren't just gelato that was growing at the homies [ __ ] house these are from real farmers you know what i'm saying shout out darwin farms you know what i'm saying but i'm gonna just show you guys real quick i'm gonna do a little film on the on the phone just so you guys kind of get an idea can you hold the tree actually babe cause i'm trying to do everything popcorn popcorn nuts see what i'm saying like there's a lot of knives that are pretty big yeah i mean i wouldn't say that the nugs are like completely super small either you're right i mean but jesus i mean like guys like this [ __ ] is gas boy it just looks purple and green everywhere purple and green all over the tc fam tray you know what i'm saying jesus oh that gas pack you know so now i mean i'm gonna break down my perspective on what i think about smoking popcorn nugs first of all i thought it was like kind of funny like bro this dude's really selling popcorn now it's like and not just like selling them but he's really flipping them you know what i'm saying 200 is it i was a little skeptical of it but the homie was like nah bro it's all exotic strains you know and then like the homie sen the plug sent back over like all the strains and stuff and i was like all right bro i was like let me get like a half zip of it um just to see like how it smokes you feel me just like see what's up bruh i haven't been disappointed you know it probably even slaps more than any other single strain yeah it slapped harder than these other 300 zips that we got that came by themselves you feel me so i don't know bro i mean like 200 is it popcorn nugs but they're exotic nugs and honestly like i don't mind them because these aren't like there's not like the whole bag is like this yeah you know what i'm saying like they actually have like decent-sized like nugs in there too so i don't know i feel like it's it's a steal i'll take it i don't need like the bigger size nugs just to feel right about myself i know when he was like i got some popcorn nuts and bomb popcorn nice but he pulled out the tray i was like at first i was imagining like little ass nugs you know probably like a little jar of bag full of little nuts but i was like oh it's not that bad and he hooked it up he gave us 34 grams for a zip yeah oh but he gave it to you like in the bag he gave it to us in the bags yeah for this one but he gave us 36 grams damn i was like all right [ __ ] that's that i'll take it i'm thinking you know what something about bigger nugs too y'all like you get a lot of stem out of big nugs so like the nug might look bigger it might look rounder way more but it's all the same yeah you start taking it apart and you start taking like half a gram off yeah off a big ass stem i feel like with these little nugs you get more flour out of it because the stems are a lot smaller on here so it's a lot less stem plus actually the same thing i don't know why people always like discriminate popcorn nugs like that hey yo look popcorn nugs are shitty when you have an all-right grow like if your grow is like mediocre then your popcorn nugs are just not like it's popcorn yeah it's gonna be like all that but like when you when you're buying from real farmers you know what i'm saying let me see real deal yeah you know what i mean these are 700 zips at the dyspo seven to eight hundred dollar zips right here at the dispel for this [ __ ] yeah so when you're buying from real [ __ ] growers like i don't know man i think it it plays out you know it all maps itself out i mean at least for me i see myself picking up another zip of these popcorn nugs for sure i'm even tempted i i i i just it makes so much more sense like then to go spend twice as much on all right but let me tell you this though you know how we got like two different strains right we had had the bastille gelato they were both bomb but they just had two different tastes to him one yeah like highs were different too but they were just like completely different strains so one was like bastille gelato and the other one was like some sort of zerber some [ __ ] but the one that had like that sour diesel taste to it like that like the bottom one i'll pick up a zip with that it's forced something for a zip of that but i feel like i would do it bro that's my car payment 470 something bucks that's my car payment my dad would always say el vicioso it is it's a big bill you know like so through if you add up everything you spend on papers we i don't want to do it i'd be so upset if i really sat back and try to look at every single thing you know i was doing the math i i'm spending about eight to a g a month on just wheat just sweet and that's not counting when you [ __ ] up on the weed and get the like wrong yeah because i've had some bags but i don't smoke the whole way that i just left there like and i'm like no this this one wasn't it you know what i'm saying like i'm turning the car off one time put the windows down it's a warm day it's been pretty chill like these past few days no like no get your seat a little closer i think that's why like from the bottom i'm too far away like that there you go yeah why am i too dark well if you're further away with like all the light behind us and stuff you're gonna start looking a little different well i have a lot of hair there's like a whole mass going on right now at the park where yeah there's like church or something yeah like these people came and set up their own church at the park it's dope the way they did it though they have like speakers and stuff hey bro it's dope to see them doing something like this in the hood because it's not like a bad part like it's a good spot that they that's what you think well i mean it's the hood i get it i'm just saying baby you know [ __ ] got killed here plenty of times from here baby i know i'm just letting you know though like i know i get it the [ __ ] is getting killed here just like it doesn't look bad the park you know [ __ ] you know what's crazy about valeo it's not even like the adults that live here that make it bad like the people that let's say on these houses right here they're not [ __ ] gang bangers they're not it's the kids that grow up in different sides of valeo like like the [ __ ] you know what i'm saying like real projects in vallejo that come out of like the welfare apartments and stuff like that that start [ __ ] [ __ ] up that start going to different sides of the city and being like well this is our park now you know or whatever like oh yeah exactly that's where like all the [ __ ] murders and all that [ __ ] come through like actually r.i.p man a couple people there's like at least two or three people i went to high school with one of them got killed here well two or three of them got killed in different sides of valeo and like my high school i didn't end up doing high school i know doing high school in american canyon and those people did high school in american county too and got killed in valeo at our age you know one of them died like last year actually two of them died like uh right when we graduated one day like 18 got shot like a couple days after graduation the other one died at like 19. and uh last one i'm talking about that like a year ago and that last one died right here at this park he got shot he got shot in the car he was in the car and got shot up and well [ __ ] just like what like literally last week you know where we get senorita bread yeah they killed somebody right there yeah if we go there right now there's still the like candles and and flowers and everything that they went it was in the car nah what's crazy was that i think that fool was like inside the store like the little cvs or whatever that little pharmacy is i don't think it's a cbs but the one with the little pharmacy is the rite aid i think or something like that the one that's right next to the [ __ ] yeah it's like a dollar general store i think baby it's a dollar store oh i think okay it used to be it used to be some sort of like okay whatever this [ __ ] it is i believe that from what i hear um they found him in the store and like kind of like went after homie outside and then um they shot him he was really young it's almost like they hunt them huh yeah he would i believe he was gang banging um but he he died very young very very very young and [ __ ] man you know that [ __ ] side of me bro like i hate growing up around that stuff man i hate hearing the type of stories and [ __ ] it just hits different too when you you you've met the people you know what's crazy is that fool that just died i didn't even met him but i just i know people and like the same people that i know were like bro like they just shot you know this person i know and then like i drove by and i saw that everything was just still like you know like that just happened and i was like man bro like and then right here in american canyon in city where things don't even pop off the employee that got killed remember i told you because he told the guy to wear a face mask yeah yeah that's crazy that's too crazy an employee got killed because he asked the customer to wear a face mask and the customer got so mad shot him imagine doing your job like literally doing your job like you think he was willing to deposit his life for that business to go tell that person hey put on a face mask no but you know what i'm saying i don't think people will ever like think oh if i go do my job and just tell the dude something as simple as put on a face mask this person is going to get so mad it's like when you go to a restaurant or something and people just start arguing or whatnot like bro they're just doing their job but like when you go to verizon and you're already like arguing with the person about the phone like at the end of the day they're just they're doing their job it's not their fault your phone's not working it's not their fault the business is being whack like they're just they're collecting a paycheck doing what they're told to you know it's not their company so you could be like oh it's your fault and then take it out on them you know man and talking about all this [ __ ] bro to all my youngsters out there bro yeah i stopped being so [ __ ] with the pistols bro like i i understand keeping the strap on you so you don't get caught slacking like if somebody pulled a strap out on you and you got your strap and you had no yours boom like i understand that type of situation but bruh i don't get why we're in a generation where people were so [ __ ] people were so scared to fight people are so scared to get their ass beat that they'd rather squeeze that trigger instead instead of throwing hands and just owning whatever comes out of it yeah go watch the movie friday and i just i don't know like that's just whack to me it's just like bro it's real talk bro like y'all got beef with people bro just go throw hands bro ain't no need for anybody to get killed bro like sometimes the beef ain't even like you know what i'm saying or something not even worth your throwing hands sometimes not even worth your throwing hands i get it but i'm just saying it gets to that point though if it's to that point where you feel like i have to go you know i have to go prove my point or i have to go then then just go fight them you know what i said and even then bro even fighting you're really putting yourself in a crazy situation because okay everybody thinks that a fight it's all about as long as i don't get my ass beat bro you can kill somebody in the fight unknowingly you can drop them the wrong way you can like do something do one punch you know what i'm saying and that one punch starts to stops their heart like there's still a lot of things to it that you want to consider but i mean that's all i'm saying like that's how i grew up though i grew up like if you had a problem you go to the park and if that dude beat your ass last week you don't go the next day with the [ __ ] glock and go blow his head up it's like you [ __ ] wait a week and you go back the neck no no no no no no [ __ ] me you waited we go back the next week and then i want to rematch see if you beat my ass last time we're going again training you know i know but a lot of people don't see it that way like for example if you drop the gun and you're like let me go handle this throw hands you end up beating him right then a lot of people don't know how to take an l yeah don't get up pop grass right there like yeah they're not gonna wait till next [ __ ] week i'm saying they're gonna go back home that second and get the strap if they wanted to like there's people that really don't know how to take an l you know so at the end of the day just you know what just don't go get into drama don't get into some [ __ ] problems especially with people that are not worth it yeah if you can stay out of it stay out of it but if you go if you don't handle bro i'm saying that don't be so [ __ ] bro like hopefully your enemy isn't that [ __ ] either you know what i'm saying hopefully he that person man enough or woman enough to just say like let's throw these hands let's get it over with and then like let's let's keep living life like what the [ __ ] like i feel like real talk and it's hella hard to see it like this but we are all literally brothers and sisters at the end of the day like that that's what it comes down to we're from different families but we're all this one species of [ __ ] human beings like that [ __ ] ain't going to change it'd be hella dope if we were all united yeah if people weren't like we would create a lot more we would be a lot more successful if people were less oh let's be egotistic and let's go against each other or let's try to compete to who's the boss and who's on top and but talking about all of these fights um the homie payway tto just threw hands where's my phone at what's right here the homie i don't even know how i put down the homie pay way to through hands um my girl actually hasn't seen the video at all i know he just told me like before we turned on the camera he's like oh i want you to see this video so we can react to it i was like bet yeah so i'm about to play it first of all shout out to uh t.o hey bro give it to you bro you know i'm saying i i give it to you for this i give it to you for not being [ __ ] i give it to you for handling yours and for not just being a rapper and you know what i'm saying by just being a rapper [ __ ] get on the beat and talk all this ass and then in real life be like they run i don't want the smoke you know what i'm saying in real life they run oh yeah that's looking good all right here all right so i have the video on my phone but as i play it on my phone i'm gonna have it playing on the screen for you guys for you guys to watch it as well all right hold on you're gonna have to put it like no i want to hold it like this so you can see it they can see it i'm gonna have it for them on screen okay they'll be fine they can see it good do his slides off he's like i give it to him i wouldn't want to fight his slides either i would throw mines off too he's still slick though i don't know who that dude is right there that dude trying to pull him off damn he's still here he's saying [ __ ] [ __ ] wait i want to know if that dude in the white did he walk up with t.o oh he didn't walk up with tio it looks like he wants stop grabbing him stop grabbing him yeah just let them [ __ ] do whatever they want to do see no grabbing no grabbing like bro get the [ __ ] off of him bro like get him off get them off you see if this is a real fight bro and you're gonna have nobody around bruh if you have nobody around to be get him off me get him off me [ __ ] would have choked you out you passed out and that's what happens in the real you know what i'm saying like there's a whole car passing by or what oh no that's probably the dude he pulled up in it how are you talking [ __ ] bro just got your ass beat he's the one that was saying all this [ __ ] right right right you either kill b it's your [ __ ] he just it's none that's it yeah but look he's they're saying that that's embarrassing that's embarrassing because he got up and he walked away but in all reality bro if homie and the white wanted to keep throwing hands right he would have walked he would have kept going after him he didn't want to throw hands either they were both exhausted and you know why because [ __ ] don't train bro people don't work out people have about 50 seconds of energy all right now we're gonna now we're gonna kind of slow-mo through this clip so i'm just kind of scroll it so we're gonna kind of scroll back right now so they're walking up to him right you got your three camera guys you got your camera guy on the left you got a camera guy on the right and i think that dude in the far back is the only guy that's with the dude in the white um but then it starts off the dude in the white [ __ ] up right here he looks at the other dude which i mean that could have happened to anybody because this other dude looks like he's about to do something you know this other dude looks like he's about to do something so he looks at the other guy the second looks at the other guy tio did exactly what he was supposed to do look in a in a [ __ ] fight like a boxing match or some other [ __ ] people would have been like this is dirty you don't do this [ __ ] in a street fight bro you always got to be the first one to throw a punch and if you already know it's about to go down and you have the chance because that [ __ ] look left you better suck that boy bro cause it's a street fight bro like no rules exist so the dude looks t.o kind of gets down now t.o bro this is the only advice i got to give to you bro if you want to throw a strong punch don't don't throw your hand all the way back like that like you see how you kind of went over his head a little bit i mean i know you connected with him but homie still had the chance to kind of to duck you hit like the back of his head also your feet kind of like flew forward when you did that like your whole body was a little off balance um i know that's that adrenaline rush though bro that's like that adrenaline is [ __ ] going through you so you're just trying to like not get knocked out but like for all my other people watching bro if you're going to get in a fight and you want to throw a strong punch and a fast one going around like that it's a weak it's a way weaker punch throw a straight punch like you know what i'm saying you'll really [ __ ] somebody up if you're right in front of me but [ __ ] throws a hand you know so he throw he throws the right then he lets the left kind of swing it looks like the left didn't really connect too well then the other dude kind of grabs teo's head like pushes his head a little bit tio gets up they kind of back away you know this is good this is this was good on t.o's and i feel like he hit he hit and he's like i'm back i'm back i'm a back i'm a back you know what i'm saying um like guys that's a good thing to do another dude was like [ __ ] [ __ ] this is going down so he takes his slides off right right here this other duke should have took off on ceo i don't know why he waited this long trying to get his hands up trying to like you know what i'm saying and again look look this is so scared right before the punch goes in teal doesn't even throw anything and look how he's blocking already he's not even throwing punches he's just blocking he's blocking he gets too close to tio tio timed him out to knew he was walking to him and he throws again this time this dude backs out but look at how off-balance this guy is both of them low-key but at least he was throwing [ __ ] though didn't throw one punch then he falls now how did he fall out did he'll punch him when he found he tripped him oh no i think he hit him with his right look you see right hand kind of goes under and right there you see hits him with the right bot straight to the jaw homie goes down right there tio you shouldn't need the [ __ ] out that cat bruh but straight knees you should have kicked him right there bro i woulda oh my god bro you could have stomped on this boy bro i'm serious like you could have got two feet in the air and just jump straight on top of his head or something i don't know that's what but boy you see right here this was on the floor like right there straight knee to the head bad i would have slept that boy he was waiting for it too and he didn't he wanted to go straight back to the hands so that's when like they kind of stopped by the hair am i tripping like it's almost like it looked like he picked him up or something i don't know if he grabbed him by the hair he almost looked like he had like i mean he basically just holds him in a lock now to the other dude that you're out here like trying to pull teo away bro look bro just just let them you know they were actually like punching yeah like let it be bro like why are you getting in the middle of this bro since when do street fights have a [ __ ] referee people start pulling up with the whole crew i mean like i don't know i just i feel like for a situation like that you gotta let them handle it bro you gotta you know unless look unless it's your homie right and your homies on the floor and somebody's just destroying him boom boom boom boom and you're seeing that your homie isn't moving or reacting to anything i think that's the only right time for you to go in and be all right bro like you proved your point you know what i'm saying you did your thing like it's done like get the [ __ ] out you know what i'm saying even if you're homie bro if you're seeing your homies just on the floor have somebody and he's just smacking this [ __ ] you got to break it up for your homie's sake because what if your homie ends up killing this [ __ ] goes to jail for life you know what i'm saying so that's the only time i feel like people should really go in but if people are tussling like even with the um that smooth geophyte geo couldn't throw hands for [ __ ] because not look let me tell you something the other guy couldn't throw hands either but the other guy was more collective that's the reason he never [ __ ] fell like he was a lot more calm if you really look back at the fight and you see he was calm the whole time he kept his distance he was letting [ __ ] smooth geo just tire himself out jill had too much adrenaline running through him but i feel like what [ __ ] up geo was people separating them and pulling them apart yeah but julia was way heavier than him so geo could have easily picked him up and slammed him on the floor and it would have been over like see for skinny people for i'm not skinny but i'm not that skinny no more but for light people bruh that's the biggest downfall is that even if you're a good ass fighter bro in a street fight bro if that person just grips you bruh and picks you up and slams you it's like damn you know it's a hard one to bounce back from yeah um and i'm saying it from experience i've been picked up and slammed when you get picked up and slammed bro you don't your whole world goes upside down like you don't even know what the [ __ ] is going on you feel me so that's how i see that and for my big people don't step sit there and just try to exchange blows you're big you want me to throw fast punches like you're big you're you're supposed to you know what i'm saying use what you got be a quarterback basically like run at this dude [ __ ] drop like you know have you has anybody ever ran up to you and like hit you like this really push you with their body weight yeah and they will drop you yeah like if somebody runs at you and really throws their body weight at you that [ __ ] will [ __ ] make it so imagine yeah so imagine being like a hundred pounds over somebody and that person's 100 pounds lighter than you that's like a little kid if you run at that person and you hit him that person is gonna [ __ ] fly bro that person is gonna go flying like you feel me that's why like bruh as a short person if i'm gonna fight a big person you're not gonna be there to be like i'm here to do a show no you're there to do what you got to do and get the [ __ ] out get yourself out of the situation like keep it moving you know what i'm saying throw the hardest [ __ ] four punches five punches you got then get the [ __ ] out of there and leave drop it real quick i just that's how i see it like you don't if somebody like okay no matter how big they are right and you hit that [ __ ] real quick the [ __ ] five fastest strongest punches you got in you no matter what how big they are you're gonna daze them the [ __ ] out so now you got this big ass human that's all dazed out bro you can run circles around him he'll never touch you anymore but my biggest advice is just leave and that person being hurt already they're not gonna you know unless your punches were weak and they were like oh [ __ ] you now you little [ __ ] like now you're getting changed now you're gonna get [ __ ] up but if you make your punches worth it you can you can do just enough damage to get the [ __ ] out of there or if you do it just right bro you might knock them out silly i've seen it happen too but i don't know man i think i should too much information to y'all man i don't want my enemies watching this [ __ ] and be like [ __ ] really doing it was he really gonna for my fans like you know what i'm saying at the end of the day like even if my [ __ ] enemies hear this [ __ ] bro it'll promise you bro it'll all go out the window when it starts because this is how it goes like 99 of people aren't in fights or they don't train they don't even do something as simple as like box or or spar in some sort of different combat sport so when it all starts their adrenaline's rushing and the only thing they can do is their natural reactions but they can't even use their brain like they don't know what to do they're they're just you know instincts and the instinct of survival kicks in but i feel like for people that fight enough like andre has explained it best to me shout out to the homie he was like bro it's like you see it in slow-mo and they just think you crazy bro like i have never and it's because i was too excited i was too much i had too much adrenaline every time i was gonna fight but when you really slow the [ __ ] down and you're like your head's in the right place you could literally see everything like you can clearly see their moves and it's so clear and it gives you so much time to like get the [ __ ] out the way you know what i'm saying i don't know maybe it's just something you develop as you [ __ ] as you keep training as you keep training yeah yeah because no y'all be moving fast as [ __ ] i don't know how to [ __ ] you slow-mo i'll be trying to like do that like look at the segundo slo-mo and that's how i end up getting knocked out because i'm just like i think it's kind of like driving like when you get good at driving you can start driving a little faster but you're seeing it and when something happens is like you react to it really quick because you have those you know it's in your head like to just react to it and and because experience because of experience yeah so i feel like it's the same way with like fighting like if you have enough years of somebody throwing their hand at your face to hurt you you you must start moving a couple times and after you start moving and you start getting it like it just starts natural so even when a punch comes at you and you don't even see it coming your brain will react for you because you've done that reflection so many times so you know what i'm saying like it's crucial bro if you get if you're getting your ass be in fights that's your fault you should have trained you weren't training you know instead of wasting money on anything else go buy some gloves go buy your trainer ain't [ __ ] putting some work boy cause the world is harsh and real and this is not for you to go out there and [ __ ] people up or especially like your enemies like not this is like for when you know [ __ ] just goes down out of nowhere and [ __ ] your hands is all you got you know what i'm saying you gotta really check you or your family bro like what if it's your family what if somebody's trying to do something to the people around you you don't want to be in a situation where like you can't even protect them or like do your part you know [ __ ] that like you want to be able to knock them out with the one too you feel me but yeah yo shout out to payday y'all check out his youtube channel uh go stream his music you know what i'm saying make sure you guys follow my

it's going to be a solid 8.75 on the overall taste so far and then when you talk about the actual taste and overall experience and the potency the color all these things the undeniable issue at the beginning of how it lit it's going to affect the score which is how it goes [Music] when you think about all the things considered this is an 18 plus tax pre-roll i can feel the high it's a little bit energetic a little bit clarifying it's potent i think i give this a [Music] 8.5 overall you got to drop the score a little bit because of the way that it lit and how like it's just not it's just not

smooth smoke harvested on december 6 packaged on march 3rd it's about as fresh as you could possibly get it to me the 8.8 on the taste test and the flavor and then combined with the experience i'm gonna bump it up to a nine flat and then when you think about the price point sixty-five dollars plus tax unfortunately it just doesn't meet that high highest shelf top level premium in my opinion but in on all in all honesty i feel that this item is arguably a 90 out of 100 overall so definitely a premium product for premium flavor and potency let me know what you guys think in the comments be

"DVNSSHr--Yc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff I'll stood on this platform welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new I don't know what you're doing you better subscribe so you can get some more content in your life I've been posting two to three videos a week keeping the streak going hope you guys are enjoying let me know in the comments if there's any videos you want to see I always think you guys suggestions and that's what this video is all about somebody on my snapchat messaged me and asked me if I would break down this little grinder on my YouTube there's a lot more to it than you think I picked this up and I've been showing it off haven't talked too much about it the company's called like cubis or quipus qub us this looks pretty [ __ ] cool they advertise it as like an airtight smell proof [ __ ] alien great quality grinder and I've been really liking it at first I had mixed opinions on it because it is not like your traditional grinder but it has enough unique qualities to it that made me keep coming back to it and it's actually cut my new daily grinder this is my old grinder I loved it it's done a lot of good but recently it has gotten pushed aside the Cubist's or kumis I'm gonna call out the Cubist because it's a cube it's literally the same size as a rubik's cube actually which is partially what caught my attention to it now if your typical four stage grinder what I really liked about this is the compartment that holds your flour that has the screen that goes into your cave catcher can actually be removed from the grinder so that you can have a three piece grinder you'll have a bigger compartment for your flour and then you also don't have to have to keep compartment now don't get me wrong I love Keef actually like a lot of Keef in my day it gives me a [ __ ] but honestly it's not totally worth it to me anymore ever since that came out because keith was like if I'm trying to get like super lit just looks at Keef now it's like I'm trying it super lit I take blob so the point of Keith has kind of been replaced in my eyes but I keep having all these grinders with screens in them and then all of a sudden I just have holy [ __ ] like why didn't I just keep that with all the lead and I could have just enjoyed the weed a little bit more because that Keith does come from somewhere look how much you keep I have in this guy it's literally built to the brim I have this key thing like half built I just started using this grinder like three months ago so the last three months I collected that much Keef that is insane that that much gave it's just been thrown away from my weed so I prefer to have a bigger compartment to hold my weed and then you also have the Keef actually staying inside the flower also today I have a sick woven blunt rolled by my looming toxic iris it was a pre-rolled he made for me it was totally empty and then I just filled it with my own flower and today I'm smoking on some llamosa I'm a big fan of mimosa it's a nice daytime eye and just keeps you going and it's nice like uplifting like conversational high there's some strains that has no clue man I just do not want to talk after I smoke them but mosa is not one of those it definitely keeps the conversation going not a big fan of blunts but I'm making an exception because this one's woven so that's pretty cool has the little checkered pattern on it love these what about tips nothing I'd like to say about this it just looks cool it's one of a novelty thing there's no reason to only smoke one of them once it does the same thing as normal one which is better that better how about great guy I always have them so I got this rounder for free I hit the company up and asked him if I could try it out and show it off and they said yeah but I didn't like this at first because of the two magnets on the top when I was going to grind it it just felt really Jackie because I just kept going over the magnetic connector but then when I realized you needed to do would you flip it around and then once you give it like a 90 degree turn so the magnetic connector isn't touching anymore you have like a full 180 degrees to turn the grinder and actually get a nice sufficient grind out of it even though I am liking the grinder still I do admit it does not grind wheat as fast as the grinder I had in the past I don't know if it's the fact that the holes are a little too small well it's just not enough teeth but it just does not grind it enough just takes an extra 30 seconds to grind up your weed and if that's a deal-breaker for you you're gonna do one you seeing these things retail for like eighty two hundred dollars which is like your typical high quality American grinder price if you're buying a grinder for like $30 it's just not made out of the same grade of quality metals the fact that they say it's smelter if it's nice if you're leading in the car but if it is truly airtight that means it's also watertight so that means that I can submerge the schooling in water and it shouldn't leak through which I'm gonna try out right now first thing you pump the weed out but look how much more weed you can store when you get rid of a little compartment this tiny little thing can hardly hold any weed so sacrificing the key compartment to store more weed is totally worth it in my eyes you can probably fit like five to seven grams in the bottom compartment if you don't have the third stage of the grinder in there all right let me try not [ __ ] this up I try give you guys a little bit angle if I can so we have our water we have our grinder and we are going to fully submerge it then I'm going to smoke this so it doesn't go out see a couple air bubbles that's concerning me salty little ones it's probably not a big deal alright alright rant try this [ __ ] off hill we will decide it is completely dry so water did get into the crevices where the magnets are but these o-rings that connect it are strong enough that it did not leak into the grinder at all so I can confidently say that this is airtight and watertight not gonna lie did not know how I was going to go I'm very excited that it passed the water test and followed the company on Instagram a little bit and the owners just seemed like genuinely cool people which is another reason why I wanted to make this video definitely has a lot of great qualities to it one complaint is doesn't grant me the fastest if there's one thing I could change about it it would have more teeth so everyone grabs me we done faster these things are fully customizable but you can make like the middle black orange you can do like red red white and blue you can do anything you want almost at the end imagine you're like [ __ ] kayaking down a river and you flip your kayak and you're like bag goes underwater and you're like no but we drew it but then you realize you have this grinder and you're like yes no it's fine like I wouldn't even be worried than iconic look alright guys my battery's dying so I guess that's time to wrap the video up I hope you guys enjoyed this video click like if you did make sure you subscribe if you haven't already got a lot more contact comment a lot of videos I'm pumping them out make sure you tell me what videos you want to see in the future because there's a good chance I'll

cannabis revolution it is now legal in half the countries 50 states to treat illness my Kayla is a registered medical marijuana patient in Britain the drug is illegal with the government saying it's been proven to damage mental and physical health I'm embarking on a road trip around the UK to find out why many people believe in the medicinal power of cannabis and are prepared to break the law to use it how long is that gonna go on for that's why I swear it's hope left saw it that goes [Music] and II had to motorbike accidents 17 years ago and sustained severe injuries all over his body he also developed epilepsy and osteoporosis and his bed found uses cannabis to help alleviate pain I'll see you later is this bit really hard noises it's cuz I can't move the child manager take so much effort it's just even I notice in every week it's getting harder and harder to make a spliff you don't let your in pain I'm fine it hurts I mean I can't even open my hands properly I'm not doing this for get stoned I'm not doing it for fun it causes a little pain but it doesn't matter in the end because it because at the end of the day I've got a joint it's gonna make me feel a little bit better up here I don't reach the point of getting stoned I never do and as anybody who smokes these will know it's a very badly built joint so the days of me being able to roll are rapidly running out I need to find another solution for many other people that solution is Jeff a cannabis campaigner who believes in the healing properties of the drug he has devoted the last 15 years to campaigning for cannabis legalization and has been arrested 12 times it's your car a bit like an office I'd often say it's probably some days it's more than my office it's more like my home really why'd you say that well on occasion I have slept in my car overnight on such missions and but yeah generally it is my office I've got everything here I need internet connection Google and email and cannabis oil in the boot probably just two weeks ago Jeff ditch field was facing a jail sentence for possession and intent to supply cannabis he freely admitted giving the drug to sick people and in a landmark ruling a jury found him not guilty the person is in need needs cannabis then Jeff travels around the UK distributing the drug in the form of oils which he makes himself from cannabis plants I brought you some more fantastic um so I can restock you know what I've actually got here this time is I have two different versions okay his product is unregulated and illegal which makes people fearful about identifying themselves but there is a big demand all over the UK for his cannabis oils we're assisting the parents of over 70 seriously ill children just in the UK alone through the Facebook page for receiving roundabout 250 to 300 requests for help per week that's not just from parents that's from adults mainly and mainly cancer sufferers do you make money from giving cannabis oil to parents no people's ability to pay he doesn't enter into our thought processes when we're deciding to help my parents Geoff is visiting a mother whose daughter suffers from severe epilepsy the daughter is only four years old what is the risk of this condition that she has the more serious thing that can happen is she'll die and that's the reason why parents like myself but Evan that cuts it because when you've exhausted every other Avenue and every other drug sends up and Gavin either the oil she doesn't jump the same in her sleep you would do anything to you know to try and cure your own child you're not worried at all that the cannabis oil hasn't been through the same sort of clinical trials have prescribed medication moving on definitely not normal because it helps her because it helps her yeah I know I'm doing the right thing and all this a lot safer than the drugs that I've caught in my cupboard I have two versions of oil with me at the moment they're two for you to have an try it's not just desperate parents hoping for a cure recently engaged Phil and Nikki have placed a lot of faith in the drug as well so I was planning to propose to Nikki before Christmas when we went to London I guess I just modeled it and thought maybe I could find a better time to do it or something yeah I can't imagine is the easy yeah yeah so how did the doctors pick it up I woke up in Countess hospital's Chester I had a seizure upstairs yeah and that was the first seizure you've ever had yeah I never had a seizure before just before I proposed we had been to Welton to see my neurosurgeon he'd looked at all the scans it got from Chester and he had said what you have here is a glioma you were diagnosed with brain cancer in January of this year yes [Music] Cannabis contains at least 400 compounds the most widely known as CBD which is legal and THC which is not THC is the compound that gets you high there are conflicting opinions on which compounds work best for different conditions I take CBD oil and I take that through the day and I will then vape THC I just want to use this for shrinking this tumor or whatever's left of it fillers already had surgery to remove the tumor and a course of radiotherapy but he believes the traditional medicine alone is not enough to beat the disease alongside cannabis he eats a special carb free diet and wears blue blocker sunglasses in a week's time he goes back to the hospital to find out if there is any cancer left in his brain [Music] in her quest to help Andy deal with pain his wife Ruth is learning how to make cannabis oil for his vape he wants to quit smoking it because of the impact on his lungs I've had to learn how to duel with us because nobody sort of tells you so Ruth can you tell me what are we doing in your kitchen today why we're going to be cooking up cannabis vaping oil so that Andy can put it into his paper as a machine and he vapes it why can't you just buy this stuff because it's illegal doing this I'm committing a criminal offence skilled artist and see what you think nothing you got mixture right but I just need to get flavor right it's just the flavor right but I've learned really what works describe it other than younger with what I want there's something safe for him to use and for me even though it's not really something I would normally have ever done I've got to the stage now where I think I've got to do something because this is what works it stops some shaking he can you know get out and about he doesn't want to get stoned he just wants to sort of lead a normal life I was doing the cheese what she's on theis right she baked so I said I'm not going to give it to you until you sit down she stepped around iceplug [Music] and II used to take more prescription medication before using cannabis so since he started taking in the cannabis what medications as he stopped using these ones that I'm pulling out now so one two three four five six Oh in the Fein they're more pictures and there's actually so that's eight so that's eight prescribed eight medications that he's off yes since taking in the cannabis the spasms have already slowed right down on probably ten minutes into smoking this none of my medicines work this quickly none of them I've researched all of Andy's medical conditions I research all of this and I know basically what it does to his body so I would rather have this than all the pills he was taking any day of the week because I get the person I married back again I was extremely tired towards the very start of radiotherapy and as soon as I started using endo cannabinoids all that tiredness went away I didn't ask to go on steroids for radiotherapy and I got to the very last day of radiotherapy and the day after I did a full day's work and I've been working full-time ever since I really don't think I would have been able to continue working if I hadn't have used cannabinoids um well I'm ready whenever you guys are [Music] today Phil gets the results of his scan this is a CBD oil [Music] find it tastes like la vegetable oil [Music] they don't worry cuz whatever happens even if it was bad news there's a lot of extra things I can do [Music] No [Music] I would rather be illegally alive than legally dead and that's the way my whole family feels this is a life and death situation here Andy Phil and Jeff were all telling me cannabis was a powerful medicine but if this is the case why is it illegal the government says the drug has no recognized therapeutic value I spoke to dr. William not cut or Hospital consultant who has run trials into cannabis treatment for multiple sclerosis and pain relief is there any evidence for cannabis does it actually work basic science I have some good examples of people with Hawley pain problems and it's been through all the standard remedies and the use of a cannabis extract have been able to achieve good quality pain relief you sort of get to play doctor really don't need I I really really don't like the doctor two main reason being is I have no medical qualifications whatsoever I'm not a clinician and I would much much prefer it if the UK law was changed so doctors and pharmacies could do what I'm doing then I wouldn't have to be a criminal and these parents wouldn't have to act in a criminal manner either I've met a man who gives medicinal cannabis oil to the parents of sick children is that safe should he be doing that it's a very complex plant if you take an extract of cannabis it has 400 plus different compounds in it so unless I know what is actually on the label how active it is and so on like that I have no idea as a doctor whether it's going to be abuse or not until we get proper clinical trials going on these sort of things all we're going to have is just anecdotal evidence and I've known patients and in on such others who have gone and died soon afterwards we just don't have the answers for this one at the end of the day you are providing an illegal substance to these parents are you just a drug dealer no in spite of all the evidence in the experience you've got you are still giving these oils that are illegal they've got the THC okay you're giving them to parents fair enough you're not making any money from them nothing material anyway but when a parent contacts me they've generally made the decision but they are going to give cannabis oil to their child because they believe it is the child's only chance of survival so it's a decision I have then I can say no I'm not gonna help you but yes I can provide the oil and if I don't do that Opel buddies don't do that then these parents aren't gonna stop and give up they're then going to continue on the Internet like some of the parents who've been conned and scammed out of thousands of pounds we and receiving so standard on all rails attested moon haha hi I guess how are you I'm okay how are you I'm very well thank you I'm calling about my father you've been battling cancer for almost eight years now okay can you've had numerous conventional treatments and he's now the point where I said I think you've terminal and I have him on the soil that I purchase I feel like he's gone downhill they scared at the minute that I was might poison my dad and you know I'm making words and dying to there really no Western bless you I wish I mean it's okay it's okay it's just that it's unlikely to have done him any harm but it's it's impossible of me to rule that out because obviously you know we don't know the source of this oil how it's been made yeah alternative specialist anything I said that she thinks the chance of spreading though [Music] that's okay darling I can send it off to the lab I use in Spain my Valenti University who tests my extracts so we can find out exactly what's in it we'll do what we can thank you very much okay you take care [Music] [Music] he's really mad her dad is dying and she's gonna do whatever it takes to keep him alive for a bit longer and I think for me and certainly for Jeff just to hear her say I don't know if I've poisoned my father I don't know if I've shortened his days I think I think that's tragic [Music] how do you navigate through you know this online medicine or cannabis world you can know Carla and that's the problem with it this is a useful medicine it's a valuable medicine in clinical practice today and it's a scandal what we said slower moving forward with medicine that's very safe when it's used improperly controlled amounts Jeff is going to meet the woman who phoned him two weeks ago he wants to see the oil she was sold so we used this for a little while and that really wasn't doing anything so that's why it's still is still a lot in there because we just stepped on it unfortunately the people who are offering oil online before fall into two categories in my mind there's the people who are well-meaning and she's shut up and there are people who were just down and out scams on meth and we've tested some oils that people are bolted to treat cancer and we battery plant contain zero cannabinoids what I'd like to do it's okay with you is take half a gram of this yeah and then I'll send that off to Valenti University alized okay exactly what's in it okay and some cancer sufferers believe that you know medicinal cannabis is helping to cure them is there any research to back this article type of cancer to treat brain cancer called a glioblastoma there is good evidence also in other types of cancer that the activity of the cancer cells is modified by the use of cannabinoids but it's not being translated into really into significantly clinical practice so the patient is left with a problem that they may come to the end of standard chemotherapy and finds you know what else is there out there I myself have been approached by many patients to say look I bought this cannabis oil on the Internet how much do I need to cure me of my cancer and I have to say well I don't maybe you know what you're taking what its effect is going to be how much of the cannabis that you've got in that bottle of oil is going to be used to or anything like that because it's not being worked up as amazing [Music] [Music] yes it was better than good results tears of joy yeah the good news is on the MRI there's no sign of disease a couple of months ago I was told that I was gonna die young this was a very aggressive cancer that I've got and there's nothing I can really do to avoid and ask the end okay you said that you've seen a difference and you have a son he's also seen a difference can you just tell me what he was like with the medication and what he's like after he has a cannabis he had dead at home but dad wasn't here so he would describe it as having a shell and it's veer but it doesn't do anything it was always me taking him out and taking him to school it was me out in the playground well he's never got that and told Andy started using cannabis this is the only thing I do in my life that's illegal it helps improve the relationship with me something because even if I'm really ground down from pain I can still find that ten minutes for that chat that he needs that he can't talk to his mom about I'll give the shop exactly you'd be like a turtle except I wouldn't be able to move - did you want copycat killers I'll take you they've got the tape mainly want me to watch back none on opiates he's got even less chance of that you know opiates it's like alcohol it's not conducive to a family life death rates are going up and suicide is going up more kids are being handed crack than ever even handed diplomas I think that rich people should live like poor people and poor people live like rich people ASA changed every week and you would say that before cannabis and after cannabis is a total yeah it's a lot it's polar opposites really how so like he's just a lot happier he's more use laughs like he tries to cling on to the little things like putting a t-shirt on because with his shoulders and everything like that it's impossible but because of a little kind of list it gives will to do it oh yes it's just like better for whole family because we're all just less stressed and a little more relaxed the only thing you really need you your life is family it's something legal I'd rather I'd rather take the legal option anytime the way I don't want that fear of prosecution is the bride in that worry because you're doing something to help your pain and to help your family from breaking apart because being disabled is a great strain on family life [Music] what do you think of cannabis do you see it as a sort of a medicine do you see it as an illegal drug I see it as medicine but I can also see why it's an illegal drug because if you don't understand it you just get higher on it but I don't think people should be persecuted for wanting to help that all it is [Music] people think it's hard for the disabled person but it's not it's far harder for the family of the disabled and that's the aspect I find the hardest to deal with mentally they'll find it the most upsetting I know it's illegal but it gets to the stage where you think society can judge me I don't care [Music] [Music] [Music]"}
