that and more its Africa's longest venomous snake growing to a length of 14 feet it's also the world's fastest snake zipping along it up to 12 miles per hour its head is often described as coughing and for many in Africa this snake is synonymous with dead without antivenin the black mambas neurotoxins can kill a human in less than 15 minutes while its main prey items include small animals like rats Bush babies and burns its lethal bite is famous enough that even creatures several hundred times in size pay out of its way the Mamba hunts by day it's not afraid to show the black interior of its mouth and scare the daylights out of this herd [Music] it does this to avoid being trampled all it wants to do here is clear a path and the strategy works perfectly wouldn't you love to scare people like that yeah sure would make getting through rush hour easier and for those of you who've seen enough nature documentaries you know what this means rush squirrel versus mama squirrels are one of the black mambas favorite meals and it gets worse the squirrel has a nest of young nearby and the Mamba is just as cozy in a tree as on the ground the Mamba uses sight and scent to seek out its prey it has the squirrel and its nest zeroed in the mother stays away but as for saving her babies there's not a single thing she can do but we can do something we can avoid the obligatory deadly mama chomps cute baby squirrel shot let's cut right to the end of the meal just the last few crunches I hope you appreciated our discretion just be glad as a human you'll probably never encounter one of these elusive yet aggressive snakes [Music]", "6W3BP1GKlrU": "[Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] gods welcome to today's Avenger we have this beautiful private game reserve and we're after a whole bunch of different types of reptile sinner species like African rock pythons and now crocodiles not all monitors even spinning cobras and black mambas they thick out there we're gonna go find them have some beautiful interactions with them join us for this incredible adventure our first stop for the morning is that a hole of an African rock python where people tell us they've seen it Boston gasps we were up now at the reserve you just plucked a little bit up the road from where apparently the partners we're gonna go there now to check it out just see hope you're gonna get me before touchdown it's Hall so we're gonna walk up really quietly don't want to make too many vibrations on our way try to grab the snake nice sunny day so hopefully it's basking let's get back now you'll see you don't have any hooks or anything puffins obviously non-venomous animals so we don't have to worry about if it bites me or something I'll get any venom so I'm gonna use my hands and also we're gonna have to move quite quickly when we see the snake okay we've got to the hole down here at the bottom of this kind of ravine but the snake normally blastx up in this big bank over here now the problem is we've got you a nice snake inside so it could have come out and it really ducked down it's all because it's got warmth you know so what the snake might be doing is coming out your boss can gain some warmth going back down or it could even be hunting so what I'm gonna do have a quick little look down here at the whole shape of the seat okay here's the whole underneath you I can't see much it goes right underneath this back towards where the road is so what I'm gonna do before we start sticking heads and bolts I'm just gonna walk around in this and this brush over here make sure the snakes not actually act I'm hoping it's out to be much easier for us to see it properly let's go and check okay guys we've had a look on the outside now she's not in the brush around the hole I put my head down in the hall check if the path NZ really concerned that the people that told us about it says she's not in good condition and that's what we worried about we just want to make sure that these snakes they're protected snakes endangered snakes we want to make sure they're tip-top condition that's what this is all about all right God look at that for watch F this is the Pathan and just if we took this camera up a little bit I just want to see what positions you I'm gonna get my hand out the way and that's it there look at that glass pythons are a whole bunch of coils and what that often means when the path ends wrapped up in coils like air is that it's actually on eggs and that would also be the reason why it's not looking a great condition so let me just put my hand in here quickly let's just see what she's doing hello McGill oh look at that card and that's at the rock there those are the eggs that she's protecting isn't that incredible look at that right in between those coils whoo-hoo look at that spectacular look at those beautiful beautiful eggs a gossip whoa and isn't that great news Scott big female African rock Pathan and the reason she's looking a bit skinny when she's outside she's on a big clutch of beautiful inks now rock path a path ins are one of the only snake species in the world there are maternal so that means that the mom actually takes care of the eggs and takes care of the babies for the first two weeks off to the hatch so what she's been doing she lies up here on this beautiful warm earth hookah beautiful there's lots of warmth and she bossed and thermo regulates up here then as soon as people come around or she gets too hot she ducks down yeah she's got an excellent burrow really secure nice and safe and she's laid about forty big white eggs each eggs about this big about twice or three times the sauce of a chicken egg and she lies around those eggs and cools who coils up around the sixer she heats up a sod takes a big warm body puts around those eggs incubate her own eggs isn't that spectacular and she defends him you can see there as soon as I came closer we cut around those eggs now you want to be really careful in a snake's on eggs you don't have miss them up you know if one of those eggs rotates and the top gets changed to the bottom the babies inside are actually gonna drown and judging by this time of the year now we should have baby rock pythons coming out of here within the next two weeks or so so what's so really what's really great about it she's done such a good job such a good mom what an absolute privilege being so close to a big mommy rock pathan who's looking after her eggs in her future babies let's get cracking go see what else we can find [Music] dasu on this profit reserve we've come down to a really big Dam where they aren't maybe any crocodiles what we've seen as a small little Nile crocodile pop its head out over here on the water just gone down now it's really difficult to catch crops and it's in such open water are we gonna do waiting hopefully the croc comes out if it doesn't we're gonna have to move really really quickly I doubt we gonna catch it but it's give it a bit [Music] [Music] cars came down to the water as you can see I've been waiting rod up why steep here kind a little bit eerie when we got that deep here water around these people around and even the small crocodiles have to come from somewhere so big mummys lurking somewhere yeah couldn't give the baby it's just too much water we're gonna have to come back at night to catch that it's gone see 50 bucks appointments okay what we doing that glasses lift with the Nile crocodiles we just going to be traveling along the side of the Dania looking for Nile monitors another name for them is a league of on or water monitor they love hanging out on the edge of the dam here really big powerful monitors massive bot big whoop of the tail really fun to interact just looking for some shiny off the snow bursting look at this hood put it up now flip it minibuses what we try to do it's just rear it up now but it's actually just marrying us this is bla black mambas are such incredible snakes whoa whoa whoa not stopping and what happened of ancient is the snake will get a bit more tired and this is a big momma the Black Mamba Babu now what we're trying to do God let's just calm the snake down a little bit man I love when it saw us it went wild mouth open hood open look at that a lot of people don't know black mommies have got hoods but they actually do look at the inside of the mouth E and as you can see this one territorial not scared of a camera not scared of me actually advancing right at the camera right now keeping that head up and then what they'll do they'll keep up to a third of their body raised okay now they're really nervous and defensive snakes there are aggressive some people say never seen an aggressive black mamba or you haven't met my friend over here look at this now this is the position it goes in before it strikes beans its head to the side lucky opens mouth look at this coming straight at me walk not not stopping you just relax and it just relax there we go it's a hot day I mean we're looking at probably about 35 degrees Celsius today and this is a big black but you can see already relaxed when we first came across it still shine the hood still shine the flicker of that black mouth and that's where they get their name from but it's got a lot slower what you're doing you have to concentrate really well when you're working with black mambas I just want to see if it'll sit for a little bit that's better here we go you bring the camera in now hopefully I won't focus on you're not on me the most dangerous snake in the world now some of you when I say that are gonna say no didn't go in the entire pen that's the most dangerous snake we're not talking about dangerous I'm not just talking about the venom toxicity what I'm talking about is overall demeanor the way it behaves how toxic the venom as the speed of a safe the length of the snake and black mamba say peccary or punch not only are they the second longest venomous snakes in the world only after the king cobra but they the fastest snakes in the world moving up to 20 kilometers an hour that's really really quickly in fact in all speed really hard to move out of the way of the other issue with black mambas is the temperament as you can see the snake is not relaxed the snake means business who wants to come and party wants to envenomate try box on black mambas don't happen to try bites when a circle part and not release venom black mambas every single time will release venom inside of you that's what makes him so so dangerous and a snake I love working with because you have to be right on the tip like a at a neuronal you're right up there on your toes I tell you what it's such a privilege living in a country with snakes like this here we go now what he's done he's calmed down a little bit look at that foots gone down a bit but you need to understand these snakes are super super fast one of my favorite snake species in the world trying to just get to its tail here alright just direct and this likes a big one looks I'm just looking up here looks like he's a male but he'll still get bigger guys look at the size of that snake this is about an on foot snake net I can get right up to about four and a half meters pushing 15 full of snake famous with this they're also really famous for the pitch-black interior of him out and that's actually where they get their name from they don't get it from the color of the skin and all of these factors that is why I say the Black Mamba is the most dangerous snake in the world more dangerous in the big Cobras more dangerous than all the tarpans put together it's like a tarpon on steroids it's got speed it's got aggression it's got really really toxic venom as well mix into that whereas you find your tarpans in that really bad venom but far more relaxed snakes look at that so alert whooping around me and the Black Mamba can from this position struck in any direction so could strike a V and hit the hook stick could struck this way it could even come back on its own body now look at that the strength that's needed to lift this body up here off the ground really incredible a good worry - my pants are still wet from trying to find those crocodiles it's a little bit sluggish a little bit slow-moving and it's just really special that it's gonna sit buckers for us all right as you can see guys what should I ever touch the snake should Oh black mamba look at that one little touch and that's gonna be white if you touch me now what you gonna do and interestingly enough when you're working with different snakes yep they're not how they worked her if this was a king cobra and I went something like yeah touched its tail swing straight around at me whereas a mom but generally if you touch the tail should move away from you but if you touch up here let me [Music] it's really important that you know the species of snake you're working with and that's what years of experience come into play so I've been working with venomous snakes for thirty years now and the crowning glory of all venomous lights is the back mama absolutely spectacular snakes and as you can see a crowds gathered behind us now I've seen us here interacting with the snake and I'll tell you what few snakes in the world have the reputation of a black mamba so you can see already people are gathering because it's such a privilege and it's such an amazing thing to be able to see the snake up-close interact with such a special animal I mean honestly this snake is one of the world's most deadly and dangerous animals on the planet and yet you've got the opportunity to spend time with and you can see it's making its way to the water the reason for that they're not aquatic snakes at all but there are really excellent swimmers so what I'm gonna do let me just put it in the water here they don't swim I'm ill but I'll take it back out put it on the land we've found it see where it wants to go look at that it's got no problem going through whatever but great climbers they're great and moving on the Koran quicker snake in the world and there are excellent swimmers as well because it doesn't get any better than that the infamous Black Mamba what an encounter rock pythons crocodiles and to end it off a king of all snakes yeah in Africa the Black Mamba what a special encounter thanks for

in it here's your nice she's a servant in the triangular that is awesome oh my God look oh my God look at the size of em green oh no can it fail again it again you want to give it enough well depends what this night keeps falling in either", "-weBSc6aivk": "thanks Noel we've got a wonderful senior this is an animal that we very very seldom see other than a fleeting glimpse they're usually quite shy but the slender Mongoose has got a good reason why it's hanging around yeah we got alerted to its presence by some starlings of which you can hear them all alarming now that's them showing their disapproval of the slender Mongoose and as you can see there's a dead scrubber and we can only guess that the slender Mongoose has been feeding on the scrub here it looks like it's hardly being fed on it looks like it's almost very fresh I haven't had a good look at it yet we'd literally stopped the vehicle as soon as we saw both the scrubber and the slender Mongoose let's keep an eye on the slender Mongoose David is on the move there it goes Mamba that killed this bed that killed the scrubber and the black mambas going up the tree ends and the Mongoose is attacking it's this is absolutely ridiculous up above Davey there we go look at this a ginormous black mamba and that explains exactly why the scrubby looks quite fresh this mumble would have just killed it and I'm kissing the slender Mongoose responded to the scene because of the alarm calls from the birds oh my shattered nerves and I think we should definitely welcome on board as many other people as we can to this fascinating scene I saw the Mongoose running and then I just saw it kind of bited something and it actually tried to bite the tail of this black mamba I thought it was trying to make another kill at first and then I saw this all mighty serpent start slithering about good grief now I was telling Dave as we approach the sighting please could it be a big snake please could it not just be a slender Mongoose have a look at the slender Mongoose below there Dave directly below it's on the dead Stamper down a bit it just jumped down but it was standing kind of looking up at the black mamba and isn't this a wonderful wonderful kind of David and Goliath display here the slender Mongoose looks like it's trying to work its way higher up this tree I'm gonna position ever-so-slightly hello everyone who has just joined us on this unscheduled Safari broadcast as you can see there is a snake up in that tree and it is a Black Mamba one of the most highly venomous snakes that we see in Africa my name's Scott and it's great to have you on board with us well let's take a closer look at the snake as I explained to you what exactly is going on here now we were driving along peacefully it's a cool cloudy afternoon and hoping to find something interesting when we've heard some birds alarm calling it was mainly the starlings that clearly were leaning us know that they weren't happy about something so we drove into this area and looks like the snakes trying to move and I just want it it's quite tricky there's another predator on the scene let's show you the the slender mongoose quickly david's just that kind of 9 o'clock there and this was the first predator we actually saw this tiny little slender mongoose and i thought oh well as paranormal there's no sign of any snakes but just two slender mongoose but then we spotted something else a dead scrub here and it looked quite fresh to us but I wasn't too sure exactly what was going on it looks like the slender mongooses want you wanting to steal it from the snake can you actually believe what's happening here so there's tiny little scrubby would have been caught by the snake and this mongoose is not trying to steal it now we need to keep a close eye on quite a few moving parts now I'm trying to work out where the snake has gone it started slithering down the tree and with snakes we we've learned that they can disappear so quickly there's no sign of it in the tree any more that I can see and who knows will this black mamba put up a fight against the slender mongoose which is definitely far smaller than its I'm guessing that black mamba was about three meters in length but the mongooses are showing an incredible display of its strength as it drags what will be an absolute bargain of a meal for it it's gonna keep this mongoose fed for days now because we see snakes so sold a million because that mongoose isn't gonna be able to move too quickly I'm gonna try and just get us into a spot where we can work out where this snake is let's hope it doesn't slither up into the vehicle like I said this is one of the most venomous snakes that we do get Archer in Africa it's got a highly highly cytotoxic sorry neurotoxic venom that against that essentially that will essentially just shut down your organs causing you to die but I don't think we're gonna get ourselves into any trouble just yet now I can't for the life of me see where the snake has gone but let's just top stuff and see if we can't have a scan in these bushes it could well have disappeared into any kind of cavities or holes ad you've just mentioned that you've been hoping to see a black mamba for many a safari and this is the first one you've managed to see with us I'm glad we managed to work that one out for you where could it have gone hmm it's incredible how such a big snake can disappear so quickly and there's not really that much undergrowth for it to hide in let's keep driving around this kind of falling down tree and see if we can't get a view of its my heart is absolutely racing as I'm sure a lot of yours are as well so much excitements out of the blue and that is the joy of being on a live Safari I didn't have time to mention where we are and what's going on we are in South Africa in the sabi sands reserve at the moments and this is a live Safari if you have not gathered that already no immediate Sun of the slithering serpents it could just be kind of curled up in a ball somewhere I'm hoping we get some more views of it but the snake is a territorial snake so it'll know this area well and I'm guessing it would have worked out and remembered a good place to slither often I'm guessing it's somewhere at the base of this tree it looks like there could be a few hiding places a few holes in and around that root system there sure know where has the mongoose dragged the scrub here too I can see the little Mongoose I think we may have disturbed it ever so slightly but seeing as though it has just stolen this meal from the snake I'm not too concerned for the time being and it will come back immediately to where the scrub here is I'm guessing it's somewhere just in front of us over here so what we should do is get into a good spot and kind of just sit and patiently wait to see if we can't get any more views of the snake as well as the slender Mongoose starting to snap down on the scrub here hoo-wee absolutely awesome awesome stuff and seeing as though things seem to have calmed down for the time being I'm thinking of saying goodbye to everyone who has just temporarily joined us and if you would like to continue joining on this afternoon Safari you can just google Safari live and find us quite easily that way thanks very much we'll see you all next time", "UZ4OGSR-8Sw": "[Music]

"NHysM_f2gmk": "[Music] [Music] regards Tingo here and you've just joined us for a final episode of our reptile rescue series for the season and I say final episode there'll be some more but I it's getting cooler now and I think this is going to be the most epic we've got a call-out now to come out for what we think is a black mamba so I'm 100% sure we got this photo really dodgy fighter the coloration looks right and we're at in this location or really poor area for a community have a look out here and this unfortunately is where the conflict exists between people and venomous snakes majority of the time they're living in these beautiful bush areas the snakes and they're coming into people's homes because there's chickens there's rats there's food it's just inviting them in and that's a problem with going right foster chicken right now and that's the issue that you have Archer and unfortunately we are the last day tonight we have locked down for the coronavirus in South Africa all the schools are on holiday so what's actually happened here is that a lot of kids at home and that poses a greater risk to so normally these kids would all be at school it wouldn't be an issue now they are all at home and there's a big slack they say it's a big snake inside their house she said it's a black snake gray snake and it's big so who knows what that means but we're going up there now we'll be there in about a minute or two [Music] boys nervous when we finally get to the house when there's a black mamba inside [Music] hello all right in here you got some yoga big syke in the room fixing some b cubed yeah it's too big when I sobbing you're yeah I'm very skin God where did you sit yeah yes that's okay I'm gonna ask you can stand over there yes we're gonna come in yep okay I'm gonna turn the music off is that okay perfect I'm a little bit ADHD so too much sound I'm in trouble here we go that's perfect okay guys what we're gonna do you can see the perfect environment yeah for snakes and want to happen just try and make sure that stand on something yeah that's the issue we have and this is where a lot of people in South Africa are living and it's a beautiful warm kind of climate environment and you see outside there it's actually it's a windy day it's a bad day but in here Natsumi does this I like working yeah this one above oh yeah can we put it on is our perfect thank you gives us a little bit more like to look at now so what we gonna do guys I'm just going to systematically go through this room now normally that guy who actually gave me this call out Jason Arnold you've seen him before in our first episode and jason said to me he couldn't make it today with all the shutdowns and the lockdowns going on he said dingo get out your please there's a black man basher so that's why we here but actually you can see how confirmed the rumors so I mean you haven't got a lot of kind of spice to move up for catching snakes out in the bush much much easier but we're gonna go we're gonna start off under this beach here it's maybe stick the camera under there first and see if we can see something we're just trying to get all right look at that gas and that's what we have to be careful of it's a perfect place for slate and people sometimes say didn't go how can they be a snack under somebody's bed well this is a perfect example of how it happens open windows they're beautiful warm climate on a fairly cool day snakes don't generally like win so he's a lot of wind outside snake will come inside buckets maybe okay sure I won't you grab the glove for me right glove please and then we can just start looking around in here who is it I've just thrown over the bed by my head [Music] and you can see guys this is where it gets nerve-racking because on my left side my body is underneath a sofa right side under a bed there's not a lot of space to move around in here and from what Cindy's saying we're talking about a big snake can you see anything that's odd cursed nothing you just go a little bit death wait the camera see if you can see there nothing hang on I can see something reach our chicken oh man [Music] I mean something they just underneath this bag I saw something I don't know if it's my coma could even be a songololo a millipede we move this out the way here slightly is this like take us back please pull it up pull it up quickly quicky and I move that I try to move the bag a little bit and this little snake just takes off and instantly I recognize Black Mamba with the bags heavy I can't get out the way and it's a little snake I'll get if the gates behind things never gonna find it again I don't want to lose the snake quick all right that's fine okay all right but it it is a Mamba one wrong move now it'll [ __ ] me right in the face Cindy I've got it here we go this is what the photo you sent us how big is it Cindy it's like a huge one because this is black mamba does it look the same as yes and I kicked the snake up bring it up Cindy we've found the snake and there Cindy this is the wrong snake and my heart it just sinks I'm like it can't it can't be this cannot be the wrong snake it's a black mamba in a house and Cindy says it's a massive one sounds like massive massive a size difference and that's where I start stressing okay now we got a big problem guys um actually don't know what to do this is it though this is Black Mamba but Cindy's saying a lot of the times what happens in a call-out is people exaggerate size of snakes are thought for sure this is actually a black mamba which makes me worried because the snake here Sydney the snakes not more than two weeks old it's a nanny nanny baby which means if there's one baby there's more babies that's my warrior Cindy and if you say there's a bigger snake if it's the same it's a black mamba like this if it's the same as this thing then I'm worried that that's Olivia and it's had eggs eggs have hatched and now you got babies that's what I'm worried about so this is very dangerous got very dangerous situation what a lot of people don't realize is even a baby black mamba like this as venom as it's big parents just gives you less venom but this like yeah I'll kill you within an hour one of the most potent the toxic spikes you could see how ready is to bark again mouth open oh yeah back back back but it's probably putting the gloves fitty Tom's all ready so let me just I don't know what you're gonna do let me put this snake in a container then we'll come back and look I didn't see any big snake under the bed but there are a lot of areas in the room where it could have moved to rock in a box can we have a box somebody who Cindy now things have changed very dramatically very quickly things have changed and there's times you go out on these call-outs where you get a little bit worried for the people live in the end this is one of those times because we going down into 20-day 21 de la carte but you can't move away from your house and we've just found baby Black Mamba in the house and Cindy says is a bigger one and she sees Black Mamba and she seems to know what she's talking about you certainly should see signs like much bigger so let me put this Mike out over here and we're gonna get back in this room and look are you shorts in the room it could've gone out the window huh come here aren't you got inside but then you saw - no in there and half the car we talk here we're talking like that we're talking like that like this yes so like just the car that is definitely Black Mamba whoa Sydney and you can see here this is one of our issues we have the black mom is excellent climber so it'll climb up here straight into the ceiling sit there and the ceiling will be nice and women's when it's faced us above so it bikes during the day it's just lives in there but you could hear a big black mamba moving so you should yeah moving along so now suddenly the search changes I'm here I'm gonna leave that bag up on the bed for now and I'm just going to systematically go through the room here so you see me I'm putting stuff on your bed yeah but I want to find this night now nothing snacks can also be in between mattresses so I'm hoping it's not in between the mattress we have to get the snack we absolutely have to get it today before lockdown starts and the problem is this place is all over the place we could find the snake now who some of you as neat as we possibly can yeah I thought that might have been a--they then that's curtain but it's just a stick or something like that be very careful we researching what I'm hoping hasn't happened is that it's gone behind this cabinet that's a whole nother world of trouble that we in what I'm trying to do is just systematically go through the room so then we get to a place we we know we clear here we cleared in when we want close right now could be in there but I'm not the bigger things out the way the easier places for the snake to go boxes light can go inside a box Cindy you sure a big snake that helps us from a searching point of view because you know it's looking to be hiding in a little box like this and it's very light if it's a big snake but you know often you go to people's homes and they say big snake and you find a small one like that one we did but Cindy's conference and she knows what she's talking about greedy she I mean she recognized Black Mamba missing here there's no evening there are holes in the back of the cupboard that I'm gonna have a look over yeah anyone got their torch this is torture that's the problem you see the holes in the back of the cupboard so I can very easily happen is the second go like this and go right down into the back I'm just trying to feel around oh man there's holes everywhere at the back half the snakes got in there this is going to make our life very very difficult I think let me move this couch out the way let me just have a look behind this couch it's a loft big art and we can move before I have to start going through drawers and cupboards and all kinds of things cool you can see it's humid in yeah it's as human as a hippos bum and summer gotta grab the couch as I grab the couch if you have the scream Sydney screaming a pile around him to think I was read my kid I needed the bed and my back was all up against that cashed it and it was a big black more buck right there to sign top you touch with my couch and then the peak flip fold it comes off and I run in a screen [Music] Wow well come around the corner Lucas big black mamba 2.8 meters at least and he's right there and I've got hope he's going out but he's come out into open area turned around coming right back after me and it comes right in between my legs a monk's buckets and before the camera even got there he came up brushed right up against my far I thought that's me I'm a corner with my allergic reaction i'ma gonna brushes up my far goes back down hook him again in between the legs trying to get back into the room I come around the corner at almost smack bang into dingo and I see the mess of year of the snake come back I'm trying to come back through the legs into the room I almost stand on its tail it was please Walter look at that isn't that [Music] funny this is it haha simulated so calm when you cut this thing a bigger look at that goddamn list yeah he's a big black mamba huh me massive and this yeah this is a massive black mamba and he's grumpy can you think of anything worse and having this car then your bedroom no why should we get the small one this is the problem and this is probably mommy or daddy unfortunately and this is that you should be having in rural Africa calm down Hamlet that's Mike I can't around the corner he came right at me there between my late I mean brushed up against my pants and not the bucket of is what all over the back of my pants from the snake and he wants to just go Blue Peter once you go straight back into the house every time a little girls baby does it right back into Cindy's house we're gonna just take them outside guys this is magic whoa that is a big big hectic hectic snake the most dangerous snake in the world and I probably got charming these little chickens we're those chickens they're running around we saw a black text inside one of those buildings there's dogs in the background and of course these people whoa and look at behind you there is whole bunch of dogs rocky and what's happened is the dogs have seen them on that and these dogs have come running and you can see Mamba he drives now check him out what's it all of it and you can see why he would go into the house it's beautiful warming me he's away from the dogs but man Allah look at that I've got two shakes there we go that's the adrenaline pumping surging through my body the infamous Black Mamba the second longest venomous snake in the world and by far the most dangerous once you go back in your house Cindy loves your house fifth most dangerous snake in the world in terms of toxicity or venom fourth most toxic snake the quickest snake the second longest a beautiful black mommy's calming down a little bit since we've got him outside but isn't that a monster absolute monster of a snake not a snake you want to have in your house sir well thank you for calling us in if you see any others you find that even the babysitting I'm worried that there's gonna be more babies yeah but we'll come out during quarantine during lockdown if there's any more snakes in this house that's a essential service in my opinion getting rid of these big I think beautiful snake and the snakes nodding you have to try and bite Cindy or family it's actually in yet just to find her ex and massive chickens and it's fun a nice warm place before winter comes we're almost pushing into April now things are getting cooler isn't it amazing you saw her mental that snake went hit gossiped its mind when we inside the house I really I've never been so close other than when I have been bitten by black never been so close to getting put in before I was there that was close to he'd bumped up against my feet what a stressful stressful time and what a way to end the last day of quarantine Cindy thank you for finding us thank you for wanting to save the snake and not killing it and that's what the series is all about a reptile rescues this even though this is a dangerous snake and it's a big one this is pushing 2.8 2.9 meters see anybody even though this is a big dangerous Lake it's not actually by people and it deserves a time set laughs itself so thanks for joining us on the last episode of this series reptile rescues will start up again when it gets warm again here in Africa see you then dingo out [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "yRowC6t8tjA": "NARRATOR: Black mambas have\nvery few enemies in the wild. But she's not about to meet her\nnemesis, the slender mongoose, a notorious snake killer. They may look like\nfeatherweights in the ring, but these are two of the most\nlethal predators on the planet. The mongoose has razor-sharp\nteeth and lightning speed. But one bite from a mamba\ncan kill 15 grown men. [SNARLS] So imagine what it can do\nto a five-pound mongoose? The mamba is lethal,\nbut she's not tough. She relies on her venom\nto sedate her victims and immobilize their weapons. Here's the kicker. The mongoose has an\nantidote to her potion. The toxins in snake venom\nattach to chemical receptors in their victims and\nblock communications between nerves and muscle. Mongoose receptors have\nmutated, so that venom simply bounces off the muscle cells. He's literally immune to danger. The mongoose MO is to dance\ncircles around his prey until it's exhausted. And then, the kill shot. One swift snap to the back\nof the head and the spine is severed. The snake is still\nalive, but paralyzed. Her muscles twitch. But her bite is gone. For the mongoose, the\nreward outweighs the risk. A seven-foot snake is a hearty\nmeal for a pint-size predator.", "9s0V62Q5__g": "this is 45 year old Tim Friede from Wisconsin and he's about to let this snake bite his arm why this is a black mamba snake one of the most venomous deadly snakes on the planet Black Mamba venom contains a very potent neurotoxin that interferes with the body's ability to signal through the nervous system it can affect the way you breathe it can make your heart stop beating it can even affect your liver and your kidneys all very good reasons not to do this twice nice I can't believe this guy was Betty buy a black mamba and he survived what's his secret there is as proof that thankfully we met Tim and his collection of snakes to find out how his slithery obsession began wait first white I was I believe five years old as a kid from the garter snake and at that point it's kind of just some snakes but how does he survive this black mamba bite Tim is essentially a walking science experiment for the past few years tim has been exposing himself repeatedly to snake venom by actually injecting dilute amounts of it into his body is not enough to kill him but it is enough for his immune system to recognize there's something dangerous here and this causes his body to mount an immune response and generate antibodies which were little molecules that bind to the toxins and neutralize them now if you bitten by a snake like this in normal circumstances you're never gonna have enough of these antibodies in your system to do anything about it but in Tim's case because he's been building these up in his system over time he's got a store basically so when he gets bitten by the snake his body's got enough of these antibodies to immediately go out there and neutralize that venom Tim is doing something very crazy to my point of view but on the other hand it does kind of serve a purpose usually a normal person would never inject themselves with venom now we can learn how the body can deal with it at first I was I was scared to death because you don't know if it's gonna work you run that risk nowadays after 120 bites and up to 400 and Jackson's I've become relaxed with it now for those of you watching the clip and concerned about the welfare of the snake the snake is fine it was being handled correctly and it was basically behaving in exactly the same way it would at any time it strikes okay but being bitten by a snake is still dangerous the danger here and the reason that scientists don't recommend you do this is that in exposing himself repeatedly to Black Mamba venom Tim could actually develop an allergy and then that snake bite could cause him to go into anaphylactic shock and die and when it comes to a black mamba thanks but no thanks", "NqMFx0rUOlw": "[Applause] this is bingo I hope you ready for an adventure [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Valley head didn't go in the house we've just got a call now owners of the house I just see a big black sack in this room yeah now we don't know what it is but this area full of black mambas yes go have a look I'm hoping it's not this kind of a peeker idea the problem is not in does it run out the house so we don't know where it is or even after listening as you can see open window it's probably oh the problem is this room is just so many places for it to hide it could be any of these toys and look at those two little girls live in this room and you look under the beds first with a good place to start [Music] we've got a black mamba what and there's no girls big problem is to get it out of there there's so many things around that's gonna be an issue maybe that's for now you can see yeah it's obviously knocked down these pictures and the face so I'm gonna slowly bring it [Music] [Music] it's an cloudless black one but yeah look at that this year she saw the young one as well probably just over two meters long I look at her so alert I'm obviously woken up she's coming to the room could have recently written she's come under the speed just to fund some shelter she's actually quite well behaved at the moment he's that's not nothing that you can put them on a hook stick but this tell you what the most dangerous thinking will no doubt about it when we going to do is we don't put it in the box now take her outside way from little children little guy [Music] [Music] she doesn't feel threatened what kind of next you can become a but as soon as you move in front of it look at it now opening quickest snake in the world 400 milligrams of venom she can release sex just 14 milligrams to kill every enemy all they've got bottom of the Hawks tickets very dangerous now the Angie's coming out chaff damage at all right now from this from this position I mean she came in to ride out tell you to be so careful she's making I can't wait but can swing bullets haven't done any physical activity but I tell you just get your adrenaline pumping these snakes okay focus on moving excellent outside Norma's she turns around black mama court we're gonna go really care now put it back in the wild that's where it belongs doesn't belong in the girl's bedroom that's no not at all men are laughs I tell you what look at me sweating bullets I mean there's very few smacks that come on this much respect and focus when you work with him black mambas one of my favorite animals didn't go out [Music] you", "Rvo-Yw_mIo0": "[Music] she's very upset today this is all right there you go that's allison the black mama she is super twitchy as you can see it's kind of like a little stair off right now with her roof [Applause] now this is extremely dangerous and i gotta make sure i keep her face away from my hands my skin my god look at that snake what are you doing huh i just want to touch your nose oh what's going on beautiful people welcome back to my wildlife i'm just hanging out here in the snake house and today we're gonna be taking care of the king cobras and alice in the black mamba i actually fed the king cobras recently so they've been going to the bathroom quite a bit they had a big pipe on they're ready to go well quite literally they've been going all over the place so i gotta clean that up if you guys come over here we can check it out you'll see that there's plenty of spiciness around the enclosure they've been going to the poop in the quarters basically painting up the whole entire edge of the inside the enclosure so it's really nasty lots of ammonia filled up when they poop like that i gotta make sure i stay on top of it so they don't get sick this is going to be really dangerous guys the black mamba is one of the most athletic venomous reptiles on the planet has one of the most potent neurotoxins and then we got the king cobras that the biggest venom yields are almost the biggest venom yields of any venomous reptiles a little pumpkin full of venom and they'll leave you dead i might need a hand for this you don't have to be a dick oh you think you're funny you want to get hairy huh you like this how you like this huh won't we call you tyler nolan huh how you like that how do you like that huh here's what we do here once you hold my pocket don't you hold my pocket there you go now you know who's bossy all right guys let's go film an episode [Music] beautiful people we're going to be taking care of these king cobras i think we're going to first take care of justina because enclosure is not too bad she's right here come on pretty look at her she's looking really good she just came out of a shed not too long ago and she had a big meal so check that out while i get this enclosure unlocked for consuming a big old pipeline look at her hooding up she's a beast of a king cobra i love this snake so much look at her let's see if we can get her to come out for this food let's see all investigated how much she's going to investigate today see if we get it just a little bit come on yellow mulch in your mouth you missed it here almost had it she's right here close to me but make sure she stays focused on that food it's not me look i'm offering her that neck because that's the prime spot for the king cover to grab down onto i'm just gonna move the python a little bit this way there we go let's see i'm getting a little more intense i'm just going to leave a snake right there she's going to eat it she's super interested but she's not liking all the movement so we're going to let her chow down i'm going to show you guys in a sec look at her heading up right now she's the best pudding king cobra that i've ever had all right guys justine is about to chomp down on that head i'm actually at a distance using the zoom so she doesn't feel too threatened look at that perfect right onto the head she knows that it's dead so she's not too worried and she's gonna start engulfing that python perfect look at that that is awesome perfect meal for her considering that the burmese python is native to southeast asia where the king cobras are native to as well and king cobra's main diet consists of reptiles snakes and other reptiles like monitor lizards look at that beautiful she is a beast of a female king cobra listen to her as she inhales and exhales as she swallows down this food she's inhaling through her nostrils and then her extended trachea which allows her to breathe while swallowing down such a big prey item will push out to the side so she can breathe this is a big workout to take down a meal this big so she's going to take her time and shell down look at her beast of a king cobra look into the eyes of the snake that is a modern day dragon look how that pupil analyzes us reading everything about us assessing the situation trying to make sure that nothing's going to go down while she's got a mouthful food because she knows at this moment she can't do much listen to her growling at me right now she eats her food she's like do not get any closer to me and that's why i'm using the zoom right now so upset her too much but i hope that audio is being picked up she's growling at me as she swallows the food like a dog with her bone she's not having it look at that venom oozing out the sides of the jaws as she reaches over the body of the snake with her fangs she will inject small doses of venom as she flexes her head so that ooze you're seeing coming out that gold ooze is the venom of the king cobra not the most toxic alapadae species but definitely a huge venoma load or a huge venom yield that'll leave you in toxicity overload listen that gargling look at how massive this female is she stretches across the cage like a dragon as you can see she is halfway down this python finishing up this meal and this will provide a good meal in the wild she could go probably a couple months without eating another meal but for her in captivity she's probably gonna eat again in two weeks maybe a smaller meal this will serve as a great protein boost scales gut content all this is great for the snake this is what they naturally so in captivity it's best to simulate exactly what they get in the wild where you're not going to get the same life expectancy for the snake there we go she's right at the cloaca of the snake so she only has a couple more inches of tail to swell up and she's done with this massive meal she's done a fantastic job taking down that food look at that the queen of the king cobras justina all right guys hope you enjoyed that clip of her consuming a big old python we wanted to share that with you happened a couple days ago but we didn't make it a full episode you guys ready for chestina remember she's very contankerous a very defensive visual king cobra kevin he's a little defensive too my big king cobra down here but nothing like justina justine has always been a fiery individual and i've known this snake since she was probably about like eight or nine feet long which used to belong to my good friend justin so this thing has always had a very spicy attitude big thick sausage all right look at her big beautiful king cobra we'll put her on the ground for just a second you're growling right now so you guys can check her out see how she's doing i know you guys haven't seen her in a while she is one of my best team cobras when it comes to hooding i might look a little weird right now but i'm just using my foot a little distraction when i work with the king cobra i use little bits of body movement just to get their focus because they are super visual the snakes nice she's very upset today there we go she's so cranky today i hear you you're so upset why don't you tell the viewers at home how upset you are huh huh you're so healthy and puffy today relax very twitchy relax all right you come this way we're gonna put her into the can the completely the snake holding receptacle notice i'm reading the body language the whole time keeping my eyes on the snake relax [Music] [Applause] okay perfect though nice and secure nice and thick as you can see she's nothing like kevin she doesn't want to mess around she takes the opportunity to take a bite into you she's gonna end your life because she will not hold back there's no dry bites coming from a king coco like that she bites you she's gonna let you know she's not happy with you by that she's gonna dump a lot of that gold into you that venom very spicy but it keeps me on my toes and i like to dance oh i didn't get there i didn't get fit we looking at allison you're next all right guys we're gonna be cleaning all this nasty stuff out it's not heaps of poop but just enough to make it a little uncomfortable in the enclosure that's a big tortoise show she likes to hide him too we got all the poop in the back here we got poop in the back here in the front i'm going to get the nice blue spray from right above give it a nice good clean so she can have nice clean enclosure to go back to because i'll tell you what somebody locked me in a room with my own poop i won't be too happy so you can understand why she has such a great attitude even after i cleanse usually i still tries to bite me but anyways we're going to clean this up make it nice and liveable for her i'll see you guys in a second all right guys we're just sanitizing the enclosure too we like to spray it down put the chlor hexadine sanitize everything it's very very soupy very spicy you don't want to leave anything in there all right looks like we're almost done we're just gonna get this last spot of poop we're gonna get her some fresh water and get her back in her enclosure [Applause] it's a didgeridoo oh okay we got some fresh water guys we're going to put it back inside the enclosure there we go i'm just going to move the glass to this side so it's easier to put it back get a show back in there all right now we can put her back in her enclosure let's see how she's doing you guys know she's acting very spicy so let's see what kind of mood she's in there have you had time to think about the crankiness look at her beautiful snake she's like what you'd even run a bath for me you're just gonna put me in a tub with no water how dare you whether she is would you relax need to work with each other for a second to go nice and smoothly you're so upset lately look at you you're cracking with the mouth there we go oh you hear her growling right now she's growling like crazy you know for a female king cobra she's got some great size to it she's got to be at least like 13 feet long oh and she's trying to cut this down all right guys let's put her back home really crazy today she was not happy guys there we go were just extra cranky today huh what i give you a big python clean your poop you're so angry all right guys let me just lock up her enclosure because we definitely want to make sure she's nice and secure even though we are in a snake proof room every enclosure should always be locked and checked to make sure nothing would ever get out we want to make sure these animals are nice and secure all the time all right awesome we're going to put a little cover up so she feels nice and comfy won't clean kevin with my handy dandy armadillo right on top thank you sir army that's nice and locked now we're gonna move on to kevin and kevin already knows what's going on you look at him he's hanging out he's checking out the scene i'm gonna be extra careful with him because he ate a larger meal favorite python than justine all right kevin we're going to go from this side he's looking really chunky so i've got to be very careful that i don't stress him out too much because he's still digesting python even though he's been going to the bathroom like crazy i gotta go so smoothly oh look how massive he is oh he's got python still digesting inside his belly oh and you can see he's a behemoth right now look how thick he is i'm not gonna stress him out he knows i don't mean him any harm he's gonna be a little defensive right now because ruth is right there but it's okay we're gonna let him be he's gonna stay right there always look at his enclosure check it out see if he's laying on his poop he was it's a little bit of poop back there that he's lying on dude you are super thick look at you look how beautiful oh it's okay alex relax it's okay relax the kinkovers are very much on edge today i want to go nice and smooth with them i don't want to accept them too much so we're going to get kevin oh dude you're so fat right now come here there we go that's how you do it all right guys we're going to get to clean this enclosure sorry if it got you a little sweaty i know i got one though little bit of sweat but it's okay kevin i've known for a very long time that's why i handled in such a manner but if you threw any kink cover in front of me i'm probably gonna handle it the same way but do this since i was a little kid and i take danger into my own hands it takes a lot of experience to be able to read an animal like that and not get bit because there's been plenty of situations in this episode and in this series on youtube where i could have gotten nailed killed mangled by crocs snakes by boys come through knock on wood that nothing has to ever happen to me but things do happen and it's on me to be professional be able to read these animals and safely work around them don't ever replicate anything you see on my show there are very enthusiastic people out there that would love to do this too just make sure you do the right route your workout facilities you learn how to do it the right way and then you get your phone in the door to be able to do things like that in the far future when you have enough experience don't go out and grab them and snacks with your hands it's not a good idea all right guys ladies let's do this you like the new hairdo everyone keeps commenting cut your hair cut your hair no bell no better all right oh that nice sticky water bowl he went to the bathroom under it i'm going to take care of this waterfall we're going to get out oh the clumpy nice nice scoop scoop grab technique acquired very nice with the drip oh agua fantastico let me get this can over here get the rest of this crap quite literally oh wow [ __ ] yeah man you you gotta take some pepto-bismol or something man this is nasty all right we still have a lot of poop in here we gotta get out so let me just ramble this back here okay okay i will see you when i'm done h2o ruth before i give this to kevin we want to get a little bit of it touch it with your fingers better go get a lot of ticket now all right guys we'll put the fresh water into the enclosure there we go perfecto perfect what can i say yeah i'm the best snake made in all of south florida all right guys good to go move that mulch around get this can out of the way now we're gonna take kevin out all right guys it's the moment of truth we're gonna be taking the king of old kings out i'm not talking about the king of rock and roll because elvis is dead and this guy's name is not elvis his name is kevin because that's a cool name not elvis let's do this scared good [Music] hey buddy all right guys i'm gonna pull kevin out try and do this nice and smooth because remember he's got a meal in his belly that he's trying to digest so what i'll do is i'll tilt the can and gently pull him out like that there we go oh look how thick he is you can see why he's very defensive he's just got a big meal in them it's not fun to digest a big meal when you're being moved around but you can't have too much fecal matter in this enclosure building up so much ammonia you don't want to breathe all that in all right we'll try and support them fully there we go there we go big boy he's gonna be digesting all this food over the next couple days i have plenty more cleaning to come for me but let's lock this up we'll leave them b so we can peacefully digest this food nice and scared i love you buddy don't be so upset all right let's get a little blindfold on this enclosure and then we're gonna deal with alice in the black mamba [Applause] all right beautiful people we're gonna be dealing with allison she's gone to the bathroom in multiple spots in her enclosure let's see i think i'm going to do the usual and take out this monster cobra so i have that enclosure to switch it into instead of trying to put her into a can because it's not going to be anything like moving a kink over i can't handle it the same way i do king cobra so what we're going to do is unlock this enclosure right here get that cover out put in a pony receptacle and then get the mamba in and clean that enclosure so if you need a little momentum for pretty good for my spanish hot roots thanks muy caliente uh give me something to do say something cool what's that mean i smell like poop all right guys we got the can right here for the beautiful uncle pillow wrap which i decided his name is sunshine because she's such a bright little co-wrote a beautiful skin mutation that more she's got she is not hot now come is here going on cutie a little thick noodle beautiful one with cobra not too hesi today just hanging out all right we're gonna put her right don't shoot out your crazy snake what are you doing hello you're so upset i hear you it makes sense all right guys let's move her to the side all right guys now i just need to pick up the hide the water bowl there's no objects that allison's gonna wrap around so we don't want to make it difficult to move in or out of these enclosures all right guys we're gonna be moving allison everyone in the room is gonna be super still even me when handling her i can't be so energetic like i am with the king cobras she picks up on movement way more than the king cobra does of course the kinkovers like to focus on the movement but this snake reacts totally different doesn't stay one place in focus like a king code this snake reacts this thing shoots forward this thing darts the other way it gets very hyped up if you move too much so you want to make sure that when you're working with an animal like this which hopefully none of you guys haven't worked with a snake like this real smooth you're calm and you understand what you're doing so if you make a mistake around the snake it'll be the end of your life all right so she's coming out of that box a little bit it looks like she's going to reverse it try and get her to go back there we go all right so she's right here in the box let me grab her out by this coil there we go all right there you go that's allison the black mamba she is super twitchy as you can see look how she analyzes her environment she's looking around she's probing her head up and down investigating see where she can go see what she can get away let's give her this option to hide into oh doesn't seem like she's interested in going in it's kind of like a little stare off right now with her let's not have that too much now this is extremely dangerous and i gotta make sure i keep her face away from my hands my skin any skin contact and she can easily land a thing in me see she's defecating everywhere into the enclosure that was a real sketchy moment you guys haven't seen allison freak out that much since the second time that you've handled like i said if you're not calm if you're not focused on what you're doing it's so easy to get hit with those fangs even though it's a short fix fang snake from the alapede family this species the mamba has incredibly large fangs so even though they're short and fixed right there they're still long enough that all needs is a quick scrape and you're dead in 13 it's even 30 minutes or 30 minutes and 15 minutes a very short amount of time and notice the whole time this mama all she wanted to do is get away from me this snake wants nothing to do with me the last thing she wants to do is waste her venom on me she first tried to shoot away when i got grabbing her her next defense was to poop all over me musking on me a nasty scent of a mixture of poop and pee to tell a predator to piss off so they don't end up getting predated on the snake doesn't get prenated on so she pooped on me and then after that the next thing that's going to happen is a bite the last thing these snakes want to do is bite you so you always remember that when handling venice reptiles be dealing with any wildlife you gotta think about what they're thinking about and you gotta work with their behavior this snake wants to go up and hide so my idea is to give an area to go up into and hide she's very defensive right now let's get a walk on that enclosure for now let's get a whole bunch of wipies for the floor since she pooped all over the snake room i bet you guys enjoyed that god i got two beats of sweat this time very spicy but nothing i can't handle

beautiful oh look who came around what's up", "nnqX_eVSYYI": "we all know Kobe Bryant for his killer instinct but Kobe Bryant wasn't always the black mamba there was an event in his career that changed everything this is the story of that event what's up everybody is Jimmy and before we get in today's video shout out to Anthony Bennett fanpage on Instagram not much debate here I think we all know Anthony Bennett was the best Hooper to touch a basketball show some respect to the man that paved the way for greats like MJ magic and LeBron and go follow the only active Anthony Bennett fan page on Instagram now back to today's video when you think of Kobe Bryant you think of this a stone-cold killer no regard for his opponent and as basketball fans we love this about Kobe the guy guarding him not so much now if you watch the early 2000s Lakers you know they were about as dominant as it gets and as good as they were as a team it was basically the Shaq and Kobe show now you see it was the Shaq and Kobe show not the Kobe and Shaq show because at the time this was Shaq's team during the Lakers three-peat Shaq was quite literally unstoppable he didn't really have a rival there was no Shaq stopper well other than the free-throw line and that three year span Shaq one a regular season MVP three Finals MVPs and led the Lakers to three consecutive championship victories and this would remain the theme for the early 2000s Lakers that isn't so Kobe had a game that would change his entire outlook on the game of basketball see Kobe wasn't always the face of the Lakers he entered the league as a 17-year old but didn't start until he was 20 and didn't leave the team in scoring until he was 24 now don't get me wrong Kobe has always been Kobe but in this particular moment in time Kobe Bryant became the black mamba in the early 2000s if there was one player on the planet that could give Kobe the business time after time it was Tracy McGrady before the injuries took Tmax career if the dude could do just about everything you could think of on the basketball court and get you 30 points and people saw McGrady as the next guy to take over the NBA but on March 15 2004 Kobe changed all of that at the time Kobe was going through some serious off-the-court issues dealing with strong accusations in and out of the courtroom basically not being able to focus on the game he loved to play and his job to make matters worse Kobe and his wife were going through a rough time understandably and Kobe got kicked out of his own house I could only imagine what was going through his mind at the time this was all going down just days before he had to face off against Orlando and t-mac but the NBA is a business and this was his job so the night of the game he laced him up and took the court like always but Kobe wasn't playing like Kobe first time he says he's never felt like he wanted to even be in the basket he couldn't concentrate at all but like he's lost everything at one point in the first half he went over three from the field and only scored one point in the entire first half Tracy McGrady said he didn't even recognize him he was passive he wasn't taking any shots and to make things worse t-mac was lighting Kobe up and already racked up 21 points by the half the magic were up by 11 by halftime and judging by the way Kobe was playing they were confident they had the win and it was this series of events that led up to one of the most important moments in Kobe's career while sitting in the locker room team down by double digits having one of the worst games in years Kobe put everything into perspective he recalled this moment in an interview saying I remember sitting in the locker room at halftime and saying to myself you know what you may lose everything in life because of the situation that you've put yourself in you may lose your family your freedom but I'll be damned if you lose basketball because this I can control and this is when Kobe became the black mamba taking the court in the second half he immediately played a different kind of basketball and it didn't take long for everyone on the court to notice t-mac recalls instantly seeing a difference in Kobe's game physically and mentally in second half totally different story totally different dude this dude came out and was kicking our butts Kobe was pulling every off the dribble Poland double team polar goes up in the paint draws contact expecting the foul Poland and still gets the bucket the man was unstoppable the Lakers push the game into overtime and got the W Kobe finished the game with 38 points including 24 in the fourth quarter the man went from one point in the first half to 37 in the second half and this wasn't just against any team this was against the future face of the NBA and his rival Tracy McGrady imagine being in Kobe's perspective looking back we know he won that case but imagine what was going through his mind at the time he didn't know whether he was gonna be on a basketball court or in a prison in one year's time but this didn't stop Kobe from playing basketball because if there's one thing Kobe was meant to do its play basketball but this change lasted much longer than that second half in the two weeks prior to this game Kobe was averaging just 18 points a game in a couple weeks following this game Kobe averaged 31 he was a changed man and I think every great player or any successful individual for that matter must face these types of incredibly huge overbearing obstacles to reach their goals the difference between those who are good and those who are great are the ones who face these challenges and not back down from them Kobe Bryant is a once-in-a-generation player he can score relentlessly he has the skills of an all-time great and he is a winner but if there's one thing Kobe Bryant will be remembered for it's his killer instinct and his ability to step up in big moments Kobe was never and I mean never afraid of big moments and this is what we love about the guy t-mac went on to say he believes he had a hand in creating the Black Mamba on that night in 2004 and I like to paint since you told me that story I had something to do with creating the Black Mamba Kobe has always been Kobe from the day he stepped into the league as a scrawny 17 year old but on March 15 2004 Kobe Bryant became the Black Mamba

careful little kobe no cut look at that look at the black interior of his mouth and that right there is why they got that famous name black mama state review what is going on beautiful people welcome back to my wildlife i'm currently hanging out in the snake house right now and today we're going to be feeding all the venomous snakes not all of them on camera but i'm going to highlight some of the best feedings today for you guys so today we're starting off with a beautiful colette snake from australia only found in the heart of queensland notice that he's flaring out his neck a little bit he's got somewhat of a false cobra hood that is because he's in the same family as cobras crates mambas and all the deadly snakes of australia oh he's real fast when it comes to his food and when he picks up the scent he goes crazy look at him he's coming all the way down he's like chop chop chop no don't [ __ ] the metal what are you doing he's biting the glass right now look at him he's going crazy here bite the rat break here there we go he just got like a little nipple going on perfect that's a nice little snack for him because usually i feed him a bit bigger but we're going lighter this week and look he's crawling right back into that crocodile in the back suits him well since he's a species from australia even though his range doesn't have crocodiles in it this beautiful animal is found in the land of australia the biggest reptile on the planet the saltwater croc lives there some of the deadliest snakes on the planet live there like the inland taipan just all kinds of really cool stuff also let's send some love to my boy ricky mack from the outback he's a good friend of mine he was recently tagged by a coastal taipan a six foot coastal taipan looked away for a split second got hit on the arm basically hanging off his forearm got an intravenous bite got one thing into the vein travel through his body super fast he's a brother to me i love him to death go give him some love ricky matt for the outback survive the taipan gnarly gnarly snake uh let's see little little meatballs chomping down on that rat enjoying himself he's going to slurp that up like it's nothing because it's such a small meal we're going to move on to some other badass lapids maybe even feed a mama today i think little koby dinkleman's a little bit hungry so here [Music] and one more for good luck oh don't bite the cage what are you doing come on no don't like the cage there we go just one more little wrap up just to make sure he gets a good meal let's get that closed nice and secure sit here all right beautiful people we're gonna leave the little collect snake alone for now believe it or not that snake can actually get six feet long and about that thick it's a big beautiful snake i've even seen some of these guys that are fiery lava red they are so beautiful it's crazy to think that people who live in australia hunting for snakes and amphibians uh reptiles amphibians herpes these guys go their whole lives without even seeing a live specimen my buddy ricky mack from the outback he's been in australia his whole life and he's only seen one dead colette snake on the road so they're very hard to find but who knows maybe with the the luck of the ricky mcpack like we had last time we'd be able to find some of the rarest snakes because remember last time we're in australia the first night we found the owen pelly python the rarest python in australia and probably one of the rarest pythons to find in the world we got some good luck huh uh let's move on to the next snake let's see we're gonna be feeding the albino monopoly cokers but we can't forget the lace monitors are hungry at the end of the episode we're gonna have these guys run around for some exercise get some good eats look at lacey she's looking real beautiful she's laying up on that stick right now her colors are fabulous fabulous oh more what are you doing baby look at her she's just hanging out do you want a little something i'll give you a little wrap up a little wrap pinky more of the green tree monitor or emerald green tree monitor a beautiful species of daenerys this animal is amazing i can't wait to get more of these beautiful lizards they're extremely intelligent they're basically like the ferret of the lizard world very fun to work with and uh when we get to the new facility we will be putting her in a giant walk-in enclosure i know you're thinking oh she's so small why you're such a giant cage these animals live up in the trees their whole lives so they have this giant canopy to crawl through and get exercise these guys will jump three feet off the side of a branch to grab a moth up in the air or a grasshopper they're super athletic so a lot of these boreal monitor lizards that i have they're going to be getting amazing setups where they have a whole bunch of space come on come on no you want to touch my hands she's like no your hands grow outside your hand smells there you go oh oh oh like a little gloss wrapper they remind me of copies from jurassic park the cute little velociraptor like long animals that would hop around me you didn't think they're too much to worry about until a whole bunch of them come out and grab them sorry guys all right now we're gonna be moving on to the monocled cobra let me lock this up and make sure it's nice and secure even though this lizard is not really venomous i still don't want to get out let's see beautiful albino cobra definitely needs to eat let me get my keys ready to go she's always got a good appetite so when she when she smells that rat for feeding responses hello that's why you got to be careful even the nicest cobras look she used her tails like a little anchor to keep her in the cage even the nicest cobras when they smell food they become one of the most dangerous animals to work with doesn't matter how nice a snake is venomous non-venomous the second food is in the air you are at risk of getting bit and you got to watch yourself isn't that good pumping all that venom into there so this is an albino monocled cobra i've got a regular monocle covered big bertha this one that you're looking at right now is actually a gift from my friend who gave me alice in the black mamba all right we're gonna let her eat that food nice and secure let's see who's gonna eat next let's see if the new fur lance little jose oh you guys like that name jose the fertile ants my buddy joe gave me this snake right now the enclosure's being kept in with allison so alison can guard jose no jose is in here because there's a screen top on top of this little tank right here and if i had it outside this area and somebody put their hand on top of the screen there's the risk of fangs going through the screen and tagging somebody people have been bit by putting their hands on top of mesh screen before so that's why with the bio-active setups it's double layered so nobody can actually touch the actual screening of the enclosure and potentially get tagged so what we'll do is we're going to open up this enclosure take out the container that has little jose the fertilizer my buddy joe who bred this animal said that forget about mice off of the rat pinks and this thing should be growing like crazy good protein for the animal allison's in the box good to go get little jose right over here all right allison's just like all right all right we're good to go let's see where's the little jose i see just a little bit of skin underneath these leaves right here so we put a bunch of leaves in the enclosure to make them feel very comfortable in lots of hiding spots but at the same time it will make it very dangerous for the keeper but that's perfectly fine i want my animals to be comfortable i'm not worried about the risk or the danger level because these are my animals and if i wasn't comfortable working with them i wouldn't have them at all all right we're good to go let me grab the right size wrap paint before opening it up that should be good a nice little frozen dog wrap paint i see where he's at he's in this leaf litter i don't know where his head's at let's see if he picks up the scent and shoots out for the food he's right there these snakes typically like to move around tonight oh there he is coming over here see him in a leaf ladder look how well camouflaged he is the lance head beautiful speed oh oh nice little bite [Music] nice little initial bite you want to hold on this snake has such a necrotic venom you would not want to take a tag off of this snake i i could have said it enough in the last episode when we're showing this beautiful animal off but you've got to let people know this snake is responsible for rotting people's limbs off its is so necrotic that when people get bit it basically looks like they dip their foot or lemon acid and gets eaten away we're going to see if he starts to chew down on that food he's kind of just staring us down using those heat pits so he's long guard so i'm going to put the top on this enclosure we'll try to get some cool shots of them feeding [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] i'm so proud of you little jose you're going to be the biggest fighter in all of florida oh my goodness this is insane he ate his first meal today in front of us no problem at first i thought he wasn't going to eat in front of us because he felt threatened he was like oh you woke me up i noticed he was almost hyperventilating a little bit because we're all staying around but then he started going up to the wrap up and engulfing this wrap up that was perfect this snake can potentially get seven eight feet long one of the biggest vipers in central america and responsible for the most bites and deaths this snake is the most feared snake throughout costa rica and nicaragua you would not want to take a hit off of the snake but saying that this snake wants nothing to do with us at the end of the day the reason so many people get bit by this snake is because they walk around at night they might not have shoes they step on the snake in retaliation the snake injects them with venom these snakes want nothing to do with people in other occasions when people get bit they're just out in the middle of nowhere working out in the bush chopping at trees or picking fruits or whatnot and they end up putting their hand in the wrong place they get tagged by the snake and it's always in defense these snakes want nothing to do with us they're wonderful beautiful animals and without snakes like this our little populations our frog populations everything would go out of whack these guys manage the animals below them the food chain and that's why they're so important whether or not you believe a snake is useful at the end of the day snakes manage our other wildlife populations they keep everything in check as well as their venom holds the key to certain medical cures not just medicines but also the main thing anti-venom how do you treat yourself for a snake bite you use the venom of the snake to make anti-venom and you treat yourself with that anti-venom so these snakes serve a purpose not just for anti-venom but for medical uses for studying different medicines that you can use from the venoms as well as these animals help us in our ecosystems keeping everything in balance beautiful animal locked and secure we're going to be putting this thing back in with allison allison looks so happy she looks like she was enjoying that feeding right you like the fertilizer you like your new neighbor she's such a cutie it's crazy to think that little head is attached to a 9 10 foot black blonde all right let's see next we're going to be feeding uh what do you guys want to see next oh kobe the black mama let's go see kobe the black mama i'll put a little jose back in a second check out kobe the black model he's getting bigger we got rat pups defrosted i'm gonna go grab some right now we're gonna feed this beautiful big boy all right beautiful people we've got kobe the black mama hanging out he's looking around you might notice he's looking less and less like a young neonate snake he's stirring and mature in the face he's looking like a true black mama his colors are gorgeous he should not too long ago and he knows just by the way he's flicking his tongue and bopping his head right now he knows he's about to get food so what i'm going to do is i'm going to open this glass he's right there he's checking everything out we're going to offer him a nice sized wrap up right here let me see if he'll come up for it you ready little kobe oh look at him look at him always he's such a oh here oh perfect look at that look at the black interior of his mouth and that right there is why they got that famous name black mamba when they feel threatened they gaped their mouth kind of like how a cotton mouth or water moccasin down here in south florida when they feel threatened they open their mouth showing the white interior the black mama shows that black interior of the mouth saying do not mess with me what you see in my mouth is death now although you don't see big piercing fangs shooting into that rat this snake does have very long fangs they're being covered by the gummy sheets at the top of the roof of the mouth this animal being in the lapidate family does not have long hinged fangs like a viper like the fertile ants short fixed bangs near the front of the mouth that stay in the same position at all times but when this snake starts to hit around six eight feet long those things are going to be fairly big and you would not want to take a hit it takes one fang and you can have a deadly dose of venom coursing through your body that can kill you in less than 30 minutes think about that 30 minutes that's all it takes for that powerful neural toxin to take effect but at the end of the day it's still an animal that wants nothing to do with us these snakes they don't go out seeking to bite people wasting their venom these animals want nothing to do with people all they do is manage our bird populations our rodent populations and they just want to mind their own business there's a part of the ecosystem they deserve to be here just as much as you and i [Music] lock and secure next let's go feed thanos the snapping turtle thanos thanos what are you doing thanos want some food oh you're getting big dude this is thanos my common snapping turtle he's been with the channel for quite some time been raising him up from a little quarter-sized snapping turtle you want a little wrap

music] NARRATOR: In Africa, there\nare four species of Mamba. Three of them are green,\nbeautiful and deadly. But the fourth is both\naggressive and fast, the Black Mamba. Named for its pitch black mouth,\nthis Mamba is equally at home in trees and on the ground. It grows up to 12 feet long and\ncan be as thick as a man's arm. It's one of the fastest\nvenomous snakes in the world. It can speed along at 12\nmiles per hour and strike in less than a second. When it strikes, it pumps both\nneurotoxic and hemotoxic venom into its prey. The neurotoxic venom causes\nnearly instant death. And the hematoxic venom\nbegins the digestive process before the victim is even dead. A person bitten has only\nminutes to get antivenom-- often not an option. [rock music] In South Africa, these\ndeadly snakes have been known to invade people's homes. And that's when snake expert\nSimon Keys and Siouxsie Gillett are called to the scene. How are you doing? He said it's--\nit's black. It's-- It's showing up\nright in the house. Yes, sir, it is. It's this side. So where's your children? The children are inside still? No, you got them out. Oh, you got them out. OK. NARRATOR: As professional\nsnake catchers, Simon and Siouxsie are\ncalled to capture snakes and return them to the wild. Right. Let's move everything\nfrom there in-- NARRATOR: And no calls are\nmore dangerous than those involving a Black Mamba. I'm going to check here first. He's not here. I'll go check that. There it is. Whoa, here we go. OK. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: Ah. All right, now we know\nwhat we're dealing with-- a great big Black Mamba. Yeah, that's huge. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: It's big. SIMON KEYS: That's huge. It's all right there\nfor the time being. It's found somewhere to hide. What could have happened\nis that snake came in and obviously scared the kids. And they ran and locked\nthemselves in the bathroom. That snake would also be scared. It could have gone back out\nthe door, but it hasn't. It's gone and hid in there. That's fine. That's cool. I'm glad it's here\nbecause now we can make sure we catch\nit and take it far away so it doesn't come back. And that is quite a big Mamba. That's-- I'm guessing\nit's at least 8 foot long, probably a bit more. Right, that's going\nto be fun because it's wrapped itself in a bottle. Yeah. NARRATOR: Their goal-- to\nremove the snake before it has a chance to harm anyone and\nrelease it back in the wild, hopefully without\ngetting bit themselves. SIMON KEYS: He's wedging\nhimself in the back there. That's cool. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nHe's disappearing now. SIMON KEYS: Sioux, is\nthat hook behind you? SIOUXSIE GILLETT: No. Yeah. SIMON KEYS: Squeeze the hook. OK. [suspenseful music] [exhales forcefully] Right, I need to get there. I'll try and just loop\na bit of its body out. I'll get the tongs in it. But this bit is very\nlow down, I think. And I don't want\nto get too let down because then we've got\n6 foot of-- or more of Black Mamba ready\nto come towards us. Don't want to go there. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nYou can't come-- I need that bit, yeah. OK, that's a little better. All these bloody bottles. Sorry, snake. That is huge. All right, OK, all right. Sioux, get ready. That thing could actually-- SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nIt's blocking me in. SIMON KEYS: All right, snake. It's all right. I've got it. Not great like that. You get--\nSIOUXSIE GILLETT: I'm quite low. SIMON KEYS: I'm going\nto let that tape-- SIOUXSIE GILLETT: I will.\nI'm quite low. I'm very low because he's big. Just slowly. OK, I got another one. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: I\nneed to go out more. He's wedged. SIMON KEYS: Wait. See, I can actually get\nin there to nick it. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: Well,\nI need to go up more. SIMON KEYS: No.\nWatch out. I'm gonna let it go. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nOK, well, I'm quite-- SIMON KEYS: Oh, wait.\nAll right, let me get that. OK. No, I'm off. Right, don't let go. No, I'm low down. I'm not-- I can't actually see\nwhat I'm doing here. Dangerous, very dangerous. OK, I got it. I got it. Drives me crazy. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nOK, I'm letting go. SIMON KEYS: Yeah,\nyou can let go. Just hold this. OK, now I need to\nget it out of here. All right, snake, go on. OK, let's get all of you. All right. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nHe's really wedged in. I know.\nForcing himself. He doesn't want to come with us.\n[snake hissing] SIMON KEYS: Oh, all\nright, all right. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nListen, can you go to one side with\nthe head, and then I'll do the body because-- He's strong, eh? Hold that. That's it. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: There we go. [non-english speech] What is that? [non-english speech] SIMON KEYS: Yo, its\na big thing, eh? It's huge. [non-english speech] SIMON KEYS: We should\nactually measure this one. It's huge. Just stretch it\nout roughly, Sioux. I'll get a tape\nmeasure on it, I think. It's huge. Probably one of the\nbiggest we've caught. SIMON KEYS: One of them, yeah.\nIt's a big one. [chatter] Oh, I don't know if she's\ngoing to fit in our bag. She'll go. Use one of the white ones. All right. I'm going to put it in the\nshade because he's overheating. There, there. One little bite from this thing,\nthey'd be racing to hospital-- so dangerous. This is extremely\ndangerous what I'm doing. Because if I slip, the\nsnake's more than likely going to bite me,\nmore than likely going to bite Sioux and then\nanyone else in the vicinity. So I'm just going to\nconcentrate on what I'm doing. The tail end, if you\ncan undo the tail-- SIOUXSIE GILLETT: I'm trying. SIMON KEYS: Take her. All right, here we go. Wait a minute. I can't see. She's big. She's huge. And she is trying\nto get out of here. So try and do it as\nquick as you can. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: I am, babe,\nbut she's fighting against me. SIMON KEYS: That's it.\nGo. SIOUXSIE GILLETT:\nNo, I'm still not in. SIMON KEYS: She is strong. OK. No, push down more.\nPush down more. A little more,\ngo a little more. Watch out there. That's where the fangs\nare probably going to come through in a second. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: I\nneed her down more. SIMON KEYS: Go quickly. I'm losing my grip. SIOUXSIE GILLETT: I know, babe. The tape is twisted. All right, you have\nto move your hand. I'm going down there.\nSIMON KEYS: That will do. That will do.\nSIOUXSIE GILLETT: The tape is-- I'm going to let go. It's coming out of my hands. [snake hissing] SIMON KEYS: You don't play with\nthat thing too much, right. Thank you, guys.\nSIOUXSIE GILLETT: Goodbye. Thank you. Thank you very much. SIMON KEYS: No problem. Just stay clear. We didn't expect to see\na big snake like this. SIMON KEYS: Big snake.\nMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. SIMON KEYS: Big, big, big.

"rfVlb-NSstc": "hi guys you've joined us here today at our home facility again and we've got lots of comments in the previous videos we've done we've looked at black mambas and we've looked at king cobras and people have been saying who wins black mamba first King Cobra well the answer to that question depends on what we're comparing them about but today we're gonna answer that question for you and we're not looking at which snake is the most dangerous to handle or which is the most deadly we're looking at if you took these two snakes and you put them in a tank or an enclosure together what's going to happen the first night we're going to talk about is the Black Mamba that's what I'm gonna bring up now now normally with black mambas you can see I've got it in this little box yeah this is a transport box so normally what happens is you open it up black worm is going to come out we're going to chase it around for a few minutes and till it relaxes and then I'll be able to talk about it property so let's just see what this black mamba wants to do today well there we go now I've been come a little bit closer with the camera if you want the stressor it's gonna come out of here pretty fast so just back up with the camera here we go you just relax it'd be really nice of the sniper just stays where it is just an axis [Music] coming straight at me okay that's speak up moving across this cross now the easiest way to cook a Black Mamba that's me whoa whoa whoa whoa look at that all over the place know what I'll do you just look it back like this it just makes the slate tired and doesn't hurt the snake but the easiest way you let the snake go over the lipstick then you pick this makeup and it's not yet in the position where I can pick it up by hand so of hours to tail it now it would nail me know if that smarts maybes about it it would smash me straight on my off if I was to look it like this pick it up by the tail now there would be an Indian nation now what I wanted to report your back wants public I just want this night to relax a little bit well I tell you every time I work with black mambas you have to be right on top form now guys as you've seen when it comes to speed in there these legs are really foster a real handful they've also got far more toxic venom and the king cobra so when it comes from drop foot drop the black mambas venom is a lot more toxic in the king and in fact the king it's venomous not so toxic it's got a bigger yield but we'll talk about that later this is a really potent neurotoxic venom infected the snake barters prey item their prey is dead between 30 and 30 seconds and a minute later way more toxic unit and then a king cobra far more lethal when it comes to toxicity of venom and its biting force it's also a lot faster than a king cobra so if this snake wanted to move away from a king cobra it could really easily do that because it's a lot quicker it moves across the ground moves through trees moves through water they're excellent swimmers they excellent climbers really really incredible snakes now when it comes to SARS black mambas they get big so this isn't such a big one this is probably a five year old black mamba it's only about 2.2 meters maybe around 10 foot but they get right up to four and a half meters and that's the second longest venomous snake in the world they also give a lot of their venom up to four hundred milligrams in a box lastly though when we're talking black mambas and how dangerous they are and how it compares with the king cobra these guys have an attitude problem they were mean snakes as you saw as I open up their box came straight at me hood up mouth open wanting to envenomate king cobras seem to be far more relaxed they far more intelligence they kind of calculate more so king cobras I'm just gonna normally blatantly go for you it's gonna sneak up to you before it makes its pass black mambas are more nervous they're more aggressive than kind of defensive in some ways and they want to botch you a lot more than a king cobra does and they're just way more grease of snakes so what we got to do we got to put the snake down we got to bring out the king cobra we're gonna talk about their king cobra and then we're gonna wrap it up with what I think is the winner between the king cobra and the beautiful alright guys and as promised the next snake is the infamous King Cobra now you might know these are probably my favorite snakes in the world and the reason for that is they are the biggest of venomous snakes on the planet even bigger than the big black mambas right guys so this is Goliath and he's a little bit older than the black man but we head out just now he's in fact around 7 years old lady really nice Mike they live up to 2025 years in captivity so he still got some growing to do I'm gonna talk more about him in a moment I just want you to enjoy him look up you're spreading a lovely little thing isn't that really really cool hello big guy look at you now king cobras just get to adrenaline-pumping he's a captive snake captive bred captive hatched and look at him still he's saying I'm the boss dingo so hard as he compete and how does he compete who with a black mamba or number 1 when we talking SARS is nothing bigger than the venomous wall been there King Cobra he gets up to 5 and a half meters whereas the black mamba will get to four and a half so he's a bigger heavier snake now that does mean that because he's big and heavier he's a little bit slower so he won't be as quick through the bush on this grass as a black mamba would be so I keep him up it's quite nice when he's sitting like this he won't be as quick as a black mamba but he is huge and watch you'll see what let me point it out right over here massive head that's as big venom glands who could you face a camera boy place a camera okay turning around and post black mambas and king cobras excellent asset it's actually being told that a king cobra can spot something from a hundred meters away so both of these snakes are really good and visually detecting their prey or a risk or a danger and they're moving towards you up they want to eat it or moving away from it if it's a if it's a danger to thee the other thing that's very different about these snakes is that if you touch a black mamba on the tail generally moves away from you if you touch a king cobra on the tail look what happens now conversely if you touch a black mob on the side of the head or close to the top fear of its body it's gonna come at you whereas if you touch a king cobra like this look he relaxes absolutely incredible - apex predators massive a leopards toxic venom acting completely differently and that's what years of experience teacher is how to interact with these magnificent animals so how does the snake compare when it comes to toxicity of venom against the black mamba well we said earlier with the black moment the black mamba is more toxic in the king cobra and that's absolutely right but when you're looking at venema toxicity over them it's not always just about the toxicity it's also about how much venom each snake delivers and with these massive venom brands as you can see right there and right there the king cobra has a second biggest yield of any venomous snake in the world after the kaboom vodka that's right when this snake bites on it injects massive amount of neurotoxic venom far more in a black mamba so even though it's least toxic this vid it's far more potent and that these snakes bite on so hard and so fast that a man was bitten in Malaysia by a snake about the same size here's Goliath it took three people to take it off his arm before we go into the real business end of this comparison what I want to talk about is the temperament of these nuts so as you can see the black mamba was all over the place really nervous aggressive the king cobra is not confident in that so as you can see he's holding his grand he's putting up his hood you'll follow me as I walk around now what's that Mamba your swing around now here we go don't worry you'll be okay and a king cobras are confident animals they not scared animals they've got a much better personality than the black mambas the black mambas are far more nervous okay come on and as you saw there's what defense of lunch math wasn't open didn't want to back but look at that board cars and this is one of the reasons I say displace all my favorite snakes in the world so then we've looked at a couple of factors we look to toxicity of venom we've looked at the size of the snake we've looked at and who's the quickest of the snakes we've looked at the demean and their personality and who's the most aggressive so who's the winner of our ultimate challenge king cobra first black mamba well there can only be one winner and folks every single time the winner is the King Kong because king cobras feed naturally on other snakes and they are immune to other venomous snakes of venom so if I took a black mamba put it in the same enclosure as the king cobra what's going to happen the king cobra is gonna hunt the black mamba down it's gonna bite it is going venom ate it it's gonna hold on with that massive bottles and it's gonna swallow down an adult black mamba then if the Black Mamba bats a king cobra the King carbo have no interface it eats crates it eats Russell's Vipers Malayan pit vipers it's all kinds of deadly and dangerous snakes for breakfast the king cobra the ultimate venomous snake in the world thanks for joining us we'll see you next

guys if you have if you don't know Albert it is go watch the other videos with Albert he is one of the world's greatest snake Wrangler right well I'm sneaky snake handler he's where the world's greatest snake handlers and in some of the other videos Albert picks up rattlesnakes puts it around his neck he picks up gaboon Vipers and all kinds of cool stuff Oh what I want to think one other thing some of you guys have been asking me is this the same Albert Kilian that was mentioned by Jake the snake on Joe Rogan and the answer is yes this is Albert used to work for Jake the snake and he was Jake's snake handler snake I keep saying Wrangler do alligator wrangling but he's a handler he's a handler he's a dealer what's the cue not a snake dealer are you know something like all right guys here's what we're gonna do today um why are we gonna do the alert we're gonna treat a black mamba we're gonna feed a black mamba yeah yeah the shadow of death whoa [ __ ] this guy out now you've been bit by a number of snakes have you ever been bit like one of these guys yeah what you've been bit by a black mamba yeah you're still here Albert Albert is still here you still got all your fingers your hands yeah when I first got bit by the Black Mamba you know I went to the hospital and they didn't get any anti-venom because they couldn't find it in time but basically my body handled that we basically neutralized it on its own I'm still standing here today so you didn't get any anti-venom and you finally got it they wanted to give it to me but I told him you know no I didn't need it so decided to go home signed a waiver and left crazy that's what they call the shadow of death and they're an active hunter so what the Mamba just did is he struck at the rat because his senses located it and he actually had a direct strike and he does it again since there's no escape and the rats in close encounter with the snake the snake made by that numerous times now the venom is very fast-acting so that's normal that he'll he'll do that yeah that's normal but normally those bites the rats sustaining right now or subcutaneous bites just beneath the skin if that was an intravenous fight the rat would have jumped up in the air and he'd already be dead okay the central nervous system would have just been paralyzed at that point so it may take a few minutes for the venom to take effect now what the snake does he actually knows the rats been bitten so he's actually gonna wait he doesn't want to get too aggressive with the animal if the rat actually goes over to the snake and starts biting him he may strike it again and that's actually a survival strategy there right just so he doesn't get injured by the why waste the extra energy and the chance you might get injured when your Venom's gonna kill it in a minute anyway yeah the snake over you knows that but he doesn't want to sustain further injury from the animal in a confined space because rats are aggressive if they don't die right away a lot of times they'll try to chew on the snake well rats will eat non-venomous snakes won't they necessarily I mean they will if they're starving most rats and other mammals will avoid snakes at all cause it it looks now like the venom starting to take effect he's obviously not moving as well yeah but also the rat sustained several bites from the snake and even if they're subcutaneous bites there's so much venom running through that animal system the rat is already paralyzed and being karel eyes doesn't really mean the animals dead it means it's just it's voluntary muscle functions are not functioning right now not as the snake will wait till it's actually dead or as no is being paralyzed enough for I'm gonna go ahead and eat you as long as the rat does it present a threat to the snake whether it's involuntary muscle functions or ceased or its voluntary muscle functions or ceased the snake will begin to eat it so it doesn't mean it has to stop breathing to attend voluntary muscle functions if the rats still breathing and paralyzed the snake was swallowing but you saw him open his mouth right there well he's readjusting his jaws from the opening of the mouth and striking at the rat and he just way you saw the block inside of the snake's mouth right yeah okay that's where Black Mamba actually gets his name you'll be surprised how many people will look at a black snake and actually think it's a Black Mamba because it's black yeah Crocs from you know okay he's coming over to check it out and see what's going on now you can tell he's he's definitely sniffing around and taking a look now the snakes actually trying to locate the head of the animal so you can swallow the animal easily without any hindrance from swallowing it into reverse so because if you try to eat the but first the legs are well you can actually do that and he'll be able to swallow it but it's not so it doesn't go down as easy if used to regurgitate it from that position that comes out easier well you notice how the animal's flexing his jaw from side to side the teeth inside of the snake's mouth are actually what we call holding teeth he's got four rows of teeth on the top and two rows of teeth on the bottom the lower teeth on the lower jaw will move themselves forward as the upper jaw moves for side to side forcing the animal down as you move the teeth forward so his teeth themselves are literally made for swallow swallowing yes the animal doesn't have any jaw pressure basically what he does the teeth actually are curved back towards the throat so as he flexes the jaw and side-to-side they move forward anchor down again and push the animal down the throat and I'm always impressed just how many just how big things snakes can eat because like even right there like that's bigger than his mouth well there's there's no attachment to the the jaws themselves aren't fixed okay they have a great amount of elasticity okay each side of the the lower jaw moves independently with no connection in the front okay the upper jaw on each side basically is a little more fixed but basically moves independent you see how this snake is forcing the animal mostly wood itself a jaw flexing the jaw and so I decide pushing the end yeah see right now you can literally see it like the lower jaw is probably pretty more fixed but the flexibility within the job because there's no connecting bones the flexibility in the skin in the tissue and the ligaments will actually extend to accommodate its prey have you ever had a snake they ate something that was too big and what happened well then then you if you did that the snake will make the effort to actually try to swallow it but in the realization that it may be too big the animal will probably be Gurjit ate it and not give that attempt to even try to swallow it like mama try to swallow a lion once mind basically realized that it was too big and he couldn't actually swallow it yeah and he couldn't attempt to do that food no he just bit it tried to swallow it by the nose but he couldn't make his mouth over the nose now once he's got guts that in there how long does it take him to digest his meal I mean is that right hang on in his gut for a couple days or is it like a day or with the envenomations of the animal that animal will digest in two days pretty much break itself down then the third or fourth day he'll probably pass it through and so one of the things you were saying is that you feed live partly because the venom actually helps them break down they they venom ate them when they bit bite them right okay when they inventive ate their prey they're better off exorbitant Risha no value of the animal because it breaks the animal down from the inside out so they get more nutritional value using their Venom's as if they're to swallow something that hasn't been in venom ate it we just may take a couple of days longer to digest so something they're capable of digesting it but it's just going to take longer so they get more nutritional value out of envenomated in their prey which is much better for the animal so if it was just a dead rat that was already killed it would it would it wouldn't use its venom they would just eat it it would eat it but even if you use the venom it wouldn't go through the circulatory system basically the venom would be isolated oh there's no pumping going on yes exactly it's not intentionally so just be localized to the one area of the bite the tissue will deteriorate in that area but it won't travel through the animal itself and we can also see it kind of moving down through him like whoa okay once it gets past the jaws and he's done swallowing it basically he'll use the muscles in his neck and his body to push it further into the stomach by undulating his body from side to side or just flexing the muscles Wow but all snakes will swallow in that fashion to whether they're venomous or non-venomous or even if they're pythons when pythons swallow they mostly used to roll jaws standing them back and forth now like this snake which will actually use its upper jaw but you can see the speed of the strike on this snake usually if they inject their venom intravenously into any rat or other animal they decide to eat like a bird the animal would just jump up in the air and die immediately I mean I've literally seen this snake bite a rat and basically the animal just fell over dip wow that potent well it's a survival strategy and that's why these animals developed that type of venom so they wouldn't have to stress themselves out and trying to find and capture their prey their venom is so potent that their prey will probably die within a matter of ten or twelve feet away from the snake or right in front of the snake the animal is diurnal it's an active hunter during the day and at night oh wow so it's a nocturnal hunter as well these guys are just always hunting well if they can scent the animal in the air with their tongue what they'll do is actually pick up the smell of a rodent or prey within the localized area that they're in and don't actively go looking for so that's like a question now to do snakes sleep yes they do and what is snake sleep look like well you're not really gonna be a what dream about well I wouldn't know that either okay but basically you're not going to be able to tell whether snakes asleep or awake reason being is they don't have functional eyelids so when they're sleeping they're sleeping with their eyes open they may be nonreactive descent but they will be reactive to vibration it's just that if their encounter with the animal leaves the snake no other choice but to lash out the snakes gonna lash out and they will lash out aggressively if the animals in an open space and he puts on a threatening display he will actually lay the lower third of his body on the ground holding the upper two-thirds of his body up off the ground with its mouth open showing you the inside of that mouth which is totally black and if he decides to thrust forward because that animal isn't agonistic to the snake itself giving the snakes ability with the thrust in the momentum he can actually lift his body completely off the ground and probably fly through the air of two or three feet so newsy when they attack or they give a threatening display to looking at your face so they go up high when they strike so is there anything else you wanted you you want to tell you you're enthusiastic snake hunter and you're in Africa and you're gonna go looking for one of these snakes you best show this animal the greatest amount of respect okay this is one animal that has the ability to kill with no problem even a bite to the finger will kill you within four hours Wow or the toe giving a bite to the chest of the face will probably kill you within probably maybe 15 or probably two hours snakes normally don't give a large amount of venom but depends on how pissed off the animal is depends on how much venom you're gonna get the more angry the snake the more venom you're gonna wind up getting the snake will produce enough venom to kill its prey no matter what well within a matter of hours after the bite they never secrete all the venom so it's not like you never meet a snake and he's like running on empty you're like guess what I got bit but luckily he was on e well there's no II okay even if I was to extract all the venom from the snakes gland within a MIDI do you have enough to kill you anyway Wow so he produces it that fast well there'll be enough residual venom within the gland itself because you're not going to get it all out of there it is settle on to the gland and then into the dock and still be functional within the fangs so there's no total extraction from any snake any venomous snake of the world I mean this snake ranks right up there with any venomous Australian snake any snake you would consider in the top 10 deadliest snakes in

In this case, there is a full grown lion that \n is blocking the exit to a Black Mamba\u2019s lair. The life of the lion really is not in danger \n as long as the mamba is not too aggressive, ... to territorial and retains the opportunity to retreat to \n the safety of its lair at any given moment. The situation will change dramatically, once the mamba returns to \n its lair and sees the lion blocking its way. Any Black Mamba and I\u2019m not just talking about a particular aggressive individual. Any Black Mamba would not hesitate to attack and strike at \n the lion without provocation in order to enter its lair. The Mamba\u2019s attack will be so quick, that the lion \n will not have an opportunity to defend its life. The neurotoxic venom is so powerful, that it can \n kill a fully grown lion within twenty minutes.", "0SrM4rRkNXY": "guys i've been thinking about this a lot as you guys know allison is an animal that was gifted to me from a person who couldn't take care of their venomous reptiles anymore they quit the venomous reptile hobby and they decided to gift this snake to me along with a bunch of other venomous reptiles so she's considered a rescue but even though she's a rescue a lot of people are in fear from my life should i really get rid of alice in the black mamba what's going on beautiful people welcome back to my wildlife i know what you're probably thinking this is going to be a real interesting video is he really getting rid of his black mama is this really going to happen guys i've been thinking about this a lot as you guys know allison is an animal that was gifted to me from a person who couldn't take care of their venomous reptiles anymore they quit the venomous reptile hobby and they decided to gift this snake to me along with a bunch of other venomous reptiles obviously of all the venomous reptiles that this person gave me this black mamba is the most intimidating animal that was received and in just every bit of a 10-foot black mom but allison is a beast of a snake and every time i handle the snake i get comments like crazy why we don't want you to handle this snake we're scared for you try to do a lock box don't handle it we don't want you to get near the snake a lot of people are even commenting get rid of allison allison is technically a rescue she's an animal that couldn't be taken care of by the owner and she had to be rehomed so she's considered a rescue but even though she's a rescue a lot of people are in fear from my life i understand that i understand that so much and that's why i'm really thinking right now should i really get rid of allison the black mamba i mean this is a snake that i've looked forward to working with my whole life i love black mamas but she is a very dangerous reptile so with a lot of thinking all these comments that i've been seeing like crazy on my youtube channel about alice in the black home get rid of her put her lock box don't handle her please get we don't want to see you get her channel with all that information taken in i've come to the understanding what i need to do and that is why today we're doing a new unboxing for my new male black mama yes i got a new black mamba male it's only about a year old it's three and a half feet long or three feet or so and it's a gift from dingle dinkleman over in africa thank you so much david dinkle go check out his channel after you see this video he does plenty of stuff with black mamas going into houses and removing them from people's homes basically saving the snakes lives and also the people themselves so thank you very much dingo dinkleman for my new black mamba male so yes the black mamba is in here i just need a reaches no i'm just kidding obviously this animal is contained i have them in a container right here this snake came all the way from africa a couple days ago and uh it came in a shipment with some other snakes that were going to a fellow keeper that you guys might know so you're going to see a video on someone else's channel pretty soon of their new snakes and this is our new baby black mamba and even though it's contained right now we've got to be careful because it does have ventilation holes and people have been venomated through the ventilation hole so check this out look at that little beautiful little face this is a confirmed male black mamba look how this snake looks around look at that cute little snake and just like king cobras even though this is just a year old snake there are fairly large venomous reptiles black mambas the record is actually upwards to 14 feet long think about that that's a massive black mamba look at allison right now allison is a 10 foot long solid black mamba female and these snakes have the potential to get to 14 feet but typically they usually get 8 to ten feet long i'm super excited because allison's pretty big but the males of the black mamba species get much bigger than the females so just like the king cobras so this little male that we're gonna have to think of a name for you know i've always thought of the name um bill like uh is in kill bill they have a black mama i thought bill would be a cool black mama named daniel has been suggesting to name this animal dingo which i'm thinking about as well but i want you guys to comment below what do you think i should name my new black mama obviously he is so small look how tiny he is look next to my thumb how big his head is look at that face he's a very small black mama he's captive bread which is very important and uh he's obviously not going to go in the enclosure with allison right away because look how big allison is now to my knowledge black commandos aren't cannibalistic but also to my knowledge all snakes can potentially be cannibalistic that black mamba is way too small to go a little allison over here right away so what we're going to do is set up this nicely sized cage over here because i knew that dingo was sending me a black mamba i wasn't sure how big it is i thought it'd be more close to like four or five feet but this one's just a year old so this is plenty of space for this animal is a vision cage so it's customized for snakes not to escape there's no other way of getting out this is all ventilation back here it's all secured vent and we have the glass for taking out the animal for husbandry now if you look at this enclosure it's solid it's sealed we even have the key right here so nobody can access it here with the florida fish and wildlife to have a venomous reptile permit you need a snake-proof building you need snake-proof cages and also a lot of experience to even be owning these animals in general which is everything we have here so now the thing about this enclosure is it looks nice and secure but if you look real quick it's it's just got just a little crack in between the two sheets of glass that open up right here and that snake most likely would never be able to get through that little crack but you know what just like octopus just like rats there are many animals that will surprise you and get through the small spaces and we want no risk of a black mamba this small look how tiny this thing is look at him it's a big snake it's the same size as a yearling king cobra so it's a good size snake but even though his head is a decent size i do not want to risk a potential escape so just to take extra precaution what i'm going to be doing is taking this insulator or this foam and actually has sticky sides and i'm actually going to set it up all along down the glass up towards the lock and right below the lock so there's no way god's green earth that the snake could ever escape although this is a snake proof room and if a snake got out of the enclosure it can actually leave this double door room but it's always good to take extra security because this is a black mamba it is one of the most athletic snakes on the planet and also it just being a snake makes it an escape artist so we gotta make sure it's nice and secure so what we're gonna be doing now is setting up this enclosure i'm gonna be taking care of the strips to put up here in the glass and then we have a whole box of new supplies right over here i'm not going crazy with bioactive or anything like that we're going to be doing some fake plastic plants we're going to be doing nice big logs i got a nice hide in here so this thing feel nice and secure and a nice big water bowl we're going to put right at the front of the entrance so it's easy to put water into that bowl and get them hydrated so i hope you guys are excited we're gonna be setting up the new black mamba enclosure comment below should we name him bill should we name him dingo should we name him toto should we name him please get rid of them wait that's another name anyways let's get to designing this enclosure all right guys so we're going to do is take this glass down and we're going to begin the process look at this as i'm doing everything we have king tut right here getting ready to strike at my legs he's just so defensive uh one of the next things we're gonna have to do is get him a nice big cage have more hiding spots so he's not so containful striking at the glass anyways he's getting distracted i love that snake he always captures my attention when i'm least expecting it so let's do this i'm going to put these strips all along the glass like i said for extra security going down to the lock and below the lock and then after that we're going to start setting up the actual enclosure so let me get something to cut this with and let's start getting creative and crafty all right anyways oh i'm so excited this black mamba is awesome i'm so happy dingo has actually been talking about sending me a black mamba uh since before coronavirus so over six months now i've been waiting for a black mamba and technically dingo was actually supposed to send me my first ever black mamba but then out of nowhere in between the time he was supposed to send me a young male and uh right now i received alice in the black mambo randomly from a venomous keeper that decided to give up this old venomous collection so in between that time and now i got allison which actually worked out because now that i know that i have a female jingo knew he could send me a male and now have a pair of black mamas which is really cool and you know what you guys are probably thinking chandler why are you gonna breed black mangas what are you gonna do with a bunch of baby black mamas well simple as this i obviously don't believe that black mambas are pets i don't want to sell them to anyone in the private collections unless it's somebody that i've known for a very long time and they're very reputable and responsible for the most part when i produce black mambas in the future i want to donate all the babies to a venom lab that will take the venom work seriously and create anti-venom so not just anti-venom but pharmaceutical purposes as well so just to clarify i really have no interest of selling deadly animals into the pet trade everything that i do and everything i work towards is for conservation preservation wildlife and bringing awareness so if you guys want to come and see animals like this come on over to the facility or in the future get yourself a safari to africa and go visit dingle ding woman thank you again dino i appreciate you beautiful look at this now the snake cannot get out at all nice and secure beautiful super important i felt like i had to take that extra precaution even though i bet the snake can get through you never know snakes are escape artists all they have to do is think of ways to get out of their enclosures so you have to be smarter so we're going to set this enclosure it's a little toasty in the snakehouse i'm not going to put a light on this right away just because all the snakes are assuming they get a perfect temperature for getting nice and toasty to digest that food we're just going to make it real simple for now i got a nice high flat to the ground add extra security just in case this mama doesn't feel like hanging out on the branches because it's going to have to be it's going to have to get used to being on display for the public just like allison she's a little skittish at first but now she's pretty content as you can see i can get close to allison she doesn't get too spooked she's throws her tongue out a little bit picks up some scent she's like are you gonna feed me or what are you doing here today huh so she's pretty laid back she's doing well and what's really exciting is since this mamba is so young it's just a young little mamba it's going to get used to the way i handle the snakes it's going to get used to the way things are getting done around here and this snake will be very relaxed or at least that's what i'm hoping it will start to understand that there's a there's a good relationship between myself and the animal and when it comes to maintaining the enclosures it's not too hectic although allison has given us a run for our money a few times taking her out she's starting to learn that i'm not out to get her and that's what's important about this because look i get near her she doesn't start flinching she doesn't get twitchy it's all progress and that's what's gonna happen with this young black mamba i'm just gonna stick this high right in the back here nice and simple i'm not going to crazy you know we just got this snake and the reason i'm not really spooked about quarantine whatnot i'm just going straight to the room is this is a captive bred snake and it's been in captivity's whole life that it's perfect what's interesting is the black mamba that dingo was originally supposed to send me his black mamba that he caught on a house call and on that house call he caught like a big 9 10 foot female and then he caught one of its babies that were like that big that baby was awesome he was talking about sending it to me and that was like right as corona was happening so six plus months ago and he had the snake he was getting ready to send it to me and then out of nowhere it's penis prolapse can you believe that snakes have two penises they're called hemi peens and the penis is prolacts which means they step out of the cloaca and didn't go back inside the snake and he was worried about it he was keeping me updated and eventually the snake actually just passed away so it kind of worked out that i didn't get that animal and then i ended up getting allison being a female and then it gave him the idea of okay i'll send him a mail so thanks again dingo i really appreciate it you're just you're really helping raise the anxiety for my parents they love seeing me get more mambas if you thought they were comfortable with the snakes i have you should hear them talk about me with the black mambas cool we got our big logs we got some real skinny ones and i'm not going to be drilling them into this enclosure because this is just one of the many enclosures this mama's going to live in this mama's going to get big like i said they have the potential to get over 13 feet long that is huge what i'm going to do is just have this as a grout enclosure once that mama gets bigger it'll keep upgrading and enclosures and we'll go on from there so let me see i'm going to get a big log somewhere right about here that's going to act as a prop for these skinnier branches all right you cool cats and kittens let me just get out some more plants like i said we're doing vape plants we're not doing a five active setup just a nice simple vision cage style setup get some nice shrubs make it look nice and green in here let me see find different spots to pop this up in shove it into little wood cracks just make it look natural so far not doing a good job looking good looking good super simple setup but hey that's what we're looking for right now you know we just got this animal we want to be able to observe the animal make sure he's on what are you doing big breath just hanging out looking around make sure this animal's in tip-top shape and we have a good view of the animal i'm going to put the water right here at the edge and the key to putting the water bowl right here at the corner where the glass is and so when i'm doing maintenance simple maintenance of filling up the water you crack the glass you fill it with water there's no need to have to reach the back of the enclosure to have to remove the snake try and limit that as much as possible because although i want to handle this animal and i want him to get used to me he's new to this environment we want to stress them out because it's very easy to do that to a snake especially one that just traveled all the way from africa oh yeah it's gonna be like a little rainforest we're not gonna know where the hell this thing is it's gonna be a game for the kids where's the black mamba where is his mommy's gonna come look oh i gotta try to fight him in the face hopefully not allison doesn't seem to do that and uh bill seems to be pretty relaxed as well he's only gaped his mouth at me once but hey but not so much like uh ejection cobra is sitting there all day striking and hunting up at you at the end of the day a black mamba wants to avoid people they're very shy snakes and although lots of stories out there coming out of africa are saying the mama chased me ah the mamba was in a tree and it bit five cattle as the cattle came through and they all died no it's ridiculous the snakes want nothing to do with us they always try to avoid us and you guys can see that when i take out alison she's always trying to shoot the opposite direction it's always me bringing her back obviously because we have to keep her contained but at the end of the day mamas don't want to waste their venom on us they have somewhat of a small venom yield i mean they got a lot of venom but compared to a king cobra or gaboon viper you know their venom yield isn't gigantic it's just those two venom glands and once they use too much of that venom now they got nothing for their food so if you think about it venom is specifically to take down their food it's hard to make it's a protein it takes energy to make that venom so if they waste it on you it's wasted energy it's wasted time it's a wasted meal for the future so in reality when it comes to mambas being aggressive and mama's coming after people mom is chasing people that is all nonsense snakes want nothing to do with us and you guys are going to learn that more and more as you see these black mamas on the channel in captivity and in the wild in the future hopefully 2021 i'm coming for you dingo chill out here all right guys i think that's about it for now very simple like i said i'm not going crazy with this setup we want to make it very simple and easy to maintain for this animal all right guys i'll be right back i'm gonna get some fresh water for the mama and then we're gonna unbox this mama and put him into his new enclosure [Music] all right guys moment of truth we're gonna be unboxing the little mamba we just gotta get this container open we've got some tape sealing the sides there we go we're gonna see how the snake acts because dingo warned me that this snake can be very flighty and acts every bit of a black mamba so we're getting very careful that they're used on these containers let me slowly crack this open and see how it works okay yeah this is new for me i've never used this type of container it's awesome it stays sealed it's very good okay so the container lid is not secure anymore i'm just gonna pop that off this snake is so pretty from outside the container it's gorgeous but when you open it up and you actually get a good look at this snake it is insanely beautiful i'm gonna spin this around so you guys can see look at that black mama look how beautiful this snake is perfect coffin shaped head i've actually never seen a black mamba this small in person so this is really cool for me to actually get the opportunity to work with one this young and develop a relationship with this snake look at this he said it's around three feet long that's what it looks to be look at the coloration of this look at that thing that is a beautiful black mamba of my buddies that have checked the snake out already tyler justin everyone's been saying wow that is a beautiful black mama thank you so much dingle tinkleman huge shout out to dingo for hooking up with the mama as you can see the mom is starting to get a little flighty he's wondering what's going on he's trying to make a little bit of an escape look at that sink that is a beautiful yearling black mama what a good looking animal look i'm just probing up checking out the area picking up all the new scents this is insane remember this animal came all the way from africa so he's been sitting in a container doing his thing look at his face look he's just investigating looking around this is actually like a four foot long black mama so a good sized snake let's get him into the enclosure i feel like he's getting real twitchy real wiry there you go bring something closer to this look at this look he's checking out the area he's investigating this is too cool all right his tail is just going in he's starting to pick up all the scents look he's investigating this is so cool just like a little king cobra super curious that is so cool this is plenty of space for this mamba and i'm gonna get a light on top of this enclosure very soon just for today we're gonna let some dark be nice and relaxed he'll get lighting from the room itself and he's gonna enjoy his new enclosure this is super exciting stuff thank you so much dingle dinkman i really appreciate the new black mamba and i can't wait for you to get a plane ticket over here to america so i can show you some other wildlife up close and we can have a good time this is an extremely a boreal snake which needs to come in a thought when you're keeping them in an enclosure like a vision cage because the vision cage actually has a lip up here and a lot of the boreal species of snake will utilize that lip to hide especially mamas him being this small he's going to realize that this lip is here if he wants to hide in the dark and be elevated this is going to be his favorite spot which is something that you have to be very aware of when you work with venomous reptiles because you don't think about stuff like that it's very easy to make a mistake thinking the snakes on that high reaching in getting tagged on top of the hand number one rule when it comes to working with venomous reptiles never never do any husbandry never maintain the enclosure with the animal stone side enclosure whenever you're going to do any servicing of the enclosure always take the venomous reptile out and secure inside enclosure but that's only for the people out there working with black mamas and cobras and stuff like that most of you guys are just enjoying the snakes from home and you're getting to learn to love snakes in general which is what i really appreciate about you guys supporting this channel so thank you so much now i think this is going to be it for the rest of this episode i've got lots to do today i got to clean up my bushmasters

channel i am justin burke i'm a vocal coach [Music] i've got to tell you that i am on a mission to teach the world how to sing and i made you a free singing lesson the link is down in the youtube description you might have heard me talk about the free lesson if you watch my channel but if you haven't tried it promise me that you're going to try it after this reaction today is the day this is your sign that you're going to take your singing to the next level or at least realize what you're capable of being completely honest like above all i just want you to realize that you can develop a great voice you don't have to be born with a great voice that's that's what i want you to realize if you have that dream of being a singer you can achieve it you can achieve it you can be a k-pop idol right you can have that kind of voice that you are so confident in and that captivates people in and it doesn't even have to take you that long all right really all it is is just connecting the mind to your vocal cords i'm not kidding if i can be honest a lot of people a lot of vocal coaches make it seem more difficult than it has to be because they want you to keep paying them monthly so let me just show you in 15 minutes what you can do with the right exercises and then from there i'm i'm hoping that you're going to be so motivated that you're going to want to continue with doing the right stuff so let me know how that goes for you okay the link is down in the youtube description and you can record your voice before and after to prove it to yourself that's what i recommend you do anyway that is in the description i will see you over there today is the day i'm telling you you gotta do it you gotta promise me okay today's the day that being said let's get into this [Applause] so this is a new group [Music] [Music] [Music] action [Music] um [Music] [Music] hates interrupt but i thought i would remind you that you can check out all of my music on my channel it's featured on my channel you know if you're gonna hear me analyze other voices i think it's important that you know what my voice sounds like too so whenever you're ready for that that's there on my channel all right let's get back to it [Applause] great voices i love them [Music] oh those harmonies in the back oh [Music] i need some coffee i need some more coffee oh oh my gosh i don't even know what i'm doing at this point this is insane should we keep going let's keep going the voices are great here's the thing though i want to hear them live i really really really want to hear them live after this i'm going to find a compilation a compilation i can't even speak after this of them live and i want to hear if they have those kinds of vocal tones and that kind of pitch accuracy and that kind of like stylization live because that would be so impressive i've gotta know let's keep going [Music] i like those sprints going in the back [Music] too [Music] [Music] gorgeous slime their vocal tone instability is so great and especially in k-pop the amount of movement that they're doing when they're singing they're lip-syncing for a music video but still they can all dance and sing and that is impressive so much of that comes down to the proper breathing technique and then developing the proper support through what's called appoggio okay it comes from the old italian singing schools i'm gonna show it to you right now just a quick tip to get you started breathing better when you sing and if you want to dance and sing so let's just do this together okay first thing breathe in through the nose shoulders down and back you don't want your chest and your shoulders to rise when you sing so literally just we're taking a quick break do this with me i'm going to improve your voice right now and get you where you can have that kind of stability or at least start where you get that kind of stability that they have in that upper register that you love okay so let's do this so you're gonna breathe in don't breathe into the chest don't breathe in the shoulders instead you are going to here i'm gonna move this up with me okay mike is coming up with me so this is actually what i want you to do no kidding okay so you're gonna place your hands on your sides like this and when you breathe in your stomach's coming out your lower back's coming out even a little bit of your rib cage is coming out is it going to look super cute no it's not because your belly's going to be sticking out but i'll take one for the team and show you how this looks okay you ready so you're gonna grab your sides like this breathe in through the nose keep the shoulders relaxed and keep the chest down and breathe in ready all right and my shirt's kind of loose but my belly i don't know if you can see that but my belly is nice and sticking out my lower back expanded and a little bit of my sides expanded so my hands that were once like this now became like this that's how i want you to breathe now let me take a step further i'm going to come down here while i'm talking to you but we're going to take a step further and i want to show you how it should feel when you're going to sing without a pogio technique a lot of people talk about sing from your diaphragm you might have heard that terrible advice the diaphragm is is an involuntary muscle you can't consciously control it so if i were to tell you sing from the diaphragm it's like that's just going to make you anxious like you're going to be doing something wrong so let me simplify right now okay that's what i want you to do whenever you sing especially when you're moving and singing feel a kick out place your hand around your belt region here and cough for me literally do this at home okay cough for me notice how that naturally kicks out so you want that muscle there contracted while the upper abdomen is as loose as it can be and that can take you some time to develop the kind of mind muscle connection to relax these muscles while contracting this lower muscle here but that is called appoggio and that's what proper breath support should feel like so while you sing place your hand there cough and then sing while you feel that same muscle contracted all right give that a try [Music] this one hit wait i missed it [Music] dang [Music] oh my [Music] honestly really impressed with those vocals those tones sounded great i love the slides those vocal slides the dorky term for those slides is called the portaminto a portamento those are very important for every vocalist to be able to do those kinds of slides and everything was good the video the visuals i mean you already know it's like ah it's like it's hard for even me to focus on the vocals when they have so much going on in these music videos it's just i don't know it's just crazy i was trying to read the translation of the lyrics too so there's a lot a lot going on they get you in k-pop i will give them that they know how to hook you in with just flashing lights and all kinds of crazies yeah pretty intense but i'm impressed vocally they really did a great job they really put together a great group vocally even if things were tuned on the back end it doesn't matter because the tonal qualities were really great really rich not too bright honestly there was some like darker qualities in a lot of their tones which i like that gives some contrast in k-pop when everything is so bright and giving more of a joyous happier vibe which can be great but it's kind of fun to also break the mold and have more of a darker kind of mysterious like vocal tone i've never called a vocal tone mysterious before so there you go that's a new one for me anyway really enjoyed this leave me a comment the important thing is what do you think i want to know what you think we all want to know what you think i love looking at youtube comments that's like my favorite part of youtube so join the discussion down below and then of course you know what i'm getting close up for this one okay i'm getting close up because it's important i promise you you can learn to sing if you have a dream of being a k-pop idol like that you can do it don't give up on your dream promise me you will not i wish i had somebody that would have told me that when i was first starting off when i wanted to give up because i felt like i could never sing i felt like i could never sing like the people that i looked up to and i'm telling you you can all it takes is doing the right exercises and honestly getting a great coach you know i wish i got a great coach sooner than just trying to surf youtube and trying to figure it out by myself it took me forever until i finally got some great coaches and if you want to do it online check out singer take that free lesson and just see for yourself this is what i would want you to do honestly is just record your voice before it go through it and then record it after because that's when you literally will have proof like because i can say this every day and you're not gonna believe me because you're probably like me i wouldn't have believed me okay hearing some vocal coach on youtube would be like yeah right you vocal coach on youtube you're just telling me what you want to hear so i can sign up for some da da da da da you know i i get it trust me i get because i was there so look that's why i'm like just record your voice don't even listen to me okay just listen to your own vocal transformation in 15 minutes just record your voice before go through it record it after let me know how it goes for you and hopefully i will see you on the inside of the singer community where i can personally meet you encourage you and motivate you throughout your entire singing journey above all i have so much love for you hope you're having a wonderful day and i will see you in the next one peace [Music] when nightmares come i'll sing you back", "hPvp_8L_6rU": "hi welcome my name is angelina and today\u00a0\nwe are going to be reviewing aespa's debut\u00a0\u00a0 with black mamba now this is definitely a much\u00a0\nanticipated debut from sm entertainment which\u00a0\u00a0 features a seemingly unique ai concept integrated\u00a0\ninto the member lineup and i actually have a video\u00a0\u00a0 about some of my thoughts about this if you want\u00a0\nto check it out after you're done with this video\u00a0\u00a0 however this is also a debut that has been plagued\u00a0\nwith controversy from accusations to plagiarism to\u00a0\u00a0 concerns about how this ai concept could be\u00a0\nused for bad intentions is their concept too\u00a0\u00a0 similar to kda? is their ai concept as it is now\u00a0\ngoing to be an issue? so along with my review of\u00a0\u00a0 the music video the choreography the styling i\u00a0\nthought we could talk about the subject as well\u00a0\u00a0 and talk about why it's familiar why it's not\u00a0\nfamiliar and honestly everything in between and actually good news if you're interested\u00a0\nin this type of video you actually have the\u00a0\u00a0 opportunity to subscribe to this channel\u00a0\nbefore i cut you off after december 31st\u00a0\u00a0 you can also like comment and share this\u00a0\nvideo with friends you don't have to help\u00a0\u00a0 that good old algorithm since youtube has also\u00a0\nblocked my community tab and i don't know why,\u00a0\u00a0 they were like you don't get a play button and\u00a0\nyou can't talk to your audience, thank you! but\u00a0\u00a0 before we get into the contents of this video i\u00a0\ndid want to leave a little bit of a disclaimer\u00a0\u00a0 so this is just a series that i do for fun to\u00a0\ntalk about comebacks or to talk about debuts\u00a0\u00a0 familiarity in and of itself is not inherently\u00a0\nbad if anything i find a lot of comfort within\u00a0\u00a0 familiarity and i think it's really fun to make\u00a0\nreference to other works of art so i am in no way\u00a0\u00a0 accusing anyone in these videos of plagiarism it's\u00a0\ndefinitely not my place and i think after a while\u00a0\u00a0 there's just so much you can work with before you\u00a0\ninevitably see things reappearing or reoccurring\u00a0\u00a0 so yes i'll be pointing out some similarities\u00a0\nmaybe making some jokes about that references\u00a0\u00a0 to other works of art, but it's all in good\u00a0\nfun so let's start with a little bit of an\u00a0\u00a0 introduction so black mamba for those who don't\u00a0\nknow is actually a type of snake but from what\u00a0\u00a0 i know about black mambas they aren't actually\u00a0\nblack in fact they're called black mambas because\u00a0\u00a0 when they open their mouths their mouths are\u00a0\nentirely black but the snakes are generally,\u00a0\u00a0 you know green to brown, so we won't get into how\u00a0\naccurately the snake was represented within the\u00a0\u00a0 music video because i don't think i'm really\u00a0\nqualified to do so and i won't be showing\u00a0\u00a0 with snake just in case anyone is a little\u00a0\nbit freaked out if the title was black palm\u00a0\u00a0 cockatoo i can assure you this video would have\u00a0\na very different direction but alas this music\u00a0\u00a0 video starts off with all four members in this\u00a0\nsuper colorful room with these blank tv screens\u00a0\u00a0 and they're addressed very colorfully and there's\u00a0\neven these little animations that appear above\u00a0\u00a0 them we then cut to a more nature-like scene which\u00a0\nreally doesn't reflect reality right it's more\u00a0\u00a0 unrealistic maybe a little bit futuristic it's\u00a0\nmore metallic and with this we're presented with\u00a0\u00a0 espa's universe and i have to say the universe\u00a0\nthat they created for espa is absolutely stunning\u00a0\u00a0 you're mixing elements that seem familiar with\u00a0\nelements that are just completely out of this\u00a0\u00a0 world you know completely entirely animated in\u00a0\nterms of creating a specific world i'm in love\u00a0\u00a0 with this and i'm so excited to see to what\u00a0\nextent they elaborate on this world to extend\u00a0\u00a0 they show us more of this world however when it\u00a0\ncomes at the integration of their ai versions\u00a0\u00a0 i have a little bit different thoughts about that\u00a0\nbut we'll get into that later but interestingly\u00a0\u00a0 enough in this universe you can airdrop a picture\u00a0\nand then when you open that picture it creates you\u00a0\u00a0 know an environmental change as we can see karina\u00a0\nis in a subway she gets airdropped a picture and\u00a0\u00a0 then suddenly there is flowers and butterflies\u00a0\ni also really love this scene with ning ning\u00a0\u00a0 and the computers i just i'm a sucker for pink\u00a0\ndespite the fact that i wear black all the time\u00a0\u00a0 so let's move on to why it's familiar the first\u00a0\nthing noteworthy of pointing out are definitely\u00a0\u00a0 the screen animations i love this i love mixing\u00a0\nanimation with real life video i definitely love\u00a0\u00a0 this aspect when it appears you know i've seen it\u00a0\nin itzy's icy i've even seen it in 2NE1's happy\u00a0\u00a0 i just love the mixture of animated things with\u00a0\nreal life videos the next thing that i see people\u00a0\u00a0 bringing up a lot is definitely the similarity\u00a0\nwith kda which is a k-pop group from league of\u00a0\u00a0 legends which is voiced by sometimes g-idle\u00a0\nmadison beer and now i get that they're both\u00a0\u00a0 dabbling with the aspect of unreality\u00a0\nright you know they're avatars voiced by\u00a0\u00a0 real people though i still maintain they do\u00a0\nit in a different way right kda is entirely\u00a0\u00a0 animated right while aespa of course is supposed\u00a0\nto be kind of a mixture of animation avatars ai\u00a0\u00a0 and real life people and in fact within the\u00a0\nmusic video we saw very little of their ai\u00a0\u00a0 versions you know we did see little glimpses\u00a0\nhere and there them kind of interacting very\u00a0\u00a0 little with their ai characters and then them kind\u00a0\nof becoming their ai characters at one point and i\u00a0\u00a0 have to admit i was a little bit scared of this\u00a0\nbecause in gisele's teaser you can kind of see\u00a0\u00a0 the integration of both characters was a lot more\u00a0\ncommon you know they were switching back and forth\u00a0\u00a0 and i was just a little bit apprehensive about\u00a0\nthat like how are people going to react to this\u00a0\u00a0 you know kpop group but anyways so i appreciated\u00a0\nthat we got to see a little bit of their ai\u00a0\u00a0 but it wasn't overpowering it wasn't like a focal\u00a0\npoint of the video it was a cool little touch\u00a0\u00a0 rather than you know taking away from the members\u00a0\nwhich i think is a concern for a lot of people\u00a0\u00a0 since a lot of people are saying you know imagine\u00a0\ntraining to become a k-pop idol and then you just\u00a0\u00a0 your job is taken by someone who just really\u00a0\nisn't real so moving forward if espa continue\u00a0\u00a0 to do this you know integrating their ai versions\u00a0\nin a way that's a little bit more subtle i think\u00a0\u00a0 it's something i could personally get behind i'm\u00a0\nnot the biggest fan of the ai concept as of now\u00a0\u00a0 that could definitely change in the future but\u00a0\nif they continue on this way while doing other\u00a0\u00a0 things outside of their music videos with\u00a0\ntheir ai concepts and integrating them more\u00a0\u00a0 in that sense i think it could be a really cool\u00a0\nidea but before watching this music video i was\u00a0\u00a0 literally thinking like four extra members would\u00a0\nbe appearing and singing and dancing with them and\u00a0\u00a0 being integrated a little more maybe in the future\u00a0\nthey will do that but as of now i really like\u00a0\u00a0 how it's integrated right now but let me know in\u00a0\nthe comments down below what you think do you want\u00a0\u00a0 more of the ai or do you think as it is now is\u00a0\npretty good because i know a lot of people were\u00a0\u00a0 really iffy about that in terms of the animation\u00a0\nbecause i know there are some people pointing\u00a0\u00a0 out similarities um before today at least with\u00a0\nthe teaser of s was video and kda music videos\u00a0\u00a0 i've seen some similarities going around on tik\u00a0\ntok you know certain like animation similarities\u00a0\u00a0 i'll try to pop some up on the screen but\u00a0\njust know like i don't know kda that well\u00a0\u00a0 i don't know which music videos these are from i\u00a0\nactually heard my first kda song yesterday i heard\u00a0\u00a0 more and i think i'm going to add it to my end\u00a0\nof the month review even though it was the end\u00a0\u00a0 of october but you know and lastly we also have\u00a0\na lot of people who are pointing out that the ai\u00a0\u00a0 members specifically look like some blackpink\u00a0\nmembers so this ai member looks like lisa\u00a0\u00a0 and then this i remember looks like rosie so i\u00a0\ndefinitely love to know what you think about that\u00a0\u00a0 do you think it's a little bit of a stretch do\u00a0\nyou think it's just maybe like a specific hair\u00a0\u00a0 color and a specific outfit more than anything\u00a0\nelse let me know in the comments down below\u00a0\u00a0 moving on to the choreography i thought it was\u00a0\nreally interesting i love this move where they\u00a0\u00a0 kind of crouched down onto one leg and then you\u00a0\nknow kind of move their weight to the other leg\u00a0\u00a0 i love that move for whatever reason like just in\u00a0\ngeneral plopping down like that i don't know why\u00a0\u00a0 there's also this move that i have titled the\u00a0\nflamingo where they kind of move to the side\u00a0\u00a0 while doing little little stops and i've\u00a0\nseen girls generation do this a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 so a little sm take back i've seen it and catch\u00a0\nme if you can but i remember it in other girls\u00a0\u00a0 generation choreographies if it comes to your\u00a0\nhead please leave it in the comments down below\u00a0\u00a0 lastly for choreography they do this move that\u00a0\nkind of represents a snake which i thought was\u00a0\u00a0 interesting but can you imagine back to the black\u00a0\npalm caucus you can you imagine how to represent a\u00a0\u00a0 black palm cockatoo, just them pretending to yell\u00a0\nat each other and causing headaches it's a mess so\u00a0\u00a0 in terms of styling i'm gonna go ahead and say it\u00a0\ni feel like there are definitely some second done\u00a0\u00a0 elements within this and here's why not only is it\u00a0\nquite busy a little bit zimzalabim-esque in nature\u00a0\u00a0 but you know keep in mind zimzalabim i feel was\u00a0\na little bit of a throwback to second gen but\u00a0\u00a0 back in the day i feel like idols were a lot of\u00a0\nthings that could easily be made at home right\u00a0\u00a0 very extra accessories that you could kind\u00a0\nof make on your own and trust me i did so\u00a0\u00a0 what i'm seeing with aespa like little elements\u00a0\nhere and there where it's like i think i could\u00a0\u00a0 make that i think i could get the materials to\u00a0\nmake that myself which adds a little bit of a\u00a0\u00a0 personalized element which makes it fun for people\u00a0\nif they ever did want to recreate the look right\u00a0\u00a0 it's fun to recreate kind of quote-unquote normal\u00a0\noutfits but it's even more fun to make something\u00a0\u00a0 that seems more personalized right you see this\u00a0\nscene with ning-ning and she has these glasses\u00a0\u00a0 but there's like pearls on them and little\u00a0\naccessories hanging from the glasses and i thought\u00a0\u00a0 it could be really cool i don't know just for me i\u00a0\nthought that was a cool element and of course the\u00a0\u00a0 styling is just top notch it's just everything\u00a0\ni also think they do a really interesting\u00a0\u00a0 mix of bright styling with kind of a darker\u00a0\nconcept right because i feel like their whole\u00a0\u00a0 universe is more of like a dark purple theme but\u00a0\ntheir styling is definitely more bright more like\u00a0\u00a0 bubble gum if you will and then sometimes it's\u00a0\nelegant and then sometimes it's just plain fun so\u00a0\u00a0 i think they do a really good job at mixing all of\u00a0\nthose elements together to create a unique style\u00a0\u00a0 so now we're gonna end off this video with my\u00a0\nthoughts on the song if you want like a proper\u00a0\u00a0 review you're gonna have to wait to my end of the\u00a0\nmonth review but i'll tell you a little bit about\u00a0\u00a0 what i think i've heard some people say that this\u00a0\ndoesn't sound like an sm song that they get more\u00a0\u00a0 yg vibes from this and i can't entirely say that\u00a0\ni agree like i'm not getting a lot of sm vibes but\u00a0\u00a0 i'm also not getting super yg vibes it feels like\u00a0\nan overall new sound like i can't really picture\u00a0\u00a0 yg artists singing this but i also can't really\u00a0\npicture some artists singing this admittedly i\u00a0\u00a0 get like the slightest girls generation mr mr\u00a0\nvibes but overall surprisingly i'm getting more\u00a0\u00a0 kda vibes because i heard more and then i heard\u00a0\nblack mamba and i feel like they're kind of on\u00a0\u00a0 the same wavelength but i asked you guys on my\u00a0\ncommunity to have what you thought of black pop\u00a0\u00a0 and then i asked you guys over on my instagram if\u00a0\nyou could even see my community tab because i had\u00a0\u00a0 some people telling me about they just like\u00a0\nthey couldn't see it so i don't know what's\u00a0\u00a0 going on i think youtube blocked my post you know\u00a0\nmaybe i deserve it i don't [ __ ] know so overall\u00a0\u00a0 i wasn't entirely able to get a consensus\u00a0\nof what people were thinking of this song\u00a0\u00a0 but i do see a lot of comments saying that the\u00a0\nvisuals are absolutely stunning but that they're\u00a0\u00a0 a little bit underwhelmed with the song and i'll\u00a0\nget more into that at my end of the route that's\u00a0\u00a0 so shitty of me in terms of it being underwhelming\u00a0\ni can kind of see where you guys are coming from\u00a0\u00a0 it seems to stay similar within the entirety of\u00a0\nthe song there's not a lot of differences they\u00a0\u00a0 have a certain expectation when it comes\u00a0\nto some songs and because this doesn't\u00a0\u00a0 entirely seem like an sm song i think it throws\u00a0\nsome people off i mean we do get like the chanting\u00a0\u00a0 in unison chorus so that seems very sm but i\u00a0\nreally am not getting the teddy vibes people\u00a0\u00a0 are saying it has a teddy chorus i just don't\u00a0\nfeel like teddy would go there paired with\u00a0\u00a0 people who are saying that it sounds a little\u00a0\nbit underwhelming there are also people who are\u00a0\u00a0 attributing this to the fact that the song might\u00a0\nhave been rushed you know essa might have rushed\u00a0\u00a0 this to make people forget about certain scandals\u00a0\nand now i definitely covered this in my own video\u00a0\u00a0 however i don't know if you guys remember but i\u00a0\ndid calculate the amount of time it took for sm\u00a0\u00a0 to announce that exo was going to debut and then\u00a0\nwhen exo actually debuted which was around i think\u00a0\u00a0 three months and then compared that to red velvet\u00a0\nwhich was you know less than a week and then even\u00a0\u00a0 nct which was less than a week so i think if\u00a0\nwe compare it to you know red velvet and nct\u00a0\u00a0 espa did actually have a really long time\u00a0\nbetween when they were announced to be debuted\u00a0\u00a0 and then when they actually did debut so i'm\u00a0\nnot too sure how accurate that statement is i\u00a0\u00a0 did personally think that they were announced a\u00a0\nlittle bit prematurely but overall i don't think\u00a0\u00a0 it was really rushed but you can let me know what\u00a0\nyou think about that in the comments below as well\u00a0\u00a0 so yeah that is basically it for this video\u00a0\nthank you so much if you made it to this point\u00a0\u00a0 if you did you might as well subscribe\u00a0\nbefore i close my

stars you know i went to berkeley high i'm always with a cup of bourbon i'm in here choosing you up here searching here you welcome everybody it's me ben and welcome back to a brand new video today y'all the espa girls are finally debuting with black mamba the music video excited to hop into this one i do believe it's just a single of course so that means we won't be reacting to anything extra over on patreon when they do inevitably drop an album though you already know we'll be reacting to that over on patreon because that's where we do all of our album reviews but in the meantime ladies and gents if you want to see more esper reactions from me in the future be sure to hit that subscribe button for your boy one time because let's be real at this point i'm already at a point i don't even know these girls names yet at least individually um but i already know for a fact and i'm gonna be back reacting to them again in the future um there's been a lot of debate so far um regarding their debut i have sort of sat on the sidelines of that and just sort of chosen to wait and see what happens and i'm really excited for this the teasers have looked awesome i think the girls seem super talented so all signs are pointing towards one of the most significant debuts this whole year that's across boy groups and girl groups so we're gonna get straight to it welcome back to the channel y'all espa black mamba should we just click play and hope that sm doesn't block this one looking at usm let's get to it black bamba aspa music video let's do this thing three two one click play oh colors off the bat are crazy damn y'all are so gorgeous how in the world am i gonna find a bias with y'all [Music] that crazy amount of flour is that quick already kind of feeding into the i was gonna use like a better word but it's y'all are zoomers bro the video is already so all over the place you could watch this back 50 million times and find something new every time [Music] with the drum it's a claps choreo is crazy too hmm i like chorus so far ah that sort of chanting effect is great [Music] interesting i love that scene so much there's the snake goodness gracious oh my gosh her voice is incredible i love that move so much the i just realized if we get and the wink don't get it twisted if we get a s but the stage like sm normally tends to do with their groups i'm gonna be dumb hyped because i'm trying to see the choreo as uncut as we can possibly get obviously if we get a dance practice too i'll probably end up reacting to that [Music] yes that yellow dress dude my eyes are like watering like crying i need to relax bro those purple pants were so cool i'm trying to get me a pair of those for crying out loud [Music] wow okay that scared the absolute i don't i don't i don't love snakes okay i don't love snakes they're better for me than spiders i'm just glad this wasn't like a this music video wasn't called tarantula or something because it would have been over for me look that was good though because it was a dope transition and it scared the out of me props to y'all i i'm not gonna rewind on that though we're not we're not doing that we're only halfway through the music video i really hope they don't do something like that again the visuals i'm not really sure what was going on there but that had my attention like nothing else in the world was even happening and now all the scenes are switched up though bro after that there's like no those same colors are gone the flowers are gone in the train [Music] and okay so now they're implementing the um i don't even know what to call it avatars i don't know interesting those vocals are crazy oh [Music] god damn [Music] i love that part the chanting part is easily one of my favorite bits of the entire song not just the chorus itself but there's going to be a lot to talk about here though there's going to be a lot to talk about oh so are they teasing the next one or is this still part of the same one so those aren't heart things though those are like heartbroken things that's dude okay that is espos debut with black bomba and i have a lot to talk about they're not even she's not even done yet okay once again i i don't know what's going on look y'all this is one of those times y'all gotta get in these damn comments and y'all gonna be talking to me because if i get to the next music video that they drop and i miss something in that one and it's because y'all are like why didn't you notice this it was just like this in the last music video it's probably because y'all didn't help me out in the comments leave me a comment let me know what's going on let's talk about this overall music video ridiculous visually speaking one of my absolute favorite music videos that's dropped this entire year once again really going to need to be paying attention to choreo opportunities um in the future like i said hoping for a version of black mamba the stage also very much hoping for a dance practice so sm if you disappoint me i will be disappointed needless to say um the main thing for me about this song i like it good song good debut song shows off the girls talents they really get to use their voice as well however i'm curious to see how i enjoy the song without listening to the music video is this something that i'm going to be able to put on a playlist and just vibe to the answer is probably yes the answer is probably yes but this happened with another group that debuted recently um and while i was listening to their album over on patreon i was talking about this i don't need to single them out of course because this isn't the first time this has happened to me before but for me um and the reason i got into k-pop in the first place is the listenability of the songs the amount of times i can play something back and still love it and love it if not even find a new way to enjoy it right sometimes the effect of the music video or a live stage is so great that when you listen to the song on its own it doesn't feel the same and i'm scared not scared but i'm concerned that with espa that might end up being a thing in the future um is the music video so incredible that it makes it feel weird when i'm not watching it can i listen to the song and still enjoy it without seeing the music video with it now this is all very weird because i'm a weird guy i like being able to listen to music without visuals sometimes right um and i'm worried that maybe there's so much effort put into the extra bits and pieces of visuals that i might not be able to you know what i mean it's a very mini to school level concern and now that i'm describing it a lot of y'all are probably gonna get in the comments and say okay ben but we don't care about that so you know whatever um and that's fine you don't i'm not saying that you have to i'm just saying from my point of view the listenability of the song is really important and do i really remember most of the song at the moment no i remember a lot of visuals i remember the girls really well and i remember the visuals of the music video um obviously the snake biting us but how much of the song do i remember off first listen really just sort of the chance so i'm gonna have to go back and listen to it often uh multiple times through today as i've got time but overall review from me is it a very positive one absolutely enjoyed this 10 out of 10. absolutely one of my favorite debuts this whole year but i want to make sure y'all know that i am a little concerned in the future potentially and it might not potentially go as well as this from what i'm seeing because there was a lot going on in this music video i think we can all agree on that right that's it for me thank you all for watching the video like i said y'all be sure to hit that subscribe button for your boy one time because anytime the espo girls breathe we're going to be reacting to it over here on the channel thank you for watching be sure to stream this music video help the espa girls out um like i said hopefully this one isn't blocked by sm like some of the last ones have been um and if it is then we'll figure it out but thank you for watching love y'all very much until next time peace bye", "dDEjgF3AjeM": " Hi Portugal ! Hello everyone, I hope you're doing great and welcome in this new video ! So in this video we're going to talk about Portugal, who organized like every year its national selection And the winner is the group The Black Mamba with the song \"Love is on my side\" and little fun fact : this song managed to win even if it wasn't the televote first choice,  nor the jury's one Then I have to admit that the \"Festival de cancao\" is not a selection that I enjoy very much There's not a lot of diversity, there's a lot of ballads, and by the way Portugal often send ballads to Eurovision So I really hope they're going to give something different with The Black Mamba Well let's discover that now, I'm going to watch the finale live performance of \"Love is on my side\" by Black Mamba. Here we go   ok... the intro reminds me a bit of Disney   Is it going to be a ballad again ?   But he has an interesting voice   I don't really like the black and white filter   I don't really see the point And the chorus is a bit repetitive I must say   Ah ! No more black and white filter ! Good !   It's pleasing but... It doesn't feel modern, there's a lack of exciting moment   okayyy So without any surprise, Portugal is sending a ballad again ! It's cute but.. it's very classical It's well done, but it feels like one of those songs we already listened to a thousand times in Eurovision  It needs more modern and original elements to it But yeah I can't say otherwise, I kind of enjoyed it, but do I think it will be enough to go to the Eurovision finale ?  no I don't think so Then, as you may have noticed, I love hearing other languages in Eurovision, ans so I'm a bit disappointed here In the portuguese selection there were many songs in portuguese so... that's really too bad And if you wonder, my favorite was actually Garziella with \"Avida sem ...Acontecer\"... I don't know how to spell it  I found this music really cinematic, it was in portuguese, it felt modern but with a retro touch with the synth I liked it, it wasn't amazing but I liked it... but anyway she wasn't even selected for the portuguese finale So this were my thought on Portugal for Eurovision 2021 Thanks for watching the video, I hope you enjoyed it anf if so please put a thumbs up and subscribe if it's not done yet we'll meet very soon for new videos, and until then I send you lots of kisses ! ciao !   Oh I'm going to make this video in 1 shot, unbelievable !", "uJN8-v700As": "so pretty much so yeah six so so so so this is yes so yes so is so people we just arrived at the spot and the place looks a little bit different than we expected i guess this mamba is in a beautiful residence area so very different area from a simple village from where we rescue the asha spitting cobra so let's see how it looks like this place is really amazing beautiful ocean swimming pool and yeah this is the reality in africa and these are some countries you can have [Music] we got it okay wow she is long holding holding it wow very cool if you don't feel comfortable just it's a strong snake very cool very cool so i was trying to explain to the guys about this snake this snake is very poison and this is called black male but it's not black it's called black mama because of the mouth things like i replied yeah so tell them if they see one like this always they need to give away because the snake which bites you you take us your time we can bring the water from the car i can go there a little bit yeah [Music] this so it can go out yeah you don't like it cool now we see the the black mouth oh so nicely that's why it is called black mamba is okay let's see how bio can does hold it like this okay do that then let the guys to put the snake in um foreign okay cool very cool thank you very much we are happy to find the black mamba to have the chance to film it thank you thank you for not killing it letting us know um you", "qHxCUrhW7Tc": "[Music] [Applause] bambamba [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

name is jordan orm i'm a professional film editor and i've been able to edit some awesome music videos for artists like justin bieber post malone roddy rich tyga kelani swaylee megan the stallion and so many others welcome back to another episode of music video editor reacts where i react to music videos from a music video editor perspective that's me alright we got a new sm entertainment girl group that's the first time since 2014 that sm has come out with a new girl group we got four members so far they're called espa i believe they have a debut single black mamba very excited to get into it and see what see what we got cooking on the sm girl side let's freaking go oh that clear frame hey i like how we just start on nothing pull out the colors that synthase all right let's talk about the production design right now let's i know we're talking about editing but who made this room looks like there's freaking play-doh and silly string all over the place a lava lamp random-ish go off production designer i see you love cutting on that yeah [Music] okay what's going on here what's going on here okay we you know you freaking know we gotta look at the theories okay so espa stands for what does it stand for hold on i gotta look it up the group names espa is a combination of ae composed of the english initials of avatar and experience plus the english word aspect meaning two sides which symbolizes meeting another self and experiencing a new world so it's like we got a virtual version in a real world version of the band's members and they're like talking to the virtual version in this song [Music] they're just like talking to themselves it says black mamba would like to share a photo what is black mamba what does that mean kobe rest in peace my friend apparently black mamba is a snake but why is black mama sending a photo to and then it looks like she enters this virtual world so like she was in reality and then she like accepts the airdrop and we're in the avatar experience this is getting [Music] that was hard oh we got some sick editing we're only 30 seconds in this is gonna be a long video okay so here we go a turbulent displace effect everybody say it with me turbulent displacement okay so we cut out the foreground here so she's not affected and then the background gets like that with the turbulent displacement effect and then at the end of it we have almost like a fake pixel sorting effect where we kind of glitch streaks across the screen and we do that to blend it into the next shot so we're always as editors trying to make the video feel seamless and try to blend all the shots together so we have that effect right before we cut to the next shot which also has that effect on it for a second and it freaking feels so nice okay the editor just popped off right there typing screen stuff it's like frick the editors were like bro how much editing do you want in this video and espo is just like yes look at all these little vfx screen elements they had to make and made it like so colorful and like this is like a pc that never had a firewall watch how cutting fits to the way that the lyrics feel in the rhythms i can watch that all day it's like every single word there's a new shot and it just flows so well and then transition it's so good i know a freaking nerf gun when i see one this is this nerf gun right here i had this when i was 12 and i won't hesitate they used vfx and made it look really sick so good job oh camera move oh that match cut the screen overlays [Music] i need a break y'all knew you were gonna be in for a ride because you've seen the video and you're like bro there's a lot of editing in this jordan good luck and one thing that i like to note about 2d animations mixed with 3d is the frame rate is half the speed as the video so if the video is normally 24 frames per second the animation is going to be 12 frames per second now vfx snake okay here we got the butterfly so if i go frame by frame you'll see we skip one it freezes so like every two frames it moves and that really helps give the the 2d animation feel because it usually has a lower frame rate because then they have to draw half as many half as many images when they're drawing it because they have to hand draw those animations like back in the back in the old times they were like this is too many pictures i mean we just like put the frame rate in half and save my hand from carpal tunnel [Music] [Music] that was cool did you see that dolly zoom so a dolly zoom is when you're zooming the lens in and then you're dollying which is moving the camera so if you're moving the camera and the lens at the same time it creates that like effect like jaws when the dude like sees the shark for the first time like a dolly zoom on him and just like oh frick and then on the break on the whoa she just goes to dark and just like if that camera move with the darkness that lighting change just fits perfectly with the producer got that drum thing here [Music] i see choreo matching the lyrics 3d graphics just like bring so much to the to the video so we have animation here but we put the animation in 3d space so we have this depth in the frame it's just like feels like these are closer to us and these are farther away would have been difficult but it would have been better if like for example this frame was like behind her feather instead of on top of it and then that would make the illusion work perfectly because it looks like in the animation that this little box would be behind her head instead of like in front of it [Music] oh is that what it's like to get eaten by a snake i think i'm okay i think i think i'm okay that's the exact same camera move they did before and match cut okay i don't know what this means it's like the mamba queen is taking her soul so we got these like evil snake hands she has a snake necklace what's going on here what is the black mamba mean somebody in the comments let me know because this envy is confusing all i really get so far is that there's two versions of themselves they're talking to themselves they're like i'm obsessed with you like their online version you know how we are all obsessed with our social media images instead of our real image i think that's a pretty relevant topic but what is this editing wise i love how we have this like sound so when it gets loud editing gets more chaotic and we have this like color effect which is really cool kind of looks like this i'll do it to my face here what that does is just heads at some visual chaos during the audio chaos and it matches and it helps us cut between shots because there's this flashing and our eye is distracted so the shots blend together seamlessly those two shots just blend together nicely and we have all these speed ramps freaking smoke and speed ramps is like if you ever have smoke in your shot use freaking speed ramps because it looks delicious it looks absolutely scrumptious okay how many of y'all were just like right when they dropped down there and the reason the reason this is so good is we have complete silence before the beat drops it's all in the sound y'all that's why it felt so impactful [Music] that's the way to do it i have a uh a music teacher that calls this the vacuum of sound once you have literally nothing whatever follows next is gonna feel so much more impactful because there was all that contrast that contrast creates focus y'all nothing and then something just makes that something feel way way way cooler oh this dancing scene is hard what was that what was that venom some green juice that just went on the plants like under a black light and then she like looks back like she just like spat on the plants or something she's just like maybe she's the mamba maybe i maybe i'm the mamba [Music] [Applause] oh she was looking at herself in the mirror but her reflection doesn't match she's literally talking to her avatar so we got winter and then i think this one says espo winter she's she's dming herself what's up jordan how are you doing today oh thanks jordan man i'm having a great day making a reaction no way what are you reacting to espe mamba is pretty cool you know [Music] dang all the glitches it's literally an animated version of herself this is kda-ish right here okay vocals so they probably had to shoot this in a certain way where they either had to create this whole background from scratch or they would just chill right here have her be out of the frame take a shot have her walk in the frame sit down so they could have this plate for vfx so they didn't have to like comp her out because she would actually be in the reflection on this shot [Music] bro this animation is so intense oh the spin [Music] you don't have to do me like that you just punch me in the face is there a mark am i okay and i love this just this glitching to go from the main character to the animated character we do have this this glitching where we just kind of basically draw out little boxes and then go into the new shot and she just and then we have some pixel sorting up here little glitches like bro look at her arm too it's like breaking the sound barrier right here just like that's how fast she punched us the speed ramps dancing speed ramps just turn me on they literally turn watch this [Music] oh my gosh you can't do that to me the visuals on this is next level i love dancing speed ramps bro [Music] and one more thing bro they had to add like these little these little pixely what is it atmospheric elements in front of the frame so like right here you can see like these little streaks going by because it's like there's like little orbs floating in the air and i love that little detail on the side camera movement we get him streaking across and then when we go to the front shot we have them just like coming at us and it really feels like there are just magical orbs floating in this avatar experience world [Music] oh oh okay i can tell you right now how to do this this is pretty easy so basically you'll mask out this area and then you go to the mosaic effect and you just throw the mosaic on and i mean the color effects here are super cool too because we literally have black purple green and blue and those are the only colors in the frame and it's all like crunchy and anyway you add the mosaic effect and it turns it into pixels and squares looks so cool i love how every single effect that we have too has a little sound effect with it so like listen like every single little animation also has a sound so if you want to take your work to the next level match little things little animations with two sounds in the music or add whooshes add sound effects to match your animations either way sound needs to match the visual to make the experience feel very very much exciting look at all these things bro this is such a cool aesthetic why are their hearts broken hey guys i'm really sad i have so many questions after this this is such an interesting debut wow well thanks so much for coming on that insane journey with me if you'd like to watch some of my other videos they're super great check them out lots of kpop lots of american music videos this one reminded me of like black pink kda itsy all like mixed together and i'm really excited for this group sm is kind of filling in a gap that a lot of other entertainment companies have and that's pretty cool whatever you're doing stop get up out your seat and join me for a little bit of [Music] come on somebody thanks for watching have a great day jesus

there was a dance practice that cut drops this week because i already did the cake choreo one because i didn't know and we know that sm does not really do dance practices for their girl groups so that's why i just ended up you know doing the k-chorio one but you guys did mention that there was a lot of complications there too like ning-ning's shoes were unzipped some of you guys didn't mention that they were probably also very nervous because it was their first performance there's some sort of like mental block in a way because if you're dancing and your shoes are unzipped that's gonna  up with your mind if you're if this is your first performance if it's your debut totally nerves are gonna be there it's because we care and it's a it's mixed in with anxiety with like wanting to do it disguised as being nervous sometimes and it happens to a lot of performers they get nervous and then they they don't get to do their best that's why i love dance practices because there's nothing distracting you i might not do a big analysis on this it might just be kind of like a reaction and then also seeing the differences between the stage version and the dance practice version okay let's go this is actually iconic that they have a girl group dance practice in this in this room i've never seen a girl grip in this room nice see it's already so good without the heels like i mean it's it was great for the heels too but like that walk without the heels this is amazing the way ning is killing that footwork [Music] i like how she did that better on the stage though [Music] nice okay yeah there i see the difference so in in my k choreo reaction they were a little bit not leveled um karina went lower than ning ning and i'm guessing because of what was happening with kneading shoes but here they went down we saw what it's supposed to look like like [Music] look how low they go that part look at that oh and winter that was a lot better too that is just it's so synchronized it's so satisfying this is actually quite iconic now too that move [Applause] this is gisele am i mixing gisella in the winter up [Music] yeah it's a lot better execution [Music] she does it so well every time this end the cake horio [Music] yeah it's just a lot more comfortable oh she ate that up wait i want to watch that again i'm sorry if you guys are wanting more analysis look at my korea one but like look how she comes in boom ah the levels that is so synchronized this thing the the arm thing all right hold on like look the way it just went like that i love it it's a lot more synchronized here and it's just a like higher energy that body line though she's amazing is this gisele [Music] she is doing a lot better here [Music] beautiful body line holy [Music] okay this is the part where i wanted them to do to go harder on the k choreo yeah even just with that it's just better energy that turn [Music] yeah yeah yeah guys this is why i prefer dance practices i love seeing people dance and and sing and rap at the same time with glamorous outfits huge stages but if i'm gonna look at the cardio there's no better way to look than a dance practice there's no distraction there's no distracting shoes there's no short shorts there's no mic issues they don't have to sing and wrap at the same time so all of their energy is in the dancing so this is the best way for us to kind of look at the choreo and see the differences but i'm glad that they came up with this because i think it's important that people see how good these girls are with the dancing here i can see a little bit

championships the league and vp honors the list goes on and on and on but no one remembers him more than the los angeles lakers family and as this franchise gets set to capture yet another nba championship make no mistake about it they've got kobe bryant on their mind all the time scoop jackson tells us how much that is true [Music] somehow he's still here his presence is so so kobe omnipresent necessary fabriced into everything this lakers team is about the black mom of jersey means a timely moment of aspiration inspiration taking what we love to do and truly having a drive and a passion to be our ultimate best in 2017 nike pitched kobe on concepts for the lakers city edition jersey but he had his own idea mamba snakeskin kobe was the creative director on the project he wanted to bring to fruition more of the mamba mentality so that was our objective to bring that through in the sense of a uniform that mamba mentality has been woven into the spirit of this team through this journey anthony davis has wanted for the lakers when we put those jerseys on we for sure play with the extra energy and effort because we know that we can't lose in those jerseys if we lose no jersey we just feel like we letting him down throughout this bubble soldier kobe's impact became inescapable all unified in the spirit he left behind the words the lakers speak come from a place deeper than the heart their own personal purpose of turning tragedy into mastery so in the words of kobe bryant mamba out but in the words of us not forgotten live on brother in this lives matter moment there's something about wearing the color black it sometimes takes on a different significance now [Music] for the lakers it became almost spiritual losing no longer an option dignity and pride translated into effort everything kobe stood for it came through in the design [Music] all we can do is truly honor that legacy remember him respect him make his uniform live forever [Music] they found a way to bond with him in a way they probably never would have where he's still here with us kobe gave them something greater to tap into an extended motive something no other team had at their disposal we try to go out every night especially when we're those jerseys and compete to the highest level how that mama mentality that we speak about because we know that he's watching over us for us to honor him um being on the floor um this is what it's all about and uh you know we're thinking about uh the bryant family they're with us we're with you guys uh we love you guys and hopefully we make them proud a unique emotional tearful transformative journey of a group of men and a jersey becoming one", "J2evJ1VI5RA": "[Music] so [Music] [Music] what's good yo we back rt tv gang gang

of groups that we did get to experience day debuts like t by t g idol and now today guess who joins the group so we can say they're part of the uh alumni of our debut yeah exactly yeah and it's an honor to have you guys we honestly don't know anything about them at all yeah we might be even saying their name wrong right yo i was thinking the same thing i looked it up on wikipedia and it says the pronunciation is is super yeah which is like soup and uh creole i believe in spanish i'll let you guys know prior to going in they are part of sm salutes us and they have four members number one is is karina giselle winter i like that name winter yeah i actually take that name from my daughter winter though i am going to take that don't steal it and take some of them yeah there's a lot of summoners they're friends [Music] [Music] that's how you say that last one but we're just gonna get right into it black mamba shout out to kobe we don't know we don't know if this is why they named it but this is a great title of your first debut ladies we can't wait for this experience if you guys watch this we hope that all you guys succeed we wish that you guys have a great time and have fun and we can't wait to get into this journey with you guys so let's get right into it guys espa black mamba let's get it oh they're colorful danger the danger zone it's so futuristic yeah even their swag is super futuristic it's like z uh xenon yes oh that gun was fire that camera work is lit this b is very different yeah you can tell they're looking into the future with everything the production sound and all the data group of the 2020s [Music] i like all the trucks i like all this that's cgi bro i like now this is probably my favorite scene of it yeah yo i don't know why but this beat is giving me like fierce runway vibes it gives me kanye like yeah yeah um from um real friends i think that's the song i'm thinking about you know it's just crazy it's like it kind of like i could picture like graduation kanye coming on this and spitting a quick verse and i i like the futuristic look of the video like that i think that's the thing i like that they're taking us into the new generations like yo we're the girls of the future like where the this is we're going to be when the world looks like this we're going to be what is going to be popping and we're going to we're ready taking you there for my debut like let's go there right now we time traveling already money it's a greatness i [ __ ] with it let's go let's get back into it baby ah oh [ __ ] i'm really in her eyes whoa oh [ __ ] like the black doll i'm scared was that the devil yeah just no you guys put into a heck so you don't even know it what the [ __ ] yeah that was scary what the hell just happened that was creepy i got cursed yeah yeah the video got like a darker tone oh [ __ ] yo one of them reminds me of that girl from um uh death note me somehow one scene though that was cool she looks very anime like right there too you didn't see how they animated themselves yeah in the mirror that scene is fire bro oh my god oh don't see that bro that scene one of them looks like misa miso in that scene [Music] pete colby oh this looks like a level in a video game [ __ ] that's fire like a video game [ __ ] you it's a video game secret ending hmm wow i wonder what they were talking about yeah because you see how it wasn't likes it was dislikes because like the hearts was actually ripped in half so it's kind of interesting oh what the [ __ ] this is the music and visuals to be continued i like i like the futuristic vibe that we got from the video they did their thing with the cgi it was kind of like watching a video game within a music video and i like how it went like from light to dark like we got like a light kind of vibrant mood in the beginning of the video and then when we saw the little creepy thing when it went into the dark everything started the everything started to get a little bit darker you saw that they were dancing like in that little forest where it was like red and black and then the train was kind of like was kind of spooky they had like a whole bunch of vines in the train we saw the slime and what pat said venom we saw the venom come out of nowhere in the strain in the train so on so far so i like i like the um i like what they did with that and even like the secret ending at the end where the dude came up from the floor like to signify to be continued there's more to come i think i was one of the girls right there that came from the floor was it yeah it could look like the hair you didn't see the hair that came back like that it looked like the hair was shorter though like way shorter maybe it's like a fifth member in the future or something like that that would be a crazy and i i like the debut i like how they really made a statement like they made show when we seen this video we're gonna remember like it was things in this video i didn't see anywhere else and i think fellas we have to give respect where respect is due because we always give credit to yg we always give credit to big hit and sm they be killing it like they gave us exo they gave us red velvet girl generation and it's like super junior they made that super group like it's a lot of great artists they haven't to have a debut like this is like their powerhouse label too and like they make a lot of noise in the industry and we really love uh reviewing our content we love sm and we love that the fact that you are always giving artists new opportunity to shine and each group is different no group is uh the same and red velvet red velvet and exo to rt tv are straight oh geez like to us we give them like we bow down like all that like data triple g's and the fact that uh sm could keep doing this again you guys are definitely like a motown definitely like these big labels in the western and keep doing our thing rttv supports and we're giving the cosign to these ladies yeah now i'm glad you brought that up because it might like because um there was one moment remind me of um i don't know if you guys remember that video where we watch of exos like wolf where it was like that was having choreography yeah i remember that yeah it was like a very futuristic and i like i like the fact that we had this right here because this is like honestly i feel like sm and and as a hyper announcer a super i espa like they really set themselves up for like the next decade and beyond bro like the cgi dolls in this bro it was like they used cgi in multiple ways it wasn't as if they specified in a certain type of animation that they was going to work with like they had one that was like a living avatar would kind of remind me of that battle um battle angel and stuff like that movie yeah and then it was moments that they had like the the black mamba that was in a whole different animation and like in that whole ending where it was like a venom type woman or a guy or girl whatever we couldn't really see because it was covered in slime that was a whole different cgi level so they really set themselves up to have like movie type quality music videos yeah crazy and i feel you on that because i was thinking about that i was like this is a great way to introduce a group to the world because i feel like um now we're not only being introduced to the group or like what they come with like the kind of things they're into like cgi cartoons you know what i'm saying like they're setting everything in this video was so different where it's like you don't know what to expect from this group even at the end like there's so much things that you could probably break down from this video like at the end why did that creepy thing come out the floor like why are there like hard like they were supposed to like like it dislike it like your theory you know i'm saying like there's so many things and like i still don't understand um the black mamba like not look you know what i'm saying i don't understand like still like they'll swallow you whole whatever blah blah so i don't know it seemed like there's like dark this darkness that's chasing after them and i don't know it makes me very curious about this new group espo yeah i had to like i like i was thinking about it i was like it was kind of as if like moments where it was like technology was the black mambo or like because you know it's like it was as definitely those moments like the technology was taking over remember that room that yeah you guys like what was mad computers she was shaking up the computers it seemed like the computers was in control and at the end where it's like it seemed like it was a cyber person that came from the ground and it was like maybe the dislikes was just like humans disliking that technology was getting ready to take over so all the little things that the black slime thing it could have been like how um what's that movie uh damn elita battle angel nah that's not i was thinking about um the the movie is iron man with that that's uh what they call the computer that takes over elect is e damn ultron oh ultron oh it's like that like it's like the movie is iron man i'm like what is he talking about like that the movie the movie is iron man where the robot takes over what i'm saying so we thank you guys so much and shout out to us from the label you

shack where a family with four children\nhas been sharing a small room with a huge black mamba. Mambas in confined\nspaces are a death trap. And it gets a whole\nlot worse when you can't see what you're doing. [dog barks] OK, so we arrive. The lady quickly takes us around\nthe back to some outbuildings. And she says, in there. You see it, yeah? Where is it? OK. We'll just jump in there. Let me look.\n- It's dark. Ooh, OK, very dark. Is there any lights? Have you got any lights? Yeah, rather don't\ngo in there unless we-- So you come out. In another\n[inaudible] not moved. Now someone's watching.\nAre you in there? I say there's someone\nelse in there. Have you got any lights? It's pitch dark in here. How did they even see the mamba? OK, right-- so it's going\nto be quite tight in there. Is there light? OK, best thing to\ndo-- if you come out-- Oh, he has your light on it. [inaudible]? I get a glimpse of it. [snake hisses] Black mamba looking\nstraight at me. It'll be OK. Bless you. This lady is\nactually quite brave. She sat there waiting\nfor us until we got there, shining a cell\nphone torch on the black mamba. I don't think she actually\nknows what that snake is. Now, this is great for us so\nwe can see where the snake is. But she has put herself\nin some serious danger. SIMON: This black mamba\nis trapped and nervous. It will strike repeatedly\ngiven the chance. Its fast acting venom can kill\na grown man in 20 minutes. A bite like that to a child\nis almost certain death. - I know--\n- It's going already. I don't know where it's going. I can't see. Where is it?\nI don't [inaudible]. Where is it? In that corner it was. But I just heard it move. Oh, shoot. Where is it going? It's going down the back there. Wait. That thing's going to go. SIOUXIE: Can you see it?\n- You have two seconds. Yes, right there. Problem is I don't\nknow where his head is. [inaudible] If I start moving\nstuff, he's going to go. So there's not room\nfor both of us. Do you want me to deal with it,\nand you just hold the torch? I'll keep that [inaudible]. It's not very good\nposition at all. Well, the head's\ncoming up, actually. Oh, his head's up there. Yeah. OK. Slowly. It's real pity is there. Because I can't actually-- can't actually get the\ntongs in on it at all. I'll try and go between his gap. That's not really\ngoing to help too much. If I start moving things around,\nthis thing's going to go. Introduce so slowly. If this mamba goes on the\nmove, we're all in the way, so we're all in trouble. Hey, don't start banging\nthe doors there, guys. This snake is in a\nreally crap position. I can't get any tongs\nin there or nothing. All right, you stay there. Trying to move these golf\nclubs out of the way. Sometimes I get in some\nright tight positions, and you can't get in there. Stay there. Thanks. This snake can easily lunge\nat me, biting me twice before I can even move my hand. I'll feel the effects\nof the neurotoxic venom almost immediately. Without treatment, my\nlungs will collapse and my heart will stop. And if I die, who's going\nto catch this massive mamba? He probably knows an escape\nroute better than we do. I'm worried if I mess up, but\ndon't get it the first time, it's going to\ndisappear into this hut or outside of this hut. And then we've lost it. And there's a good chance\nthis snake might come back, because they're habitual. They come back to\nthe same place. This mamba may have been living\nwith this family for weeks. It's a miracle\nnobody's been bitten. SIOUXIE: To the left of\nthat beam is snake as well. I can't move.\nI can't move. I know you can't.\nI'm just telling you. He's both sides. Yeah, I think I'm going to just\ntry and get the tongs on it and then all hell is\ngoing to break loose. OK, here goes. [inaudible] OK, now, here we go. I don't know where I've\ngot it or anything. As I get tongs on it,\nmore and more snake bulges out of the dark. And I'm thinking\nthis thing is long. It can easily nail me. Where's his head? Keep that torch on me, Sioux. I don't fancy getting bitten. What have you got? Is that his tail? Or is that-- oh. Yeah, that is\nquite low down, eh? The bloody paper out the way. OK, I got it inside now. We're a bit better now. Got it in the tongs. But now I've gotta\nget my hands on it. And I can't see a thing. The worst place to work in. Try and get it to come this way.\nYou back up. Back up. SIOUXIE: Do you want\nthe light or not? Yeah, just keep it there.\nI can't-- SIOUXIE: I can't do both. [inaudible] Yeah, that's it. Get a tongue on it, see? Any way you can. Got it?\nSIOUXIE: I'm upside down. The snake's upside down.\n- All right, just hold it there. Yeah, the snake\nis upside down. Just hold it.\nJust hold it. I've got to go around here. Don't bite me. OK, now let's stop it like that. Let go, because\nyou twisted it. That's it.\n- I know. I said he was [inaudible]. Then go again. SIOUXIE: All right, I\nhave to go below you now. Well, you-- oh, you're\ngoing to go catch it. No, I can't.\nI'm upside down. - You're not now.\n- No, but our tongs are twisted. Just stay there. SIMON: We're way too close\nto the snake for my liking. All right, now's me chance. All right, snake, do it. OK.\nI got it. I got it.\nSIOUXIE: You got it? - Yeah.\n- [inaudible] got him. We're going to have to try\nand get some [inaudible].. - [inaudible]\n- Right. Stay there and let me go past. I've got it. I think-- should we\njust bag it here? SIOUXIE: No, I think\nwe need to go outside. It's dark, isn't it? Let's do it out there.\nI've got it. Yeah, yeah. [snake hisses] OK. OK, I've got your snake. [inaudible] It's OK.\nI've got it. It's OK. SIOUXIE: We can't get\nyou now, so come around. No, come here.\nCome close. No, don't touch the snake. But come close. Do you know what this is? SIMON: Black mamba. This will be about a year\nold, this particular one. They grow very, very fast. So it's because of all\nthis stuff around here, you're getting snakes. You've got chickens here, and\nyour animals, dogs, and mice, and rats will be here. That's what it's come after. Anyway, we'll take\nit away for you. But you did the right thing\nnot to interfere with it. Because it's a very\ndangerous snake. It was you when we\nturned out watching it. You did a brilliant job\nwith your torch watching it. That's a really\nbrave thing to do. So well done. Made our job easy. Be careful there. SIMON: Yeah, never\ntry and mess with it. At least you can sleep tonight.\nAll right. I'm just going to get it\nlike this a little bit. OK, that's a bit better. It's twisting around\nlike a mad thing here. Trying to get away. I'm just going to\nbe careful there. Don't slip. Don't slip, OK? It's all right, snake. You're going to be in\nthe bag in a minute. OK. His tail slipped out of my hand. I've only got his head. OK? All right, don't\ngo near the bag. SIMON: So it's a\nvery dangerous snake. SIOUXIE: She's really worried. I'm just so pleased\nwe've got it.

you will see one of the most venomous snakes in the world the Black Mamba is the most deadly snake in the world they grow 14 feet in length and can't travel at speeds of up to 12 miles per hour they have a head shaped like a coffin the Black Mamba is not actually black they have a brownish gray body with a light belly and brownish scales along its back it gets its name from the color of the lining of its mouth which is purple black and which it displays when threatened there are several well-known places around Africa where the Black Mamba lives they include Ethiopia Kenya and Somalia the largest numbers of them are believed to be around the Republic of Congo they can live as high up as five thousand nine hundred feet but they tend to live lower however with their natural habitat continually being depleted and food sources taken they are adapting where they can in order to be able to survive they are known to be highly aggressive and strike with deadly precision they are also the fastest land snake in the world capable of reaching speeds of up to 20 kilometers per hour these fearsome snakes can strike up to 12 times in a row a single bite is capable of killing anywhere from 10 to 25 adults the venom is a fast-acting neurotoxin if the venom reaches a vein it shuts down the nervous system and paralyzes victims and without anti-venom a fatality rate from the Black Mamba biteys 100% if the victim does not receive medical attention symptoms rapidly progress to severe abdominal pain nausea and vomiting pallor shock nephrotoxicity cardio toxicity and / versus eventually death can result at anytime between fifteen minutes and three hours in order to prevent black mamba attacks you must avoid tall grass and wear heavy boots and pants also you must keep your eyes open and if you spotted a snake try to escape slowly and don't provoke it and remember black mambas are fast [Music]", "av2NEQxCyl0": "in today's video we're back in the beautiful uncommon river valley kwazulu-natal South Africa but this time around our cameras weren't ready for what we were about to find now onto the lift is big [Music] it's actually busting my ears here so the Mamba has a problem confined space like this can you hear the echo in this big beautiful silo on this farm we didn't have even time to introduce the video we're driving around sometimes he's time to introduce a video sometimes it's not big blacks that come straight across the road definitely Mamba sorts tail hitting in oh yeah so this is the Mustang that what they make in a club just in case' you actually ideally I don't normally wear long pants but this is a scenario whatever you do don't walk where I haven't warped it it's teasing sauce barn but I would say just like to meet him walk did you see my feet this service is a bag of cats at a dog pound site could be any bigger I don't know if they're always going out could have gone there as well to Black Mamba disappears just [Music] [Music] it's also not an ideal position having a black mamba in a confined space because when this light does wake up it's gonna go away but it's a spectacular sight I want to hear [Applause] [Music] I don't want to take the snake out on the hook stick because it's just outside there's just one cross and I don't know how I'm gonna get through that hole while the spikes on the hook even when it's been you know pushing you don't have a grab stick with you do you just get it take to look around something like this can come in close now you see what it's doing now well it's doing now it's holding on with its Nick so it doesn't realize that you come up close together there we go got it not ideally but I've got the Black Mamba one of my favorite snakes in the world isn't that brilliant let's get outside yeah quickly highly allergic to this poo too so don't spend too long having introduced Kirstie mrs. ding go behind the cameras swinging around quickly at yourself that's your big mug Lee there she is oh she's so quick swing around one more time so people can see you back around now you look at the solid back down down there's that there's the muscles nemesis and what a romantic morning we having coming out catching black mambas together now my arm is there really a chi look at those welts there that's not from the venom that's from fireweed from darling but the problem is this Pooh is right on top of those things though they're not open wound so I don't have to worry about that however it just does it adds to the itchiness a little bit now look at the math on this Mike and that's why they call it the Black Mamba look at that pitch-black inside that mouth isn't it spectacular what a magnificent magnificent snake how's that the math of the Black Mamba the part of the snake known as the kiss of death I just want to show you something very quickly have to be gentle can you see those fangs they [Music] whoa and did you see a venom come right out of them that's the fangs day of the Black Mamba and you can see they're not really big fangs in fact it's like even with big fangs seeing a mean of fangs already big for a black mamba this is not such a big snake it's probably about the 1.8 meter walk or so and they can get right up to four and a half meters explore equal four and a half meters the second longest the venomous snake in the world off to the king cobra but these guys different kettle of fish - the king cobra now what a lot of people will see as you will see some black kind of sheath that we call it over the fangs there and people say are the snake is davina masked or defend its just ignorant sexually what if that is it's a protective layer you've got it's like a gum in the mouth that goes all over those fangs and protects them most the time what's the stop just like biting itself all the time another question we often get is if the snake bites itself what happens absolutely nothing it's like you biting your cheek you might get a bit sore they get an ulcer or something but it's not gonna do any harm the venom won't affect the snake one black mamba bite another black mamba no problem whatsoever absolutely incredible incredible snake they're the quickest snakes in the world super fast I mean this like electric just quicker than Seabiscuit absolutely spectacular snakes and they excellent promise they'll climb trees they'll swim over rivers they'll Gabriel did you hear that thing was a cow long it's beautiful form in this valley here and it's just prolific with black mambas they pick very everywhere here absolutely spectacular spectacular snakes and as you can see on my arm here guys look at all their poo on my shirt as well it's all over the place yeah and the reason for that is when you come across a wild snake tuckus gets a fright when it gets cornered and it will just difficut all over you now it's not stressed out I've got it you can see it's not trying to but it's not carrying on peeing it's just parking on my arms now wondering are you gonna eat me what you're gonna do I wouldn't nearly eat you I think you are magnificent you beautiful beautiful snake and unfortunately so many people see these snacks and they're prolific at young forms and they're coming to rural people's houses and the reason for that is some people are just dirty buggers and then take away their trash they leave their rubbish all over the place rats come in and these guys they'll eat two three rats a week sometimes of the taught enough they just that grow super quickly a hatchling can go from a hatchling to two meters in a year that's how quickly these spikes eat so they come along and they're around people's houses and the proximity to people and that's where the conflict exists in rural parts of Africa sometimes both of big cities black mambas and I've snake like us enough venom until probably 2030 people and they just watch repeatedly and part really quickly but I think they're absolutely beautiful beautiful gray color underneath and you'll see the colour of the snake is not black that's where we spoke about the mouth it's more Brown if it's been in captivity the whole body will go that gray color it'll go little gray like great the whole body is absolutely spectacular but these wild caught animals you can see a lot more Brown because they are char nature and what's happening our chairs you're getting rain on them and dirt on them and all kinds of things beautiful beautiful snake I think what we're going to do release them back into that silo that's where he was going maybe they're rats in there maybe there's old grain that he that the rats come in for and he hunts who knows spectacular snake one of the highlights of my life working with these beautiful big dangerous black mamas I absolutely love them when you see snakes just leave them alone not gonna do anything to you please don't try and catch a snake regarded today very very dangerous I've been doing this for 30 odd years and that's why and even with the videos of experience there's lots of times where I've had problems so the super potent neurotoxin or the Black Mamba you want to stay away from that it's a goodbye to this beautiful beautiful snake and we'll let it go on its way isn't it spectacular screaming Loxley you're right back where you came from we go once you go back now it's alright but here's a road chairman right here we go the infamous Black Mamba on his way he's coming out here we go Black Mamba release isn't that exciting and another black mamba back off on that's why isn't that exciting thanks for joining us we see you

line every day for one reason to save people a tear from sniper the reason why I inject venom and get bit by snakes is for a larger purpose and that larger purpose is to create a universal human anti-venom for the last seventeen point five years I've been using basically seven snakes to become immune to prove it one is that people say you can't beat because they're too necrotic and you can't build up immunity wrong you can build up immunity so you can be immune to anything that's only by doing it the probiem a black mamba is one of the most venomous snakes in the world from Africa and you can easily die in 20 to 30 minutes from a black mamba but it's just a nasty snake its aggression level besides the fake length make it easily that's a black mamba highly venomous highly aggressive especially this one just like most mamas but this one in particular is it's gonna really be attitude I'm about to take the black mom about to take a bite to prove my immunity it's a captive born zoo Black Mamba about four feet long highly aggressive let's do it got me twice three times right the finger I'll do one more in the arm something we ready make it fast and two more bites [Music] uh two bites in the finger two breaks in the arm I did not want that to happen when I took it out with the other direction got me the finger twice got me twice three times shoot when you get bit by a black mamba basically like getting hit with a hammer in your face on your finger it's pretty much the exact same thing that feels like throbbing sensation it feels like it's broke and that lasts a pretty long time usually two to three days before it goes away [Music] we're going to find out but I don't believe so hi I have millions and millions antibodies to the black mamba this was the most extremely easily the most extreme by bites that I've ever taken I've never had four bites by one snake which sounds strange and it really doesn't make any sense because people listening to that well how'd he get bit four times ago one snake and the way that AB has it bit me twice in the finger and I was trying to pull it out safely and I did another intentional bite and the reason I did that is to see how far I can take it and I love to push the limits and that's to to prove my medians to prove it works and obviously it does because my hands are swollen which means there's venom injected if they weren't swollen there'd be no about em injected so it clearly clearly proves that self immunization works to the very highest level and the very highest level of that was today at four bites and that's a beautiful thing the really cool thing that as we sit here in a film right now is the website was just launched live Mithras bio.com deck by dr. go an adult the PhD Stanford anti body engineer and all the films that I've done I've always said what I want to do I never thought in a million years that I could film and say the sights up it's done they have my blood my Hania bodies are

millennial men channel i'm josh i'm noah and we're back with another music reaction this time we got espa i believe so yeah we we looked it up online and we heard the translation um we hope we are right black mamba music video there we go that i did do correctly closed captioning is on not neon is really available [Music] i really like the way they're using the like editing software it's like it's like uh like computer generated like little pops of color and flash and like the yeah like the flowers and stuff on the like the transition it's more than a green screen yeah yeah big fan of uh the quick cuts and the noose of neon like the neon hearts and some of the neon flowers i like that because it instantly grabs your attention to that specific area even though it's a really quick cut for less than a second [Music] says [Music] oh i like the camera [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's like very visually stimulating so it's hard to like break away from it yeah like it's really like it's happening so fast so i'm like trying to like process while also listening to the lyrics yeah as you all know we try to deeply analyze these things so we try to look at all at once and sometimes it's tough um i do like the the camera work i think the camera work is pretty pretty awesome in this especially with their dancing parts in the and when the beats drop and stuff their camera works pretty spectacularly the way they're doing it right now i think you you uh brought up a good point in terms of having little like computer it looks like little computer edits like with the editing software specifically when they had their choreo going there was this little green like block laser things moving and i was like but it's like it brings your attention everything it's like a cat me like literally i'm just like oh my god but it's really cool because you're still able it's not overwhelming where i'm just looking at these green lines like oh oh but it it's like it it envelops the whole thing and i like they're i like their small edits and their big edits so the video of staring down the barrel of a gun and then shooting it and it was confetti straight into the choreo and the camera flipped and then also the edit of the snake going through what seemed to be that like jungle floor it's very quick but it's very like enticing yeah let's go for it yeah [Music] is [Music] all right so that was sick my monochrome two colors that's my evolution that's really cool because i don't know if you notice about the whole black mamba and like they have a lot of dark scenes and then like these like her scene in the um like i don't know she's like hacking the main frame yeah yeah it's all super bright colors like white green pink blue neon one of them was on their phone and it was just a dark subway then i flipped it into like all the flowers you know the butterflies the same thing even right here right this is the scene where they're like dancing and they're all in [Music] black [Music] is [Music] [Applause] and it's like it's interesting because you can see it grow like darker and darker i want to say it because it was like you see the large snake and then the bite and then they grab to choreo and as you can see like the background it gets more and more filled with like trees and leaves but they're all like dark colors like a black or a dark gray until you look into her eyes and all you it like almost looks like it consumes i'm such a sucker for when they when you they fade out fade out the beat and they do some intense stuff and [Music] i love that red [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay [Music] oh [Music] oh sick see the heart yeah yo wow so i was like i was looking at the lyrics during most of the video it's a very confident song i'm not sure who they're referring to like because at some points they even talk about like is it me in the mirror that i'm referring to and stuff like that but they're very much like you can't win against us like we will win like type deal very confident song um if anybody has some more information on that yeah i would love to hear ever listening to their music or music video for that matter either so i was hooked on the video i literally was just i think the the the graphics are just awesome the cgi is super super like captivating the entire way through it like it's never too much and then when it's the focal point it's done extremely well like it doesn't seem like it's part of a music video it seems like it's a part of like a like a movie it looks expensive yeah it looks like they paid a lot of money and a lot of people to get that snake perfect like that kind of stuff yeah not only that the edit of like them watching their their future choreo on the phone and then tapping it and now that's the main outsourcing the edit of the snake biting and then changing it straight to the choreo like all of the transitions were very clear and concise and very original like it wasn't they were consistently doing this edit of like okay snake bite next scene snake bite next you know it was like snake bite to the eyes zoom in to the explosion of the smoke to then the the passing of a subway it was everything very very specific and the cuts were so quick that it just continuously like float like it just grabs your attention over and over and over with a new and separate aspect than before which is really really well done i'm a huge fan so if you have anything else by them that we should react to because i was sick let us know uh besides that uh you all know what to do comment like subscribe hit that bell so you know when we drop our next video hit that link to stay connected with us and thanks for stopping by the money man channel peace have a good one oh my god that thing was tough", "lpzoFaQAneA": "[Music] [Music] [Music] m [Music] [Music] action um [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh yeah oh [Music] [Music] does she [Music] oh um [Music]", "0nPhfqq_p6g": "foreign foreign

soon okay bye bye vespa vespas here vespas here okay bye", "jRWkA_d1s1M": "Hello! We're going to react to aespa's debut song - Black Mamba. So, I don't know anyone. I don't know the song. I haven't seen the MV. Same! But for me, I stan them. I've heard of Ningning. So we only have one aespa stan here. Who's your bias? Ningning. God vocals. She's unbelievable. How many are they? Four. Four? Who's the leader? Do they have a leader? They have a leader. It's Karina! Who's the youngest? Who's the oldest? Ningning's the youngest. The oldest is Karina then Giselle then Winter and Ningning. What's their age? Around 19-20 years old. Hmm. I see. Let's react! I feel like they're good. The views speak for itself. Well, they are from SM. SM artists are super talented. Are they the Rookie of the Year? Is this the group that won ROTY? Not yet. They debuted late. I think they're not eligible for 2020 ROTY but they're eligible for ROTY this 2021. Anyways, let's start. 3, 2, 1. Go! Expectations are high because they're from SM! They are already in sync. That's Karina (side note: SHE'S SO PRETTY ARGHH) I think my bias will be on the right? What's her name? The far right? No. This one on the screen right side. Wow! That's aespa! They have nice vocals. That's my bias right there! Ah! She's the girl I'm saying earlier that's on the right. Oh my God. Her vocals are insane! That's Winter! Is she also the main vocal? No, their main vocal is Ningning! Why do they all sound like main vocalists? Me: Woah, they're also amazing dancers.\nGirl at the back: Who's that? Giselle! Giselle! Who's that in the center? That's Karina! Woah. She has pretty facial expressions. Who's that? Karina. I feel like my bias is the blonde one. What's her name again? Winter! Or that girl? That's Giselle! Main rapper. Oh Giselle's her name. I'm still confused with their names. Me also. I can't memorize their names. Their vocals are on point. They have god-tier vocals.  She's so cute. What's her name? Maknae. Ningning! Okay, I finally found my bias. This will be final and I won't change, They're so fierce. Woah! They're amazing! Wait for this one. Woah! The visuals. That's scary. Woah! Look at this. It's so freaking pretty. Insane visuals. She's so pretty. What's her name? Karina, right? Yes, Karina! I don't wanna change my bias anymore. Final is Ningning. Wow! The beat drop! I think my bias is now Karina. Who's that girl on the right? She's my bias. I swear! Ningning! And that's Giselle right? Wow! Best dancer. That's Winter right? Yeap! That's Winter. Wow. She really is beautiful. I find her the most attractive. Is she the visual of the group? Yes. It's like League of Legends. Woah. Wow! The girl in black top is an amazing dancer. It's so catchy. Wow! They're so good! Let's stan them! What's this? Woah! Black Mamba. Their logo is so nice too. And there's a heart. That's BOA. Who? BOA? I thought it's Giselle cause of the blonde hair. BOA's, our queen. The Queen of KPOP. This is like a teaser to BOA's comeback. Have you chosen a bias guys? Who's your bias? My bias is Karina! My bias is Ningning and Giselle. Giselle. Karina. Karina and Winter. And Mingming...Ningning. Oh yeah, Winter also. Everyone? Actually, every one of them cause it's hard to pick a bias in this group. But maybe, it's Ningning! Ningning is also my bias. She's so good at singing and dancing. Ace. All-arounder. And their debut song is super nice. It's super catchy. Ayayaya. As expected from SM. Yeap. We will stan them! Talented. Vocals! All SM artists have great vocals. And super catchy! We shall stan. I will stan! True. Incredible. 10/10. 10/10. 100/10. 100. 11. They're really good. 15. They're perfect. 100. Future of KPOP. Make it 1000. Okay.

prototype and then we have like a drawing or something like that a cad drawing now people might thought it was a trans art because they're doing the trans metal stuff and everything but it looks like ben from ben's collectible he talks to them so like and they said this is not theirs so i don't know who this is who it is but it looks you know pretty decent so far i mean you know there's not really a whole lot to go off of you know but i love that they come with the spider web that looks pretty cool uh black rachnia came with one and it really looks really nicely done so yeah i mean we might be getting a transmetal tranulus it's you know pretty cool i wouldn't mind to have that but like i said it's not going to be trans art because they already said that this is not theirs so i don't know who's making this but hopefully we'll get it so there you go very very nice i wouldn't mind having a transmetal transfer list around you know what i mean i like some spiders so it looks like generation toys is giving us a new uh rebuilder it's a six-pack now featuring a platinum finish on the chest and the tank and the cement mixer and a golden redeco of the generation toys tyrant which is with their legend scale megatron so this is their devastator has been out you know they put that out a long time ago but now they're giving us a new box set and it's like i said it's going to have new platinum finish so it's going to be a little shinier and you also get that golden gun from uh you know double 07. you remember that game come on now uh the combiner stands about 45 centimeters

drift 2.0 he's a little a little dumpier and chubbier than the original one but that's cool so yeah fans toys still around yay eggs you know exciting everybody can calm down not worry about this stuff awesome it's awesome well all right folks that's all we have for third party news let's move on to official and it looks like black mama is legit now so if anybody knows black mamba is a knockoff company they knocked off a bunch of like a favor stuff and everything they did some other stuff and everything as well but looks like they're legit now so they're making some trains and stuff and everything some transformable trains you know licensed high speed trains uh they look pretty good to be honest uh so and they're official so you know that's pretty cool so if you really like trains uh here you go black mamba has you covered and uh they're official now so you don't have to feel dirty when you buy a knockoff or something like that i'm just kidding it's fine whatever you buy is that's

points of articulation and you got a removable wrap back cassette mode that fits sound waves chest as well so very cool if you're into the super 7 stuff there you go we got a new sound blaster coming

starscream they look kind of really cheap and everything but you know that's if you like them that's all that matters but walgreens have an exclusive they got a g1 thundercracker statue chase variant so this was been found in california so if you're collecting these and you want a chase figure here you go thundercracker is going to be it i wonder if they're going to do skywarp the same way we'll

images of galvatron from kingdom and this is the canon mode his alt mode is showing as well and everything so very nicely done uh i think it looks pretty good now the canon looks really long and strong about to give us friction on but it definitely looks a whole lot better than what the top returns one did so i'm liking everything you could put the little spaceships on his little sides and everything i probably won't do that but i'm going to have him in bot mode anyways but yeah this is our first look at the alt mode and it looks pretty good i know these are leaked and they weren't supposed to be leaked uh so eventually we'll probably get some you know better picks uh from like a you know toy fair or something like that or you know any you know con that's gonna have you know

[Applause] [Music] it's nothing more empty your chutney tunnel quicker than seeing a black mermaid when you go to the toilet black mamba one of their favorite food little baby very lazy isn't he absolutely beautiful chilling archer he found a beautiful spot where he thought he could hang out he didn't know this is where cindy we look after the snake isn't that right okay cindy wonderful that's what it's about that's how he got up there he's an excellent climber excellent excellent hello everyone dengo here and as you can hear our voice is going a little bit we're horse we've been running busier than a one legged man in ice kicking competition lately and i got a phone call this morning we're actually out now in the rural part of of where we live around the durban area in south africa and i got a phone call from somebody that i was sure i was going to get another phone call from that's right it's cindy phoned me this morning saying dingo i've got a snake in our toilet can you believe it in the toilet that's what she said so we'll see if it's still in the toilet when we get there but um cindy if you don't remember cindy go back i'll put a link down below to another video we did at her house two members in the bedroom with absolutely harrowing experience and in that episode one of the big mom they actually bumped right up against my far i thought that was it one of the scariest captures and rescues i've ever done in my life today we're back out for black mamba i'm really nervous it's beautiful terrain for black marbles here and it's been particularly rainy so it's been raining the last few days and uh what often happens then is the mambas they'll come in to find shelter and that's obviously what it's done it's coming here uh sorry go lift it shawna um gets a bit complicated with these roads cruising all over the place so we're close to her house now going to give her a call in a moment just to make sure she's still got eyes on the snake very important keep eyes on the snake [Music] hello cindy yeah we're coming now just wait outside are you watching the snake now okay that's perfect keep watching it you can't see it now the inside okay we're almost there now we'll be there two minutes all right perfect right guys off the phone there with cindy it's just over here on the right side yeah under this big tree we're off the um phone with cindy she's she says it's gone into that building where the toilet is look at this place isn't it absolutely incredible we're going to get out go straight there hopefully easy capture that's what i'm hoping and with most people i wouldn't think they know what a black mamba is cindy she knows what a black mamba is here she is the rocket scout house [Music] hey cindy nothing will make nothing will empty your chutney tunnel quicker than seeing a black marmot when you go to the toilet it's a jelly jar cindy hey that's the third black mamba yeah i thought you were going to phone us during lockdown of course that baby i thought there'd be more babies no babies but we've got another black mamba whole big it's a big one it's a huge one huge one another black moon but guys what we're going to do i'm going to get the sticks uh the problem with a confined space like this is that number one a mamba can climb it can be up above the heads it can be down below it's also um it feels cornered so when it's cornered it wants to come out and hit you sometimes fortunately it's a bit cooler this morning but uh let's go get our stuff let's try get in there it's nice and contained which is great cindy can it can it escape out of here at all the holes at the top yes there's holes in the top and the bed but nothing's coming out you're sure come have a look here so a couple of holes can it go down okay that's fine look at all the dogs here pandemonium their chickens and uh this is what attracts the mambas to an area like this little cat so you got cats here still no cats cats are gone because last time they were little baby kittens black mamba one of their favorite food little baby little puppies little chickens or is going on here there's absolute chaos in africa we absolutely love it it's always a bit nerve-wracking guys when you've got a little commotion around the dogs are here you don't want a dog getting bitten you don't want people getting burned let's go see what we can do i was going to the toilet when i i guess inside the toilet i sit down i hear something's moving on top of the of the toilets when i saw it was a black man by a big black man but then i get out of the toilet and i ran away [Music] i can't come here you can come right in can you see the snack yeah there he is right up there holy smokes so cindy's coming here sitting on the toilet here and look what's above her it's a big one cindy that's a decent sized black mama were you on the toilet and you saw it was it at the top when you saw it can you imagine that'll just it'll empty out your bowels and then it'll make your starfish pucker something rotten let's just move this dog out the way sydney can you call the dog this snake would have enough venom to kill probably i don't know 50 of those dogs no problem at all there's often stories about people where they find a black mamba and what happens whole bunch of dogs are dead so now this is not going to be easy it's hooked up he's going on some wire look how they can hold on let me just take the camera but you can see them better look at this very large isn't he absolutely beautiful what a magnificent snake and he's lying up against this kind of brickwork there very little for him to hold on to look at that he's put himself in that wire to anchor fortunately for me this is making life a little bit easier for me don't move now boy because he can't get anywhere and he's trying to go through the the iron but i think he's too big to fit out so what i'm gonna have to do he's not flashing mouth yet he's quite cool it's a cool day as i said um

gonna use the hook stick i'm gonna hook him there hopefully he doesn't fall down on top of me we'll bring him outside and then we'll work with him a little bit better [Music] now he's moving around a little bit more moving very slowly because if i spook him now or if he drops down off this ledge he'll bite me just go through the other side this shoulder tell me if he's coming out there okay um if i spook him now he's going to shoot up while shawn into the bush and i don't want to hurt him how far is his head out the side there [Music] i can't put him back tell me if he's going forward or back

our main snake facility and right here we've got a whole bunch of containers of animals that are going out they're not being sold we'll be taking him dry the vicinity Adam Piggly Wiggly for the weekend it's all happening but before we going I wanted to tell you about take you right back to the year 2003 when I was bitten by and envenomated by a big black mamba it happened at a show there were 300 people in the audience and the snake came really high in the past and bit me now what I want to do today is not just tell you about it but I want to bring a black mamba out going through exactly what happened what went wrong and hopefully impart some knowledge and experience that will potentially save some other people's lives handling these dangerous snakes these deadly snakes it's really learning by trial and error sometimes so hopefully you can learn from my areas that will keep you safe so let's get the black mamba out and let me talk you through what happened in September of 2003 all right guys when I've taken out a momma but it's not buying the points planned you can see right now it's busier than a one-legged man in the hospita competition it's all over the place in the room yet it's a very slippery falls in this room so that the snakes can't get aggro and that's for good reason I just want this night to calm down a bit okay deep groaning I don't know why it's doing that trying to get away from me I just wanted to calm down a little bit so I can slow down because I looked it up on a hook now - probably bought me in the face come on it's okay I took it out of its enclosure they lost its mind just went mad and I'm keeping its heel on the ground because as soon as I look through with the ground it's gonna try and flip it right up in botany and this is a small bomb about a two meter mom about seven footer it's actually one of the display animals that I've use there we go it's what a relaxed Mamba you might be saying dude are you mad have you seen the think I'm alive floor yes I saw it and that's edgy well I don't want you today have you come up closer you just have the camera moves in front you can see how nervous and erratically slice off just wave your handi above the camera okay click of the mouse exactly what you want to do I think this is my first time working with you guys no man that episode climbers these black bombers and you can hear already out of breath look at that magnificent snake now just call me down a little bit it can come right out from there and smash that camera they've got super good eyesight just want you to relaxed No and I can climb really well the hook stick in a matter of a second and before I get into the story of how I got bitten I just need to make sure this mob is completely relaxed and slowed down because I can't work with it like this little tag you for sure and what it should do now is now that it's out of its enclosure it should just start relaxing a little bit no let me just get it off there and doesn't hurt the snake come on folks to cook in it always super it's just a muscle this also makes us made out of muscle let me try and see I just want you to calm down think it's climbing I look at the strength of that snake guys absolutely just powerful two meters of just muscle and speed that quickest snake in the world there's no doubt about it there's no snake in the world that is as quick as I smoked and in fact when I was bitten in 2003 out of the three now this is the problem I lost a tail out of the 300 people that were in that show not one of them saw me get bitten that's how fast the snake was stop talking now so what happened the show I was doing a public demonstration and at the stage I had about ten black mambas and I used a variety of them and shows and then that morning and what happened that morning is I took one of the snakes which wasn't too aggressive but it wasn't my most calm this is quite a common black mamba he's quick I mean look at that very very quick but he's quite calm he hasn't actually tried to bite us and some people say there's no such thing as that as an aggressive snake absolutely loner a rubbish there are some black bombers that all they want to do is they want to bite you and I have to be super careful when I'm with me these spikes and I'm concentrating boy am i concentrating right now every movement I'm watching that's why get onto the story as soon as I'm really uncomfortable to do that but I'm watching the snake all my energy all my focus twenty plus years of experience all coming now to a head when I'm concentrating on this lake the most dangerous and the quickest snake in the world fifth most toxic venom of any snake in the world and when they bite they envenomate they don't muck around I don't give you too many warnings they come in hard and fast and they bite you and then they bite that mean business and I was doing assuring the black moment was the last snake in my show and I didn't have it on a hook stick like this I had on one of these Koran sticks and in many different types of grab sticks in the world I'm just gonna swap it over onto the grab stick to give you that in the stretcher I had no gloves back in 2003 there are clubs around and I had the snake up like this in the show it was a much bigger bomb it was I had to put Acme tamam back and I recommend you work with grab sticks like this anymore and I had to snake up like this and it was a different type of the grab stick one that didn't have this cable running down the middle and what I did is I thought I pressure on the snake so I lifted it up out of its container I thought I had pressure on it in net hook and what is actually happening in those particular types of grab sticks and I'll show you one in this picture to the handle instead of closing down the snake had got jammed right over thee so I thought I had pressure on the snake the whole time meanwhile the snake was just sitting like this and actually what had happened as I had hacked the snake off it was grumpy Dean grumpy hot fully charged and with lots of people moving in the audience the snake wanted to come and bite me and this is what he did exactly what he's doing now slowly he came rapidly full speed and because he was a longer mom a two point eight meters or he's getting heavy now even he came all the way down here and he put me right on this thumb and you can see how he can just stretch all the way now I'm doing with a glove so I'm safe and I'm also an kid his body at the end of the hooks dacovia look at that he's an kid he can't come too much closer and I'm pulling against him but that mama came down so hard and fought he pinned me right on the thumb and as he pinned me I dropped the crab stick of this crab stick came down the ground I held the mob up on my hand like that and that's the most dangerous part because I smack got this can whoop around and often when a mom about you doesn't bite you once about you repeatedly fortunately I was in a facility that had a big kind of a production stage behind me and I was on the stage and there was a big curtain so what happened is the slightly got this doctors head under the curtain to get away from me and I could hold it with my hand so I was holding a snake it's hid was underneath that curtain and it wasn't worrying about me trying to get away and that's what probably saved my life repeated bouts of that snake one bite can kill up to 20 adults human beings so if you can repeat it but you're just talking about more and more availabe pumped into you if one bite gives you four hundred milligrams of venom you can see how quickly the guy from 0 to 100 a lot they cost you just react I just want you to sit back and you guys be like a good mom but let me tell my story stay relaxed I'm watching you you can't make me I'm gonna put the stick in between us so 14 milligrams of dinner will kill an adult human being in one bite from a Mamba the wrinkles 400 milligrams that's a lot of vino so as I've got tagged I thought oh my gosh worst not me but fortunately I wasn't allergic to Mamba venom back then and I've got tagged by the snake and instantly within about five seconds I've got pins and needles and electric pins and needles going throughout my face in my mouth it's a strangest feeling I've ever felt almost feel like you're just getting little electric shocks going all the way around your mouth and I knew I'd been envenomated and I'd had a bad one it was at 2.8 almost three meter Black Mamba it was angry and it had pumped me full of venom two fans in my thumb fortunate was the last night of a show so I ended the show then no one in the audience 300 people none of them knew I'd been bitten by the snake so what I put the snake away I walked right back to the back of the auditorium and I said to the person in charge I need to go to a hospital I had a magnet with me he was driving me and the guy says to me wow what happened I said I just got bitten you see what a little bit gee I see mom couldn't believe it so I told him finally er tell them we're on the way black mamba bite and the problem you have a lot of hospitals there's a lot of people who get bitten by snakes in Africa well got it and everything's a black mamba oh I'm watching you I'm watching you you know to face me you can actually hear listen to black mambas have got the most bone-chilling hiss of any snake in the world it's all because a lot of people in Africa going to hospitals everything's a black mamba bite and they go there and it's not a black mamba so I said tell them please I gave him my name cuz the hospital knew about me they don't work with venomous snakes I said I'm coming in with a black mamba bite and I laughed at the hospital ten minutes after the bite that's really really fast we were going down one-way roads through red robots and as we got it down I feel the pins and needles coming down my hands up my feet or I throw my feet up my legs and I know what's happening is that nervous neurotoxic venom enemas are taking my nervous system and as soon as it gets to your diaphragm what's gonna happen you're gonna stop breathing look at that my side of the snake they just watching you watching that camera I can speak up a little bit closer now we go and that neurotoxic venom was just impacting me in a 15 minute stopping all the message is going from my brain to my muscles and I know as soon as it gets to my diaphragm that's me over I'm dead the diaphragm stops working you die from asphyxiation ah don't look at me did you smoke no just looking and that tight flick that's a rotation that's not smelling they're an environment that's a watch out when it goes up and down like that black mamba say I'm on God a little bit of a hood showing as well and hitting on the Guinea yeah super super dangerous snakes these black moles are good worked around there at the peppermint way with miles away these three hitters with weeks left position of the enemy and that's what I mean about these snakes yet it just goes from zero to a hundred and a split second and without reason cameraman there's nothing there to upset the snake and I'm holding this hook stick in between myself and them on there so that's all saying can you just try to see if you're relaxed about pick it up a bit just for next time hasn't it and whereas I was saying what happened is I got to that emergency room ten minutes off goods and on you things were getting tough things were getting close to me being in real trouble I was betting to breathe I try to get out the car the vehicle when you're out there whoa whoa whoa stay on the hook stick don't come back why you can be back now and just reposition the psyche until I'm happy with it the sonar scan was a lying on the floor far safer to work with and I try to skip down to the vehicle and just fell over and my legs haven't really become paralyzed ten minutes after the bot and instantly I knew because in trouble fortunately there was a brilliant doctor dr. bloom Maha and here that experience with giving a venomous snake back to those who knew me and knew who I was and he treated me he got there really quickly and he pumped me full of antivenom and also he intubated me or we came here a bit later and that was the last thing I remembered receiving was having this big like a shove down my throat and it wasn't like to see on Grey's Anatomy I'm just watching look at this like backing up I don't want you on my hand boy and that's the last thing I remember before I passed out you just don't be so careful with these snakes back in that coming forward ready to back climbing up the hook stick and I passed out as that ventilator was going down and I found out afterwards it was an emergency everything was closing up I was Bethany to breathe and I was about to die so they just took that and they just stuck it right down my throat as quickly as possible four months after designed pieces of flesh coming up my throat there from where the damage had been done when it closed down but absolutely safe mother and I was in a coma for about nine hours after that and woke up later in the ICU in the hospital and then fortunately with Mamba venom is very quick acting but if they can control it and if you get the anti-venom and then you're on a ventilator on your heart or lung machines and everything else the effects of the venom wear off fairly quickly and I was in that ICU room and I got to talk and I'm able to move for about three days three of the most scary days of my life from the infamous Black Mamba and three days later I was finally discharged and my lungs had started working that anti-venom took three days to get all that venom out of my system and my lungs started working on their own mechanic and that's all of the parts of the infamous Black Mamba the most dangerous snake in the world like if but smarts maybes about it the quickest snake nervous-like aggressive snake but they are one of my favorites and I don't know if it's because I've been bitten by one but I respect them incredibly I appreciate them they get super big the second or longest venomous snake in the world and they really are a real force to handle to work with but you look at it's like looking at a big grown tiger like we're looking at a massive elephant like a polar bear like a great white shark so all those animals apex predators top of the food chain where they come from absolutely incredible incredible snake so when it comes to handling and keeping and interacting with dangerous venomous snakes just remember one thing be careful learn from other people's mistakes don't let you all mistake cost you enough thanks for joining us see you next time dingo bad [Music] you", "j367UwIqjiA": "portugal

menacing as possible to any predator all this snake wants to do is let you know i don't want to be messed with i don't want to waste my venom on you if you get too close i'm going to strike and bite you and leave you dead look at that oh look at that look at her clearing your neck look her fingernail oh she is a beast of a black mama look at her look at that snakey look at her she will shut up her what is going on my beautiful people welcome back to my wildlife and my wild snake house here at the everglades outpost in south florida what is going on beautiful people i'm about to get into a whole mess of danger in a second and by danger let me put my didgeridoo down before i make a didgeridoo the danger i'm getting into today is the black mamba we actually have this new beautiful black mamba that's nearly 10 feet long her name is allison she is a beast of a black manga and as you can see she's actually come out of her old skin and she has complete shed that she broke out of over the weekend this is super exciting because the snake is continuing to grow reptiles never stop growing throughout their lifetime all they need is heat food and space and this mamba is already 10 feet long so i can't imagine how much bigger it's gonna end up being good thing is from what albert was telling me the previous owner this snake hasn't eaten in probably he said a couple months i've got this animal to eat one chick one chick before going to shed so this snake is willing to eat food in its new enclosure she's shed she went to the bathroom it looks like she needs some fresh water so we're going to get into it we're going to be taking out the black mamba securing it in this enclosure right here i'm actually going to start with taking the monocled cobra out putting it into this tub right here i'm going to put the mamba right inside this enclosure here versus trying to put the mamba inside a bucket or a big trash can because the thing is the mama's gonna keep trying to shoot up and i'm gonna try and put that lid on not knowing where the mom's head at i don't want to do that a little too dangerous so i think the smartest thing to do is give the mom a dark area that's elevated open the door a little bit let the mama go through into the door slide it closed and i'm safe to clean its enclosure it's a little bit different from the king cobra it's a totally different level of an animal it is one of the most notorious snakes for speed venom and defensiveness so definitely it's gonna be a little a little intense today it's time to get serious the black mamba no mistakes so pay attention pay it i won't do it today we need to be serious pay attention pay attention all right so first things first we're going to take out the new albino looks like childish gambino's going through shed two his eyes are slightly opaque and he's throwing a bit of a fin we'll leave him beat what i'm saying is we're going to take up this albino monocled cobra that was given to me by albert killian the same person who gave me this beautiful black mama allison and look at that this monocled cover is actually going through shed too everyone's grown like crazy so this snake's eyes are very opaque you can't see and this thing already is quite an aggressive or defensive snake so going through sheds probably not being too happy right here relax oh reverse it on me it's okay that is a thick little cover not happy at all beautiful uncle cobra and nyakutia more potent drop for drop than the king cover being a true cobra like that i'm gonna say well to the viewers hello look at that totally being defensive flaring that hood up spreading the ribs to look as menacing as possible to any predator all this snake wants to do is let you know i don't want to be messed with i don't want to waste my venom on you if you get too close i'm going to strike and bite you and leave you dead the snake does not want to waste its venom on us it is a protein it takes a lot of energy to actually make venom so snake's last resort is to envenomate first it's posturing up pooping trying to get away last resort would be to bite somebody look at that beautiful snake come on like crazy look at that that is awesome you doing good sonny still gotta think of a name for this beautiful final monopoly cobra so comment below what you guys think you should name it what are you doing [Music] all right perfect i love these tubs because they lock down perfectly nice and tight little oil drums nothing's going to get out of there there's little holes for ventilation pretty easy so now what we have to deal with is this enclosure for the mamba you guys are probably thinking cross-contamination is an issue why would you even want to risk it well if you think about it this monopoly cover is actually being housed right next to the black mamba in the old snake house that albert was keeping them in so there's actually no real risk whatever they have they've already shared it but these snakes are healthy and he's having for a very long time so we're putting the water bottle out hiding just leaving an empty cage gonna leave it cracked open just like that so the mama can go to the cage and i can slide the glass closed and put the mom in there and lock it up and i can actually clean that cage without being in circumference with the bite zone because with the black mama it's so fast that before you even blink it's just like that and then your hat flies up just like that and you're envenomated and then you're looking at your hands going why did i pick a career working with venomous reptiles oh yeah my mom dropped me down the stairs when i was a child that's why pay attention come on it's a serious day it's a black mamba where's bingo dinkleman when you're new it's time guys get your game faces on quit messing around put your phone down quit texting and pay attention because chandler's wildlife is about to handle a black mama for the second time in his life let's see how i do all right so enclosure is unlocked all we got to do is retrieve the black mamba get it out of the box she was actually selling herself and she went to her box when we walked in so i'm going to open up the box she's going to come out i'm going to safely get her into this enclosure we're going to close it and safely secure a 10-foot black mamba that's well probably not pushing 10 foot since it's just [ __ ] so let's get this open ruth why don't you stand right there in the firing line for me thank you thank you very much if anything happens your sister can film for me right cool that is such a good looking south african black male but she's got that voice beautiful white speckled speckling down her body look at that i actually would like to readjust my hand because the way she's coming out she's more kinked and i want to make sure she's nice and comfortable oh look at her she's not happy look at that oh look at that look at her clearing her neck over her finger and up now the reason you see the flying with the neck is because they're in a lap of a family member and in the alapaday family whether it's a true cobra or a member that's from australia like a sudeka's family member like a red bully black snake they flat out their neck in defense to show that they're really big and they don't want to be messed with so the black mamba actually flares out the ribs around its neck to look more intimidating similar to a true cobra they're in the same family they're in the lapide family but they're not true coconuts in their own little group of mamas look at that she is a beast of a black mamba i'm gonna lock this up real quick and we're gonna get to cleaning her enclosures look at that she's a beast of a sink wasn't too bad either i had her out she was flaring the neck she was upset but she wasn't shooting all over the place we're gonna see how it goes when i take her out to put her back in the enclosure but for now let's get to checking out this shed we came around through the sticks oh my goodness that's some full black marble machine look at this i was shaking a little bit this is super exciting for me because i've been working with venice reptiles my whole life i've only had with mambas on a few occasions most of them green mambas second time i've handled a black mama super exciting for me look at this eye caps complete right there they shed their eye caps the snakes scales every single scale of the body coming off completely this is a perfect shed just the right amount of humidity that is insane this snake skin is ridiculous look at this of course snake skin stretches after it sheds but look look at that that is ridiculous this mamba has to be at least 10 feet long that is insane my first time handling black mambas and that's a 10 foot beast of a female that was raised up by a friend of mine it's so cool right she's just glowed up in the back she doesn't have a hiding spot we don't want to spook her too much i think what we'll do is get to cleaning when we put this shed to the side this is really cool i'm not even going to post this up on the wall because it's a complete black mama shed or maybe i'll do like a little competition for the fans to see if uh somebody can win this as a gift so maybe we'll do that later we'll talk about that some other time when we put this black mama shed to the side get the can for the poop and start cleaning this up as you can see there's a little bit of poop right there in the corner there's a little bit of poop over here and there's poop over there in that corner too really good the snake is digesting well it's got the perfect amount of heat go to the bathroom perfect shed it's going to be a happy long living snake i'm super excited the black mamba in a shield if you're not you're playing with your phone and then you've got a little bit of challenge wildlife playing in the background oh oh he's defeating ziggy okay he's being kevin we're messing with alice allison the black mama she don't blame those black mama poop clean time montage [Music] okay we got the freshest the the best the most wonderful look at this take a look do you know what this is do you know what this is no not grape juice water it's h2o wake up what is wrong with you let me put my hands down please come here let me put my hands down for a second do you really just say strangers cut it out all right we're about to bring out black mama be serious all right guys fresh water good to go let me grab the hook and put it right there last move put her boxing all right this box just in case any of you guys don't like it i am going to make a custom lock box soon kind of like what i have for kevin i'm going to make a small one that stays down here and one that's elevated that goes up here so different areas to hide out at but for now nice cardboard box if she goes to the bathroom in the box i'm going to throw it away really easy versus having to scrub it out of the wood so you're going to leave it just like that for down until she poops in it let me close the cage that much when it comes to space so she can shoot back in my footer back she's completely coiled up in the back right now she's just hanging out if you get a good luck she's just trying to make herself comfortable she's wrapping up in a nice tight coil she's about to come back out let's do this this is gonna be awesome let me see this is super exciting stuff because for me this is like the ultimate snake when it comes to working with this is a snake that the fans respect notorious for its speed it's venom and its posture when i say posture i mean the way they posture up when they're real upset all right just gently you can feel her flinching she's not liking that i try to do is use the hook to keep her away from my body redirecting her at all times she is a beast so you're flaring that neck up look at that she is a beast of a black mama look at her look at that snitch look at her she will shoot her own body but it's nothing look at that insane [Applause] come here don't cause a whole mess of trouble come here oh she's going to the bathroom typical of a venomous reptile before they end up trying to bite you they're going to poop all over you because the last thing you want to do is waste that down all right back inside the enclosure go ahead sorry about that hopefully she'll get to know me over time but we won't have too many issues and when she comes out for handling like my king cobras it won't be a bunch of drama will be nice smooth calculated easy to work with let's close that before she comes back out right there she's such a beast inside look she's posturing up in the corner right now hanging up under the lip oh she's trying to find her high spot all right we're gonna let her be give her some privacy wasn't that crazy black mama that is awesome let me lock up her enclosure she has a piece of this that's the wrong block this is the lock oh look she's trying to hide behind the box all right turn closures nice and secure locked up we're gonna let her be give her time to go back inside her box and relax i'll try to shift her box back into the corner because she's trying to hide behind it right now that was alice in the black mamba she doesn't play no she look how massive she is look at that that is awesome allison black mamba a 10 foot long beast of a black mama what an awesome educational ambassador for this facility for the black mama for all her wild cousins for people to get up close and see these animals in person if they really get a good idea of what a black mamba is the one looks like up close really up close that's really cool all right we're going to end it here i'm tired i've been cleaning closures today it's been a long day and i just wrangled up with a 10-foot black mama i'll see you guys on the next one stay beautiful stay safe but most of all check out this new merch look check it out look no oh this one yes but i meant this boom look at the photo that is

watch together portugal entry for eurovision 2021 starting oh oh i didn't expect that this sounds really sophisticated and classic oh and it's english yes oh black mamba [Applause] [Music] two steps okay that's that's not where i thought it was going in any way i it sounded like really jazzy and then we went to quite a normal chorus but no i don't have a problem with the chorus at all well we'll see we're just 53 seconds in but i this is so like i'm sitting here and all i'm asking songs to make me feel it can be happy it can be angry but something in his voice yeah makes me feel emotional like i'm i'm feeling something inside me what it is i don't know but he's got a very interesting voice like i feel like i shouldn't like it but he pulls it off there's a really weird tone to his voice but the start sounded so jazzy and cool i was really like thinking we're going to have this really out there entry that's all jazz but yeah i was i i was hoping he would start doing steps because of his shows i thought he's going maybe he will maybe i'll speed up [Music] maybe not tonight yeah beautifully produced it's beautifully produced but i feel it's a bit too slow that chorus was an absolute like it felt like there was loads of momentum in the first verse and the chorus just sucked everything out of it oh what a shame however it could be a definite grower it's a grower it's for sure a grower but it's a song for a specific mood i don't think you'd ever go out of your way to put that on probably not but i won't skip it straight away i would have thought but anyway let's see let's see let's see he's doing lies with his voice i like him though this fits really nice i like the melody now oh wow that's i really love the verses i love this but that chorus is it's like a black hole that sucks all the energy out of the song because that second verse was glorious the way it was produced his voice the way it's slowly built and that lovely little hook before the chorus and then the chorus is like oh it's a shame maybe we'll get a cool bridge i really really wanted to like it like i went in it was great i wanted that to feel that surprise and feel oh oh my god portugal yes too repetitive too slow but i love what he's doing with his [Music] [Music] voice i just love him [Music] maybe not tonight oh that was sad that was a bit sad then oh well on the whole i like that a lot i loved the sound of that the production was gorgeous the composition the instruments the sound of it his voice and what he was doing he was properly singing and the staging at the beginning when it was all black and white and the effect was on it was quite cool but the chorus i i want to hear that again because i feel like it will grow and i want to like it more than i currently do and i haven't felt that with many songs i don't know this artist i don't know this i don't i guess the black mamba is a group and it's just a huge rubber [ __ ] it's just a huge rubber [ __ ] stop it sorry the senior it's it's i don't remember when there was such a contrast between how i feel to a singer and how i can do a song with him the moment he started to sing there was i fell in love yeah i felt i felt like i'm feeling in love with this singer and i want okay give it to me give it give it to me deliver it deliver the song chorus arrived and i was like but the end of the song was cool but the end of the song was scored they tried that was something yes really nicely and the final chorus was a bit softer so it wasn't such a they will have to do something with the chorus i would have thought you can't change the you can't because it was kind of like call an answer he sang the really slow line and then all the instruments responded to him and then he went back to a slow line then instruments came back it's like i don't know something a bit meh but i really like that that's a really cool thing i am not disappointed and portugal i like the idea of loving portugal's song to the competition please let us know in the comments below what you thought about the black mamba love is on my side the black mamba it's just a huge few months back we sat down here and decided to reset

The result was a highly-praised book, entitled\n\u201cSerpentine\u201d, which underlines the striking beauty of the otherwise deadly creatures. Against a black velvet backdrop, the award-winning\nphotographer captured the coiling snakes\u2019 texture, color and form. The stunning photographs came at a price as\nLaita ended up suffering for his art in a brutal encounter with a black mamba. Throughout his collaboration with various\ncollectors, Laita knew that proper safety measures needed to be taken. While photographing the spitting cobra, for\nexample, he wore protective equipment. The king cobra was photographed while encased\nin an acrylic glass box. Then, one collector approached him holding\na black mamba, which is among the most venomous snakes in the animal kingdom. Laita wore shorts at the time so that the\nsnake wouldn\u2019t be startled by the movements of pants material. It was also a precaution against the worst-case-scenario\nof the snake crawling up the pants leg, free to bite into vulnerable areas. At one point, the black mamba started circling\nLaita\u2019s foot. The photographer then switched to a different\ncamera to better capture what was going on. As the collector reached in with a hook to\ndraw the snake away, the mamba bumped into a red cable that was hanging down. It got startled and, within moments, sunk\nits fangs into Laita\u2019s calf. At first, the man felt nothing but soon enough\nblood started gushing out of his leg. Both fangs had struck an artery. The collector repeatedly asked Laita about\nhis heart and breathing, fearing that envenomation had occurred. However, roughly 20 minutes later, the photographer\nstill felt fine apart from the blood that had soaked his sock and filled his sneaker. Laita would report intense pain throughout\nthe following night, but ultimately recovered. It could\u2019ve been much worse when considering\nthat the snake\u2019s venom glands hadn\u2019t been removed. Fortunately, it was older and most likely\nbit without injecting venom, which is known as a dry bite. Even if it had released venom, the severe\nbleeding would\u2019ve probably washed it out of the wound before it could take hold. As he was going through the pictures he\u2019d\ntaken, Laita discovered one of the snake still latched onto his leg. He didn\u2019t remember taking the shocking photo\nand it potentially occurred as an involuntary reaction to the sudden attack. The picture subsequently went viral and provided\na harrowing perspective for anyone who knows what the black mamba is truly capable of. What Is It? Dendroaspis polylepsis, commonly known as\nthe black mamba, is among the most dangerous snakes in the animal kingdom. It belongs to the Elapidae family, the members\nof which have fixed hollow fangs used for injecting venom and subduing prey. The snake\u2019s common name is derived from\nthe Zulu word \u201cimamba\u201d which translates as \u201cscales\u201d. Of all the venomous snake species, the black\nmamba is exceeded in length only by the king cobra. Exceptionally large adults have been reported\nat close to 15 feet. The black mamba has medium-sized eyes and\na coffin-shaped head with a rather pronounced brow ridge. It\u2019s a front-fanged snake and the inside\nof its mouth is dark in color, ranging from bluish-grey to nearly black. It\u2019s where the snake gets its name from. When it comes to skin color, juveniles are\ntypically lighter than adults, which vary considerably, from olive to a metal-like grey. Black mambas usually hunt from permanent lairs\nwhile mostly preying on birds and small mammals, such as rodents or bats. The aggressive snake has earned a fearsome\nreputation in its native sub-Saharan Africa. It possesses highly toxic venom that wreaks\nhavoc on the human body, which is why encounters are best avoided in the wild. Number 4: Arslan Valeev\n31-year-old Russian YouTuber Arslan Valeev purposefully allowed his pet black mamba to\nbite him and then live streamed his final moments. Valeev, a former zoo employee, ran a channel\nfeaturing exotic animals alongside his wife Ekaterina Pyatyzhkina. The couple had hundreds of thousands of followers. The two snake enthusiasts then started having\nmarital problems. Valeev was physically abusive towards Pyatyzhkina\nupon suspicion that she\u2019d been unfaithful. The 24-year-old woman moved out of their marital\nhome. She filed for divorce and started seeing another\nman, who was reportedly involved in the rare animal trade. Then, five days short of their wedding anniversary,\nValeev let a black mamba bite his hand and started talking to his subscribers on YouTube. During the live stream he expressed regrets\nat the way he\u2019d treated his wife and the pain he felt living without her. He told his viewers \u201cIf I die, then I die\u201d. While the bite itself wasn\u2019t shown, Valeev\nlifted a bloodied finger towards the camera. He visibly started to wither away as he was\ntalking about his relationship. Valeev was aware that he was slowly dying\nfrom the black mamba venom. He gave those watching Pyatyzhkina\u2019s number\nand pleaded with them to call her so that he could see her one last time. However, by the time the woman got the call,\nit was already too late. Valeev stumbled off camera and into the street. Pyatyzhkina rushed to the home, where the\ncamera was still on but Valeev was gone. He\u2019d been taken to the hospital, where he\nlater died. Pyatyzhkina said that she\u2019d loved him very\nmuch and that, despite their problems, they were still husband and wife. Valeev\u2019s father said that he felt hatred\ntowards those who\u2019d encouraged his son to keep venomous snakes at his home and use them\nfor entertainment. Where Is It Located? The black mamba is widely distributed throughout\nsub-Saharan Africa, in countries such as Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia,\nRwanda, South Africa, Namibia and others. Aside from certain areas in Zambia and Kenya,\nthe black mamba is rarely found at altitudes above 3,300 feet. It prefers a moderately dry environment such\nas semi-arid savannas, rocky outcrops or light woodland. It\u2019s both terrestrial and arboreal, meaning\nthat it can also live in trees. On the ground it moves with its head and neck\nraised, finding shelter in tree cracks, abandoned burrows, rock crevices or termite mounds. During the mating season males compete in\nwrestling matches that involve intertwining their bodies and using their necks in submission\nattempts. The black mamba is an oviparous snake and\nfemales lay up to 17 eggs. The young are known to grow quickly, capable\nof reaching nearly 7 feet after their first year. Juveniles are highly apprehensive and can\nbe just as deadly as the adults. The black mamba\u2019s life span, in the wild,\nmay exceed 11 years. They don\u2019t have many natural predators,\nwith the exception of several bird species, such as eagles and vultures, which are experts\nin hunting snakes. Mongoose and honey badgers will also sporadically\nprey on the snake, since they have some resistance to black mamba venom. That\u2019s mainly because their muscular receptors\ndon\u2019t bind the alpha-neurotoxins in the venom. Number 3: Ryan Soobrayan\nRyan Soobrayan died from a black mamba bite while he was trying to extract venom for medical\nresearch. The incident happened at a reptile facility\nin Johannesburg, South Africa. African Reptiles and Venom provides snake\nidentification, treatment of bites as well as programs aimed at raising awareness. Soobrayan was in charge of venom extraction\nat the facility and would even provide training for others. The herpetologist was described as a highly\ncompetent snake handler who loved his job. As he was working with the black mamba, he\ngot a pinprick on his thumb from one of its fangs. Moments later, he asked his colleagues for\nhelp and collapsed. Despite their efforts, Soobrayan died on the\nspot. It would have normally taken longer for the\nvenom to put his life in jeopardy. However, what happened in Soobrayan\u2019s particularly\ntragic case was that he went into anaphylactic shock. He\u2019d suffered a severe allergic reaction\nto the snake bite, which ultimately claimed his life. Today's topic was requested by Instagram follower\n@kingjards.

The black mamba represents a deadly mixture\nof venom toxicity and aggressive temperament which arguably makes it the most feared snake\non the African continent. When it attacks, it delivers several quick\nstrikes and injects considerable venom with each one. It\u2019s a highly athletic snake, capable of\nslithering speeds of up to 10 mph. Because of its size and ability to raise its\nhead a considerable distance from the ground, the black mamba can launch well-over a third\nof its body upwards. This means that attacks on humans can occur\nabove the waist as well. The black mamba can have up to 20 drops of\nvenom in its fangs and only two are enough to kill an adult human being. The venom differs markedly from that of other\nmamba species and predominantly contains neurotoxins, which target the central nervous system. The venom is fast-acting, incredibly potent\nand features toxic agents from two main families. The first are dendrotoxins, which have an\nexcitatory effect causing symptoms such as sweating. The second are three-finger toxins, named\nafter their common structure of three connected beta strand loops. These include alpha-neurotoxins, cardiotoxins,\nfasciculins and mambalgins, each with intense effects on the human body. Out of all of them, the most toxic components\nare the alpha-neurotoxins. They block neuromuscular transmission thus\ncausing paralysis. Cardiotoxins impact the heart muscle while\nfasciculins cause muscle twitches. Interestingly enough, mambalgins, the snake\u2019s\nproprietary toxins, have a pain-inhibiting effect. This is why there\u2019s research interest in\nits analgesic potential and why the World Health Organization has classified the black\nmamba as a snake of medical importance. Its bites won\u2019t generally cause necrosis\nor swelling and the only initial sign might be a tingling sensation in the extremities. It\u2019s often that symptoms start to develop\nwithin 10 minutes of envenomation. Here\u2019s what\u2019s likely to happen if a black\nmamba bites you and injects a large amount of venom. You\u2019d begin to feel a metal-like taste in\nyour mouth and gradually lose control of your jaw and tongue. You\u2019d likely feel tingling in your lips,\narms or toes. Aside from slurred speech, you\u2019ll experience\nnausea, vomiting, blurred vision and uncontrollable salivation. Symptoms progress to respiratory failure,\ncardiovascular collapse and death. Some fatalities have occurred within as little\nas 20 minutes after the victim was bitten. Untreated bites that cause severe envenomation\nare almost always deadly. Number 2: Nathan Layton\nNathan Layton was a British trainee safari guide who had a deadly encounter with a black\nmamba at the college where he and his girlfriend were studying. The snake had been found near a classroom\nat the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit. The snake escaped as Layton and an instructor\nwere transferring it into a glass jar. It was during attempts to recapture the snake\nthat the 28-year-old student got bitten. However, he hadn\u2019t felt the bite but only\nthe snake brushing his hand so he carried on with his classes. He then asked an instructor if black mamba\nbites were supposed to bleed and showed her his index finger. There reportedly wasn\u2019t any visible mark\nand, after asking him if he experienced any tingling, the instructor deemed that Layton\nwas fit to continue the lecture. About half an hour later he started complaining\nfrom blurry vision and collapsed. Attempts to revive him proved futile and he\ndied with his girlfriend by his side. It was later reported that the college didn\u2019t\nhave any antivenom on site, which could have saved Layton\u2019s life. How to Survive? Black mamba bites are very rare outside Africa\nand the most common victims in those cases are usually snake handlers or collectors. In the wild, black mambas are most irritable\nfrom September to February, a time frame in which breeding occurs. This is also the peak period for deadly encounters\nand thus the period when it\u2019s best to avoid trekking through the black mamba\u2019s natural\nhabitat. They rarely tolerate humans approaching within\nmore than 130 feet. They\u2019ll either attack or retreat into a\nbush or a hole. There are a few signs that an attack is coming. The snake will engage in a threat display\nthat involves raising its head, opening its mouth and flicking its tongue. The black mamba may also hiss or spread its\nneck-flap. Should you see such a display, it\u2019s best\nto back away slowly without making sudden moves. Be sure not to accidentally block the snake\u2019s\npath if it wants to retreat. The black mamba is agile and delivers a series\nof rapid-fire strikes. A bite is to be considered a medical emergency. Death generally occurs within 30 minutes to\n3 hours. If help is not immediately within reach, standard\nsnake bite treatment should be applied. This means applying an arterial tourniquet\nor a bandage at the bite site and keeping movement of the affected body part to a minimum. Make sure the bandage is neither too tight\nnor too loose. Don\u2019t try to cut or suck the venom out. Try to keep calm as an elevated heart rate\nmay hasten the spreading of venom throughout the body. Medical treatment involves the use of polyvalent\nantivenom and several facilities have been working towards developing specific black\nmamba antivenom. Number 1: Danie Pienaar\nIn 1998, years before he became the head of the South African National Parks Scientific\nServices, Danie Pienaar was just a student tracking white rhinos at Kruger National Park. It was then and there that Pienaar barely\nsurvived a black mamba bite. He was alone in the wilderness when he saw\na black mamba slithering past him. Pienaar then noticed four blue-purple holes\nin his leg. It wasn\u2019t long before he started to experience\na metal taste in his mouth and a tingling sensation in his lips and fingertips, the\nfirst symptoms of envenomation. For a brief moment he considered resting against\na tree and writing farewell notes to his friends and family. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d manage to get help\nin time. However, he ultimately decided to try and\nreach his pickup truck. Even though he knew he shouldn\u2019t, he tried\nto use his knife to open up the wound and release the venom but was unsuccessful. Pienaar then wrapped a belt around the upper\npart of his leg. He left everything behind except for his gun\nand compass and moved slowly towards his vehicle, careful not to raise his heartbeat. He reached his pickup truck and darted through\na tourist road until he found help. Pienaar arrived at a hospital two hours after\nhe\u2019d been bitten. His symptoms had intensified by then, but\nhe was still able to tell the doctors what had happened. After they removed the tourniquet, Pienaar\u2019s\ncondition deteriorated rapidly. He couldn\u2019t swallow or speak properly and,\nat one point, lapsed into a coma. He was incubated and spent three days on life\nsupport but ultimately recovered. The fact that he\u2019d managed to stay calm\nafter being bitten and the decision to place the tourniquet had most likely saved his life. Thanks for watching!

five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six and seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight okay this is lesson five and this is the chorus okay so we've just gone one two three four five six seven eight so now you're in the center to do the drop what you're going to do is you're going to put all the weight on your left leg and just slide your right out like that so you need to be on a slippery surface for this to not hurt like your feet if you have carpet um you don't want to get carpet bun if you have wooden floor that'll be the best and then wear socks so you can slide but not too slippery otherwise you will hurt yourself so you wanna put the weight on your left slide like that as you do that you wanna circle your arms and push down and you're gonna do like a tiny bounce okay so that's one two so what you're gonna do is you're gonna push yourself up like that to go over to the other side okay so push all the weight back in your left heel to push yourself up to go the other way uh what you're gonna do at the same time is rotate your head do a hair spin that way to the left so you're going to spin your hair okay now as you can see at the same time as i spin my hair around to help you this left arm needs to go that way so turn your hand this way as you turn your head okay it's going to help you to go over to the other side as you spin your hair around you can see my left hand has switched to this side so you're going to go all the way down on the other leg here like that okay and you're going all the way to the other side until seven and then on eight i'm going to show you the next position so from here from the top this is one two three four bend your right knee five six weight is transitioning to the right knee seven then on eight what you're gonna do take your hands off the ground now you're gonna put the right knee directly to the floor so you're gonna do quite a reach you're gonna reach over here so you're gonna put the right knee to the ground lean over on your right arm and hold the left like this so the left that was straight is going to come up and you're going to put your left hand on it we're going to go down again so one two three four five six seven eight okay so you can wear knee pads if you want because your knee is going to slam to the floor uh your right knee seven eight now you're gonna get this left knee and the left hand the left knee is gonna curve in okay so curve down to the floor come up like this and then you're gonna push it straight out as you do that you're gonna have your left hand on your left hip looking to the right so coming down here this is seven eight then this will go one two then you're going to put your left knee now to the ground here slide it in now you're going to get ready to go on this toe and then you're going to come up with this right knee now and you're going to flick your hands out like this this hand was here and this hand was here you're just gonna curve them over here with hands out like that on the side from the top this is one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six okay so from here just put your left knee to the ground now you're on both knees to get you ready to bring this right leg up hands here then finally you're gonna come back up to the top and you're gonna put this right hand brush it down the side of your face as you come up so that's the floor part okay so let's go from the beginning this is one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight after this you're going to step out to the left and you're going to put your hand into fists on your hips okay and as we do that we're going to circle our hips from left to right so this is one two three four then we're going to circle our hips around again and put our hands like this joint together circle around so the hands that were here are going to go back on the left around on the right then these are very very fast moves okay so this is on my mamba once you get to about here right hand is going to go to the other hip left hand's going to go to the other hip open and then you're going to slide down your knees like that and as you slide down your knees you're bending head up and then finally you're going to bend your knees and you're going to put right over the left over here so this is on the move after you go here okay it's very fast when you actually do it at 100 speed so from here one two three four spin ma like that and then you're going to put these hands back behind you as you do that you're going to bounce forward on your toes or on your right toe so you're going to bounce forward then back okay and then you're going to come forward again and push your hands that will back here up on your head on the top of your head here and look up as well from this bit this is one two three four five and six and seven eight one two three then on four you're going to swing your hands back around this way so four now as you're swinging on four left hand is going to go on your h the left hand is going to go on the hip and the right hand is just going to come out here because you're going to hit inwards on the top so the palm is facing outwards on the top swing out hit with your knee and then come back so from here this is one two three four spin ma ma ma bounce bounce push and around here and then you're going to circle two times to the left so what i mean is you're going to get your hands into fists now you're going to circle once with your hips are going to follow circle once quickly circle again lift your right leg off the floor push your fists over to the left with your head this will go boom ma ma ma one two three four five six seven eight okay just to recap the first half i will go back and do the leg drop just to add in the two parts five six seven eight this is one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five and six and seven eight one two three four five six seven eight okay so we've just gone boom boom so what we're going to do from here is we're going to push these fists down our body as we do that we're going to go back on the right leg with our head going to the right as well then step back on the left then the right okay so from here this is one two three four five six so they should be fully down now your fists then you're going to go seven eight so you're on the right at the moment you're going to tap your left foot to the ground cross your hands as you do that open cross jump open straight with your hands in fists okay so from here this is one two three four five six seven eight okay now on every i yeah yeah yeah part you're going to go from left to right i'm gonna have to actually say the word because i can't count and do this part at the same time i can't really do it mentally so i'm gonna have to say the words so you're gonna put your hands on either side and you're gonna go to the left so you're gonna put your left fist is shorter so your right fist is going out that way you're going to put your head to the left and as you can see i'm very very slightly bending in the right knee then you're going to go to the right side and push that other arm away from you slightly bring in your left and you're going to alternate that on each word so you're going to go i yeah yeah yeah yeah and then on the last one you're going to go to the left but you're not going to look to the left you're going to look to the front it's very very fast okay so you're going to go ah yeah yeah yeah yeah back to the front okay so left right left right left right left and then on hey you're gonna go hey you're going to lift your arms up bend your knees in the center hey arms up and then straight down okay so from the top of this bit this is one two three four five six seven eight ah yeah yeah yeah yeah then hey down okay then you're going to start on your left hip when we step from side to side but what you're going to do is you're going to bring your fist up to the top this time from bottom to top before we went down now we're going to push the fists up like this all the way to the top as we do that we're going to start on our left leg go to the left right left so you should be all the way up to the top on the on the left now then you're going to tap your right foot this time to the floor to cross and open for the next ayah bit okay from this bit where we push up this will go one two three four five six seven eight left right left right left right left now you're actually going to stay on the left you're gonna look to the left on the final time and stay here so this is on five six and then on seven

over over here joining our right leg okay so this will go left right left right left right left six seven eight then we just get into that really small transition bit before the next verse so before we do that i'm just going to recap this part here so this is one two three four five six seven eight left right left right left right left up down then we push up now one two three four five six seven eight left right left right left right left stay on the left and then seven eight now we're doing the little small transition bit where everyone's sort of like running around and doing their own thing going to their place and i will be following giselle when i am doing this part because it's going to slowly build up into her verse anyway so we've just gone here and pull over here so what we're going to do is quite simple you're going to put your hands into fists and you're going to run on the spot and bend your knees and come up like that to the front so this is one two three four keep running and you're gonna brush your hands on your knees and then your thighs from here seven eight one two three four five six now stop running and you're going to go seven eight you're going to hold that pose so from here you're going to step out to the right and put your right hand out lean on the right hip right hand out and the back of the left hand on the side of your head like this then you're going to brush your hands down the back of your head run to the right side from this this will be one two three four put your hands down five six then on seven eight we're going to bend our knees to the right side with the left knee in you're gonna put your hands on your knees like this bend down seven eight and you're gonna brush the right hand up the left arm and this continues into the next verse so from the end of the chorus here seven eight this will go one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one it continues one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five and six and seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two and three four and five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two and three four and five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight this is lesson six and this is verse three okay so we've just gone here seven eight we're going to continue this for one two okay so keep brushing up seven eight one two now put your left hand on your hip step out to the left get the right index finger and thumb and you're going to hit out to the top left and back on three four okay then you're going to get the left fist okay and you're gonna step with the right slide over here so this will be on five six join your feet together then on seven eight you're gonna put your hands to your knees you're gonna curve your head down and roll your body back up so you're just doing like a wave back up so from the top here seven eight one two three four five six seven eight so as you're coming back up this is eight you're gonna hold it for one then quickly with your hands you're gonna go two and three so you're going to quickly brush the right shoulder right left and your head kind of follows right left and then finally you're going to lean on the left hip put the right hand in front of you and then the left hand to your mouth like this and look up at it like pretend like it's a mirror or like a phone like a selfie or something so when you finish here seven eight one two and three four five you hold here until five and then you're going to go six seven eight so from this you're going to get your hands together push them down switch your hip to the right side so you push down and you lean forward okay so from the top this goes from here seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two and three four five six seven eight then you're gonna step out to the left and right so left right as we do that we're gonna fling our hands out as we're flinging them the left hand is in a fist and the right hand is in a gun gesture so from this you're going to fling out by stepping with the left here then when you step with the right you're going to have the left fist underneath the right elbow and the gun gesture in between your chest like this and you're going to lift your head up once from this this is one two three four now she's going to like go underneath the arms of the other members so this again whenever you're by yourself these types of moves are going to look a bit different or odd because you're by yourself so what you're going to do is you're going to step back on your right get your right fist and pretend to push something back behind you so go on your right leg step backwards push this behind you now step foot with your left foot bring this hand up and brush it down the back of your head from here this is one two three four five six seven eight now step out to the left get your hands open brush down step with the right and have them out into fists okay so from here this is one two then you're going to go three bend your head to the left three four you're gonna get a gun gesture and turn it like the other way so the palm is facing the right push it straight forward okay so from here one two three four now you're going to go five six push this that way and slide over this way five six slide in your right leg then on seven eight you're just gonna slide back into your place seven eight on the right so from this this is one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two and three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight this is lesson seven and this is verse four so what we're going to be doing is the same moves as before where we do this in the last verse but instead of stepping like this quickly we're going to step out to the left right and left right and middle okay so you're going left right and left right and middle so you're doing those exact same hand movements but you're just doing it by stepping instead so this is going to go one two three four five six seven eight one two so in the middle now three then on and four we're going to go and four so that's when we do the gun gesture on this side and four then same thing five six seven on seven that's when we flick out and back okay then on eight and quickly we're gonna go eight and from here we're going to push our right fist and left fist up then on one we're going to push these fists back behind us as we do that we're pushing our head and our chest forward and we're twisting our body this way leaning on the left knee forward the left knee is twisting in this is eight and one then we're going to go two lean on the left hip clap your hands together then you're going to quickly open and close okay your hands this is eight and one two and then you're going to go back again where we pushed our hips and our body this way but this time we're going to get these hands open them out on either side behind us okay so we're pushing the knee forward like before lifting our chest and then finally you're going to land here so what you're going to do is you're going to twist in your right knee lean over this side right hand is going to go across your shoulder left hand across your hip and just like cover yourself like this from the top this goes one two and three four and five six and seven eight and one two and three four and then finally you're going to step back on your right leg brush this right hand under your chin like this and like push your head to the right as well so you're like this at the moment one two then step with your left foot three four and then on and you're going to join your feet together put your hands on either side like this so the left is on the bottom right is on the top palms facing out you're going to step to the right and curl your hands into fists and go the opposite direction bring in your left leg so from here this is one two three four five six seven then like before in the last verse in the last lesson which was i think lesson three you're going to jump apart and shake your shoulders quickly right left right okay from here again one two three four five six seven eight and one two and three four and five six and seven eight and one two and three four and five six and seven eight and this is lesson eight and this is the second pre-chorus there's only a few minor changes so we've just gone like this okay this is similar to before so what you're going to do is you're going to hold it for one then on two this time you're going to get this hand it's going to come around like before but instead of sliding down our chest we're going gonna push this hand down onto our right knee over here so from this this is gonna go one two three four this is similar to before as well you're gonna spin your left fist around here now before we pointed down here this time we're going to point over here okay so this is one two three four five six seven so pointing down on the left side then we're going to quickly go eight and it's like similar it's the exact same as before but we're doing it this side so you're going to raise your index finger come back up then what you're going to do this is different you're going to get your right elbow push this back behind you and you're going to brush this left hand across as we do that after we go boom boom you're going to put all the weight onto your right leg and you're gonna push down with your left arm and your left leg coming this way okay so this is gonna go from here one two three four five six seven eight and one two three four now the same bit as before five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight now before we went like this this time it's a bit different so we've gone seven eight you're gonna step back on your right leg you're gonna get a gun gesture push it into your body like this and as you push it in the left elbows coming up so it's like they go against each other okay so you're gonna step back on your right leg bend on the right knee like this and push a gun gesture all the way out to the front okay this will be on one two three four now you're going to push this in bring your body in like that five six now step to the left seven eight like before to get ready for the big drop again so from here we stomp five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight and then get ready for the drop so the drop in the chorus is all the same and everything is the same the only slight difference is building up to the bridge so we're going to go from here one two three four five six seven eight left right left right left right left up down one two three four five six seven eight left right left right left right left and you hold here four six seven then on eight we're going to cross our arms fists cross the fist and bring up your left knee so from here six seven eight and you just hold here because in the bridge we're going to go down like that so lift your left knee up cross your arms that's the only difference in the chorus one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six and seven eight one two three four five six seven eight one two three four five six seven eight this is lesson nine and this is the

profile - huh - no so now I'm used to it and it was protecting the nature itself always always driven me from when I was young to protect the environment when I come out of the training made very different people my favorite part of my job is patrolling the fence go around the sleeping was less every hour I called him to check on them we didn't find something suspicious we call for backup usually we're not using weapons where eyes and ears of the reserves we are doing it differently this one poaching is bigger than guns and bullets and we are going through schools to teach children's about the environment about how to protect the animals system that is not good to kill an animal that will like you because we didn't have that opportunity there was no one to tell us about the life of animals and now visiting is 668 learners that we're reaching awareness isn't the main objective to be a black member it means we are tough and strong young ladies who can work in the bushes without no fear I know that I'm helping the animals out there as a black member I feel proud in a community when I'm wearing mine and people when they look up at me they see a euro if we lost around I than we failed we mark our success on the amount of time that we've gone without losing within one year they've brought down snaring by 86 percent and there'd been no rhino poaching in this region either that

down by 16 they leave my cool exactly a minute for free [Applause] [Applause] started to take matter to do his own hand you gotta containers [Applause] first the big question because also few have done it and most have failed as you know come out of high school to the pros it was just the challenge that was big that you would have been the challenge it would have been a challenge but no human people say that yeah the opportunity go to Indiana played against the greatest players in the world that do that get you going on thing anything well what I really feel like to put on the the Golden Boot and purple well feels great because it's just so much pride you know behind the uniform having the legacy that's behind the uniform I remember growing up and seeing Earvin Johnson coming today coming to the NBA with LA Lakers and win another championship say me mr. Scott and worthy and so forth and when I step on the court you just feel so much pride to try to carry on this tradition carry on the legacy that mr. West and Chamberlain and the chapter and they all had did and all that still did so it's just so much pride in you it's like a dream come true I decided to see my talents [Music] Heaviside escaped college too much house Olivier with the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft the Charlotte Hornets select Kobe Bryant from Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania [Applause] the coming-out party for the high school kid Kobe Bryant meeting with the approval of that charlotte's man in attendance here and here we this is a guy whose stock has risen every time he's tried out people like this trick everyone writing when he first came out well he's gonna have to bulk up this guy is 200 pounds at six foot six he is an offensive Wiz the very very talented as all-pro hooves and when when you you look at him you're talking about a young man with range he can go off the dribble he can get his shot and in every place that he down nothing but grades no one talking and in shortness or a weakness in his game Jerry West told me today that greatness lies ahead to this young man thought he was going to be absolutely fantastic I recruited him out of high school at skin Bay College into a very physical game all he did was averaged 31 points the game is seniors here as people three losses in which the packagin i think what you like best about him everyone says that he makes everyone else around him a better player say a wedding style guy if we realize that there's a lot to overcome when you come right out of high school but if anyone has a good chance this young man is blessed with outstanding offensive skills what was it like the tryouts what did you learn well I learned that you have to work hard you have to approach the game with a serious mindset there's a step off from high school when I understand that so therefore every time I step on a basketball court I will put a strong effort out there on the floor I'm not gonna leave anything on the floor you had the grades you had the scores to go to college why do you mean it's open the challenge nope I was 40 years old and I'm sitting back and I'm looking back at my career if I went to college for failure MBA maybe I had a great career maybe not and I'm stopping that down my mom could I answer that challenge could I've responded to the challenge of the day and that's something I didn't want to have on my on my shoulders so I just really accepted he's gonna wear number eight and Kobe uh this is for you and also they have mr. Watts match exactly bring the ball up the crew at night they said visit myself you know in the hallways at the house knocking down lamps and you know creating all kinds of chaos in the house and thinking about Magic Johnson just like it's just like a dream come true straight out of high school he's been a catalyst for the team and a favorite with advertisers and fans Charlie Rose met him in 2001 when the Lakers were going for their second straight title show me a trademark Kobe shot trademark Kobe shot yeah what's a signature shot Kobe has the ball you know that the offense is set up but he's gonna take Chuck what's a signature shot you can counter this move everything all right tell me which one we can get yeah [Applause] that's the kind of play that is serving Kobe Bryant and his Los Angeles Lakers very well he's one of the game's most dominant players and for good reason I love playing basketball it's nothing like it what is it you love this is the ball when it bounces the sound that it makes smell of a basketball the nets you shoot the ball and it goes right through the net sniggers has a squeak on the word strategies the competition the camaraderie the fans will only learn or I take you to this scene 20 seconds left to go you're down by one you want the ball you want to take the last shot absolutely I'm not afraid to fail and I I just love it it's just an adrenaline rush everybody in the crowd stands up and anybody's waiting to see if you're gonna make this shot if you're gonna lose the game where you gonna win the game just unbelievable rush besides he got lost for a second Kobe Bryant was a different kind of kid with a different kind of upbringing he spent most of his childhood in Italy where his father played after leaving the NBA the Bryant family spent the next eight seasons there Italia started for as great over an Italian school I was six assists there was seven my assistant was eight what influence do you think it had on you I think it made me more mature you know we had to grow up a lot faster I think it uh it brought us closer together as a family that's moving out there into a whole nother world we didn't speak the language we didn't know anybody we had to bond with one another more so than anything he also continued to bond with basketball but without the competition found at American playgrounds and schools his family came back to Philadelphia every summer and he learned quickly what he was missing so I come back to American to summertime I play to some of you and I don't school Point summer at one point the entire summer not one point not a free-throw not a layup not a steal nothing zero points don't hold summer and my father came up to me afterwards he gave me a hug he said son don't worry we're gonna love you if you score a zero a fifty yeah you know and ice we were thinking when Bryant's father retired from the game the family came back to the United States for good after a stellar high school career Kobe Bryant skipped college and went directly to the NBA today five years later he continues to defy expectation unlike a lot of players he prefers practice to partying when he isn't practicing he's working out when he isn't working out he's studying game tapes in his room there's no time left for socializing with his teammates a sore point says his head coach at the Lakers Phil Jackson last year I said you know some of the players came to me and say you know that you don't even want to go down have you know I'll buy tea with him or go to a movie with him and you know if you want to be a leader of these guys you gotta accommodate what they like and find a common niche he's had a hard time fitting in on the court - since the start of his career Kobe Bryant has been accused of not being a team player when he takes control of a game away from the Lakers of a superstar center Shaquille O'Neal and plays too aggressively the Lakers sometimes lose games they should have won this season Bryant could feel the chill on the court you just felt like something was amiss between you and your team some wasn't right some wasn't right I mean I go to practice and I feel a little uncomfortable was this about this wasn't there before something must be someone to be going on around here and what was it about well it was about me is about them thinking I was out for myself and I was being selfish which was totally not the case it is without question one of the league's most talented players but he has been criticized for poor shot selection and not playing a team game Peter spoke with the Lakers phenom the tough situation because we all want to win and Curt he wants his players today on practice he wants them there every day he wasn't doing on time yeah I practice at eleven when she's got eleven o'clock shot ready to go it doesn't mean 11:05 and I probably want you there quarter two of them exactly once you did warmed up and ready want you to just be ready to go fool out at 11 o'clock it doesn't want anybody to disobey that and especially with a couple of losses that we've had playoffs right around the corner he's fed up some of the shots eat space at this stage of his career are questionable sometimes it's so electrifying you could give him whenever I got to the point while it's kind of low or energy they've always did it pick me up and help me out kind of urged me along whoo Shaq and he's been very very supportive especially I'm being certain ball games oh I miss three shots in a row I turn the basketball over something like that hey man I said let's go relax won't get this job done and they always be very very supportive when Kurt takes you out and he has taken you out a few times for quick shots with plenty of time left on the clock what do you say what is he saying how do you handle that when you come back in mad as any player is I mean you don't wanted to take taking out a ball game because I just love the play so much regardless of his for a mistake oh it's not for mistake I won't be any play but at the same time I am I'm with him and I've told him that whatever decision you want to make whether it is to see me down or run a certain play or whatever it is I owe much you do you learn from it Toby yeah yeah you have no choice yeah but I still see I mean that look I'm sure you know that I've been on your case a little bit on TV you know we're same same exact start but I see how much talent you have and I know how young you are but do we want to use that as an excuse or are you learning no on the run I'm kind of learning on the run I think if you look at the years I've been a lead I think you've seen improvements for a shot selecting votes I'm gonna get some uh tapes from last season's at all all kind of happened myself at taking certain shots because I'll take those now are we to play a little bit better it's again I think I've actually learned pretty quickly because I've had a lot of other things too adjustable as well my big question is with the season dwindling away the games are the Lakers running out of time to become a team team this is where Brian emerged as a rising star Lower Merion High School in suburban Philadelphia he enrolled here in 1992 when he was 14 after his family spent seven years in Europe where his father finished his career Bryant says his fondest memory of high school is winning the 1996 state championship his senior year when he was also named a McDonald's all-american and Gatorades Player of the Year but hoped that success came a perceived arrogance by some that led to Bryant's highly scrutinized announcement in May of 1996 the 1996 NBA Draft was a month later Brian's hometown Sixers had the first overall pick they chose consensus number one pick Georgetown guard Allen Iverson Bryant was picked 13th overall by the Charlotte Hornets before being traded to the Lakers that summer Bryant developed into a superstar and by his fourth season helped the Lakers win the 2000 NBA championship [Music] you're gonna take over give us what your opinion is in reference to why there seems to be a love-hate relationship with Kobe let's go to Pat and Southwest Philadelphia nerd and arrogant he just doesn't seem like a nice guy at all like them as a person I think a lot of that is because he plays in Los Angeles you know that's a tensile town that's glamour I mean come on Philadelphia is a blue-collar hard-working City I just get the feeling from watching you guys in the last few games that the team collectively figures that this season is over - my view from from the studio that that they feel that you know you're mentally mentally whipped mm-hmm that you've lost that edge know would you consider yourself friends don't definitely yeah don't question during the Shaq years were you guys friends know the game you know the two great players can't get along covert was just trying to do too much when you're that good you can do too much but when you play on the team you shouldn't have to be that awful there was kind of a Kobe on one side and I should kill the faction on the other whenever they went through me the outcomes the the big dog and me then the house won't get guarded I don't know why anybody else would want to change father they're selfish reasons just get off it except ever really seriously I just so you know we should stop asking me about it what would I do if you were the GM would you have kept Shaquille O'Neal and tried to work this thing out well I would have I think everybody would would probably say the same thing but I don't know what the intricacies were on the deal Shaq what had to do was best when he and his family he said so after the last game we played you know saying oh this is a business and he's gonna have to make the best decision for he and his family and that's what he did your opinion of Kobe Bryant as a player he's a great player I think if he I think if he did the little things he'd be a great player to ever play the game but he's a great player what are the little things make everybody else better he'll be the greatest play ever better than Mike better than Shaq better than Duncan be the greatest player it's a great player said that minutes out what do you think of Kobe Bryant as a person there's a matter what I think think about him as a person when I was out there on the court doing my job I play team ball so there wasn't matter what I thought about him off the court let's see what people understand is I don't have time to think about people at the court I got five kids running on my Master's I gotta go home and do I gotta go home and do law papers and study statistics and and all that stuff I don't have time to think about what he him doing is him doing that no I'm top of that could it have been worked out between the two of you could you guys have coexisted yeah absolutely no we have no we've had our spats we've had actual arguments on the floor of various reasons he you know used to get mad at me for not playing a team basketball I see they're mad at me because it wasn't in tip-top shape but you know we put our differences aside when I didn't plate and and we won and we played great in doing that so even the coexisted we know we have coexisted part of the problems Kobe at least as far as your relationship with Shaquille O'Neal go back to your court case where it was revealed that you had suggested and I don't have a quote exactly that Shaquille O'Neal maybe has paid off women in the past when's the last time you talked to Shaq did you ever apologize for those statements you know I haven't had an opportunity to talk to him directly um but if I do get at that opportunity I definitely why not call me it's been months why not yeah I could try to I could try to track him down by you know I don't have his number anything like that man I was able to get a message to him you know through a through a mutual friend but you know December 25th sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him and tell him I never I never meant any kind of way to bring you know this anything of his personal business outside like like this Kobe are you fearful that Shaq will not want to talk to you no I'm not feel fearful of it I mean I can only do what I what I feel is right you know what I mean no I feel it's right to go up and apologize to the man for for for bringing a mentor to my situation you know I never intended for that to happen and you know things were way overblown and and misstated why did you bring up his name though Kobe why even go there you know I can't really get into the details of it all I can say these things were you know they it kind of took something ran with it and it took a someplace completely you know different than what it actually was well let me ask you this question one of the things that Shaq would say and I and I know him pretty well is that Shaq would say he's not hard to find if you really really wanted to find him over the last six months or so it should have been relatively easy to find him how do you respond to that well I respond to that is you know you probably got his number I get it from you and I call him today really that supplement you know I don't have time you know I I've been through too much my family now we've been through too much to sit up here and be yes and say oh I'm not gonna I'm calling but I really don't mean it and all sort of stuff been through too much for all that you know I seriously sincerely mean I will pick up the phone and call him if he takes the call great if he doesn't you know what I mean it just you know just just know I'm sorry for all of that Kobe Bryant called you on your cell phone right now what would you say to him I don't have a cell phone because people that I'm connected with them connected with him what you got to do is think and I'll call you I don't have a cell phone and that's a problem with the diesel I'm technologically more advanced than you are my thought process begins with regular human APICS is that but is this maybe about control and almost if Jerry Krause was not here next year or in Chicago would you would that affect your decision to want to stay there oh definitely I think there's no doubt about the fact that you know that you know you look back on the relationship that the Jerry West and Pat Riley had with Los Angeles I mean you know those things and that ended after about nine years Chuck Daly McCloskey at Detroit you know that was a great relationship and both of them went on after about nine years and when different directions and I'm not saying that all marriages in this kind of a business is general manager coach's business doesn't have that lifespan but it seems to me like that is you know that's pretty much pushing the envelope Michael Jordan said coach that if you aren't in Chicago he will retire and then now that you said hey this this is your last year do you think he's going to stick to that position well in some ways I hope not I think that you know Michael should determine whether his own career is over of whether mine is with the Bulls or not for the new millennium the Lakers moved to a new home but it was a new coach that heralded a bigger change and a future more in tune with the traditions of the Lakers past without further ado the new coach to the Los Angeles Lakers Phil Jackson [Music] bill Jackson had won six NBA championships as coach of the Chicago Bulls but his impressive resume came with doubts that his unorthodox style would mesh with the Lakers youthful stars Randy Yazzie published just pivot were like but I even have it a basketball run they'll set a pig and spin pivot go stop changing the race like wheat without a basketball they practice layups without a bath swig Jackson's first challenge was to get his new players to understand him then he still had to get them to unite behind him there was a kind of a Colby faction on one side she'd kill a faction on the other and we had to bring these guys together there were some personal goals that were standing in front of the group goals and that all had to be kind of figured out it was a situation in which the I was asking them to kind of fit into roles and demanded the team to play more unselfish basketball first time my career coach came in and said look this is what you're gonna do this or what you're gonna master if you're not gonna do that then you're not gonna be here during the preseason any early optimism appeared hopelessly misplaced to make matters worse Kobe Bryant broke his hand and would miss eight weeks the season would begin with little reason for hope and even less reason to believe when Kobe returned from injury the Lakers 21 year old star also seemed more mature instantly adapting to the new team first approached when a first Innisfil salesforce is not how hard you play because you can play harder hard you went this house possibly it was vintage Laker basketball as Kobe and Shaq came together like magic shacked up them the combo Nicole becomes first with the jab and then you follow Whitney's and knockout [Music] great execution by Shack or the chef humble Jack may be fatherhood Colby [Applause] [Music] the players but it wasn't just the combo it was the constant flow of a ball that lifted the Lakers the infinite combination is possible when five players play as one we felt at that time there's no one better in the NBA and we just took off like that like uh like a bottle rocket [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] take a look at O'Neal fishing on foot Kobe Bryant on rooks who started an IV it's jump on this poster [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's ISM all the way to the rack what you spin [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's syphilis it's after having six in the first half he picks up his first [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lakers basketball Network in the first round of the playoffs the Lakers regular season confidence carried over but against the backdrop of their past failures they were all too aware of the hazards of postseason play we knew they were going to be some tests and we know being the best team in a regular season to test we won't be very off we need every team wanted to make history about being us we do that every team was going to be up for us [Applause] Coby spins in left a slight side [Applause] [Music] right now for the Lakers Oh so visa lose at home and just have a vacation we feel good baby we drove back to LA and the Lakers faced adversity for the first time in a playoffs [Applause] they failed dramatically in this first test so now you know the pressures there did we win on our home court with nothing in their experience as a team to fall back on the Lakers only had their trust in each other two click [Applause] [Music] I think every name - we had a little bit more confidence every to pull in the game out we could pull it out of any situation affect the city's been waiting for this moment just like I've been waiting for this moment you know we have opportunity to do something that hasn't been done years so I'm sure the

thinking the same thing in your locker room well in our mind this is the championship so we came out play well for Anu they're gonna come out with a lot of energy you just want to keep it close and make it nice little work now going down the stretch jack goes down all of a sudden you step but these are the kind of moments that you look for there there was a fire fouled out my ma state was no

through the night you worked so hard it was a hard-fought game we finally got a championship it feels great for 21 years you said you going dream the winner Jim Jim is it what you dreamed up on everything you're more but you have to the regular colors fall upon the ceiling fans going crazy I got the hat on and everything covering my fro [Applause] the one thing that really got you guys over the line there really pushed you to this point what would have been this thing it's just determination you know PJ did an excellent job him in his coaching staff and you know Shaq was marvelous all season long and I bet he's great he's just pulled it all together in a game like tonight where to break down the defense that's what you have to do you know just had to break them down that's all I'll just create similar to the game for situation I'll just better train train get into the gas robin or made some big shots box to the big three and we won again No love it [Applause] [Music] the next one right here syphilis we work all year long for me Shaq the man whose dominant way in the world championship was going through we went through this year the barn every formed one another for all the adversity all the struggles that we went through we had a chance where we could cave in instead we decided to pull together and come honest and stronger than we were a communitarian we created as a world made food we joke around with each other laugh at each other we stick up in June 2000 the Lakers conquered the NBA powered by the fusion of the games two brightest stars together they seem to make the Lakers unbeatable at 28 Shaquille O'Neal was the league's MVP and at 21 Kobe Bryant was fast becoming the league's best all-around player it wasn't just about winning a championship those about creating a dynasty and creating something that you know other teams can't really even speak about obviously the boys were able to do it in the 90s and the Lakers and 80s and Celtics in the 60s but there's a new time it's a new millennium and we wanted to be the basketball team in the basketball organization to kind of start the NBA legacies over but after the celebration the Lakers would learn that being a champion demands more from a team than just winning a championship the 2001 Lakers arrived at training camp as a changed team the roster had a new look Horace Grant supplanted Laker veteran AC green of power forward and in a move considered risky for team chemistry the erratic Isaiah rider was signed to replace Glen Rice the team's third leading scorer during 2001 of the Lakers inspirational leaders Derrick Fisher was lost to injury but the most important change was the loss of harmony between Shaq and Kobe who came to training camp with the same goal but opposite visions of how to achieve it Shaq had had a told that you'll really take it easy this has been a long season you put a lot of energy and he put a lot of minutes on the floor your body needs to really heal and you know don't worry about working out come back in September and start getting ready for the year and he did he came back on September 28th and started getting ready for the year instead of September 1st in Shaq's defense it was the first time he was champion and it was the first time he was able to relax once in his career and enjoy a basketball moment while the battle-weary veteran used the offseason to recharge his youthful teammate was working to fulfill his lofty personal goals but we never took one breath literally from the championship to the beginning of October end of September he'd been moving this game up he wanted to come on in an alley and everybody his goals were set much higher than one championship much higher than the level of play he he played that dear before when the season started it was clear that Kobe would no longer be satisfied to be known as a supreme talent he wouldn't rest until he was known as the best player in the league what of Steel [Applause] he says they're not going to stop me you can't even contain me that is where you do the comparisons with Jordan Kobe Bryant no one in the league playing better but Kobe's personal ascent seemed to leave his teammates flat the delicate chemistry achieved during the Lakers championship run was lost and no one took the change to heart more than Shaquille O'Neal I think Shaq struggled with the fact that Kobe came back so determined and so hungry to show that he had grown as an individual player Kobe was just you know just trying to do too much and you know when you're that good you can do too much but when you play on the team you shouldn't have to be that on the team's problems came to a head when Kobe exploded for 51 points at Golden State but failed to produce a win Coffee has become a one-man arsenal it was trying to to help us win so desperately any gun so many points he puts it's a brilliant game and carried it just a one step or two too far we shot a couple air balls down the stretch and kind of exacerbated the situation where you're in then you know he was trying to win it all by himself a lot of nights people wanted me to just kind of level off my plate and I improve and just do the same thing I did last year and I'm not gonna do it and I worked through I improve as a basketball player every day and I want to show that I'm proof I've never been the one to get into most team it is who was this and who's that but when it was when everything went through me the outcome was good it was 67 to 15 playing with enthusiasm the city was jumping up and down and had a parade of Haven and now we're 23 and 11 so you figure it out but tension between the two superstars was destroying the fabric of the team the things going on against with Kobe and Shaq were well documented but there was too much focused put on that and I think you know for a lot of us as members of the team you know we kind of stepped back and also started paying attention to that a lot instead of really being held accountable for what we could do to help the team what had begun as a championship saga had become the league's leading soap opera so just like well they were going to figure it out come out on top I was just going into rock bottom you know loses either way there's nothing anybody could say or do to try to stop that from happening it was gonna be our decisions whether we want to pull through this adversity always going crushes the Lakers were out of answers and running low on hope after sixty games the return of Derek Fisher restored a sense of order on the court but it was something unexpected that made the Lakers rediscover their sense of purpose in late March an injury forced Kobe out of the lineup during his nine game absence the Lakers found themselves playing as a team and they were winning no one noticed more than Kobe during the period 10 that Kobe set out we had to change our style back to where Shaq had the dominant space on the floor and ones we've got to that we executed very well and I think that when Kobe came back it was really his impression that I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna make this transition into this team he made a conscious decision to trust his teammates more to be a playmaker underneath the baseline be [Applause] selfish play by coffee being a great player ain't about scoring 40 everything dump it on somebody every night doing this doing it it's not about that's about making everybody else but [Music] [Applause] once they got in the same page just like everyone filed a new one just jumped on and we just glued and jail together with Kobe back the Lakers were reborn as the team they had been trying to become all along a ruthless way to put it while the apps absolutely want to cut their hearts out absolutely through six playoff games Kobe had bottled up his game for the good of the team in Game four in Sacramento he finally exploded trakula shot by with shock and foul trouble Coby knew it was time to demand the ball himself as the Kobe one-on-one and Christy isolated right side elevate shoots now the puck and he's fouled ready tells the crowd of lush Reena have a good crowd of there the crowd gets involved in the game and like to talk trash so I started drawing back and started jawing with some of the players and found a groove by doing it to sweep the king [Applause] Vlade Divac brian with it angles to the baseline drop steps been betrayed two defenders and he sends in on my say shot [Applause] the Lakers were chasing history and chasing away their demons 7 and Oh in the playoffs a perfect run of 15 looking less like a fantasy with every win I think right now we have a certain swagger about ourselves because we're the defending champions in one a 15 game winning streak right now so I think there's naturally more confidence you know feel like we can pull out of any situation the Conference Finals would be the Lakers chance to erase a bitter playoff memory in 1999 the San Antonio Spurs had humiliated the Lakers in the final games ever played at the Forum the Spurs felt the Lakers 2000 title was tainted because Tim Duncan hadn't been healthy and with Duncan back they had the league's best record in 2001 he if you asked me is there bad blood no question they're not our favorite team and we're not their favorite team the San Antonio was a team when they won they embarrassed us and I swept off so Kobe either in his month I had that in my mind no longer concerned with proving who was the best individual the Lakers set out to prove they were the best team [Applause] Salinger sorry it counts in Game one Kobe carried the load [Applause] defender with every defensive adjustment the Spurs made Kobe countered with another level of creativity beautiful fingertip Kobe's got this intensive competitive drive and he doesn't back down he always lost those challenges [Applause] [Applause] impossible indefensible Kobe had scored in 93 points him back-to-back road victories I told Cole today he was my idol his plan mom I'm sorry playing phenomenal you know I don't know what else to say I think he's the best player in the league by far two seasons earlier Tim Duncan was making that same claim and in Game two he tried to make the case again now Duncan hasn't left the lane against grant to the big slide gets inside it lights ahead to Duncan [Music] and the Alamo [Music] the Lakers were being outplayed for the first time in the 2001 playoffs and for the first time they looked ruffled [Applause] everything seemed to be going against us in that game Phil Guinea ejected San Antonio was playing on top of their game hitting all the shots crowd was behind it was like 36,000 people but our leader had just been exiled from the game and we felt even more challenged to go out and to finish the Spurs off in that second game although they hadn't brought their best game with them the Lakers reduced the contest to a battle of wills with increasing determination and confidence they hammered away at the Spurs lead after Jackson's ejection the Lakers went on a 9-2 run the players had sensed their own peril and the lessons of a long season helped them to fight their way out of danger [Applause] you can see the visible increased intensity of the Lakers who doesn't want to come back they showed them that way to chance we deserve to be the champs and this is why we deserve beat a Shaq comes outside to Brian he's hoping he shoots for three brilliant connecting they have dealt severe and perhaps fatal ball to the Spurs championship hubs man in the Eastern Conference the Philadelphia 76ers had taken everybody's best shot all season long and were the last team standing in the end like the Lakers they had flowered during the season as a team and in the playoffs league MVP Allen Iverson had captivated the basketball world [Applause] [Music] in winning the East Ireson proved himself to be more than a scorer he had become a leader and had his team believing they could become champions [Music] I said they were wearing him down he's getting tired right so we should not be able to make that time to show a good job but Lewis done a great job of helping his teammates 96 20 Oh the Sixers Oh for the suffocation [Music] these kids left mark the biggest question is gonna be the Lakers one respond to this they're almost invincible they look like you said walls through the playoffs nobody is to death or psyche well tonight the Sixers come in the Laker I think they're gonna have tremendous energy and I think what you're gonna see is what we saw in Game one against San Antonio may be a lot of screen roll look making the tub up showing up sitting Kobe to the basket or Kobe running down to that post and trying to post up here in the key is so I'm told feeling much better far yes coffee with two minutes and gig one will not stop keep shooting because his teammates expect those shots we'll go things that fall off the back of the round the short jumper landed [Applause] I think in that triangle hundreds of these players I feel very familiar where the teams are coming [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] now some generators now for it this is the patients that bill Jackson want to Kobe Bryant survey the floor penetrate fine Shack and that is a very very high percentage shot but again told the defense bringing to you the handy here now at quick surgery jugglery here's my cursor will the shot clock [Applause] the 76ers I've gotta get back Kobe you guys have not been in a must-win situation in an awful long time are you guys sensing the urgency feels good it feels good you see your mungus challenge they're so competitive and they playing so hard but it feels good to be tested I think there was a certain stretch there were we're overly aggressive I think our motions got the best of us but we're able to settle back in the game and start executing our office it puts them right to the break copito to me right now a lot of talking going on there right now I think you're gonna see the referee step in and separate the two players a lot of emotion and passion [Applause] exchange of trash-talking an Allen Iverson was telling the official riot started what happened first of all with Allen Iverson right there at the end of the game for the conversation that's all two competitors talking it looks too friendly I'm going to hear the battle that spring choppy let me ask you you guys built up the big lead and the 76ers just would not go away you said you liked the challenge but did you get concerned down the stretch no but we got away from my execution we didn't do the things that got us to that point and we said every group in the next two offices it's your game the other night in Game one [Music] when you did tonight to bounce back no I wasn't thinking about getting one at all I just want to come back play hard you know trying to help my team in any way possible and found able to put some positive date tonight about going back to Philadelphia you're all homeless I don't really care that's what around me you know trying to do what it takes to win a ballgame all right Kobe congratulations through the tour to see you in Philadelphia all right thank you very much Marv Kobe 20 points you're on fire there in the second quarter what's it like to be in the zone like that well you know he's getting the rhythm and let's he makes it excellent job finding me coming over screens and Bassem easy looks copy is the confidence and the swagger coming back after the long layoff that was just saying we just found our rhythm again you don't have to have a nine days off there's stuff to come back and then you have your rhythm but we're starting to find the flow of the game again all right copy good luck in the second half thank you my beloved the road to see what happens to the second half back to you yes he does Carly with 16 of his 20 points in the second quarter [Applause] lady Jean 22 parts [Applause] five Shaquille O'Neal [Applause] yes a tional block by Kobe Bryant writers say one out of three question his blue on the Lakers wants the basketball right now other than cold enforce Kobe to trying to do everything here Mars and coffee to for his last 15 being defended by Russia bow clock Koby you struggled a bit in the second half three for sixteen but you made a big big shot down the stretch yeah well you know that's what we teammates before man it really stepped up here Robert came in as an excellent job he did you mug your shout for us you know you know we're able to come out here with a win you're 10 of 16 in the first half how did you have the confidence because when Shaq went out you told your teammates I want the ball and then you made that big basket well you know my ladies got so tired you know you know I just pretty much started coasted a little bit that my teammates carried a burden and know when it came down for a pressure situation I was trying to save my legs for that moment and work out well then you saved your legs tell us about the big defensive stuff that you add on Iverson right down there at the end when he go for the basket well you're not saw I'm coming so no usually that's his specialty you guys get in their lane and shoot those little floaters and know I had a little help from long arm right behind me he said this was a must-win so you got it we got it all right we'll see you next game you were just one assist away from a triple double but the Sixers made a heck of a run again you said at halftime you can't go for the jugular why not with this group to keep on fighting and they score in bunches so you know it's important for us that you remain poised when they make their run and continue to do what we do it seemed as though the offense was in sync tonight but can you talk about the great disparity and threes you guys I think you've made nine more than the 76ers that we did say that again I love you Kobe well we did we just threw the ball in a shack and let them double-team and know when they collapsed their defense we just kick it out to our shooters and everybody was making shots no team has ever come back Shaq from the three games to one deficit this series over plus you know we're just focusing on one more win but in this situation I should we had a lot of scary moments this year we wanted to just come and take everything all the time we let one game super we're so fuss is just focusing on getting one away and we want to have our Father have you learned a lesson from what happened last year in Indiana you had a a great game and then you guys came out and lost by 30 points on the next attempt I don't think we learned the lesson I think it was a learning experience for us and you know for us was just one more win you loved him as well all right right back at home man right back here a love fest who would have ever thought that back to you Marv six ladies what a spectacular play Barbie funded a ball but if work was Brody's here to hit that shot alright thank you very much Marv I spoke to Kobe Bryant he said that the team played their worst half in the final since the first map of Game one he said were still up for at the half he said we didn't shoot very well only 38% we're still up at 4:00 he says we got to keep our heads together let's not allow the emotion of the building in the 76ers to take over and we need to keep them off the offensive boards I'm very happy with our position considering the way we play Thomas this means to then winning the series here in his hometown pull it up he grew up in the suburbs Lower Merion as you know a one-time member of the Philadelphia 76ers he literally grew up across the way in the hallways we're over Schuester [Music] and Kobe Bryant beginning to feel it Gina water history [Applause] a great game right now any predictions for next year I will wait till October all right we have Kobe Bryant back in Kobe congratulations for a second time what's it like to finally achieve this dream here in Philadelphia is something you had wanted your entire life in your home city it was nice to come back to Philadelphia and play in a place where I'll hold my competitive skills and not kid I jump around like the city of Philadelphia Forest gonna be an L a boy to stand out there but it was fun to come back to Philly and play for the championship you're 22 years old you've won two at least does this mean more than the first one the first one is always it's always very special because you've proven to people that you can do it the second one it's like you're proving that it's not a it's not a fluke you know the series against San Antonio two champions going head up and went in back-to-back definitely feels great considering everything that you have been through this year Kobe do you consider this some form of a relief and did you almost have your spirit broken at your lowest point well I have so much going on outside of the game that's why people didn't know about it just felt good to pull it to pull through this season I don't do what another championship it you know definitely feels good can you tell us what some of that was now are you willing to discuss it no not really a matter it was hard but you know that's just is no progress when you went out for 11 games did that give you an opportunity to gather yourself and to come back with a different focus and and to try and put everything that had gone on in front of you behind you well I think having time off really helped me put things in perspective in the find I was important in my life no basketball yes you know it's a big part of my life but it's not a thing and I was able to focus on the game a lot of credit goes to my wife not only putting up with but supporting my work ethic you know because I work all day consistently and she supported me and a lot of credit goes there a final thought jerry west and always meant an awful lot to you he's not a part of the celebration how instrumental was he and patching things up with you in check well Jay was just his inspiration period he's NBA logo for crying out loud but no Jay he's always been there for me from day one so we had a conversation during the season and he hope help me put things in perspective you know from the game standpoint and Shaq and I patched things up and went out then you know what another title Kobe congratulations we appreciate your time great year thank you celebrating that absolutely go get some celebration we're gonna have a lot more coming up here from the first Union Center the Los Angeles Lakers have now won back-to-back championships their 13th championship overall we'll be back congratulations to you you now become the youngest man at 23 to win three titles how does that grab you what does that represent you that's uh no it's a blessing I've been blessed I've been fortunate to play with a great organization may be the youngest player ever to win three that's you know it's an incredible accomplishment did you have a feeling when you beat the Sacramento Kings that you guys had won the championship no no the feeling that we had you know we had a lot of momentum obviously we were starting to play well together offensively and defensively we felt like we're going to find us with a lot of momentum how is it that you managed in the fourth quarter to kind of turn things on that you kind of glided at least in the first three quarters in this series in the fourth quarter you just were the man who closed the hatch I mean you know the fourth quarter is uh you know many games on the line so even though you know I might not be shooting a ball you know pretty you know extremely well the fourth quarter I can turn it up a little bit and what about this guy right here the man who saved the season what are your thoughts about Robert Horry when he made that shot in Game four big shot Rob he knocks it down the game's in a line he caused his kickstand going you know you could count that's buckets he's not gonna miss that you wore the number 23 in here tonight representing Michael Jordan and your jersey parade why you can't have a collection of jerseys and not have MJ in it I don't make any sense Kobe thank you for all your cooperation congratulations you got cold destroy placing gently through my body burn so sweet blood boils when you speak makes me weak but I refuse to eat yet when I sleep I feel tears trickling down my cheek stay strong cry telling me move on my heart's fight him forcing me the whole dawn yours forever [Music] those that don't know yes I had a budding music career as a rapper it didn't last long but I did make a video and on the video set is where I

wanted to know where she was you know I would finish the take and then go to my trailer but I wonder where she is the entire time and then come out of the trailer and just want to talk to her some more in between takes and stuff like that and she wrote a phone number down at the time when you had still write phone numbers now and I called it a very next day and we talked for hours which is beautiful we literally did everything together everything together and I thought I was a big dork because I loved I loved Disneyland I loved the Disney movies and things like that but I never really had a chance to go to the park much and she was a big Disney fan too and we used to hang out at Disneyland we used to go to Magic Mountain she became my best friend you know and for me it was very different to have somebody that I was so close to because I been so used to growing up in an isolation really and moving around from place to place and making new friends all the time so I never really opened up to anybody because I knew I was just gonna inevitably move but now you know being in Los Angeles and feeling like I'm gonna be a Laker for the rest of my life and I just met this beautiful woman that I just see the world the same way with we decided to get married I proposed she said yes we're both so young right so I'd wake up and I go train and I come back and she still be the bed sleeping like 18 year-olds do - if you sleep - like 12:00 1:00 o'clock and afternoon man and then I lay down with and I go to sleep again - and then you know we wake up and just do what kids do do what kids do I take it to the batting cage go hit some balls like and we play miniature golf go see movies we go out to eat it was just it was a beautiful time man we had Natalia it was like

Stein baby Mozart videos where he kind of just hypnotizing your kid it I went through all of it oh all that stuff [Music] you're gone you really have a tendency to think about your own personal journey and for us is about taking two young people and trying to figure out our journey together and try to grow together which is a challenge but when you have a kid then it becomes even bigger than that because now you're a responsibility of this little life shefte Molk it may be hard for him to complain he has a 71 million dollar contract with the Lakers plus millions more for advertising endorsements Madison Avenue loves his winning personality and even found a way to put his fluent Italian to you wasted on me at Gaza oh this has made him one of the highest-paid 22 year olds in the world recently he bought a new toy all he wanted for our room since I was a little kid and I was kind of opportunity to kind of splurge it's a Ferrari Modena this is how he commutes to the Laker training facility in LA Kobe Bryant lived with his parents until last year about the time he became engaged to Vanessa Lane they met two years ago when she was only 17 you start introducing yourself and and you know she turned at a point so there's tons around excuse me whooshing there Vanessa you know she got my eyes got real big and it's just like there was no one before her I mean what you

were starting now he and the Lakers of both playing their best basketball of the season and seemed destined for another NBA championship if so it will be a championship fueled not just by strategy or by star power but also by a 22 year old single-minded love of the game I'm very very fortunate to be in this position you're playing the sport you love I love you perhaps the hooli loved it just two years after this piece first aired a 19 year old hotel employee in Colorado accused Kobe Bryant of rape he admitted having sex with a woman but insisted it was consensual in the summer of 2004 the charges were dismissed after the alleged rape victim refused to testify she and Bryant reached an undisclosed settlement of a civil suit six months later but the charges in Kobe's response to them became an issue for the Lakers as the team struggled to handle their golden boy turned liability the media frenzy heightened tensions that had always existed between Kobe and his teammate and coach

__ ] they gotta win the middle three game something that no team has done at home since they went back to a 232 format in 85 there was actually a time in the mid when a home team won all three games

number-two seed in the Eastern Conference and for the Lakers it truly will be the end of a particular era living in an apartment back and forth they go for Kobe Bryant the biggest question watch of course for him yes if you take his career and you divide it up basically in the numbers that he wore yet to hall-of-fame careers so it's only right that you need to retire both numbers just an epic performance by Cobie plan Chloe Brian came into the NBA as a 17 year old kid but former Lakers general manager Jerry West said he knew from the moment he saw him work out that Kobe was special for the next 10 years west watch proudly as a kid wearing number eight grew into a champion number eight was just he was a lot more explosive and athletic when he went to the basket to try to dump him he's trying to embarrass you Kobe and Shaq won three titles together and it's hard not to wonder how many more they could have won with each other but the Lakers felt like they had to choose between them after the 2004 season and owner dr. Jerry Buss at Kobe two years later called we made another change the Lakers have notified the league Bryan will wear 20 for next year great players do that all the time they want to reach alledged ourselves and I think for him was just changing numbers you just trying to wash away everything that he did remember eight and see if he can duplicate it with number 24 there were different situations different teammates his role was different and he continued to reinvent himself that's what all-time greats tend to find a way to do [Music] [Applause] 24:00 was more of a thinker I got I played chess while other people playing checkers out there I just saw a much more mellow Kobe it was the first time I really seen him smile on the basketball court as much as he did and I think he enjoyed that I once asked Kobe which number he preferred the Lakers to retire 8 or 24 he paused for a minute and smiled and said whichever number they choose it would be hard for someone else to weigh the other one Kobe doing it the way Cody doesn't I wouldn't put it past Kobe Bryant that he was thinking I'm gonna play 10 more years on the plane than the 24 my have pretty much identical numbers that I had in a break and they're gonna probably have to retire both girls that's the type of guy he is one more of his being that more than ever as with another championship for Kobe Bryant animistic fourth title is once again within his grasp and for Dwight Howard the first step on to his sports the most prominent stage magic Lakers game 1 of the NBA Finals is next on ABC everything is on the line you want to kill each other because you never know what could happen stand the other garden number 24 6 6 13 season out of Laura Marion High School Kobe Bryant 6 in the Denver series [Music] Dragutin size pop shot gets it to go again this is just simple basketball size advantage Brian in the post over Courtney Lee and the help defense Lakers six all run Michael Jackson likes it beat by 39 at the new Boston Garden walking off the floor with green confetti falling on top of them as the Celtics celebrated such a disappointing loss they were questioned about their toughest we asked Kobe Bryant are they different this year or talkative much tougher tale tougher mentally tougher physically anywhere you know the series that we've had with Utah you sit in Denver those are three very physical teams tough teams and you know we had to overcome adversity and particularly that you see in Denver series and we managed to do them right on top of them we closed it down like you saw Kobe Bryant yesterday he is as serious as we've seen of all season right now another pick-and-roll good content by Beatrice Tenno run by the Lakers Kobe the last six Kobe Bryant deflectors by Nelson Brian gets it right back falling away tough shot but today and I wanna chakracore Lee Ryan so you should be in timeout right away you make a shot like that you have to go to the silence Brian pulls up again call me by with 16 little dream shake right there great content by Pinterest better offense by Brian this guy you put him in pick and road to solve that's a difficult difficult cover want to be trapped let me dance wall one with the small lead to the first half before he picked up his third foul Brian top shot bastard might be out of one of those nights he's got 22 already Kobe Bryant 26 for Kobe Bryant and a chance for a three-point play well a very good screen by Gasol very good use of the screen by Bryant hips to his right hand and you couldn't see the foul there where he clipped his leg but again the play by Dwight Howard is the right play to me the magic need to cut a little bit more the sole put under a beautiful adjustment and they're on their feet at the Staples Center as the Lakers Kobe Bryant on the drive gets to the basket the shot clock expires he's got 29 and the Lakers back up by 18 [Music] and he has five rebounds as well rise again he's got that look he's got that game couple of pics cockatoos got to put it over rise the packet just so out of foul Kobe Bryant brilliant here in the third quarter and the Lakers up by 22 [Applause] incredible on the offensive end good defense just better offense the ability to take the hit create your own shot a thing of beauty playing putting on a 20 the man they call the closer not waiting till the fourth quarter to do his damage watch the tears at night an endless day it's working whatever it is doors on a mission getting guys involved and then turn back time talking to guys on the bench excited after place attitude the approach that mentality became convinced the basketball to the point got no charge hands it off to Kobe Bryant outstanding job of running the fast-break take notes Orlando Magic defeated over Courtney Lee league got very good defense Bryant just remarkably skilled to jump shots and then the well-executed fast-break off the magic turnover Lando leads Ryan Pitts a three and just like that it's down to seventh I think the fingers okay can keep you when he finalists just picked up his fifth foul Odom has 5,000 pulls up shotgun and a Lakers back up by 328 for Kobe Bryant leaves it for the toad short rubout take a nice fish to push spinning in the lane back for the solemn Freddy's pass back to a three-point game and the critical part was Beatriz jogging back outstanding job of getting his early and making play to talk about scoring we all know that he has the ability to do this anytime he wants but down the stretch he making plays to drop off the PAL kosoul cuts it from 5 to 3 and then double-team a

fan diehard I mean I knew knew everything about every player that's ever played here so to be drafted and then traded to this organization and to spend 20 years here I mean you can't you can't write

players of all time calling it quits at the end of the season ending an incredible 20-year career with the LA Lakers I went one-on-one with Kobe about his big decision it is the end of an era records shattered respective turn and now after 20 years and five NBA championships Kobe Bryant will say goodbye to his first love basketball everybody wants to know why now it's the right time there's no point in really believing it or dragging it out or saying well leave the door open in case I don't know if something may change I don't think this is something this is a decision that you can allow them to have outside influence dictate whether or not you can do the place must be decision that comes to nothing so once I knew this was it might as well say so how did you know this was it I try to have at least 15 minutes of still time I'm just kind of sitting my thoughts in the morning it was kind of meditating normally what happens with me is my mind would always drift to the game always then I found myself sitting in my mind when drift towards the game all the time anymore and that's why I start realizing you know what it's getting close it's getting close not just 20 years but 20 years with the same team the LA Lakers how important is that to you extremely thing to me I was such a huge Laker fan growing up I mean like a die-hard Laker fan I had magic posters you know magic t-shirts it was my dream to be a Los Angeles Laker and so you know to be here for 20 years and to get to know some of my mentors it's been a dream come true and the fans the the letter that you wrote you want it to speak to your fans first why well because I think it was important to know how much they've meant to me the letter itself still doesn't do it justice and how important they'd been how vital they've been in my career and I mean we grew up together and that's such a beautiful thing was it a slow process to get here or was it just one of those lights which went off and you said no it was a slow process and it was something that kind of evolved over the last three years you know would be kilise injury that really frightened me because I you know I was like my career to be over now it scared me what am I gonna do next then I trained hard came back the next season fractured my knee I trading the harder came back again tore my shoulder and it was just like oh my this is one thing after the next and so it was kind of a slow three-year process of kind of evolving to get to where I am the 17 time all-star calls himself his biggest critic and he admits this season is far from his best do you feel that you're being treated fairly this season being your last and all that you had done for the sport yeah I mean I wouldn't have it any other way you can't just sit around expecting everybody just as a gift crazed whole time you got to be able to take the good with the bad one of the most important things that I can share with the younger generation is to accept it all don't have any expectations or leaning on the line or positive reporting on your career or negative have you accomplished everything that you've wanted to on the court no no I wanted to eat Championships as a dreamy kid and growing up in Italy I want to eat y8 because magic had five Michael head SIG's and it's okay I'll win eight and had an opportunity to have seven and didn't work out you have talked about wanting to have your place in the history of this game top five players of all time who would those five players be and would you crack the starting five no I would never put myself in the starting five ever I'll put the people that I've actually learned the most from being Jordan Magic Bird Hakeem Olajuwon and Jerry was but when you see that hashtag goat by your name I think is fantastic you know I think it's great to be mentioned in the same breath as those players honestly to me that's everything we will sit and debate endlessly who would win in a one-on-one matchup to myself and MJ and we debate that to the cows come home so who would win no doubt he would win somehow would win some but those are the beasts that will go on forever although he said his goodbyes I had to ask are you really ready to let her go I am I am I am but the thing I'm carrying this with me no matter what you know what I mean but internally my love my passion everything that I've learned from it is always gonna be with me your first remembrance of when you felt that this was going to be your game first remembrance I would say I was actually eight years old painting league in Florence I was playing on the Julian team managed to score 61 points well hold on yeah eight years old and you score how many points ago V 61 my uncle always talking I father always told me said you know you can put points in the board I gotta do it shoot it you know it wanted to have the same type of feeling that he had and I didn't know what that feeling was I didn't have people change your name and asking for autographs all the time I was kind of curious to see what that feeling would feel like I wanted to experience that same type of emotion and I wanted to be better than my father usually kicked my butt all the time all the time at what point did you get him I was 14 no kidding what was the feeling like that I wanted to keep doing it and and his feeling he didn't want me to keep doing so you don't blame me yeah no kidding y'all stopped after that play my father says I was a little Italian boy that was the son of an NBA basketball player how'd that go over well one kid tried to challenge me and that just gave me an opportunity to just unleash hell on this poor kid because of all the frustration of moving into a new place and the isolation that comes with that at that moment I understood how much the game can be the place of venting it can be an outlet for me basketball was gonna be your armor absolutely Brian's bravado some said arrogance earned him more detractors when he turned pro at 17 Gold's Gym and 98 and lifting weights and I get a phone call it's Michael Jackson I'm the other one and kind of what the hell's going on somebody's playing Michael Jackson calling you at the age of 18 age of 18 he's a big basketball fan and I was starting to get flack for being an introvert and being so serious all the time about the game and he wanted the call gave me encouragement to say don't change for them you have to stay focused if you want to be one of the all-time greats you have to study the all-time greats you have to be obsessive about what you do and how you do it and the summertime I would just disappear because I'd be studying and be researching I'd be drinking wine the game Chicago won another championship how why how do we get to that level I'd like to introduce my friend the Black Mamba that was the birth of the Black Mamba all the creatures that you could have pulled for yourself why that one because they spoke to me the length of the snake the accuracy of the snake the temperament I step on the court that's me [Music] how's the traffic yeah I think that's the point right why do you have to want you to do this I hear a lot faster why does it matter why do you in your life started doing this Bryant says is where he'll achieve greatness in a new field storytelling he's lined his office with photos of his inspirations JK Rowling Walt Disney Steve Jobs and the composer John Williams how often you come here all done all the time sometimes I can't sleep now and just have something that's my brain I'll just come in here and talk in the morning myself and a lot of energy yeah it's nonstop brian says he's here reading and writing training for his new job I knew it a very early age that this date was coming so I started trying different things out because I was interested in he was always gravitating around story like what what did you sighs I wrote a great amount of commercials a lot of stuff that he would nicely actually write as well this year Kobe ink produced a campaign called Pharaoh villain in which we hear the home crowd chant its love for Bryant and the road crowd it's hate [Applause] the concept the words the message Bryant says they're all his he also says that he's just getting started that soon he'll be creating movies books even video games carrying it around I mean what in the hell have you been carrying around I'm still tripping about it I would think so you probably thought you were done winning awards right yeah man I hadn't won a championship in a really really long time so here we are yeah this is unbelievable it really is unbelievable you know you now have more Oscars than Shaq and Michael Jordan combined I have a little present for you it's anything I don't know if you'll use this but I want you to have this because I think this would be great this is for Oscar actually not for you [Music] [Applause] laughs or maybe you just want to change it out then put that right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so were you guys going tonight huh I guess what I hear we're doing up jersey timepieces jerseys my first time back - no first time back watch the Lakers play get that hitch you know you're gonna get the itch [Music] it's a night over 20 years in the making as the Staples Center and Laker legends get ready to honor the greatest player this building has ever known tonight two numbers will be retired in honor of one man [Music] congrat the laser just like that 60 we never taken a [ __ ] slope in a minute somebody I get this very few players that ever stepped on the hardwood can match his accomplishments over the duration of Kobe Bryant's 20-year career he became an 18 time all-star and scored the third most points in NBA history while securing five unforgettable championships so it is with good reason that just 20 months after his retirement both of his iconic numbers will be raised to the rafters Laker fan Kobe fan dream come true back at staples center the excitement builds all day long as large crowds gather to visit Kobe land [Music] party preparations are in full swing its Staples Center and with good reason it's not every day that

detail is forgotten right down to the type of beef that shares his name and a number of friends have already gathered including a long list of Lakers he will never forget [Music] [Applause] it's fitting the celebration of him that the quality of people that admire him would actually take the time out of their schedules and it just takes you back [Music] a little bit going on [Music] I see what I saw what to do my brother man Coby has been like a big brother to me so you know when they told me the date I thought I might be there it's hard to say goodbye to one of the best players ever

Kobe Bryant who can remember when he scored 81 points it again and last but not least there would never be an athlete in his last performance to top this man's performance 60 points so before I turn the mic over to our owner Jeanie buss is two things I want to leave you with Kobe Jerry West called me the day that you worked out and he said Earvin I just witnessed the greatest workout I've ever seen in my entire life and Jerry you are absolutely right this man has turned out to be the greatest we've ever seen and the next thing Kobe is this brother we need you right now when I look into this audience there's all raise up people come together cheered you on for 20 years and this country needs to come together and you were able to bring us all together as a city in Los Angeles for 20 years so we thank you for that miss TV bus come on out please and Geney before you speak we have got to bring his closest friend my partner in crime out here to join us Rob the Lincoln you gotta come on out representing Kobe for all those years you gotta come on out we don't that genies do her thing right now [Music] [Applause] Koby we knew this day was gonna come and here we are I also know you well enough that the jerseys hanging up there was not your motivation but this is our tradition this is our ceremony but really what we're celebrating tonight is the journey that you took us on for those 20 years we are retiring both your numbers because if you separated each of the accomplishments under those numbers each of those players would qualify for the Hall of Fame I have the honor of representing all Laker fans here tonight and overwhelmingly they asked me to express their gratitude and their appreciation for all that you've done I am quoting some of them here Thank You Kobe for your incredible work ethic never giving up and somehow figuring out how to impose your will on a game and change the single-handedly changing the outcome Thank You Kobe you taught us what happens when you outwork fear with the relentless Mamba mentality teaching us that failure is a non-existent concept [Applause] Thank You Kobe for not only making the players on your team better but you forced your opponents to raise their game as well Thank You Kobe for inspiring a generation of fans to fall in love with the game Thank You Kobe for playing through enormous pain and sometimes putting the team on your back to carry us to the finish line and Colby I thank you for staying loyal to the purple and gold and and remaining a Laker for life would have might have been easier for you to leave we asked you for your hustle and you gave us your heart which was so much more you showed us how to win by sheer well hard work and perseverance you have forever made your mark on this franchise your legacy is much greater than basketball no one will ever wear eight or 24 again for the Lakers because they are being retired the time has come Lakers fans please direct your attention up to the southeast corner of the arena were number eight and number 24 will hang forever as we honor one of our Lakers rakes Kobe Bryant [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you I want to say you know it's thank you so much for tonight but you know it's not it's not about my jerseys that are hanging up there for me you know it's about the jerseys that were hanging up there before and without them I couldn't be here today they inspired me to play the game on a high level magic cab Shack pushing me every day Baelor Chamberlain Goodrich West worthy goes on and on and secondly it's about this class organization and Jerry Buss your father believing in a skinny old kid from Lower Merion High School in Philadelphia and it's also about the next generation it's about its current lego roster that we have here it's about it's about embodying the spirit that exists in those jerseys up there and carrying this organization forward so that the next 20 years are better than the past 20 years and that's what it's about and then it's also about the fans fans the media I don't think you guys understand how present you guys were with me you know you guys were there with me at 5:30 in the morning when I was running the track and I was midway through my workout I didn't know if I could make it through and I thought about the expectations you got hot you guys have for me and you have for our team and it pushed me through it got me through those 800 some 400 said 100 at 5:30 in the morning so I thank you it's about family it's about my wife Vanessa you know you guys gonna know this but the last game my last game that we had here against Utah Jazz I was really tired I got home and I was like you know what I don't know if I can do this thing I got one more game left but I don't have any legs and she said I want to show you something I got a gift for you for your last game and she proceeded to show me the role of retired jerseys from Baylor for magic from Shaq from cab all the personal messages signed to me including for Michael Jordan including from the great Bill Russell included from the great Larry Bird and when I saw that I knew then that I had to turn it up turn it off so thank you baby for being an inspiration to me and and lastly our daughters Natalia Gianna and Bianca you know I I I hope that tonight is not you know you guys know that you know if you do the work you work hard enough dreams come true you know that we all know that but hopefully what you get from tonight is the understanding that those times when you get up early and you work hard those times when you stay up late and you work hard those times when you don't feel like working you're too tired you don't want to push yourself but you do it anyway that is actually the dream that's the dream it's not the destination it's the journey and if you guys if you guys can understand that then what you'll see happen is that you won't accomplish your dreams your dreams won't come true something greater will and if you guys can understand that then I'm doing my job as a father thank you guys so much I love you [Applause] [Music] the eloquence of Kobe Bryant what a night what a celebration very family-oriented in his speech singling out his wife and his three daughters means so much to him this great Lakers organization the bus family for sticking with him believing in him a Laker for life Kobe Bryant number eight number 24 forever hanging in the rafters at Staples Center the only thing I mean that was a no-brainer there the fact that both yours would go up but I think what matters the most is the message that Kobe said to the fans that more importantly the message that he sent to the current Laker roster about what it takes for the journey you create a kolbe over here it's so driving in today I'm sure you saw the crowd of people outside all these people and you're not even playing the night I mean you been retired the effect you have on this city does that are you ever in all of that or is that something that you can feel no I it's weird man it's you know cuz growing up just why I just want to play basketball you're gonna mean and then once when Championships I wanted to be regarded as one of the greats and all the stuff that was very very internally driven individually driven and as you get older and as I sit here now I come to realize that it's really not about those things those things carry a greater significance to them and it's how well can you affect or impact others not from the sense of fandom or whatever the case may be but it's through your actions through your behavior through your commitment to the game how can that inspire people to be as committed in whatever field that they're choosing to be a part of and that's where I think the connection that we have and we've fed off of that energy I've cut off their energy from it for many many years and and I think that's the best of reaction you're saying Ted so oh the right I go over here good to see you again I remember the first day you walked into the floor and I'm thinking that little kid right now is still inside of you somewhere can you go back there and think about even imagining that this has happened and just the emotions of dealing with all these accolades and at the same time have you had a chance to look outside yet and see what's going on in Colby Lane I haven't had a chance to look outside and see him I saw it driving in and what I mean it's kind of like and then secondly I can remember back to being being a kid because that that child inside of me is never left and all the years I've been playing here that child inside of me is never left I mean one of the first things I did when I walked into the forum when her lights were down he was dimly lit and I looked up and looked at all the jerseys that were up there because I'd seen him many times on video tapes before and before every game I made a point to kind of glance up there remind me of what I'm playing for you know how I got here and what it is that we're representing appreciate all of this as you evolved as a person well the appreciation comes in moments it comes in increments you know like you go through a moment in time and you realize that you're going way too fast you know I really get a chance to appreciate everything that's happening so you take a beat and you appreciate it but the reality is you can't stay there you know I mean because then you can't ever grow and evolve right so there's moments of appreciation and then you eventually you have to move on and focus with your head down on what comes next second round the center Obi Chao throw for a totally Madonna della to a career a crafty Tori Christic America's shipping type in Sato wisdom Athena opens autumn Aalto perky volleyball team an earring in encuesta memento condo RSO communist enemy sent on patch in patch me sinto orgulloso the color to taka fat covet aqua coral acres they're all dentro de met Apache Mark Medina play Thompson doing stuff with body armor and Kevin Durant and so wouldn't IKEA what kind of business perspectives have you offered any of those guys well I mean it's just to be a part of brands that you believe in as you believe share the same core values as you and then everything else tends to fall in place but you gotta find a connection with brands and what they represent and what you represent what you want to stand for and then then everything else takes care of itself and Mambo Sports Academy we embrace the Mamba mentality the Mamba mentality is constant curiosity asking questions how do I become better today than I was yesterday that means bringing passion to the process it means bringing the maximum effort required to be great here we state for ourselves and our goals are our own take responsibility for the work required to achieve those goals Mambo Sports Academy is really evolved and have fun it's got to be fun this is where we become better members of our team our family and our community ultimately the best version of ourselves [Laughter] [Music] so that's really cool to see Kobe in a different role [Music] [Music] Jame man friends every day of night every night how would you describe your in coaching style teach all the basics fundamentals my footwork moving off the ball handling the ball passing cut and rebound in boxing I like all the basic stuff you lay back and you kind of let them find their own way a lot patience patience bender 12 he's got to be patient let him develop let him grow they surprise you at all with like how surprised me how fast it goes how fast a time saver that's surprising we've really been doing this for 10 months when I first started it could be only dribble shooting all that stuff and now I'm either we've gotten a lot better than 10 ones maybe there's one thing that Toby always talks about is you get better by practice working out and putting the time in but our girls play basketball or we're down to seven days a week in the summertime it's double session and at first you're kind of like that's a little bit crazy things like well yeah but you want to be number one coach Marvin Val you know you've been putting it in you know he's you can see that he wants to you know get out there sometime but now my excellent coach man I'm learning so much you know even as a parent just by watching his coaching style he'll tell them something and he'll make noises we have a list of his noises and he'll be like Papa Papa and then they'll go and do it pop up up exactly the way he says or he'll go a fast and then they do it but pop it's just weird definitely keep her very compassionate for these girls shows just a lot of love for what he does and for these girls from the team and what it's becoming [Applause] [Music] yeah they're mine until they go off to college right so this team the plan that we have in place Ohio teachers is a six-year plan how artistic actually you teach it in increments to teach it and piece by piece by piece by piece by piece which is very patient preaching and really better every day just get better every day that's all let's get better every day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] they're here at the ASA season opener I'm joined by the Bryan's Toby and Gigi now Kobe's starting with you just as a pure fan of the game watching this league grow from 1997 till now where it is what does it like to see that grow well it's awesome to see the progress that's been made they still understand I believe is still that attendance the amount of broke that it's going to have over the next several years is going to be and you are a part of a dynasty with the Lakers people are saying that the Aces have a chance to be the dynasty of the WNBA adding Kamboj Wilson plum McBride I mean it goes down the roster who ignore some your favorite players okay aja Wilson and Jackie and as the reigning Rookie of the Year I mean aja Wilson took the league by storm last year if we really only see the tip of the iceberg how much do you watch her and tell people um and kind of tune your game and try to do what they do on the court watch as much of them as I can so you get more information more inspiration and finally for you what would it be like the one day be a WMD player I think I mean every good evening and thank you so much for joining us we're gonna begin with the death of basketball legend Kobe Bryant tonight investigators from the

released a statement saying he was a little brother to me Dwyane Wade couldn't hide his grief in this tearful video today is one of the saddest days in my lifetime it seems like a bad thing a bad dream I know we all feel the same way about such a great it's a great leader it's a great champion Shaq you're the first guy I thought of when I heard this news the other day of course I talked to you and Charles and Kenny later that afternoon but then I saw that you had gotten a text from Coby that morning Shareef had gotten one what how do you how have you been over the last 48 hours so the other day I'm downstairs working out with my son - Shakir my nephew Columbus the mother of enough who comes in crying and he showed me his phone and I snapped at him I said McGee though out my face get away from you know we live in a world where anything could be photoshopped anything could be hoaxed I didn't want to believe it and then I got a call from you Charles Kenny everybody called me and then we found out it was confirmed and having felt the pain that sharp in a while we names will be attached together for what we did people always ask about our relationship and I tell them it's just like me and Charles got to strong minded people that are going to get it done that way we're gonna say certain things the respect that never be lost when it comes to be inside the lines and win I've said me and I said we did that's what me and Charles that's what we do it was sort of like a triple triple stabbing to the heart because after you cry and wondered about that then I get back on the in and that Rick Fox's on the plane so now I'm sick even more I'm calling Rick he's not answering so now I'm like what's going on and then the final blow his lovely daughter was with them on the helicopter you know we every time I saw his lovely wife in this kids something I do it with kidneys kids and DeWitt's kids hi my name is Uncle Chuck I don't know if they know mr. bachelor but it doesn't matter I just I am uncle Shaq I try to make him laugh and he would do the same thing Shariff probably devastated I said Kobe just texted me to check and see how he's doing and he used to do that from time to time you know just makes me think that and in life sometimes instead of holding them back certain things we should just do do you weigh waaahh was this we are we up here we work a lot and I think about we take stuff for granted like I don't talk to you guys as much as I think much is that needed to the fact that we're not going to be able Joe get his Hall of Fame ceremony what I'm going to be able to say hi I got five you got four the fact that we're not going to be able to say if we would stay together we kind of got 10 both of the dude can't get back and with the loss of my father but my sister I'm a pig that's all I wish I could just say something to him again I start my talk it was when we were here and I answer to get 50 that he got 60 it's a lot of time I spoke to him and I just wish I could you know so it definitely changes me I have to it's not working like you guys know what I do I work probably more than the average guy but I just really have to now just take time and just call and say I like Rick Fox call finally called me said man I like you he shall call me so I'm gonna try to do a better job just reaching out just talking to the people rather than always procrastinate because you never know life is too short never I could never imagine nothing like this I was thinking the other day I've never seen anything like this all the basketball idols that I grew up I seal their old like I used to be at home when you came to interview me already I used to watch the great round mound of rebound now I'm working with him I used to want to be dr. J he used to live next door to my mother and I lined up my father used to tell me about the three great big man I met him I seen him in the fact that I've we lost probably the world's greatest Laker world's great battle pledges I listen people want to say take your time and get better but it's gonna be on from me I already don't sleep anyway so but how I figured out my condolence goes out to his family his mom his dad his sisters the other families everybody involved Laker organization I talked to Jeannie Atlanta and people here hurt and especially in this organization you know some people have to get treatment and people just just don't understand because hit all of us out of nowhere I didn't want to believe it I said it myself I hope somebody some buttface made this up and it's not true I didn't want to believe it and then I forgive all of them but the cause and that you finally felt was concerned and just it just you know my spirit just left my body I just wish I could be able to say one thing to the one last thing to the people that we we lost because I know once you're gone you're gone forever and you know we should never take stuff like that for granted be who you are be your and I mean that in a sense of you know we all go through things and I think it's just being aware of which you with your experience having a time where there's frustration whether it's anger that it's a joy or sadness you know it's fine to experience those things because we all do you know and I think it's just accepting where you are and once you do that and it's very easy to pivot from that and move on and I think the most important thing is finding what is that you love to do that's the hardest part and it took work like basketball was born to play but the second phase what we're doing took a lot of work a lot of soul-searching a lot of investigating trying things out but when you find what it is that you love to do do you wake up every morning with a sense of purpose joso my life is it's been great and I fell into a great routine I work out five o'clock every morning take the kids to school get some breakfast with my wife goes to the office work there picked the kids up and then from there is just you know volleyball here a basketball here soccer there that's what we tell once you have the passion that thing that you're passionate about now you can look at other people or other entities or other things or works of art and you can draw things from that to help you be better at what you looking for those common denominators you wake up in the morning and you're dreading going to work dude do something else do something else and those are hard decisions to make but when you make those decisions it's a very liberating experience I guess just kind of sit in the moment who did you laugh whatever is inside of me at that moment just come just come forward I think prepare for stuff like this kind of it's not really truthful just kind of got a sit the moment absorb it then whatever comes out come down in 20 years are we gonna be talking about your legacy in basketball or investing which would you prefer investing you know that's it playing basketball you know the focus is always on winning when in championships winning championships within Championships now Championships come and go right it's gonna be another team that wants another championship another player that was another MVP award but if you really want to create something that lasts generations you have to help inspire the next generation it's not about your point it's about you taking it channeling that food game right as a resident as a as a way to to unleash right so loud you can't matter how do i express that to them how do I get them to that point where they figured this out for themselves and he wanted the call and give me encouragement to say don't change for them you have to stay focused if you want to be one of the all-time greats you have to study all hung greats you have to be obsessive about what you do and how you do it the best way to prove your your value is to work is to learn is to absorb to be a sponge you should always want to outwork your potential as hard as you believe you can work you can work harder than that so it's not a matter of pushing beyond the limitations expectations that's really the key and when you do that in the world just seems limitless [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because the man's Anatomy [Music] potatoes came to see if you talk about elevation [Music] to the coffee shop [Applause] [Music] [Music] get to the run [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Applause]", "SA7NiyorHHs": "hi once again and welcome back to another episode of chats with shaz today i have a really exciting guest that i want to talk to you with and i'll introduce you to him now hi ellie hey how's it going yeah i'm good nice to see you nice to see you nice to be here with you oh it's good to be back in the purpose yeah um i want to introduce you to alistair burton akka black member man and if any of you guys have been following him on his instagram page um you'll know that he's quite a controversial character but he is my hoodie he's from my hood yeah and we look he lives just over the road from amalenda and basically i just want to welcome you back um al back to zoom because you've been on the road for a long time um but i want to take everyone back to where um where you left zimbabwe as a youngster leaving school joining the british army and going and doing a few tours you know with the royal marines to afghanistan tell me about that time and how you were feeling when you left some yeah well i left in 2004 um as you know zim started having its troubles in around 2000 2001 and uh yeah my family we have a place just across the road here and we were doing tourism and things were not so good because of tourism being basically cancelled because of what has happened and yeah and i was at school and uh i was uh actually a couple of months away from writing my own levels and uh and i was i'm terrible at school so i've got dyslexia i've got adhd i've got everything um but uh yeah i got to a point where um i was going to do my mock exams and i wrote them and the teachers said to my parents they're like it's going to be a miracle if if he passes that's nice so confidence in you yeah so ask your son what he wants to do with his life so my parents were like you know what do you want to do and i and i and i wanted to join the british army so they said is that for the discipline side of it or for you to try and get some form of discipline in your life because being so adhd that that might have helped you um channel your your energy into one year it was it was more of something that was different to school you know academics and that just weren't really my my scene you know and uh yeah and i and i just checked out the way i got learnt about it was my friend had this um tape that he played and it was for an army foundation college and it said yeah come to the college you can learn map reading and learn all these different skills and you get paid so i was like she's this sounds like a a good deal you know so i was like no that's that's what i want to do so i left um zim my parents took me to the uk and uh they didn't have any intakes for this college but the the army were accepting and the navy so i ended up going into the royal marines because when i went to the careers office they said a lot of zimbabweans and south africans make good soldiers and i think that's really also due to the the discipline that we have going to school here in zimbabwe you know that really actually set me up for a lot of things because in them you mess you you you're naughty and whatever you get beaten you know so that for me was the worst the worst waiting to get beaten was probably the worst thing so they said oh well you guys are actually getting the beta yeah exactly waiting to get beaten was was the big mountain to climb but um yeah they said if you come to the marines you know you're not going to get beaten you're just going to do press-ups till your eyes bleed so i would rather do the press-ups so just for our listeners sake and people who are watching us when you were in afghanistan you started using music as a way to express yourself but also as a probably a stress reliever yeah that's when you started taking up you taught yourself how to use the guitar and how do you think right yeah i started uh just i actually had a playstation and my friend had a guitar and i didn't really play the playstation and he wanted the playstation so we made a swap and then i started playing guitar and then yeah i just started watching some youtube tutorials and just kind of learning and and then yeah i started writing my own songs because i like being a clown you know so i would write funny songs about the military and yeah and all the glads would just enjoy the truth so then i just continued doing it and so there's the song um that you wrote which got your namesake black mamba man boy just a little intro to what that sounds like well the song that i that i wrote because i imitate a lot of uh demographics here in zim so i uh do uh colored local black accent the the hardcore rhodesian style you know so i just like play on those characters and uh which is great because it just makes it more wholesome and about what our history was yeah i like our whether it's a checkered past or whether it's a rainbow nation you know it's um exactly because everyone's got their their quirks you know so i just like to expose those those sides but uh black mamba boy is is just like you know you have these bush stories and in africa you hear of these stories and sometimes they're a bit like far out so i decided to write a song that was really far out you know and i can give you the first the first part of it yeah i'm sure our listeners will be happy to hear a bit of swearing and everything that's called black mamba boy [Music] this is a story which i'm not going to think is but i swear i ate it from a guy who had it from another guy was now drunk at the time so juan appella once upon a time a young boy was left for dead they crossed my valley as the family could not raise the youngsters things in zimbabwe were now a struck [Music] as the young boy left the bus station crying into the night a three meter black mamba slithered on his position inspecting the young boy the black mamba did not strike or biting but took him in as one of its own the young boy was raised in an ant mound where he was fitting on routines in small termites who's lucky for the young boy he was found he spent seven years in a small ant mount he bought your mother playing mama so much joy he grew up to be known as black mamba boy [Music] at the age of seven when the mother plagued mamba realized that the baby black mamba boy was uneducated she decided to enroll him in the crosma valley primary but baby black member did not enjoy the school as the other kids did not want to play with him as he was constantly biting the yankees and crabs of the other kids but then one day a young girl joined the school who was also weirdly raised by rotates her name was rotten girl and rotten killer baby playing mama caught on like a house on fire chasing each other around them congo not really the playground just enjoying because like for a young boy he was found he spent seven years in this small hand mount but the mother blamed mamba so much joy he grew up to be known as blake [Music] and there's more to the song but if you want to listen to it just check out black black mamba boy on on spotify or anywhere you can listen to the rest it's quite a long song ali i think the sun's coming out so why don't we go down to the pool i'll show you what the pool is like and we can have a bit of a swim yeah sounds like a fantastic idea let's do it [Music] so i think we'll just carry on having a chat out here by the pool early because it's nice it's a nice location um so al i want to take us back to um your time in afghanistan and the songs that you wrote while you were there because and what your message was um two zimbabweans who actually eventually do come back i mean you were yeah you were a little young bush cat yeah from the metopus actually fighting in the afghanistan war yeah and how that affected you but what made you come back and what what did you miss the most about zen at that time yeah well i am i spent six years in the royal marines almost six years and during my time i deployed on two tours to afghanistan and yeah the the two tours i went on they were pretty cheeky they were quite quite intense um and yeah after after doing my second tour i decided to come back to them because um yeah you get you you get four you do four and a half years and then after after that you can put a year's notes to leave so i thought you know what i've already done two tours i don't really know if i want to continue that because you sign up for 22 years so i just thought you know let me come back to them and i'm from the bush you know i grew up here and i really love zim zim has a special charm you know it has a special uh vibe a special mood here and it's nothing like anywhere else in the world i feel more free here as a person not just because of the nature but just because of the way people operate here and zoom you know and and i and i'm better suited here because i i'm from the bush i i love this kind of environment and for me to come back and to start something was was a lot easier than trying to get something going in in the uk or something and it's more exciting life here is exciting you know you never know what's going to happen you wake up in the morning and you know you're driving to sun you might see some rhinos crossing the road or you you know you never you never know what you're going to see here and the people the people in zimmer are really friendly and hospitable yes even like even like the police now you know it's just like people are it's it's not it's not a it's not a bad place to be you know and when you came back i know um in true zimbabwean as um you know as a male zimbabwean you know you got to you got to show your kind of like rough stuff so i think there were times i mean when you came back from afghan you were raw straight out of out of tour yeah you were suffering from ptsd and you were living with us in our home and i remember i don't remember i don't at the time i didn't realize what was going on that you were actually suffering yeah in that way um but when you were going out at night um the zimbabwean boys would try and attack you or trying to like come on you know like come on to you and say like let's have a bravado fight because and you're like hey i've you know really i've seen enough i've done enough i don't need this yeah but they they really wanted to challenge you yeah it's it's a weird thing i don't understand why but i think once people certain people i think it's these kind of alpha males who kind of get threatened because they think oh well who's this oak you know he was in the royal marines and you know they're trying to try to try and test you and that you know which is probably the worst decision they ever made i recall one day you came home with with a bit of a blood nose but i think um you you got off lightly amongst those other four yeah um who you sorted out yeah i actually got arrested and everything got in a big fight in the bar and the police came and arrested me and rested these other four guys were which were quite older than me and i was yeah we were all outside and i blood all over me and and the police started shouting at them saying why are you for boys eating this young guy so yeah but in terms of my mind i mean that must have been like like what the hell like i've just been you you guys don't know what you've just what i've just seen over in afghanistan and i've got to come back here and deal with you guys yeah because you've got alpha egos or male egos yeah people just people don't don't understand you know but i during that time i i you know i was kind of a bit off the rails to be honest like i was really like out there i mean remember when i was at your house and and i woke you up and i was like there's someone in the garden someone in the garden now there's your gun where's your and i got your handgun you gave me your handgun and i'm like going around the garden and i saw and i just peeped out the window and there you were like stealth-like mode with my nightmare going through the garden going through your succulents and that was just a like a moment of ptsd yeah just a moment of paranoia i still get it now like i still have paranoia and um but you've turned to your music a lot more yeah to express that music has helped me heal a lot you know because really i'm i'm just expressing uh what's coming from me you know so it's not um i'm not trying to i don't know sometimes it's like crying you know not many people especially amongst men it's a bit of a thing don't cry because uh you know it's not what guys do you know but as humans we need to express those things you know we need to get out uh some of the the pain and and the and and the stuff we have even as a woman i still sit in the in the shower and cried my feet it's good to have a cry it actually sorts  out you know sometimes you just like that and then afterwards it's like when you're a kid you know you have a little tantrum yeah so we're talking you talk about covert and this is where we are right now in zimbabwe and everyone is in lockdown around the world and we happen to be in this most beautiful space um fresh air and that's something that talks to you a lot as well is is your passion for wildlife and your passion for nature yes um so you've written some songs and you've you know done recently yeah written i've written a song called human tied yes um but yeah you know you really come to a deeper appreciation well i have personally like traveling around the world for the last two years i've just seen that there's not many places like this in the world this is actually you i grow up here and i kind of like take it for granted you know but when you actually go out and you you come back here you realize how important these areas are you know and they're healing they'd heal you because it's very soulful it's nature in its rawest form and you come out yeah you're you're not the dominant species you know you can if you're in wang you're lying at night and there's lions roaring and everything you know you think jesus i'm i'm out of my uh my death here but it gives you a great appreciation for where you actually started things you know so we need that i think everybody needs that and especially everyone now listening to this needs to have um an idea of where they want to travel to next and yeah they're ready to travel you know um so well if you're thinking of traveling i would definitely recommend coming to zimbabwe because it's really un unspoiled by a lot of the world you come back come here it's like going back in time a little bit but that's what this song's about it's called human tide and it's about the tide that's coming in and it's the human race overpopulation and how it's affecting our wild areas and nature as a whole so here we go this is human time [Music] [Music] it's coming in it's coming in real fast and we all know [Music] it ain't gonna last garbage trucks making more rounds tropical birds making this sounds cause we're too foggy it's coming in do you choose to sink or swim can you say that you tried to swim against the human tide so al you know you you were out of the country and i want to know what your message is to to other kids who um or laities who've left zimbabwe what do you what do you what is your message to them to come back um well i made a decision to come back because you know i just managed managed to get around to some places and i really found that i really just love being in zim like it really grounds me being here being out in nature i was in lockdown in portugal and i'd rather be locked down here in zimbabwe in this environment than be locked down over there so i would say to anyone who's thinking of coming back to zim now is a good time zimbabwe is really changed and things are looking good and there's a lot of opportunity here to get involved and actually to live this kind of lifestyle out here in the bush and yeah just to live a bit more of a free and enjoyable life so i'd say and rebuild our country yeah and rebuild the country you know the more use and energy and yeah we need we need that yeah you know and i just think if if we just had more people come back you know safety numbers the more of us come back you know the better things will become so so come back we're waiting and just before we finish off i noticed you have a massive yummy yummy yes is the river god of kariba it's like the the god of of kareem always when we are out there fishing um you always got to toast the nyami nami gods with your beer in the morning first before you're going to catch a fish yeah so why why your this is something that really represents uh being zimbabwean i think would be a big thing just like the copper bracelets you know you don't find this anywhere else in the world and it's a half snake half fish and it protects you um in water so you can go swimming in the in the rapids i would suggest it but you know your neck but yeah it's a special that symbolizes a lot you know about zimbabwe and and the the history yeah and ethos it's really yeah that's why i wear it i got uh this one is made out of bone and it's beautiful yeah i love it so follow alistair on his um instagram pages his spotify um we're gonna do a lot more work with alistair going forward in terms of of having gigs out here metopus as well at our melinda lodge and alastair we wish you all the best maybe tell everybody where to find you yeah i think you can find uh if you type in black

absolutely\nspectacular with his yellows. - I've never seen one so beautiful before. (light melodic music) - [Mike] There you can see, you can see the venom\nflowing, very nice, very nice. (dynamic upbeat music) Hey, good morning everybody, you beautiful people out there, can you do me a favor before\nwe get started on this vlog, can you go down the comments and tell me something\nawesome about you guys? I really need it today, I need to read some uplifting things, I've been going a million miles a minute for the last three months and I need some energy from you guys, so let me know in the\ncomments something awesome and let's get this day started. It is gonna be a busy day, because I have a tour coming any minute and then I have the\nfirst ever birthday party at the reptarium, I'm a little nervous, because we haven't done it, I've done plenty of birthday parties, when I've traveled to places, the first one at the reptarium, so fingers crossed everything goes well. I did wanna share with you\nguys a couple of things, that we just put on exhibit yesterday for the very first time, of course, this is that\nlittle Dumeril's boa, that someone donated to the zoo the first night that we were open and the person that donated it said it was having a little\nbit of an issue with feeding, but ever since it's been here, it has just been crushing food. So I finally thought this\nis a beautiful animal, let's go ahead and put it on exhibit and let people enjoy it as much\nas I've enjoyed it for sure. Another animal that we've\nhad is this beautiful guy right here, take a look\nat this monkey right here, of course this is a\nNorthern blue-tongued skink, that we produced a few months back, Mary actually kind of\nhas been babying this one and then handling it a bunch,\nso it can be really tame. Of course, you guys know\nthat we have Potato, but now when you come, if you wanna see a Northern blue-tongued\nskink, not just a Centralian, you can see this little bugger. Now both of these guys do need names and by the way, there's\na handful of animals that still need names at the zoo, I'm gonna have to update you guys on it, but regardless, anyways, busy\nday today, gonna be awesome, comment down below, let's\nget this day started. Hanging out today with\nthese guys right here, how do you feel about Perdida, cool? - Yeah.\n- Alright, cool and it's your birthday and your birthday - Yeah.\n- coming up, right? - That's awesome.\n- Yeah, tomorrow. - [Brian] Well, I appreciate you guys spending some time with me. (mellow upbeat music) Thank you so much for coming down, you guys are awesome,\nyou're welcome here anytime, thank you guys.\n- Thank you. - [Brian] Keep it going, happy birthday, happy birthday.\n- Thank you. - [Brian] Alright, come back and visit me anytime, right guys? - Okay.\n- Okay. - Alright, thanks, bye.\n- Bye. - The tour done, absolutely amazing time. I've been so lucky to get just a bunch of really cool people, that\nwanna come and hang out, never had any issues, these\nguys were super, super cool, so into the animals. Now we actually have\nour first birthday party ever at the reptarium, I mean, we had people\ncome for their birthday, but this is the first\nactual birthday party with a 45-minute\npresentation attached to it, so this ought to be fun, I've done plenty of\npresentations in the past, so I guess it's the same,\nbut this is the first one here at the reptarium, wish me luck. - It's very scary!\n- Lovely. (mellow upbeat music) - Just wrapped up Sam's birthday party, it was cool, I mean, definitely they were a little bit older, so we didn't do the kind of presentation that we were initially planning, honestly, we spent an hour and a half just kind of pulling animals\nout and having a good time, - Yeah. - But it went pretty well, right? - I think so, they were super happy, Sam's Mom said he was over the moon and honestly, that's all we care about. - Exactly, we always say it, when you come to the reptarium, whether it's a private\nparty, a birthday party, or even just visiting, we\nwant you to leave happy and it worked out well. So now just a bunch of little things to do and then we open to the\npublic in about an hour. Okay, so I'm about to get\npretty deep with you guys and you know I like to keep things upbeat, I like to keep positivity, but there was a situation, that\nhappened to a friend of mine over in South Africa recently and I've been wanting to\ndo a video about this, but I wasn't exactly sure how to do it, more importantly, I wanna\ntry to help the family. So you might remember my last trip, that myself and Forrest\nwent to South Africa and we stopped at a friend\nof mine, Ryan's house. You have some amazing animals, you definitely do a lot of\nBothrops, which is amazing, we're gonna see a bunch\nof different things. He had an amazing venomous collection, he also worked with Mike Perry, who did the venom\nextraction for black mambas. Oh, my gosh, this is fantastic, Mike! - [Mike] There you can see, you can see the venom\nflowing, very nice, very nice. - That Ryan was one of\nthe more passionate people I've ever met, when it\ncame to not only snakes, but in particular, venomous snakes. - He's absolutely\nspectacular with his yellows. - I've never seen one so beautiful before. - To be honest with you, I mean, I've taken a lot\nof pictures of this snake on my camera, you can't\ncapture the beauty. - You can't capture how beautiful\nthis snake is in person. - You wanna have to keep her. - [Brian] My time I spent with\nhim was absolutely incredible and I know that all he cared\nabout was doing what he did and I know that when it comes to me, that I wanna do what I do, no matter what the consequences are and Ryan, every day worked not only with his own venomous collection, but also extracting venom\nat Mike Perry's Venom Lab with black mambas and cobras. (melancholic music) So, so I was very upset to\nhear the news recently, that Ryan was bitten by a black mamba. - Ryan, my mentor, my\nfriend and my brother. On the 26th of September 2018, Wednesday, Ryan Vincent Soobrayan was\nbusy milking a black mamba, which he had done countless times before and his one finger, his index finger got caught on the fang, sorry, this is quite emotional for me. - Again, Ryan spent his life not only keeping these amazing,\namazing venomous snakes, but also risking his life to extract venom to save other people's life. - 50 seconds later, after the prick, Ryan was unconscious and\nwent into anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis is an allergic\nreaction to the venom. He was quickly raced off to hospital where they resuscitated him, he spent a few days in a coma, in which the 27th of September was his 27th birthday. - I wanna believe that the\ntime that I've spent with Ryan, that although this is\nan unbelievable tragedy and I know some friends of mine in South Africa are completely gutted, but Ryan lived his life\nthe way he wanted to. - Yesterday morning, 29th September, Ryan went in for a brain scan and after that, they switched\nhim off life support. (melancholic music) Ryan, you're my hero, you'll\nlive on in me forever. Ryan sadly died from\nthat black mamba prick, but he wouldn't want you\nto not love the animal or hate it or anything like that, he would in fact want\nyou to love the animal and respect it with all the\nrespect you can give it, that's how good of a guy he was, even though it took his life, he would want you to\nstill love the animal. - This is always such\na touchy thing for me, because I've always said that if I were ever to pick\na way that I wanted to go, it would probably be doing something that I really love like\nworking with animals and I realize that isn't good for Ryan's family and his friends. I've actually personally always\nhad this reoccurring dream, since I was pretty young, that I was eventually gonna\nbe killed by a venomous snake and in particular, a cobra. Now whether or not that\nhappens, I don't know, you know, but for me personally, if that happened, I would know that I died doing something I absolutely love. Now again, that doesn't\nmake the family better, it's not what I want, it's\nnot what I wanted for Ryan, of course every time I go to South Africa, not having an opportunity\nto spend time with Ryan is gonna be really devastating and certainly people\nlike his family and Bryce and all his friends and\nfamily are devastated and that's one of the reasons\nI wanted to make this video too is to try to give them help. We've put a link down below for a GoFundMe page for Ryan's family, if you so choose, you can\ndonate to that GoFundMe page and help all of the expenses going forward and I just know that Ryan left a mark on lot of people in this life, he saved lives and he lost his life doing something that not only he loved, but also something that\nwas gonna help others, save their lives. So Ryan, I'm gonna miss you, buddy. The short amount of time\nthat we spent together really impacted me and\nI can't thank you enough and I guarantee you one day, me and you are gonna be running around somewhere in the future\ncatching snakes together again, so rest in peace, Ryan,\nyou will be truly missed. Again guys, I don't mean to\nbring things down, you know, again, it's a terrible tragedy, I know a lot of people are\nreally hurting right now and all I can know how to do\nis to bring you guys the story, let you know what an\namazing person Ryan was and then carry on in his name, kind of doing the things\nthat he believed in, which was just the love of animals and getting people to understand some of the most mistaken\nanimals on the planet, things like black mambas. We have to open up the reptarium soon, so to get me into the best\nmood that I possibly can, I think I'm gonna feed my frogs, I hope you guys don't mind transitioning to something\nlike that, but regardless. (mellow upbeat music) And again, there's no real\neasy way to transition from that kind of news I shared with you to kind of let's have a\ngreat day at the reptarium, I'm just gonna try to do the best I can do to again continue to kind of carry on the love and the passion that\nRyan showed to so many people. So let's go ahead and\nopen up the reptarium and do our best to enjoy this evening. Hi guys, how are you? Hey, what's going on? Good to see you again. Hey bud, what are you doing? Hi, how are you? Hey guys, how are you? Hi, welcome, welcome, welcome. Hi guys, how are you?\n- Hi. - Hi.\n- Hi, how are you? Another really great day, I mean, there's definitely\nbeen a lot of people, busy. So what do you think, you know, I mean, it's been a month now or so, I mean, how do you feel about it? - I feel like it's very hot in here and we need some fan\ninstallations in the ceiling, that's what I feel like. - It does get warm in here, the bodyheat, we actually turned the temperature down and then the body heat kicks it up, it is definitely hot.\n- Yeah, no, but it's really cool, it's\nawesome to see all the people here come in and enjoying\nall the reptiles. Look, there's like a little\nthree-year old over there just holding a little snake, like it just doesn't get\nany better than this. - So you were here for\nthe opening weekend, so you've been here since, this is what, how many times you been here?\n- Four times. - She's been here four times, you're just having some\ntime with Callan right now. It's really cool to see people\ncontinuing to come back, I think it's absolutely amazing and she's been unbelievably supportive, so thank you for that. (mellow upbeat music) Another person that actually\ncame the first weekend as well, you're getting a little Perdida time, huh? - She said it was with Ryan.\n- Yeah. - And there it is, guys,\nwrapping another one up, we've got one more day\nof open at the reptarium, but tomorrow I may be traveling to go to Critchlow's Alligator Sanctuary, you guys may remember that\nI donated Mitch and J-Paul, RJ's roommates, alligators to Critchlow, so we're gonna go move some\nalligators from outside inside, because they're here in\nMichigan and it's getting cold, so they need to go into hibernation. We may do that, if I'm feeling up to it, it depends if this silly\ncold is over or not, so tomorrow we may be\ngoing on an adventure, but we will definitely\nbe back at the reptarium at night to open up and have some fun. With that being said, I'm\ngonna go ahead and end the vlog and wish you guys an\nabsolutely amazing day, evening, whenever you\nhappen to be watching, your support is so amazing,\nit means so much to me and I truly do love you guys so much. Can you do me a couple of favors\nbefore we get out of here? Can you smash that Like button, turn those post notifications on, leave a comment, because I\nlike reading about you guys. Be kind to someone and I promise I will\nsee you guys tomorrow. - Though Ryan's no longer with us and many of us are flipping heartbroken, I'm fighting back the tears, that's all. (mellow upbeat music)", "sOAVuyKHjwo": "a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign um okay", "wNe6lndhQK8": "my name is miguel cazais i'm uh one of the founders of the band and i play drums i'm marquis i play i play keyboard and sometimes guitar uh i'm gleerm and and i'm playing all the keyboards uh with marco pedro tatanka uh i play the guitar and i sing as well and we are the black man but just in case you don't know [Music] hey perfect thank you for that i i know it's like the most awkward thing to do instruction but i wanted to start off by saying uh congratulations or parabanes uh for your victory um at any point between submitting the song to um rtp after they approached you and the final performance did you ever expect to win the festival we were very confident that we had a good song and we're going to do a good performance but by then we didn't know which songs the the the other artists had and uh and and we knew from start that we we would gonna have issues with english because it's our it's the first time that that that portugal sends a a a song fully in english so we knew that we're gonna have issues with that but we believed all the time that it was possible um after we know the songs the other the other contestants the song their songs and uh probably the numbers on youtube as well as soon as the as the performance the live performances came out um didn't indicated that that um that we were favorites so we went to the final with with the mindset that we we had to do a great performance uh and just that and the rest is history you know you know i believed that we were go we could win i have to be honest and we did you've had the honor of doing interviews of random 22 year olds in london but yeah i mean it was what i love about the festival is that it's always very unpredictable it's never the case of whoever has the most numbers wins it's about atmosphere it's about connection and there's a lot of emphasis on artistic integrity and the juries are selected by the broadcaster very specifically with that in mind and just listening to some of your other music like love is on my side is very much in tune with the music you make and it's very authentic to your sound so do you think that that was a helping factor despite the song being now the first english entry for eurovision from portugal in 53 years so we knew from start that we we're going to be different even in portugal we're going to be different uh and we we we kept faithful to our to our to our beliefs to our to the music we love to the music we make to the music we made till then and uh and that's that's uh that's a factor that uh s maybe probably even more in in eurovision from the other contestants in i guess we don't do modern music but we're different and that's that's a good good point uh probably i don't know i don't know how it works in in in eurovision but probably the jury can can like that because we we we're really faithful to to our origins to our um to our beliefs and we're very true truthful i don't know if if that's the word to what we believe so i guess it's it's probably a good a good good point to be fair you did win also in the televote in the first semi-final the public definitely got behind you and have you found uh support from the portuguese public following your win we we were very surprised to have the such uh support from the audience because we have uh other contestants that have uh a lot of uh they are really really big in the the social media a lot of followers etc so that was one of the the the the factors that we didn't we weren't ex we weren't expecting to to to to be so can you say to have so so much support from the audience we knew that the audience the audience liked us but uh it was a surprise it was it was a surprise yeah i can say so you've been active as a band for about 11 years now is that correct yeah um and you've released some albums you've also like done gigs internationally had you been approached by activepair before to participate in the festival or was this the first time you had been asked to do it it was we were about to participate in last year okay uh but we couldn't because we were touring um [Music] during the the winter we were doing a tour uh celebrating the 10 10th anniversary and um and that's why we couldn't we couldn't do it so the invitation passed uh to this year and kept kept to to this year and we're happy to we're happy we did it it worked well i guess basically if if if we could accept last year and we won imagine that we would win we we wouldn't be allowed to go because there were there wasn't no eurovision right yeah so we're happy that things happen that way yeah worked out so had you um participated last year would this have been the song had you written it by that point or was this done since that invite it was already written yeah okay cool was this for like a forthcoming album and it was yeah we [Music] we had this idea to to to write an album based on stories that happened in red light district in amsterdam since we went there since we went there touring in 2000 in 2018 so we we were there living and playing all night every night and we actually realized that that was the perfect imaginary universe to write about all those characters like in solid kind of characters that you find there are very hard to find are very hard to find here very unique very hard to find somewhere else so we we wanted to to to write an album based on that and um [Music] and then after we came i started the wrote actually i we were we started to to write this song right before that but it never it never went anywhere so we kept kept it aside and uh when we came back uh i wrote this song and it was there waiting it was the only song that i had that i that i had written to the black man but that time so [Music] he had these two two specific times that the song was was written before amsterdam and after empty well it's a full circle moment because fingers crossed you'll be back in the netherlands in may yeah i'm not sure the red light district's doing it at the moment during a pandemic i can only imagine i was there we're not superstitious but now we're starting to believe that in superstition yeah i guess yeah well something's on your side for sure i can't say what but you're coming back full circle and things happen to have worked out for you um a question i've been asking a lot of portuguese artists um particularly this year is kind of reflecting on the post-2017 changes to the festival i know a lot of people in portugal are aware of the festival not everyone watches it everyone has an opinion but there's definitely been a huge change in the way the broadcaster has approached it particularly in the selection of artists did that have any bearing on your decision to take part yeah i think for most of us and most of the musicians in portugal i think uh because salvador after winning the the eurovision had so much hype and um not not in in portugal but in in the all around the world so i think after that everyone wants to be part of the the eurovision you know and the the festival de cancel here in portugal so for me and i think for us it was a big important part that salvador winning and like i think ftp also changed a little bit the concept yeah the concept of the festival and bring more uh new artists and indie artists more eclectic selection yeah yeah so i think they did they did a great job with that yeah because it wasn't it was not only uh after salvador it was the same commission that actually changed the year before that brought salvador in you know that they they already changed but people only noticed that it changed before after salvador salvador wins you know what i found when asking particularly portuguese artists um this question is that i got a lot of good recommendations i'm gonna ask you guys because you guys can have a very deep musical kind of appreciation which reflects in your sound what like portuguese artists do you want the rest of europe to know about um both fabia and kareetos told me about um antonio vetiver soyuz what do you think yeah my extrusionary pronunciation very much not portuguese yeah but like i discovered his music following that conversation and it really uh um spoke to me so i wanted to ask if you have any other recommendations of like portuguese artists that inspire you or like excite you that people outside of portugal may not know okay so can can we can we have one each yes sure okay i really like i really like um gp simulation yeah yeah he participated like two years ago right two years yeah before salvador oh after that i don't know you should check him out it's just it was after it was after you should check him out uh jp gpc munch he's a is a quite is a quite character he's really good and he writes really good really good songs everybody should know him for sure gee what's your thoughts about it one of the most important for me was josefons it was like one of the revolutionary singers and from the 70s right yeah and was part of my childhood yeah yeah i can say a a band that we already done uh um like um we got into a tv show do bring homage to this band that's called turvant that's uh one name in portugal that you you can't look away you have to to dig in and look these guys these guys are incredible back from from from the past great tunes very original you have to check them out and and very ahead of their time right yeah as well very ahead of the time so i have uh i have one uh most of people in portugal don't know them i had the pleasure to to cooperate with them um and and we all did the singer is is one of the heads behind some of our lyrics uh in every i guess he participates in all of her albums i guess uh yeah it's true um this band is the offshores they sing in english they have this kind of the tarantino kind of style they're really really good they're old guys uh the singer was the first punk singer in portugal in in the 70s the late 70s and they have really really really good musician and imaginarian aesthetics and uh i guess you people should check them out yeah thank you for sharing i really appreciate any like recommendations especially from countries that their musical scene isn't always doesn't always cross over to the rest of the continent it's always great to get that insight and that's something great about the festival that rtb have definitely implemented recently my final question to you all is what your hopes and expectations are because in may 200 million people will hear your song oh yeah i want i just want to know like what your hopes are if you have any particular expectations or you're just going to go with it like how do you feel about this platform that you're about to have to me one of one of the biggest and most important things uh to me and to us that could happen you already you already told us to to how many two hundred two hundred million yeah two hundred million are gonna watch us uh so that's that's gonna be great to promote our work and to open the borders so we can finally tour more often throughout europe and uh that's that's that's the biggest dream that that this band always had and the hope everything goes right and we can travel to rotterdam to to share our music and our love to the world what's your thought guys i i have zero perspectives uh i was just wanting to have fun with my friends and come back to the netherlands yeah a lot of fun and write some music there yeah man yeah yeah it's the same to put some seeds of our bands yeah and have a good experience in the revision because it's a i think it's a once in a lifetime experience right yeah yeah yeah we we we can we can lie to you as well because um we can't like if if we go well in the in the how do you say classification classification the ranking the ranking if we go well it's going to be better for us it's going to be better to the portuguese people because from from now on we represent the portuguese people we we're not only representing ourselves and that's a big burden to care event uh but um we're very confident in our abilities to to do that really well and then uh the faith belongs the destiny belongs to god portugal always stand behind the artists no matter what with coding series in 2019 um he didn't frank highly but everyone was like no cody should have qualified colin should have done better he was misunderstood and even the person giving the points in the on the saturday had a uh telemove t-shirt on he should be here too so i don't think that actually matters to people just from the conversations i've had it's about do we feel represented and they voted for you so clearly that's going to be the case so i don't think that's something you should worry about in my humble non-opinion yeah we're going to have fun and we very pretty much confident that we could that we can deliver the best performance that we can we're very confident in ourselves that we can do a very very good performance to make all portuguese people proud yeah that's all it's about right thank you guys so much for your time i really appreciate like you speaking to us and i know people from outside of the borders of portugal um appreciate your song and appreciate your uh attitudes and i can look forward to seeing you in may thank you man thank you so much thank you [Music] you", "kx5GN9aBVVk": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we're going to be taking a look at the newly released corvette assassin also known as the revenge of the fallen sideswipe now if you are looking to add this figure here to your collection he is currently available and in stock right now over at shoshi's store and for that of course i shall include a link down in the description box below i believe originally this figure was marketed under the black mamba brand although as the years have gone by i do believe that that has slightly changed especially here with this reissue although i'm pretty certain that they are still the same company just of course under a different name now for those of you unfamiliar with this particular mould as far as i'm aware this is in fact an upscaled and perhaps slightly improved version of the sidearm sideswipe which was a deluxe class originally released in either the hunt for the decepticons line or actually the revenge of the fallen line either way it is one of the best sideswipe moulds of all time and to get it here in an upscale with some new improvements a slew of accessories that sideswipe actually used throughout dark the moon and revenge of the fallen this has got to be the best version of the character so far so let's start off by taking a look at the accessories of course we get a pair of signature side swipe arm blades and these look really really well done of course they are rather simplistic as far as their design is concerned but you can just see the reflectiveness there to the metallic silver the entire figure and all of his accessories have been painted exceptionally well and i think they've done a terrific job of course these can be pegged onto either of sideswipe's arms and just to demonstrate how that looks they are very easy just to slide into the port in the hands and i think it looks really really awesome something which i'm not a massive fan of is that you are unable to actually rotate the wrists around so that the blades are visible here from the side i would really like to have actually been able to get that particular look here for sideswipe but nevertheless as far as the display is concerned you can definitely get him into many poses like we saw in the movie and of course we do get a pair of pistols which i believe we only see him use towards the end of revenge of the fallen and then of course darken the moon and i think the detailing as well as the paintwork on these particular pieces too have come out really nicely especially where that charred singed effect is towards the tip here of the barrels i do like how it fades into the very nice once again metallic silver and the overall sculpt work on these pieces too looks impeccable and much like the blades they can be inserted into either of the figures hands but taking a look here at sideswipe himself this is a really really nicely done ko the plastic quality feels great and the paint is some of the best i have seen it does not flake easy and really looks remarkable as mentioned earlier on in the review i do believe this is an upscaled of the sidearm side swipe mould so for those of you who already own that deluxe figure you'll pretty much know what to expect here with this release although with the enhancements i definitely do think this is the best transformable rotf side swipe that is currently out there and available you can see that as far as that head sculpt is concerned it really does look remarkable even better than the studio series side swipes head in my opinion and i love the variety of paint apps that they have used you can see how we've got this darker almost smoky silver used there for the face plate and if the camera will just focus you can pick out some of the sharper details there to the sculpt and of course we've got the very nice looking piercing blue eyes which two have been painted impeccably well my only major critique with this figure here in robot mode as far as aesthetic is concerned is that i do believe the top of the chest to be slightly too large and it can make the head look a little too small although in the grand scheme of things that is a minor critique for what is otherwise a really really well executed looking figure you can see how we've got these sections which flare off to the sides of course as they're on ball joints you could recess them slightly although i personally like to flare them upwards i think the overall torso design has come out really nicely and you can once again see the reflective nature to that amazing metallic silver that the entire figure has been painted in and despite me transforming him multiple times there is minimal paint scratching on this at all so considering it is a ko it is certainly one of the better kos out on the market you can see here that for the biceps and the shoulders the scope work once again has turned out impeccably well with some nice bronze highlights to pick out some of the sharper details of the sculpt and the fingers too have been sculpted impeccably well as we turn our attention here down to the lower section of the figure i'm not a huge fan of these hydraulic pieces when articulating the legs they do become easily detached and it can be rather difficult to actually reinsert them although if you were going for a static pose this probably wouldn't be an issue and i'm pretty certain that you could just glue them into the port although i'm not entirely sure as to whether or not that could restrict articulation overall turning here to a side perspective you can see that as far as the lower leg is concerned we've got some fantastic looking mechanical detail and as far as i can tell this is in fact a die cast piece so not only adds weight here to the lower section which is actually quite skinny in comparison to the upper torso so it does actually aid the stability of the figure but it also gives this really nice metallic flake to it as well which i think looks super super cool and of course we've got the hydraulics there one of which has been picked out in a very nice looking bronze and then turning our attention here down to the wheels you can see the die cast heel spurs that we have which once again does help aid stability for a character which essentially rolls around on wheels and overall i just think it looks really really cool as far as articulation is concerned sideswipe does have a ball joint here at the head which can look left to right as well as look up and down we do get ball joints here at the shoulders which could rotate the full 360 as well as hinge out to the sides full rotation here at the bicep 90 degree bend here at the elbow no wrist nor waist articulation although i put that mainly down to the transformation although i think they could have maybe engineered a rotation here for the wrist or perhaps it would have bumped in to this side panel but regardless we do get ball joints here at the legs which considering the design i think we do get quite a good range of motion kicking forwards and of course kicking back but you can see that once again these hydraulic pieces do easily become detached he can kick out to the side ever so slightly unfortunately he doesn't have the greatest range of motion here although you can rotate here at the top of the thigh we do get a hinge joint here at the knee which you can also see the working hydraulic that we get there and of course we do get a lower knee joint as well which i think is awesome and then finally this section can rotate mainly due to transformation although i have actually found this joint to be rather helpful when aiding some of the dynamic poses so overall as far as accuracy to the movie i really do think this is probably the best transformable sideswipe that is out there on the market and you can see even as we turn here to the back we've got some nice detailing which i don't believe was apparent on the original sidearm side swipe and of course you do have the door wings which is very accurate to the movie so i think he's really really well executed it's just that i do believe this section to be slightly too large you can see how it is a little too broad when in comparison to the smaller head sculpt but from a front on perspective it is nowhere near as noticeable as it is here from a bird's-eye perspective and in regards to articulation he pretty much has all of the joints that i would want from a side swipe based on of course revenge of the fallen here for a very quick size comparison we have our new black member corvette assassin compared next to the npm bumblebee and you can really see the drastic increase in scale of course npm bumblebee for those of you who own that figure is roughly a large voyager class perhaps small leader class as far as 2021 scale is concerned and considering this figure was originally a deluxe class you can certainly see the significant increase in scale but as far as an npm display is concerned i really do think this could work this side type is near enough spot on in terms of scale to how he would appear next to bumblebee in the movie and taking into account the exceptional paint and detail that we have it definitely does look as if it is an official takara tomy and hasbro masterpiece product and so to clear a path and transform sideswipe into his amazing corvette stingray alternate mode to begin with you're going to want to take these panels here and just flare them up to the top we can then take these side sections and you can see that tiny little circular hole that we have that will in fact peg in to this slot so just snap that in there of course come here to this side clip that into place we can then take sideswipe's head and tuck it away into this cavity you'll then want to turn your attention to the forearms bring this section up rotate the wrist all the way into the back and then rotate this section around and align it up here with this side panel of course repeat the same process here on the opposite side so hinge that up rotate the wrist all the way back and then just align this up appropriately here with this front section what i then like to do is come here to this side and you're going to want to detach these tiny side panels so just attach those they are held in by this tab and port and of course repeat the same process that will then unlock this entire back region which will then allow you to extend that we can take this panel lift this entire section forwards of course manipulate these here out of the way to allow for some additional clearance and then what you'll then want to do is take this entire section and i thought this was a fantastic touch and this may could be a direct carryover from sidearm sideswipe but if it is in fact something that black mamba have engineered it really is genius so you can rotate this around and as you do so it does reveal some fantastic mechanical detailing which honestly you aren't going to see in either mode this is merely just to aid the transformation experience so you can see as we rotate that around we reveal that mechanical detailing and then of course a much sleeker panel here for the roof of the car i really really love that touch we can then take these and just straighten those out rotate this here around and then just compress this in like so we can also see a tab that will peg underneath this section so just snap that in there fold out this rear plate here and then bring this section in and around and just snap that there into place once completed we can then take this section bring this entire region forwards you'll then want to take the lower section of the foot rotate this around and repeat the same process and then just take the heel spurs and collapse those in just like this that will then allow you to bring this here all the way to the back although i personally would not recommend tabbing this in just yet as we do have to manipulate the arms so rotate around and then rotate here at the bicep bring this entire region underneath just like so and then of course come here to this side and repeat the same process so rotate here at the shoulder and then rotate here at the bicep tuck all of this in and then just align these panels up appropriately on the underside snapping that in we can then turn our attention here to the legs you're going to want to straighten all of these joints out here at the knees so repeat the same process and you can see how we have tabs that will in fact peg into these slots so just snap that in there and of course come here to this side and repeat the same process just clip that there into place ensuring that everything is sat flush along the bed of the vehicle mode and then we can flip here to this side bring this panel around of course ensure that this here is aligned with the front and this tab will indeed peg there into this slot so just line that up snap that there into place and then just take this panel bring this front headlight forward slightly so that we can tuck that under there and of course repeat the exact same process here on this side rotate this here all the way around tap that there into place come here to this side snap that into place and here we have the corvette assassin fully transformed up into his amazing looking revenge of the fallen corvette stingray alternate mode and so taking a closer look here at sideswipe in his vehicle mode for a figure which is actually third party i believe they've done an exceptional job in essentially recreating the real life vehicle even going to the extent of painting the insignia here of corvette in the black and red which is of course accurate to how a real-life corvette logo would in fact look i'm not entirely sure as to how they've gotten away with it but it is here in my hand so they must have found a way around it but it is truly here that you can appreciate that amazing metallic silver paint that the entire figure has been decked out in they did not skimp out on this at all you can see here even at the front this entire section has got the really nice looking black detailing on the inside and you can even pick out some of the sharper details of the sculpt such as these tiny little intake vents of course we've got the headlights here at the front and that corvette logo and for a figure which is a transformer i think they've done quite a good job in actually concealing all of the panels of course we do have some panel lining but i think that they do come together quite close and tight and considering that they have actually completely painted him in silver meaning that there is no base plastic visible i think that for the most part it does create for a rather coherent look i'm also a massive fan of the smoky black plastic that they have in fact cast the front windscreen out of and these sections from what i can tell are indeed painted black so that means that you are unable to really see any type of interior robot mode cable which once again i think looks really awesome and this is indeed accurate to how the real-life corvette stingray does indeed look you can see here from a side perspective just how sleek and elegant this vehicle truly does look and we've got some incredible detailing here actually in the interior here of the wheels which is such a nice added bonus and all four wheels are in fact rubberized as well meaning that when rolling him along the ground he does so with ease and i think that's a really nice touch even taking a look here at the rear of the vehicle we've got the exhaust as well as the rear headlights which have been picked out in a very nice transparent red plastic and it does appear as if though there is actually some silver paint detailing underneath this so overall as far as the vehicle mode is concerned to me it is just as good if anything may be even better than the robot mode they truly have done such a splendid job and as i have mentioned throughout the entirety of this review i really do believe that this is in fact the best transformable movie verse sideswipe that there is currently available out on the market and i'm really surprised that no other company had actually come along and tried to give their take on sideswipe as from what i can gather he is in fact quite a popular character and i know myself and many of yous will agree with that as when the studio series version was announced it very quickly sold out and so some final thoughts here for the corvette assassin also known as a ko and upscaled version of sidearm sideswipe if you haven't gathered already from this review i am really really impressed with what black mamba have indeed done they've taken what was already one of the best transformable versions of sideswipe upscaled him i believe improved the mould slightly and of course slapped on a ton of silver metallic paint as well as some die-cast material and have also added additional accessories that the original hasbro version did not come with and it really really does pay off this is by far one of the best movie verse side swipes that i currently own in my collection and i've always really regarded the original human alliance side swipe as being one of my mpm style figures but this version has certainly dethroned him he looks great alongside npm bumblebee and of course even the npm ironhide and for those of you who are looking for a more detailed slightly more complex and more definitive representation of sideswipe to add to your collection at least for now i think this figure is certainly the one to go for with all that being said he is currently available and in stock right now over at shozi store and for that of course i shall include a link down in the description box below please be sure to let me know down in the comment section below on what you guys think of this particular figure and whether or not you shall be adding him to your collection i thank you all for watching and until my next review i'll see you then thanks for watching", "qBMUf_oHZeE": "[Music] yo what's up guys my name is duke welcome back on my channel today we are going to see the debut of asm's new girl group asper and it seems like they are having like a mixed

of reverb on their voices but the rebound is not like the usual v-verb that it sounds like normal echo it's a bit it's a bit edited i don't know how to describe i also like the synthesizer synthesizer choice uh it sounds really futuristic and a bit like an action movie but but not too heavy i don't know what to describe but it's really cool [Music] oh nice voice [Music] this is stunning [Music] she

concept i would say more hip-hop based style like blackpink and really unique vocals like g idol and put them all together and you got asper and i mean come on telling asper that they are like three top idol groups mixed together is the best compliment you could give someone right actually i thought they would go for something like wet velvet 2.0 but god damn this is really cool please write down

another luca vision video and welcome back to another eurovision 2021 reaction video that's right and judging by my outfit of choice today i'm sorry i tried and that title down below we are having a little look at portugal's entry for the 2021 eurovision song contest held in rotterdam now the winner of portugal's national final was the black member and his track is cool love is on my side now guys i must admit i haven't actually listened to any of the national final songs of portugal so this whole thing is going to be a brand new experience for me but what i really want to know is for you guys that did keep up please let me know who your favorites of the national selections were down below i want to see if there's any more tracks that i should be checking out but curiosity killed the cat and if i wonder anymore this cat's on its ninth life so say it with me in the chat let's react now guys correct me if i'm wrong but isn't a black man but a snake and believe me i know one or two of them you know who you are so let's go oh that orchestra is magical it's so classic oh his voice chase and it's in english that's a bit different for portugal voice is so silky it's like caramel oh this reminds me of like a disney film or something from the 20s like very elegant and classic oh and those the strings the vocal arrangement coincides with the strings and the classical elements of this song it's so sophisticated and elegant [Music] oh guys this is a beautiful oh we're in color now this reminds me of like an adele song but sung by a male singer it's that it has that sort of modern element and twist with that old 20s classic styling and a lot of people might say oh this is boring it's not boring it is so sweet and beautiful i love the build of the violins in the background his vocal tone is very unique it does kind of remind me of gabrielle crossed with adam levine from maroon 5. this is a moment i can see why this one i haven't heard the other songs but it does seem like he has control of the stage and there probably wasn't a dry eye in the audience if there was one he's got this whole stage presence about him that's just encapsulating you can't take your eyes and ears off of his performance oh and then the electric guitar comes in where did that come from was he holding it the entire performance i do feel like the song is dated guys but in a good way and it is memorable [Music] oh he smashed that his vocals were to die for the instrumentation was beautiful the aesthetics on stage was great as well i loved how it started off in a monochrome black and white kind of like before 60s time and then it went to modern day it went colorful but the music stayed the same it just showed you that that sort of music has stood the test of time and it was popular back then in the black and white television days and even nowadays in color tv and i thought aesthetically it was beautiful i loved the theme of the song the lyrics were very very sweet and his vocal tone was just so guys there we have it they were my thoughts of portugal's entry for the 2021 eurovision song contest what did you guys think were you a fan of that song just as i was or

they did a dance cover to espa black mamba this has been requested by a couple of you guys and i personally really like espa i think their music is so good and i really like the members as well so i personally really like espa this song in particular is probably one of my favorites from them so i'm excited to see how invasion girls perform this song so let's check it out whoa oh my god okay she's cute [Music] oh my gosh dude they're like they remind me so much of the espla [Music] members oh my gosh this is so cool dude this look they the camerawork is just like the she's so pretty though what's her name she's cute too they're all yo why are all every in every dance cover i watch i always fall for the members [Music] dude they're so fast [Music] because the dance moves in the s video are really fast like they're keeping up well you know yo i like her i like oh bro the camera worked this looks so professional oh my gosh though why are they so cute though [Music] oh okay [Music] yo

ending pose they're like yo good job guys i thought that dance cover was really well done it seems like these members could be a group honestly i feel like if someone told me this was an idol group and that these were all idols and not just dance cover dancers i would believe it because the level of performance is just so high quality i feel like a lot of these dancers have been dancing for a while because one thing i noticed while watching this video is that they all seem really comfortable on stage and on camera for those who don't dance for a long time that's not easy to do since they looked so natural and comfortable dancing and also lip singing the lines it seems like they're very experienced at performing i think my favorite members in this group are the ones that did giselle's lines and ninging's lines this is i have a problem guys like every time i watch these dance covers i end up falling for the dancers after watching pink panda i was like you know what i'm gonna follow all the members on instagram and i might have to find these members too because i might just turn into a fanboy honestly anyways guys if you like that reaction make sure to hit the subscribe button and also like this video if you guys want to see more reactions from me in the future make sure to leave some suggestions in the comments and i'll try to get to that as soon as possible i'll see you guys in the next video bye [Music] you", "Sjl2mxmcyAA": "[Music] so the song isn't bad at all for a rookie group it is really strong i was actually really surprised by it the song teaser seemed dark yet the song wasn't at all i thought the little references within the first verse were kind of cute lol the song starts off playful and then when it gets to the chorus it seems like rey of chilled confidence it reminds me of everglow's song player vocals really shined in black member and i really want to see the girls try a darker song next time i think having backing dances for a debut is a little questionable don't get me wrong the choreography is good but in some cases choreography can only look appealing because of the background dances therefore the dance being more dependent on numbers rather than members themselves but something i feel the need to say is thank goodness the ai members were not dancing with them it makes no sense for them to so i'm glad they weren't the choreography seemed bomb in the music video but that may be due to camera angles [Music] sm almost always put in efforts for visuals black mamba is no different the budget that must have gone into this is insane the music video kind of gives off q and a by cherry bullet and boom bayer by blackpink vibes the amount of technology in this constructs a clear theme throughout though the ending scene did creep me out a little the camera angles really helped the choreography and members to shine well i could not see anything wrong with the mv at all i am still worried luckily the emphasis on the ai members wasn't as extreme as i thought it would be in all honesty if i do stan it will not be for the concept i don't agree with it if i do stan it will most likely be for the four human members to me it seems like karina is being promoted the most and we've seen this trick before with yg and blackpink jenny had the most pretty butt activities such as starting in a lee hi song and with g-dragon karina was part of taeyong's choreography for one of his songs and was quite a part of it as well as doing a commercial with exo's kai this isn't a bad thing and it's not jenny's fault or karina's but i am worried about that to me it feels like they're promoting one member over the rest and you know what happened to jenny when yg did that so for that i am quite worried it's still concerning to me that you can buy the ai members but this debut also helps settle my mind a little the human members are the main focus like i had hoped and i don't see people or even sm promoting them as eight members excessively in the future i think people will grow to love the four members and appreciate the other four as part of a storyline and complicated law the group have it's still quite early as they debuted a few hours ago but from what i can see it will be okay i was originally worried about automation and how the music industry may be replaced but i realize that sm entertainment aren't actually giving the ai members enough to replace anything the music and choreography is placed entirely to the four real life members the ai like i just said seem to be there for plot line only

eurovision 2021. portugal will be sending black mamba with the song love is on my side which was not the favorite to win actually i believe neve was the favorite to win so i am looking forward to this i actually haven't looked at any of the national final for this which is very bad of me again but with so many songs coming out today i think it's fair to say it's all right that i didn't do that anyway and let us see what portugal has for us in this year's eurovision song contest but before we do so please do not forget to like and subscribe to my channel over here that is a very important and clicking that notification bell so you don't miss any of my videos and if you want to follow me over on instagram it is niche one my voice is slowly disappearing as you can tell getting very late black mamba take it away clicking play now oh we have gone old school beautiful voice [Music] okay it's a ballad but it's a beautifully sung one okay the guitar is it gonna come in somewhere honestly his voice is just captivating me [Music] love is on my side oh i love the instrumentals there [Music] it's groovy though isn't it oh i love the guitar oh my gosh why do i like this so much and i'm shocked because portugal's entries have not been as strong lately okay but was that it oh no i wanted more than that that was beautiful but way too short it felt like no time had just passed but in a way it was a bit like we were walking up a cliff but then we didn't actually get to see the view so in my opinion this is an amazing piece of music right there i love the guitar the instrumentals were beautiful his voice was incredible how can we make this a bit more exciting portugal because at the moment this just seems like a standard piece of music it doesn't feel like a eurovision entry in my opinion it gave me some goosebumps that's for sure i think that the older generation watching this will definitely connect with this but i do think that the younger generation is gonna have a serious problem connecting with this song but what did you think of portugal's song for this year's eurovision song contest please let me know down in the comment section below do you think black mamba was the right choice for portugal tell me all your thoughts and opinions that is very important and i will see you guys in the next one bye-bye", "EJq3jCQ6CPw": "foreign foreign by [Music] [Music] garden

portugal's entry for eurovision 2021 which will be held in rotterdam in may before we begin don't forget to give this video a thumbs up subscribe to our channel and hit that notification bell so you don't miss out on any of our new content let's go i love a bit of moody black and white i love a strings opening could be like from your face there's an old fashioned feel nice very old style i kind of feel like we've been taken back decades i love a big fedora hat yeah i really love his vocal tone love his voice oh that's a voice love his voice this is interesting no one's really serving us anything like this oh that voice and hi english we're reacting to portugal right it's in english for the first time i still can't believe portugal's sending something in english though this was unexpected that's weird for portugal because they always think in portuguese that made their songs so special portugal always sends something different from the rest of the year yeah like okay they have a different uterus survive portugal has always sent innovative entries to eurovision would like that chorus to go somewhere a little bit more we can't keep going at this pace it's just gonna completely get lost at eurovision but for some people this could be a pee break yeah some people might go too fast but it's good to have a mix because we have a lot of party songs this is stunning i would say i enjoy the simplicity of this performance it's nice and simple and old school it's cute i think this song is going to be a slow grower so it's eventually going to build but it's gonna take the whole song come after the storm okay and we're gradually turning to color that's a nice little trick oh this is so smooth oh no why did i go back to color i didn't want that i know a lot of people are really angry that this is not in portuguese and i get that but in english it's just hitting me quicker even the song is in english but you can still feel portuguese vibe this song feels nice it's not terrible but it doesn't have a soul i find it's very middle of the road but it does have its charm this sounds like it would just be on like a an easy listening radio station and no one would even think that's eurovision one of the great voices that we heard this year so far this is a nice song it's inoffensive there's nothing wrong with it but it's not going to light anyone's fire at the contest this isn't really lighting up my world i'm not gonna lie it's a nice wallet but we have plenty of nice palettes you need to stand out somewhere but there's so many songs it's difficult to grab your attention with this one i think so it could be a little bit forgettable with a mix of other songs it needs a bit more energy already being put into it because i'm getting kind of distracted and lost in the song now the only other entry i can think of that falls into this category is belgium super phonic and i think hoover sonic's song is much much stronger so portugal unfortunately is probably going to struggle this year i can appreciate the artistry in the song i don't know if it's going to qualify though even past the semi-final stage it needs a little bit extra it's good but i'm not sure how the audience gonna react to that probably the jury is gonna love it it doesn't scream portugal this is just so different from portugal honestly the range that this man has singing it's unbelievable i like his voice i like that kind of gospel group singing in the background i just want to like wave my arms in the air i do like this it's like a nice chill song yeah it's a very chill song i don't think it will feel well in eurovision like i said it's charming and it will have its audience it's a decent song it's a decent performance i think this kind of simplicity is what we need because so far is this year is very bop crazy we've got a lot of like flashing lights and kind of big i think in my playlist i won't be skipping this yes bravo well that is what we thought of portugal's entry to the eurovision song contest 2021 what are you seeing please let us know in the comment section down below and until the next video bye", "BzzovXOKCWk": "[Music] foreign [Music]

by now that espa made its mark on their very successful debut with black mamba but what you don't know is the meaning and the title hints that the groove left in their music video let's start with number one espa's official symbol in the beginning of the music video we can see the girls with their respective symbols karina has the heart symbol ning ning represents the butterfly giselle has the moon sign and lastly winter has the star symbol [Music] number two esva's universe the meaning behind the group's name espa is derived from the words avatar experience and aspect it means to be able to experience a new world through another avatar of yourself in the music video we can see that the avatars are trying to communicate with them and when their avatars joined a different world was unveiled wherein sm entertainment called it espis universe it showed that espa is truly a group for the members of the real world and the avatar members of the virtual world coexist supporting one another and they are able to promote together a dynamic identity number three the black mamba sm entertainment defines v-block mamba as a threatening existent to the world and a hinge into the connection of espa and a their avatars as it travels to their universe the girls express hate to the black mamba with the lyrics i'm viespa there can be two monochromed colors this is evolution the black mamba's existent took over the neon color universe and transformed it into its very own dark world number 4 takeover when the black mamba finally took over it altered the girls in their surroundings the train was dark and the garden was covered with a black mambas venom number 5 meeting with the avatars with the following lyrics is the me in the mirror you is it just a distorted vision if i could connect with you again i want to meet you now the girls asked avatars for help to regain their power against black mamba but only a karina and a winter was shown in the music video number six another avatar in the ending we can see the train remain dark and an unknown avatar was born in my theory i believe espa lost their battle against the black mamba and the black mamba successfully took over the espa universe and made its own avatar number seven is the avatar the next espa member recently it was rumored that sm entertainment is allegedly planning on adding three more members making espa a 7-member group in my theory maybe the new avatar in the ending is a clue to a possible new member this happened before with red velvet when yary was spotted in their happiness music video it left a clue that yary will eventually be a member and it was confirmed one year later when you're officially joining the group in 2015. number eight kwang yeah they said in the song leaving another clue which many fans speculated that it is an acronym of a seven member group k for karina w for winter and ferning ning g for gisele members with initials a y and a are left number nine espa joined the sm culture universe in super m's one music video a scene where taemin pulled out his phone revealed espa's official logo and the garden train used in especial black mamba music video was first seen in nct u's music video for make-a-wish later on espa joined the trend and featured boa and their black mamba's ending scene [Music] number 10 monster rookies in just nine hours espa broke the all-time record for the fastest debuting music video to reach 10 million views in kpop history and within 24 hours it had 21.4 million views on youtube owning the highest 24 hour view count for a debut mv in kpop espo also landed a number four spot on the list of 2020's most viewed girl cube music videos and also has the most viewed sm entertainment girl group music video in the first 24 hours espa is also the first female rookie group this year to reach 1 million followers on instagram you know a powerful debut indeed and that sums up my own envy facts and theory about

Truly trained professionals should be the only once that should keep mambas. I like the idea of mambas being displayed in zoos \n but somebody has to take care of them. But there are people trained to care for such dangerous animals. No person is really properly trained to handle mambas. I myself handled several docent mambas throughout my carrier. One of the first time was a confiscation in \n which someone had their entire venomous snake ... collection confiscated and brought to my facility. Among the confiscated snakes were three or four mambas \n that I had to place in cages. I actually pinned a few down and some of them I used the hook. Because the are so fast, agile and quick which makes \n them more dangerous than any other snake to handle. But giving enough room and practice they become handleable. Once I bought a mamba hatchling, raised it and I \n pretty much got to know its movement patterns. It got to know my movements too but I \n got to know how to handle it. Where to grab it and what little tricks there are to handling mambas. That comes in times and with experience. That does not happen over night. ", "UY0wcxyC7Ao": " - [Voiceover] Action.   - Well, Coyote Pack, I think\n  it's pretty safe to say that winter has set in in Ohio.   And while it might be cold,\n  that's not gonna stop us  from making an awesome\n Behind The Adventure.  (tribal music) Welcome back, everyone.   Wow, it is seriously\n  cold out here today,   like five degrees\n  Fahrenheit, and boy,   do I wish that I\n  was somewhere warm.    So today, we're taking\n   you back down to Florida.  You remember a couple of weeks\n ago when we did an episode    all about catching anoles?   Well, if you didn't\n  see that episode,  there was a scene at the end\n that gave me quite a surprise.  So let's take an extended look\n at one seriously close call.    Got a snake, right\n   here, right here. - [Voiceover] Hmm, what?    - The grassy, no,\n   the black racer.   Holy cow, and\n  they're super fast,    right there, you see him?   - [Voiceover] Yeah,\n  he's slithering.  - And I'm on this side\n of the logs, buddy.    I'm gonna get you.    Watch how fast they dart,   as soon as he\n  decides to take off.    Got 'em, got 'em,\n   got 'em, got 'em. Woo. (laughing) Trying to catch anoles,\nif you come across,    (groans and gasps)\n   oh, he bit me.    Good thing is,\n   he's not venemous.  Look at that, rattling the\n tail, just like a rattlesnake.    That's a warning sign,\n   where he tries to make me    think that he's venemous,\n   even though he's not.   Oh boy, he got my hand good.    Now this is one of\n   the top predators  that's out here eating\n the brown anole.   And they are so\n  unbelievably quick.   (groans) Again, jeez, maybe\n  I should just hold him    kinda out like this so I\n   don't take any more bites.  Look at how beautiful\n that snake is.   Now, this is another species\n  that does incredibly well in a residential area like this,   because there's so many\n  things for them to feast on.   Obviously the brown\n  anoles are probably    a pretty easy snack, but\n   then you've got all sorts    of rodents, and they will\n   even go after baby birds   if there are nests.   These snakes can climb,\n  but where they really shine    is on the ground. And I'll put him\ndown real quick,    hopefully I'll be able to\n   grab him a second time.    Ready, watch how fast this\n   snake takes off, ready?    You good? One, two, three. Look at that, he's\ngonna come right at you. It's okay, don't worry.   Woo. And out in the open\nlike this, he can feel--  - [Voiceover] I\n almost stepped on him. - [Coyote] Yeah, out in the\nopen like this he can feel that   he has nothing to go\n  under, so that's where he's gonna show us defensive\nposes like this, you see, he's kinda rearing up.  Look at that, he's\n got the tail rattling,  trying to shake these\n leaves, make us think    that he is a rattlesnake. And of course, you do have\neastern diamonbacks around here.   Watch your feet, it's okay,\n  don't worry about him, Mark, he's not gonna hurt you. He actually feels more\ncomfortable right there under your feet.  - [Mark] Does he look\n at me as protection?  - He does, because\n you're a shaded area, and potentially he could\nhide under your foot.    Now he's come behind you. All right, all right, all right,   let me just wrangle\n  him back here. Nope, nope, nope, jeez,  look how fast they go.    Okay, whoa, went right for\n   my face, holy mackerel.  Okay, that's probably\n about as much  as we need to stress him out. Let me see if I can just totally\nget him to calm down now.  Come here buddy, there we go.  Look at how beautiful\n that snake is.    Incredibly smooth,\n   incredibly smooth,   and that's what\n  allows them to move through the\nenvironment so quickly.   Oh boy, he's looking right\n  in my face, and he's saying,  \"Just get a little bit closer.    \"I gave you a bite\n   on both hands,   \"and I would love\n  to bite your nose.\" That's not gonna happen.   And he is musking right now,    so that's another\n   defensive tactic.  Let me poop, scare you\n away with that smell.  I'm sure it tastes pretty bad. But holy mackerel, that\nis the black racer. - [Mark] Kinda unexpected, huh?  - Totally unexpected,\n I don't know    if we're gonna be\n   able to top this. I was hoping for a bigger anole,   you never know what\n  you're gonna find. (gasps)  Whoa.   - [Mark] Did he bite\n  you in the face? - He bit my hat.   You never know what\n  you're gonna find.  Whoa.  Yikes, talk about getting face\n to face with the black racer.   I'll tell ya, that encounter\n  sure gives a new meaning   to the phrase up\n  close and personal.   I do feel lucky to\n  still have my nose,   even though I can't\n  feel it right now.   I think it's time to head in\n  and get some hot chocolate.  I'm Coyote Peterson, be brave,    stay wild, we'll\n   see you next week.  If you think that was\n one wild adventure,  check out the time I\n got a little too close   to the gila monster.

Brian Hanley I don't have a degree so it's nice to have something that does the represent the cause Academy wise I tend to like people who get out and do something really hard against demons the more I found out the more interesting new ones here's a guy with a high school education you're self-taught himself some pretty sophisticated immunology in biology it's as simple as this if you're an Africa whatever country I'd let's say Milos and you take a controlled dose and fed them through time you dilute it down and you're working her way up to a certain amount of that up to create an entire level for antibodies IgG you can walk out of your Hut get bit go back to work and not done it's as simple as that the good scientist doesn't argue with empirical results I know with Tim's results it's like riding with the sky being rude it needs work but it's real and it fits what we know about immunology there's there's no conflict here dr. handly and I hope we can take what I do and publish it and have other physicians clinicians take it out into the world to self immunize other people in the world anywhere in the world do people die from snakebite that's things like this you know work on it you work on it you work on it you work on it and then maybe the right people see it and you catch fire you never knew I'd like to help him accomplish there but Tim's experiments haven't been without great personal cost one injection of monocled cobra venom cause necrosis in his leg and he had to self amputate the muscle and that's not all it made a big mistake back in 2011 and took two cobra bites took one fine took another one and flatlined ICU it because it was so bad it's really cool to be at this stage and beat that with scary limb big mistake but sometimes when you make those mistakes you have to come back and get through them and do this which was the best thing that ever happened top buddy perhaps the biggest cost has been the breakup of his marriage and the damage to his relationship with his family you ever feel like though you pushed too hard oh yeah I pushed hardly hard they push myself to death literally he also pushed your family way I did but that's three people versus millions and millions and millions and millions I know you want to save lives and I understand that and I know that's your priority I always wish though that we came before the snake I wish if did -

to come out in the evening but it's morning for me right now um i just woke up it's like 11 00 a.m 12 00 something like that like 11 a.m 12 p.m something like that but um we actually did these videos yesterday and i was supposed to edit it last night but i'm editing it right now bro because we just kept doing videos and blah blah blah like the videos they're gonna come out eventually you know i'm saying but it's gonna take a little time to edit them but look check it we got shaq and kobe back here with another video not check it bro the last time y'all seen kobe and shaq on a quarter with each other when i made a video about it was when it was who versus it was kobe shack and lebron owner you know what i'm saying we were going bro me angelo and jaden bro that was a banger video i don't know i was a bang for that everyone crazy i'm god but look check it though if you would make sure to hit the like button and subscribe to the channel if it sound like i just woke up yes i just woke up like 25 30 minutes ago make sure you hit the like button we got kobe shaq and parker's all here it's me sheer and jaden the homie you know what i'm saying but let's get it we're gonna get into the gameplay and um get ready for the comment so the first game on the threes and of course i mean just why not you know what i'm saying like we're going against all pure builds again we got a pure sharp a pure stretch and a pure shotgun now bro i've noticed that the pure shot created that's one of the most broken builds in the game bro you can cheese your bro you can cheese the life out of people with a pure shot but look i'm representing kobe on my defending shot creator we got this man cheer on a pure lock now cheers on a center pure lock but whenever you see this whenever you see his built play you're going you're going to be like oh it does feel like shaq you know but like just check it out so jay ended up actually getting i think kicked out of the game or something like that for some odd reason and it was like a 2v3 for for a minute and then like one of their teammates left and then it was like a fair two v two but as you see right there they're getting the easy three point off to start off the game you know what i said but look though check it as i told you i was before it was a 3v2 for a little minute so i'm getting double team this man sure is low-key kind of wide open so i see this man shear i pass the ball out this year sure runs back towards the rack and get an easy contact so in the last possession we gave up a little three-pointer so off the inbound i get the ball i do a little hesitation i split the defense i don't know where this man is going and i get an easy 360 dump so off the inbound here shaq has the ball so i'm gonna let this man's shack cook up so they lucky kind of double check a little bit so shaq does a little cross and does a little fatal and it goes in now one thing i noticed about being as big as shaq well as shear was on the shack built right bro nobody's gonna try to take you to the rack anyway so look i get a little cross on this man i break his ankles and then i hit the rack and get an easy 360 dunk for the intro clip so we back in our office i had a little kobe side up and then i hit the right right so i'm getting double teamed i do a i get into the post do a little post spin hit a little step back and he jumps so i get an easy job so we back here on offense i'm doing a few kobe sides up right and then i hit the left i run it to the left i come back towards the three-point line hit a little curry slot and i pull up because i broke his ankle so off the inbound this man shaq has the ball and his defender is completely on the island so he just beat him on the inside and just get the easy contact dunk right over so off the inbound this man shack passes to me i get an 80 mid range shot and i miss it this man shack snags the board his defender jumps and he gets an easy post fade away so we back her offense this man is on the island i had a little step back do a little kobe side i have a little curry slide hitting the step back again and i'm wide open with a 90 mid range and it goes in so off the fast break this man sure has the ball running towards the middle of the court it makes him do like a moving forward animation so i comes up get the steal from this man who just grabbed a great rebound i passed the ball back this year and we're gonna go for a lot so i'm running towards the goal sure goes in the mirror range area he throw the live i get it 84 and it goes in and that is the end of the game right there let's get into the next game bro this light on this video game is simply blinding me right now what is going on but look check it man we head to the next game and we going against all pure builds again we got two pure sharps and a pure stretch so they're all it's basically just a shooting lineup so we know that we're gonna have to play we're gonna have to we got to go crazy on the perimeter because there's some shooters i mean pure stretchers they can still you know get 80s on dunks but like most time you got to pure stretch you're not just going to dunk them you know what i'm saying it's a picture that's not a dunk spam type bill you don't spend a pure stretch you're just different that's up but so in the last position we just gave up an easy three-pointer so look this man parker saw gets wide open in the corner and i passed this but this man the ball and of course my guy he's wide open and it's green this bump animation is so annoying but look i run towards the goal and come back get a 62 fade away and it goes in so we plant some defense this man shaq is guarding this man this man pulls up with a fade away from three-point line and does not go in so we get the board we're down to court this man shaq passes to kobe and i passed to paul gasol and he's wide open of course and you already know the color that is a bit green and we go up eight to three kobe got the ball and it is time to kind of do a little kobe size i'll do a little spin move a little step back another uh curry slide coming back to my left and i get an easy path to the rack so i'll just take the easy dunk right there to go up 12 to 3. so yes i skipped a lot of clips because it was like layups it was like boring clips or whatever so yeah i really need to see those but look shot cuts towards the room and i get this man with an easy alley to go up 20 to 6 in this game and that is all she wrote for today man i'm gonna catch up boys in the next video it's probably gonna be like probably tomorrow
