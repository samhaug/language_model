{"D8DahUYbK4Q": "[Music] hi guys today I'm doing something much different than I've ever done before I really want to review something very basic and compare it with all different brands I've got a whole bunch of white teas for you guys today they are all crewnecks they are all 100% cotton they're all different price ranges so one of them is like 15 bucks the last one is almost $200 and I want to see if it's actually worth spending that kind of money on such a basic white tea for the record I don't plan on keeping all of them some of them still have their tags attached and that's just a chance for me to be able to keep the ones that are the most distinct from the pack and anything else that I feel is a little maybe subpar I will be returning and none of this is sponsored or gifted everything is something that I purchased myself so I will leave everything linked down in the description below that will list my sizes that I bought as well as my own measurements of my body so you can kind of compare and make a judgement on which size that you would get the first one is from made well this one's 15 bucks on sale right now I have to say it is very similar to a more expensive one that I have in a few minutes so keep watching what I want to talk about with this one is that the fit is really beautiful I like the fact that the shoulder is a drop shoulder which means that the sleeve isn't very long but it looks longer on me that's a preference of mine I like for my sleeves to be a little bit longer I also think that this shirt this fabric is very much more on the see-through side of things it's less opaque so it looks more like you would see a white bra through it so I think that that's another preference if you like to have your shirts be maybe more breathable and you don't mind if your bra shows a little bit then this would be a good option I like all sorts of tees I like really thick ones I like thin ones it just depends on the outfit of course with $15 you're not getting as much as you could be with things like ethical standards some other companies that I want to feature today are you know five stars on that realm but this one is just made well so they're making strides on fair trade but really just in their denim Department so far another factor to the fact that it's a see-through shirt it's a very thin material this shirt wouldn't last for you know several years like some of them will that's also something to keep into consideration maybe you aren't looking to invest in a white tee because the t-shirt will become stained over time especially if it's a thin material this next one is from ever Lane it runs 18 dollars right now it again is a very thin material but it's not as thin as the made well one was the fit of it I think is a dream I like the fact that it has like more of a longer sleeve but it's not incredibly long I also like the fact that the sleeves are a little bit tighter and that's just again everything dimension here is preference so judge for yourself on what you like if you like things to have a tighter sleeve or a sleeve that's up higher I prefer them to be longer no matter really how wide they are but I like the look of this one I think because the sleeves are tighter compared to the body that's a really flattering look when I was comparing the feel of each one of these shirts this one was one of the highest-ranked ones on how comfy it is it's very soft it's that pima cotton that makes it so soft there's nothing like that you know it compared to a regular regular cotton of any form this one is so super soft as far as durability like how long it will last I don't think that it will last like a month I think it'll last much longer than that but I don't think it'll last for a couple years just because it's a thinner material and that already will make it more prone to stains and rips and that type of thing I've had plenty of ever lain shirts that are made of this pima cotton material and I find that like my turtlenecks especially they will last about a year and when you think of a turtleneck you're wearing it through several seasons and same with a t-shirt you're gonna wear that spring summer fall at least so those are things to consider I would say that this is a really fair price considered all that I've read about with the good trade they've shown a lot about whatever lanes ethics are and I can link that again down below next is alternative apparel and this one runs about twenty four dollars it's a much thinner material just like the other ones were but this one has a very loose fit so this one's a small on me and I would say that the sleeves have the biggest difference there a shorter sleeve not my preference not my thing it's almost the way that a cap sleeve looks you know when it's just up and angled a little bit more so this one is not really one that I prefer the fit of myself the really redeeming qualities about it is that I think that it's the most comfortable thing it's not the most comfortable out of this pack but this one is right up there with the best of them and I will say too that this one is much more on the you know ethical and sustainable route if you want to go that route then this one would be an option for you to look into this one I'm quite shocked about so this is j.crew it's about 30 bucks I would say that it is so incredibly similar to the made well one the first one but you know what's so interesting is the fit is a little bit different the sleeves don't have that you know you don't have that drop shoulder that's making the sleeves look more flattering I really don't care for the fit of this one at all and I was looking closely and it's already starting to have a hole in it and all I've done is put it on a hanger and wear it around just for this video and it still has the tag on it like I haven't worn this out at all it's an extra extra small it's got that same fabric from made while so it's thinner but I have to say that I think it's just the way that made well has created there's I don't know exactly what they've done but this one is so much more fragile than that one is and the fit of it again not my favorite this is me not that like I made that feel both of these shirts he thinks they feel exactly the same but to me this one just feels just a little bit scratchy err in this case I'm just really surprised because this one is backward I think through July or any for months not only that but it's a best-seller I'm just kind of shocked at this one it's much different than what I would assume it's you know double the price of the made well one if you are torn between the made well and the j.crew one because they are so similar a hundred percent I would say go with the cheaper the made well one before reviewing the tape on all of these I thought this next one was going to be my absolute favorite and I haven't ruled that out yet but I have to say the feel of this one is just like heaven it is so dreamy and comfortable and soft it's so much softer than any of the other ones and so this one is from Quiana it runs about $45 the sleeves on it are very interesting because they are cuffed and they're sewn to be cuffed so you can't uncuffed them unless you take a little you know ditch remover and get that off but I love the look of this it's beautiful you know when you're thinking of the complete opposite and you buy a pack o t-shirts you know in a Hanes bag you wouldn't get something like this like this looks like something hanging up in a really nice shop so that's what I appreciate about this it's very extremely drapey and loose again I'm such a fan of longer sleeves so that one's hitting that box forming it's not extremely long but it's somewhere in the middle it almost has a shine on me too and when I was wearing it's acts like you know that has like a sheen to it and I found that to be really interesting a note about their ethics they're more of a slow fashion brand they're very fair trade and I actually even though it's a thinner shirt I don't think it's gonna fall apart very quickly it's very tightly knit and I think that that will give it a little bit more life to it but I do think that it could stain kind of easily next is redone and this one runs about $78 about a year ago Rhydian gave me a shirt and it was the exact same one it just I wore it to death and so I wanted to buy a new one myself and put it in with this list and just kind of compare it and hold it up against the others so one thing to note is that similarly to the made well in Jake it's got this sort of pattern to it if you look closely it's it's not an even pattern it almost looks like it's this heather color you know the way that it's knit together it's significantly different than the made while j.crew option it seems softer and yet heavier it has detail and the way that they knit this together in the back or sewed it together it looks like it's going to stand up the test of time much longer than some other options I just love the look of how vintage this looks it's just so inspired by that and I feel like I just have a different look about me when I'm wearing this shirt I also think it's great that they're using recycled or upcycle materials which redone is just known for I do think that there is just a couple of other shirts in this pack that I prefer more than this one I will say that this one is a dream it's durable it's got up cycled products that is using fabrics but then also just the fit of it it's gorgeous I would say that probably the way that how long it lasted me the last time was about a year but that was when it started to fade and I wanted something that was just bright white that I could compare against these and honestly I could still return this one and still keep going with my old one just kind of judge that for yourself how heavily you'd use this but I am really incredibly happy with this one this last one is somewhere in between really really expensive and affordable and I know that that's different for everybody but what I mean is it's luxury definitely it's not Chanel expensive but it's not you know much more affordable like the $15 option so this is Jesse kam and it runs about 195 dollars there are some really redeeming qualities about it where I am very tempted to keep it so I will just review those with you first of all it's more of an antique white it's not like a starch crisp clean white and I think that that will make it last a little bit longer because I don't have to try to maintain that brightness if you look closely the stitching on it is a very starch clean bright white which i think is a really unique detail to it then they put extra detail around here where it's like double stitched and the material is extremely thick it is so incredibly thick that I would say that you could definitely wear it in like spring and fall or you know if you're indoors but if you're gonna wear this outside in ninety hundred degrees you'd get pretty warm which might make you sweat and maybe stain the shirt so just kind of think about that but reviewing the tape I would say that this I was just blown away at how different this shirt was cut to make it look on me versus the other shirts the other shirts look more standard you know and that's what you get for what you pay when you wear something like this I was really surprised to see how much different I felt like it looked on me because I wasn't expecting that much of a difference for a basic white tee which is why I wanted I was like curious and wanting to try this example and I do love how long the sleeves are that's like automatically I'm gonna fall in love with anything that has that it's got a really wide cuff on the sleeves and I feel like that's another win like it looks really flattering there and then I because it's such a thick shirt and it's just made with such detail and quality and extra stitching everywhere this shirt is not going to disappear in a few months like some of the more like see-through or cheaper options are going to only last maybe you know a season whereas this one's going to last I could see if you took care of it maybe Scotch guarded at first it would last me you know a couple years at least maybe three years so you are paying for that and if you're more trying to buy less and just like consume less then something like this would be a good option because you're gonna have it forever you know as far as white tees are concerned and there's such a staple that I could see that that would be a really great benefit so Jesse Kim is more small business I think she has like three employees it's made locally in and those are reasons where it goes more into the cost of what you're paying for so look into all of that judge for yourself and just see where each one of these companies aligns with where your values are in those realms but this shirt overall it's five stars on how long it will last the fit of it I am absolutely in love with very tempted to keep it the feel of it I would say is the only thing holding me back from skipping it like five stars because it isn't super soft but I love the feeling of having a thick shirt sometimes you know so going into the ones that I'll be like keeping and returning I love love the Quiana one that one is my favorite I think that it's just such a great price range and I also think that the fit and the feel we're absolutely amazing so I definitely want to keep that one I'm also very tempted with the Jesse cam one even though it's much higher price I could see in the footage the difference of how it's cut compared to any of the others where I feel like okay it's a designer shirt like this one has reason for the price because it's just such a beautifully designed shirt and then the quality of it is right up there so no disappointments there I just you know maybe with time it will get even a little bit softer I wish that was just a little bit softer if it was it would have been my favorite out of the affordable options definitely the ever lane one was my favorite $18.00 and you get an incredible shirt and it's just beautifully cut the the design of it was flattering it's very light weight and it's something that I could wear every single day as for the ones I'll definitely be returning the alternative apparel one just really didn't amaze me enough to keep it just the way that it fit really was a little bit awkward to me and so it's just really not my preference I do think that their ethics are just amazing what it stands for so those are qualities that you might want to invest in and make up your own mind on that my least favorite in the one I'll definitely be returning was the j.crew option I just don't think that it was a good fit I feel like it was poorly put together it was double the price of the made while option and it's you know same company everything so I would rather just go with a maid well one if I was choosing between them I think that the maid well one had a much better sleeve length as far as having that drop shoulder and this one just doesn't have that so definitely not a fan of this one and that's it hopefully you found a shirt that meets exactly what you love maybe there's a certain fit you love or a brand or you know that it's standards behind it or maybe it's just a price point thing for you and all of those things are something to judge for yourself but I definitely have my winners and losers in this pack for my own personal taste and hopefully it just gives you guys insight if you like this sort of video then let me know because I could definitely do this more frequently with different types like maybe jeans or shoes or there's just so many options so give this video a thumbs up if you liked it don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time love dancing you never mind cloudy day make the world a better place do you love dancing [Music]", "ZnguoFcG290": "do you know how hard it is to find a perfect white t-shirt I've bought a lot of t-shirts over the years but there always seems to be something off slightly too long slightly too short sleeves a little too big sleeves a little too small easily wrinkles too large of a neckline can any of you guys relate I mean first of all problems right but you know what today is that they this stops because today we are going to find the perfect white t-shirt let's go [Music] okay so here's the deal the objective here is to compare different white t-shirts from different brands ranging from three dollar t-shirts all the way up to eighty dollar t-shirts and the attempts to hopefully find the perfect white team so right now I have a couple of the unit close to pima cotton tease sitting at home and one from Primark and there's one from a skit that should be arriving today so right now we are headed downtown to buy a couple of white t-shirts from hmm Zara costs and a PC and then we'll head back home and compare each of those side-by-side let's go [Music] okay guys so we are now back and we have a total of eight white t-shirts to try on so ranging from the cheapest to the most expensive we've got one from Primark two from H&M one which is their basic white t-shirt and another one that's a regular fit I'm not sure how tough it's gonna be different on those two so we're gonna see that later then we've got one from Uniqlo which is your basic supima cotton white t-shirt then we have two from asket one in extra-small and another one in small if you guys don't know ask it is a brand which makes 15 different sizes instead of the usual five so they basically go from extra small to extra large and then for each of those sizes you can choose between three different lengths short medium or long so I basically got to one an extra small and one in small both in regular length after that we've got one from costs and finally we've got one from a PC which is also their basic white sheet it's called a jimmy t-shirt on their website for sizing purposes know that I am 5 foot 7 tall I weigh 60 kilos and I usually wear the smallest size available in any given brand all right let's get into it [Music] okay so first off we've got this one from Primark it's their basic white t-shirts in extra-small and it's priced at $3.59 truck ssin is quite poor the stitching alongside the body is not symmetrical on both sides and the material is see-through so if you get close you can actually see like my tattoos underneath but I feel like we can expect that from a t-shirt at this price range so overall I probably wouldn't stock up on these as like my essential go-to t-shirt for for everyday use but at this price I mean I would consider wearing it at home if I'm doing some manual labor for example and I know I'm gonna get dirty or if you're really stranded on budget and you want something super cheap and you don't mind that the quality is not really there you can also go for this the fit is actually not that bad so I would recommend this if you're really tight on your budget [Music] alright number two we've got this hmm basic white t-shirt it's their basic cotton t-shirt in extra-small and it is priced at $6.99 that is since most of you guys are in the u.s. I'll be giving the prices in US dollars so it's an extra small but it definitely feels much bigger it's quite long it goes down below the crotch as you can see and it's also quite large on the side so it feels very oversized quite baggy definitely does not feel like an extra small and this fits much more like a medium size than an extra small as for the quality of the material it's a bit see-through but not too much I guess that's okay it feels slightly better than the Primark one but it also does not look like high quality cotton at all okay number three we have this regular fit H&M t-shirt this is super weird guys like I feel like a bat the fit is just really awkward like it's super super long and the sleeves are super tight there's like plenty of excess fabric right here which kind of makes it look really awkward lifts the tag here I'm definitely gonna be returning this one it's also six dollars 99 the other one was a much better fit to be honest even though it was also a little too big alright there we have it [Music] next up we've got Yoona close supima cotton white t-shirt so I've actually been wearing these for a number of years now I've got a couple in whites and then a couple in other neutral colors like Navy and gray they're all in extra-small underpriced that 9.99 for my height at least they fall right about mid crotch which i think is perfect for a t-shirt they're quite slim and they fit nice over the body and the sleeves are just about right I used to think that the sleeves were a little too big because my arms were a bit thin but now to be honest like I've been working out a bit getting a bit of arms and the fit is just perfect overall it's obviously not the highest quality cotton you're gonna have like it's it's slightly see-through and you lose a bit of that softness after like washing it a lot of times like not after a couple of washes but let's say if you had the t-shirt for like six months to a year and you've been wearing it like every week and washing it often you're gonna lose a little bit of that softness in the material but asides from that I've been quite happy with them I think they're a great balance between quality and budget so a $9 98 they're not gonna break the bank but you're still getting really good quality and the fit is nice but with that said the next four t-shirts I've never tried them on in the past so maybe who knows we're gonna find one that's better than this one from Uniqlo let's see what happens [Applause] all right so the next two are both going to be from a skits as I mentioned I go one an extra small and then one in small because they've got those 15 different sizes so you never know when there's that many sizes which one's gonna fit your best so one an extra small regular length and one in small also regular length so this one is the extra small and to be honest it feels super nice the cauda is it's a heavyweight 100% Egyptian cotton it does not look see-through at all and it just feels super nice and super soft onto the body and I keep in mind I haven't washed them yet but they really feel super nice on you lengthwise it does feel slightly too short the extra small it hits like at the crotch and maybe slightly too high on the armpits let's try on the small see if it fits any better be right back all right so now we have the ask it in size small regular length it definitely has a more room than the extra small one especially around the midsection and around the torso area and it's longer it hits about slightly under mid crotch which honestly I prefer the length of the Uniqlo t-shirts the material on this one feels better but I kind of feel like I would want it in between the two you know because it's much roomier on the sides and it's also longer but maybe slightly too long God you guys are gonna say I'm so picky but maybe like if you get an extra small in the longer length would that be better would it be in between the two would it be like super long I don't know okay so conclusion on these two from a skits if you're slightly under five foot seven because I'm five foot seven so if you're slightly under that and a little more thin I think the extra small in regular length would be a perfect fit but if you're slightly taller than me slightly taller than five foot seven and you slightly have a little more mass on you I would go for the smaller and if you're like me I would go for any in between so probably the Uniqlo ones okay let's move on to number seven alright number seven we've got this bonded cotton t-shirt from costs so this one is super big it's definitely much bigger than all the other t-shirts but not big as in ill-fitting big more like long line slash oversized kind of vibe so it would definitely work for a street wear a kind of look with that long line t-shirt maybe like under a denim jacket and you got the t-shirt kind of growing out of it to be honest I really like it it's got these kind of bands at the sleeves and at the bottom of the hem and it fits nicely for an oversized t-shirt like I would definitely not buy like 10 of these and have them be like my staple go to everyday t-shirts but as a more unique piece in my wardrobe I would rock it so it's priced at 60 I think just a second sorry about that it's priced at $45 USD so yeah it's definitely a bit more expensive than the rest but the material feels nice feels supersoft like you can feel that it's like heavy weight cotton drapes nicely over the body if you're into the oversize kind of look and you don't mind putting 45 bucks into a t-shirt I will go for it and lastly we have this t-shirt from a PC in size small and it is priced at $85.00 sir not too surprisingly it also fits a bit long like many t-shirts from many brands because I'm so short but other than that the material feels nice regarding the sleeves they feel slightly big but at the same time they also flare out very nicely and geometrically on the sides like this and although they make my arms look a little small I kind of like the look of it I like the look of how they flare out on the sides but then again is it worth $85 you guys decide for me probably not I probably wouldn't want to spend $85 for a t-shirt but the quality feels nice if you're taller than this like if you're slim if you're thin and you're tall like five foot nine or something this would probably fit you perfectly to be honest because other than the length it fits me pretty nicely all over so it's really only the length that's the problem if you're five nine and slim and you've got the money to pay 85 bucks for a teacher try it on fits nicely quality is good alright now that we have reviewed these eight different white tee shirts also I know that I didn't review one from Zara because I went to the store and couldn't find any t-shirt even not in whites I couldn't find anything in size small I mean in size extra small so sorry guys I cannot review that so in conclusion which one of these brands makes the best white t-shirt in my subjective opinion with my size and my height and my frame and build if we simply take into account the fit of the t-shirt I would definitely go for the unique low ones now if you're bringing the quality of the material and the durability and how transparent it is and how soft it feels to the touch I would go pretty asketh once those felt really high quality to me at a reasonably affordable price compared to like the more luxury brands like a PC like for a skits you get really high quality t-shirt for 40 bucks I'm not saying it's cheap it is expensive for a t-shirt but to get that premium quality fabric I think it's reasonable but then again when it comes to the size and the fits of a t-shirt it all comes down to your own personal body type so only use this as a reference while keeping in mind my size and keeping into account to your body type and how it would likely fit you and there's no better test than simply buying the t-shirt for yourself trying them on and seeing how they fit with that said I hope you guys got some value from this video let me know down in the comments if you enjoyed this style of video it's a bit

Which one is the softest? This one is $1.50 this one is $2.50 and this one\nis about $3.00. How could you ever tell without touching and feeling\nthem? The softness of a shirt has everything to do with the little details\nthat improve the quality of the fabric. In this video we're gonna explain the\ndifferences between the different grades of cotton. What's the difference between\ncarded open end, ring-spun and airlume combed and ring-spun anyway? We're about to\nexplain why the type of cotton matters and which kind to look for in this\nepisode of our series Us vs. Them. If you like this series so far go on and\nhit that subscribe button. Let's start with the worst type of cotton. It's\ncalled Carded Open End or COE for short. This type of cotton is super cheap,\nmaking it the cotton of choice for the one to two dollar tees of the world.\nIt's scratchy, heavy, stiff... kind of feels like the love child of a burlap sack and\na T-shirt. Now let's move on to ring spun. As fewer and fewer people were willing\nto settle for COE, manufacturers started making ring spun cotton.\nPeople often throw out the label ring spun and combed and ring spun\ninterchangeably, but these types of cotton are not the same. When cotton is\npicked there are a lot of impurities in its raw form. It's a plant so you have\nsoil and plant matter and it's just all-around dirty. If cotton is ring\nsponge but not combed and ring spun it means that all those impurities are spun\nup into the yarn. Whereas with combed and ring spun cotton\nthe raw cotton goes through a refining process to get rid of those impurities.\nWhat ends up happening is you lose a lot of the original cotton, resulting in a\nsmaller yield and costing manufacturers. But in the end you get a much better\nproduct. For you visual learners, just compare this photo (which is like ring\nspun cotton) to this photo (which is like combed and\nring-spun cotton). If cotton isn't combed it results in a tee that is hardly soft\nand a print surface that's less than optimal. Wondering where airlume cotton\nfits in this mix?At Bella+Canvas we go a step further with our airlume cotton to\nachieve something even more premium than combed and ring-spun cotton. First, we comb\nout 25% of the cotton we start with because we have super high standards for\nwhat constitutes as clean cotton. With most combed cotton only a small\npercentage of the impurities are actually removed. Then using only the\nlongest staples of cotton we spin yarn that has less stray fibers resulting\nin the smoothest print surface possible. Bottom line there's no cotton that's as\nsoft as our signature airlume combed and ring spun. So next time you're\ndeciding between a few tees make sure to pay attention to the type of cotton and\nmake sure it's airlume, the most premium blend of combed and ring-spun. It's just\nanother thing that separates Us from Them. Next week in this series we're\ngonna unravel the mystery of why your shirts are shrinking and let you in on\nthe secret as to why ours don't.

before we get started please make sure you guys like share subscribe all that good stuff hit the bell so that you get notified any time that i upload i try to upload at least one to two times a week sometimes more if i have time but at bare minimum one to two times a week um what we're going to do today is we are going to try sublimating on 100 cotton that's right 100 cotton um now i know like the first cardinal rule of sublimation is you have to have polyester but somebody not sure who to give the credit to created this solution um spray solution that you spray onto your cotton shirt and it allows you to sublimate onto the cotton basically the solution that you spray onto the shirt adheres to the cotton fibers of the shirt and allows the those fibers to be able to grip the ink so that you can sublimate on the shirt um is that's the information i got from the person that i purchased the solution from um that was the description that they gave and how it actually works so this is my first time trying it out with you guys i have not tried it on any other shirt before um and i felt like this was a perfect image to do i got this from a young lady in a craft group i'm in i purchased it from her um i can't remember her name off the top of my head i'm gonna have to look at my email and um i will leave her name in the description box so if you're interested in this image you can purchase it from her um but yeah this is the image i'm going to go ahead and use um i am going to mirror this because we know a sublimation we have to mirror i already have it have it sized out i'm going to be doing a 10 by 14 and a half and this is going to be on a large shirt i believe a large fruit of the loom um white 100 cotton shirt so i'm gonna go ahead and get this printed out i'm gonna come back and show you guys how i do it and we're gonna see if it works so stick around to see if we uh get it together all right guys so i am back here um i do have my image printed out here and then i have my this is my cotton t-shirt let me show you it's a haze i'm sorry it's a fruit of the womb platinum 100 cotton t-shirt 100 cotton um so that is what i'm going to attempt to silver on today um i do already have my butcher paper inside of my shirt to prevent any bleeding um okay and then i have my solution here i just put it in a spray bottle it came in a bottle this is the bottle that it came in and i put it inside of this spray bottle it's a hair um i've been using this for like just a water bottle for a while now but i put it inside of this to you know be able to easily spray it onto my shirt and i will link in the description box the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from so you guys can check it out if you want to okay so the first thing i'm going to do because this is cotton i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to do a um i'm going to let roll it and then i'm going to do a quick uh pre-press [Music] make sure my shirt is straight okay i'm gonna do a quick like 10 second um pre-press just to make sure all the moisture is um out of my shirt okay and now because my image is so big i'm just gonna place it on here i'm not gonna cut it i'm not gonna tape it or not i'm sorry i didn't even spray it gotta spray it first i'm just gonna give my solution a shake and then i'm going to spray the whole area you don't want it to be soaking wet you want it to be a little damp and then you gotta wait for it to dry so i'm gonna wait a couple minutes for this to dry and i will be right back okay so my shirt is um completely dry now um yeah it's completely dry now um so now i'm gonna take my image and like i said i'm not gonna cut it or anything because it's just a big piece of paper here i'm gonna place it on my shirt and then i'm going to cover it with some butcher paper like normal my heat press is already preheated 400 400 degrees and we're going to press this for 60 seconds so i will come back in 60 seconds all right so it has been about 60 seconds here my timer is going off i'm really hoping this works i can see the image through the paper that's always a good sign okay so it went through is definitely not as bright though i know for a fact that if i would have done this on a polyester shirt these colors would be absolutely popping and um here's the shirt and the colors are there it looks it looks pretty good okay it doesn't look bad for this to be a cotton shirt it does not look bad but i know if this was on a polyester shirt 100 polyester these colors would be absolutely like shining bright like a diamond but it's not bad it's not terrible it has a little bit of a vintage look to it i don't know if y'all can see but it did take okay so like i said this is the shirt let me show y'all the tag again it is come on camera focus a hundred percent cotton i don't know if my camera is focusing it's a hundred percent cotton shirt this was the sublimation and i'm actually pretty impressed um and because this is like a 90s throwback shirt the fact that it looks vintage doesn't bother me it kind of goes with the theme of the shirt so yeah i'm actually really impressed like i said i will put down in the description box the um the etsy shop that i purchased this solution from um i only purchased a small bottle because i wanted to try it out but i mean if this is the results i'm gonna get then i might go ahead and purchase myself a bigger bottle um but yeah i'll put the etsy shop name down in the description box it's not gonna be a blue link for you to click on it's gonna be an etsy shop name underneath the materials that i put in the description box so yeah and i got this um fruit of the loom shirt i got it from um um i got it from walmart and it's 100 cotton for the loom shirt so but i will put all of my materials down

talking about our Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt is our standard, most\neconomical t-shirt that we offer here. It comes in a wide range of colors\nhundred-percent cotton more generous fit than a lot of the more expensive brands.\nI'd say this is our go to shirt for a lot of large events. If you're ordering for a big group go with the one hundred percent cotton. It offers so many colors, it also comes in a comparable ladies\nstyle, so you can also order a ladies style to complement the unisex. Now, more\ngenerous fit, just like I said so just, instead of telling you about it we do have our model here. He's gonna come over and you're going to see what I mean. First off,  more generous fit here, it's not going to be as tailored. There's no side seam, here a lot of the more expensive shirts. A Canvas, Next Level,  American Apparel, Alternative and so on They have a side seam here, which basically is going to be more tailored, more contoured fitting. This is going to be more generous. Also, it is a hundred percent cotton so it's not gonna have kinda that pull to it. It's gonna be more contracting. Which, you don't have to worry about shrinkage and is pretty true to size but, just with that over the\ncourse of a lot of washes, there's a chance it could shrink if you dry it on high So, with that being said this is more of\na one time use shirt or, you know, a few uses. It's not gonna be one that's gonna be your favorite for years to come. In terms of the fit here the sleeve, more generous cut. I wouldn't say it's tapered by any means it is going\nto be a little baggier. Standard length right here it goes kinda down the bicep. In terms of the neckline here, very standard collar, it's gonna be right up on the neckline. The pull of it, it's always gonna come back, it's not going to be very stretchy. It's pretty much just the\nstandard cotton. If you want to step up, we really recommend maybe the Next Level hundred percent ring-spun, the Canvas one hundred percent ring-spun or even the American Apparel those are great kind of step ups. But this shirt right here amazing bang for your buck and nobody's\ngonna complain because they get a great shirt. It's just the soft factor is not all gonna be there. So, you look great in this, Tyler. Thank\nyou so much. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one. Thanks for watching this video.

your girl shanita nicole and welcome to do dream one if you're new and if you are already a dreamer welcome back welcome back welcome back okay y'all i'm geek today i'm excited today i am going to be using this poly acrylic i'm going to be using this some good old h2o and i'm going to be sublimating on a hundred percent cotton shirt so i'm gonna do two i'm gonna do gold because i'm feeling bold and i'm gonna do white you see this white so these are just your classic gildings i don't know about this when it's a heavy cotton these are classic guildens 100 gildan excuse me 100 cotton shirts both of them are 100 percent content now both 100 content and we're just gonna see and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna show you the image that i'm gonna use but i'm excited so what we're gonna do is we're going to use um this is spray bottle i got from the dollar store gonna use eight ounces of water and we're gonna use two tablespoons of this poly acrylic okay so the finish i'm doing is clear satin they have matte they have a bunch of different ones but this is the one i'm using so we gonna see how this one go okay okay so this is the image that i'm going to be using and now i just want to see how i want it on the shirt um the shirt is gonna be a medium shirt i typically really wear i could wear a medium large or extra large depending on how i want the shirt to fit i just grabbed a medium that was the first one i chose so i'm trying to figure out i think i'm going to duplicate it just in case i mess up i'll have the original copy right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to stretch it out a little bit i'ma see if i could do it because i like the page flip this way but i'm gonna see if i could stretch the image out a little bit just so i can wear it the way i want okay so right now we're just playing with the size so that's something you always want to be sure of when you're creating things how it's going to look on the shirt so remember the area that i spray you want to make sure you can actually see the image right so i'm letting it air dry then i'm probably going to just blow dry it to make sure it's all the way dry and soft and not like hard because if it air dry it'll probably be hard so i could throw it in dryer or blow dry it whatever i'll probably just blow dry because i don't feel like going down there so i mean i'm just keeping it real y'all know that's what i do so i'll make sure that i have enough of the image um so it can be this way yes i'm just doing like this now a few things this neon which i'll talk about later when i print it out it's not going to be neon because i don't have neon ink sublimation ink they do have it i just don't have any so it's going to that green is not it's probably gonna come out looking like this down here green okay so i do know that so i want the colors to pop but i know neon won't show because i don't have the colors to mix to make that so it'll be a different variation of it so i'm going to go ahead and send this to my epson workforce 7720 um and i'm going to do two of them because remember i'm doing it um i'm a print twice because i'm doing it on my um the gold shirt too just because i got to be fancy i don't know i just said i wanted to try it just to see how it would stick on that one too so we are going to y'all know i have presets already my popping colors i'm doing this in cassette 2 because that's where my larger paper is i'm printing two copies and yeah so that's the image we're gonna print it out i'm gonna come back once it's printed out and dry and we gonna get this thing popping ten all right stay tuned okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to put one tablespoon in first then i'm going to put the eight ounces of water then i'm going to put the second tablespoon okay then i'm going to close it up and ignore that that's just my makeup and then i'm going to make sure it's closed and i'm going to shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it and that's literally all you have to do make sure this is closed clean everything up shake it up a little bit and that's that ready to go okay y'all so guess what i have put my um shirt up under the heater sounds like maybe while i'm recording the um other portion that it'll help dry a little bit it completely dry so if this will completely dry now i will say it's not soft like if i put in a dryer like i literally can feel where the poly is which actually is a good thing because now i know where i can lay my image so my first picture came out this is the asap paper today this is what we'll be using is asap today and this is the image it came out so good look at that that looks amazing right so and actually that neon remember i said it was ago it looked a little bit yeah so show me so anywho this image came out looking so good this is uh so i'm going to um dry the yellow shirt but we might as well go ahead and do this so let's do this one first so i'm about to go ahead and do it it's on 400 degrees 60 seconds if you missed it you can rewind it but i have poly acrylic i put two tablespoons um and eight ounces of water here i was safe i had my gloves so the shirt is dry it's completely completely dry this is that can you hear this so you can hear it so it's completely dry i'm going to go ahead and um uh put it under heat press for a couple seconds i'm so excited y'all then i'm gonna do it and see how it turned out then we still gonna do the gold one but we gonna do this one since we're here so let me go ahead and set this up and move in move you guys in closer all right y'all let's see how this turned out this is my first oh snaps oh my goodness oh my goodness now i just threw it on there y'all saw that look oh yo i'm so good look at that and this is 100 cotton shut the noise oh my god are so good oh mine turned out so good look at this y'all stop playing with me shut up this this image i just found on google too i literally just found this on google okay so let's rewind what i did yo i'm tsugi okay let's rewind [Music] poly acrylic mine was clean satin i got this from lowe's eight ounces of water two tablespoons of poly acrylic and then i put this under the heat press so i actually laid it up under the heat press while i was doing the other portion i think it was like maybe six minutes not even 10 i don't think it dried it completely and then y'all i'm sorry i have my sucker y'all know i always be whatever and then look at this so i'm gonna do a wash test i'm not gonna do it today but i'm gonna do a wash test so we can see what happens but we gonna do that gold but baby we gotta just let's take a minute to just admire this real quick i might put this on today so it was a success if you want to do this for just like a day for an event let's say you're doing a walk let's say you have something you want to use um as far as being toxic i did hear that because it's only two tablespoons and diluted in eight ounces of water and then we shake it up it's not a whole lot of the poly acrylic that's in here it's diluted with eight ounces of water right so it's two tablespoons eight ounces of water we shake it up so it's not like it's really harsh or toxic um do this on your own wrist i don't have anything you know i'm not a dermatologist or a doctor or anything like that so i'm not saying that you would do it i feel comfortable enough to do it for myself so you don't try this at home that's my disclaimer but for me because i didn't use that much i would feel comfortable putting it on myself even if i just had a undershirt or something on under here to make myself feel better but yeah so we gonna try this gold out so i'll be back oh why the gold is getting dry real quick guess what it's not hard no more so it feel it make a little bit it's not hard like how it was i don't know if the heat did something to it but it feels feels good it's not like crisp or crunchy or anything like that y'all okay we're gonna let that finish dry i'll be back all right i'm back yes i'm getting yes i did put it on excuse i got some makeup on there so excuse that that's just the makeup but 100 cotton size medium image from google shout out to whoever was the artist makeup by me messing up my list whatever so now we're just going to see this this might be a fail let's just prepare ourselves this one might not work but it's okay because this one did okay so we're just gonna see all right and you do want to put um butcher paper in the middle of it i ain't doing it for right for right now because i'm just not but you do want to put so anytime you sublimate you want to put butcher paper in between the images on top of it to protect everything this just for the for myself my i'm not doing it right now um i just ordered some more butcher paper actually from amazon and it just came in the mail today so we're preserving the butcher paper this is gonna be mine too so that's not 100 perfect it's fine does this just flow on me okay so recap while we wait for these 60 seconds um two tablespoons of poly acrylic two tablespoons poly acrylic mine was um clear satin i don't know if that matters or not that's what mine was eight ounces of water our gloves to be safe shake it up shake it up shake it up shake it spray it dry it i put that under the heat press it dry it dried the whole thing in less than 10 minutes but you can put it in your dryer you can use a blow dryer you could um use a fan hey whatever you air dry it whatever works for you i put it under my heat press though and um cosmos ink guild and shirts 100 cotton yeah i'm so excited y'all i'm like literally hyped over this that was 60 seconds let's see you see that's why i use that butcher paper you see that that's why you use the butcher paper okay and like i thought the gold shirt is different it went but the colors because it's gold it did it the black work but because all those other colors on the go it didn't it didn't go but now you know so people i can't do it on dark because i went in my group real quick i went live in my group request while i was waiting and um can you do it on dark so i'll tell them how it turned out for darker but y'all know what it is and that's but

this is M at RushOrderTees along with Dan the man behind the cam. One question we get all the time is what t-shirt should I get? That's a tough one. This is understandable because there are literally hundreds of styles out there. Maybe thousands. I don't know can somebody check that? [beep] We're gonna help you decide by subjecting some t-shirts to a series of tests. It's science. So the fabric type of a t-shirt is its most important quality. So that's what we'll be testing Luckily, we can break these fabric types into four main categories and that's what we have right here. 100% cotton. 100% polyester. We've got the 50/50 cotton poly blend and we have a tri blend which is cotton polyester and rayon. Dan, and I will be ranking the shirts for each test and giving the best one a score of four and the worst one a score of one At the end will add up all the points and let you know the overall winner It's the t-shirt test [music] [swoosh] But first let's take a closer look at these test tees. Wait, that doesn't sound.... can we edit? [beep] But first let's take a look at the t-shirts we'll be testing. All right, I'm here with Dan and our first test is all about the feels. It's the feel test. [swoosh] Now what we mean by feel is the softness, the touch, the texture. This is often called the hand. Because you feel it with your hand. So we're gonna test these shirts by feeling them. You ready? [kazoo music] All right, so after some rigorous scientific investigation, we've come to a conclusion on the feel of these shirts. What did you think Dan? Um, I was just drawn with the tri-blend for some reason, you know, it was really soft. Stretchy. Very, very soft. Definitely the softest. Yeah, so I think the try blend is the clear number one. Lightweight, alright. So that's number one, I would agree with that. Number two is a bigger conversation. It's really a hard choice, but I almost think I want to say cotton. I would say cotton. 100%. Alright, so there's our number two. I think, I think poly number three. Alright we'll give poly number three. Alright so that means 50/50 is the last one. it's gonna finish in fourth place. Get outta here! The results are in for the feel test and we have tri-blend in first place taking a lead with it's super softness. followed close by cotton in second then polyester in third and 50/50 bringing up the rear. Okay for the next test we're calling it the wear test [swoosh] And for this test, we're gonna have Dan wear the shirts. Oh, really? Yeah. Alright, let's do it. [clap] Whoa! That was fast. Okay, so this is a 100% cotton. 100% cotton. Feels pretty good. Feels like a standard shirt, nice fit. Not too heavy. Next up will be a 100% polyester. Are you ready? Yup. All right. Let's do it. [clap] Wha--how are you...? It's just....we wanna move this video along you know what I mean? Okay, so polyester... Feels very light, very airy. I can definitely tell that. Next up we have the 50/50. You ready? What are you gonna do to me this time? [clap] What the? This is backwards. Sorry about that. [clap] Ah, okay. There we go. So this is the 50/50. Honestly feels a lot like the cotton. It feels really good. I can't tell if it's lighter or not. It might be a little bit more breathable, it feels like. You like the cotton better? Yeah, honestly, this might be my favorite one so far. Okay, favorite one so far. There you have it. You ready for the next one? I mean do I--? [clap] Whoa! Wow, okay, this one feels great. Really soft. Kind of like the best of what everyone else has had to offer. It's soft enough, it's very light. So what do you think? Hm, okay, so In terms of comfortability,  I'm think going to go with tri blend number one. 50/50, number two. Cotton, number three. And polyester last. But again, that's just my opinion Some people like poly, some people like cotton more. Well, science is all about opinions, so... You're right. That's very true. So here's our scores for the wear test It's tri-blend Once again in first place with its ultra comfortable wearability. Followed by 50/50 in second place. 100% cotton in third and polyester last because Dan said so. Next up We're gonna be stretching these shirts for the stretch test So we're testing the stretchiness of the fabric. And more importantly how it holds up after being stretched it's the way the fabric behaves when we stretch it Looks good stretchy. Let's stretch it up Here's your results for the stretch test Polyester getting the win on this one with its ability to snap back into shape, followed close by try blend in second then 50/50 and third and 100% cotton with a big loss here For the next test we're getting wet It's the wet test Actually, the shirts are getting wet We're gonna time how long it takes for each of these shirts to dry off in the hot Pennsylvania sun Polyester tends to be moisture wicking. So we're gonna see how that does. I have a feeling cotton is gonna lose this one, but we'll see. Let's do it Results of the wet test are in we have polyester in first place again with an easy win followed by tri-blend in second and a surprising third-place finish for cotton and 50/50 with the agony of a wet defeat. Okay, next up. We're gonna see how wrinkle-resistant these shirts are It's the wrinkle test We're both gonna take two shirts, put them on our chair, and sit on them for the rest of the day What? So we're gonna take each shirt and we're gonna ball it up and shove it in a sandwich bag and leave it for 20 minutes And see how it comes out after that 20 minutes later All right, so we got the shirts out of the bag and and they're pretty wrinkly except for this one. clear winner is poly. It was barely even wrinkled. The next one number two would be the Tri-blend here, not too bad at all, I bet these would come out as you wore it for a couple hours 50/50, Hmm Didn't do too well. Pretty wrinkly. pretty wrinkly gonna need an iron for that sucker and then cotton, oh the most wrinkly So that's a clear Clear 1 2 3 4 on this one. Looks like a topographical map. Here's the scores for the fifth and final test of this video It's polyester with another big win. This stuff just doesn't wrinkle it's kind of weird Coming in second once again is tri-blend with 50/50 coming in third and Cotton suffering a humiliating set of wrinkles. That brings us to the halfway point of this competition Let's look at our scoreboard and check the results so far Tri-blend is in the win column with a total of 17 points followed closely by polyester in a surprise second place with 15 points Cotton and 50/50 are tied with nine points apiece, and we'll have a lot of catching up to do in In our part 2 video of the T-shirt Test We will present the final five tests The screen-printing test the DTG test the mess test the wash test and the dangerous damage test, look for that coming soon Click on the items below to get more information about them or start designing on them right now Thanks for watching.

t-shirts and that sublimation printing on cotton let's not waste any time and get right into it so the first thing you guys will use an epson double you have 7710 printer this printer can easily be converted to a sublimation printer you guys will need the sublimation ink cartridges and sublimation ink and you guys don't need sublimation paper make sure you guys install the sublimation ink cartridges this is not gonna work on regular ink we're gonna go on a website called gypsy shirts and by our 100% cotton t-shirts here you'll need sublimation spray this is basically liquid polyester you can get these cheap on etsy so the first thing to do is mirror image with image image rotation click horizontally and they're gonna print image so the good thing about this printer is that it can fit 11 by 17 paper this is a large paper and is the perfect size to make t-shirts so when the sublimation paper is printed on the colors are not gonna be bright don't worry about this when this transfer onto the shirt is only perfect so the first thing we're gonna do is preheat the shirt after that's done we're gonna spray the show with the sublimation spray I'm gonna let it dry for around 20 minutes make sure you guys spray the entire area where the image is and if you transfer also don't worry about spraying outside of that area anything that sprayed outside is now going to be visible when the shirt is done next one alignment to the t-shirt to make sure it's straight you guys can tape it if you want just make sure the tape is not go on the heat press we're gonna place the image onto the heat press we wanna put the silicone paper on the heat press and we're gonna press it at 350 degrees for no less than one a minute also make sure you guys add a decent amount of pressure will present with sublimation you guys have to press it for at least a minute because if you don't the full image is not going to be transferred and it's going to look Peyton if you want a bright vivid image you have to press for at least a minute now we're gonna move the silicon paper remove the sublimation paper and our shirt is finished take a look at how bright and perfect and vivid the shirt came out so because the shirt is seldom mated the colors will never wash out so this shirt costs around $1 80 cents to make if you guys want to slow show it's online in my opinion this is the best way to do it you guys can easily sell these for over $10 also make sure you guys have Ward the Amazon sublimation sprays these are complete garbage the image quality is gonna be horrible and also this fray when it's dried out is gonna make the image surface hard so definitely make sure you guys award these another thing you guys should avoid is these sublimation powders the whole process is super messy and the end result is garbage also it's a hustle because even though the powder is cheap you guys cannot sublimate on regular sublimation paper you will have to buy special silicone paper otherwise it's not gonna work and these silicone papers for 11 by 17 they cost around $4 per sheet so again if you guys want high-quality results use the Etsy sublimation sprays and you're good to go I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please hit the like button and subscribe and I'll see you guys on the next one", "KfHYSecLFlw": "now normally you cannot sublimate or do sublimation on a cotton t-shirt not until now we've got a new product to look at let's have a look at it right now those of you who do transfer printing like I do and vinyls and stuff like that onto 100% cotton t-shirts the reason why we use concierge is because they're basically half the price of sublimation t-shirts for those of you who actually are in the know now we've got a new product here where I can now sublimate or use sublimation to print onto a cotton t-shirt let's check it out Robin I've just got this test batch of a new product that's out and what they do is provide you with a special transfer paper and some special powder which you put through your sublimation printer in this case it's the year Rico print which we are using and you use the sublimation inks on the transfer paper and then you apply a powder over the top which is like a polymer powder and that then gets pressed onto a 100 percent cotton t-shirt and it's supposed to leave the sublimated image permanently fitted onto the t-shirt now I've not used this before so you're using it for the first time with me so let's give it a try I'm going to get our cotton t-shirt now it's basically for white t-shirts and light-colored t-shirts is this a product by the way it's not for dark t-shirts so let's just get a t-shirt now give it a press and then we'll see what happens right so this is the paper and I know if you can see there it's from a company called subway to cotton comm and again this is just a sample sheet here it's a little bit thicker than the normal transfer sublimation paper so what I'm going to do is to open the tray and you place this facedown in your Rico sublimation printer like that I'll turn it on first obviously and I've just pulled up a color print here of an image it's Lightning McQueen me grandson loves that I'm not going to sell this this is purely to get a good sale good the color definition is in this so I've never tried this before once it prints out the image what you have to do then is to lay the image on a tray and then you sprinkle this polymer powder over the top of it which again I've only got a little sort of bagful here so we plan to do that and cover the ink up that as it comes out of the printer it's obviously still wet and sprinkle that over until all the inks come and then we can actually press the air t-shirt with 100% cotton t-shirt so let's give that a go now and again all I've done is pull up a graphic here of a lightning McQueen cars and the image should come out here wet right as we can see it started to come out now so I'm going to bring the image black straight down in the tray like that and I'm just going to get this white powder now I'm just empty it onto the tray I'm not going to you gotta be careful not to smudge this as well apparently so I'm just going to put the whole lot on for the moment and I'm just going to swish it all about so again I've never done this before so you have to bear with me on this so I'm just going to sort of just try get it all over the top of the image this is all brand new to me and just make sure literally that the whole of the image is covered which I can see there that it is there you go so now we've done there I'm just going to pick the paper up carefully dust it off like that as I say there's no cutting around the shapes either so as you can see here it's just literally just drop it all off and I can see there that everything is actually covered and there's only this residue which is actually just stuck to the image itself I'll just lay that there for a second I've already pre pressed our t-shirt as you know what we always do there and as I say the temperature which I'm pressing it here is 180 degrees and I'm going to be doing that for 30 seconds now you've also got to be careful that when you put this down face down that you don't move it about so you want to be in the correct position really right from the beginning so I'm just going to place that down there like that and cover up with me cover sheet as you can see there now don't forget this is a hundred percent cotton t-shirt which normally you cannot sublimate - so let's just press that down there and we're going to be counting down for 30 seconds now so I've never used this before myself it might seem a bit of a faff but again it's a learning curve and it could be a way of producing I mean the biggest thing about sublimation t-shirts are they normally double the price of these cotton t-shirts right here we go so I'm just going to take it off like that we've had it under for 30 seconds I don't know what it's going to do what it's going to look like and I'm just going to pull this straight off and this is a set view is 100% cotton t-shirt using sublimation inks now look at that first of all I'm going to say to you but then colors are absolutely fantastic look at this look how about that can you see how vivid that is and there's no seams or anything whatsoever there now that looks really nice I'm very surprised by that and look at the depth of the colors as well I'm sure you can see there and as I say this isn't a transfer this is sublimation ink on our Gildan t-shirts which as you can probably see on the sign they're 100% cotton using sublimation inks how about that well all I can say is really that that's erm that's really surprised me I'm a little bit taken aback by that to be honest with you I've never used this before I've heard of the product as I say but this is in the UK at the moment I don't know if you've got it in any of the other countries at the moment I think this the price of these as compared to the normal sublimation or transfer papers I think it's about double the price at the moment but apparently the manufacturers are trying to work to get the price down so it can compete favorably with the the transfer paper market and also you know you'll be saving because these t-shirts are literally dirt cheap as well so I'm think you'll find there's no you can fill a surface there obviously but it's like a polymer surface which you get with any sort of printed surface but that ink is been taken by the polymer power that which is obviously sunk into the actual world garment as well so that's why it's actually part of the garment as well there so well there you go that's a new one on me and if you probably see I'm trying to stretch it there look can you see it's actually stretching because it's actually part of the garment as well there we go look there's no sign of any sort of degradation when you stretch it and well please wait I think I turned that lovely and look at the vivid colors as I've said before well that's just something to looking out for and that is from a company called sublet ooh cotton limited a brand new product here in the UK although I have heard of it before maybe in different guises and it is a polymer powder to be used on top of your sublimation ink with your sublimation printer so that you can actually print on 100% cotton t-shirts there you go I hope that was of some interest to you it will be to me because I'll be running it through to watch many many times and we'll update you obviously somewhere further down the line in a different video there you go hope you enjoyed this one thanks very much for watching don't forget to subscribe to my channel share my videos and we'll see you again in the next

feeling tell it all so this paper says this revolutionary technology now allows printing directly unto cotton material great for both light and dark colors with the supersoft field to the touch application directions pre-press the garment which a professional-grade heat press for five to eight seconds and to eliminate wrinkles and moisture step 2 place the cotton sub with the rough side down on top of the garment okay so yes definitely this is the rough side so you will place that down step three mirror print a design on sublimation paper if using step four if using a colored shirt make sure your design completely covers the cotton sub or goes a little outside of the material so no white is visible after application if using a white shirt make sure your design says inside the material to eliminate ghosting put the printed sublimation paper over the cotton sub press at 375 at 385 degree for 60 seconds any temperature peel is fine if using that he sub sublimation paper a delay peel is best wait at least 24 hours before washing turn inside out when you laundry for longer-lasting best results hand wash inside out after application do not iron on top of the cotton Sun directly and heat wool from solid I got my glasses on reactivate the ink if you need to press it do it inside as out as well if iron it on top of the material put parchment butcher or regular paper on top of the cotton sub and hiring as needed we're gonna have to get us a Tesla [Music] just wanna measure this out see how big it is so the size is 16 and a half by eleven and a half whether we go with it so I said the rough side damn and you can clearly clearly feel it what size smaller size rock so I'll just cut more straight down a middle just to see how it goes y'all know is going to work out

better and feel their best and in this video I'm going to be reviewing Yoona clothes two people cotton t-shirts stay tuned so you know clothes - pima cotton t-shirts have a bit of reputation in the menswear community in fact any discussion around you know the best t-shirts for men is sure to include this highly regarded tee and some men swear by them while others just don't really understand the hype I bought four pairs of Yoona clothes supima cotton tees and so you know you kind of know where I stand in that camp but we got grey we got heather gray white and navy even with all the high praise nothing is perfect and so let's dive right in with this Uniqlo supima cotton tea review in this review i'm going to cover the t-shirts of style and fit shirt quality comfort and durability how well they've held up over several years of wear you know the pros and cons and as always if you want a deeper dive head on over to gentlemen within i'm gonna link that down below and then you can read more about it cuz it just showed I own four unit clothes - pima cotton tees for reference I've had the white and navy shirt for around four years now and the two grey shirts for about two years so exactly what is pima cotton well it's a type of cotton that's actually grown and sourced in the United States it represents less than 1% of cotton grown in the world and it's a unique sort of cotton due to the extra long fibers that contribute to its premium properties of strength softness and color retention the facts pima cotton is lighter and 45% stronger than regular cotton and it provides superior comfort durability and softness for the shirts style you know clothes pima tees are as clean and minimal as a shirt it's going to get it has zero branding no logos on it except for on the back tag where it's printed you know where it's made in the Uniqlo logo they come in all the basic neutrals of white gray Navy and black all in all you're going to find 14 different colorways but the wide ranging shades from olive green and yellow to red and cobalt blue there's no shortage of options to choose from here in terms of the shirts of fit you know I've said it before and I'll say it again Uniqlo the pima cotton t-shirts are some of the best of fitting t-shirts that i period they're fitted without being skin tight and have an overall clean drape the body length is spot-on hitting around mid fly and the sleeve length is also perfect landing around mid bicep the sleeves also hug my biceps just the right amount without being restricting I can't say it enough but Uniqlo supima cotton tees were actually the first t-shirt to actually fit me pretty impeccably off the rack before discovering them you know I was wearing these cheap-ass H&M tees for like $5 and the sleeves way too short and so they were always riding up and then you can see my armpit hairs and when I put them through washes the fabric just kind of got all distorted and it just did not hold up over time and so when it comes to the fit of these shirts I can't speak more highly of them some of the product details that actually comes in double x-small all the way up to triple XL and so you know there's a wide range of sizes here however they don't carry any tall sizes so if you're a really tall guy you know over six-foot some you might have some trouble with you know clothes shirts which is you know something I encountered when I was you know doing some research on forums a lot of guys on reddit some male fashion advice the taller guys were saying that the fit just you know wasn't there for the product details Uniqlo says that it's you know hundred percent supima cotton and it has a glossy Sheen with a premium feel there really is no glossy Sheen this shirt is not shiny at all however it does have a premium feel under percent supima cotton and these shirts are made in Vietnam not us which is kind of weird because supima cotton is sourced in the US so I'm not sure you know what's happening there now let's dive right in with the shirts Comfort so Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really soft and they actually get softer and softer after every wash it's a nice mid weight cotton and it is not see-through by any means you know comparatively it's not as thick as you know Banana Republic pima cotton t-shirts or ask it but it's thicker than brands like Express ever Lane and even the mountain bowed rigs t-shirts that I reviewed in you know my best t-shirts roundup in terms of where the shirts have been through dozens upon dozens of wears over the years I can tell you that they've held up supremely well they've gotten softer over time as I mentioned before and you know there are no holes in the shirts so that goes to show you that even a ten dollar t-shirt can withstand the test of time and get better over time and so price isn't always going to be a factor when it comes to finding quality comfort we're just gonna get right into the durability of the shirts had them for a couple of years now plenty of washes as I said before and the shirts have no holes in them they're not weirdly distorted or warped through many washes the shirts still have a clean drape and a nice fitted aesthetic I would say that the durability of these shirts are really good and they've held up really well over the years but it's not all perfect though and assurance actually do fake considerably over time especially the colored shirts and so my Navy shirt I would say more saturated colors are gonna fade over time with washes and dry cycles so the Navy is not as saturated as it was before that's going to knock it down a few rounds all in all though Uniqlo Supima cotton tees have proven to be immensely durable over the years where you can buy them you can shop online at Uniqlo comm or you can hop into one of their brick-and-mortar locations they have locations all across the US and so you know if you have one near you go in get fitted and see how the Uniqlo supima tees fit on your body all right so let's finish it up with some of the pros and cons for the pros best bang for your buck at 990 a shirt crafted with long-lasting high-quality supima cotton one of the best fitting t-shirts that I own period classic crew neck and v-necks in a myriad of colorways can conveniently shop online or in-store for the cons not the best for tall guys you know no long sizes and color shirts they're gonna fade quite a bit over time and it may be too sheer for some people it's not really thick material here if you have any brands that you feel are a better value you know leave some comments down below and let me know but yeah in the end Uniqlo supima cotton tees have a reputation for a reason with a price point of $10.00 and high-quality long-lasting product Uniqlo supima cotton tees are really hard to ignore and so it's definitely one of those staple pieces in my wardrobe by under $10 it's hardly an investment piece and so feel free to go crazy there with all the colorways and yeah it's all I got for this video if you liked it smash that thumbs up and if you're new here consider subscribing put out new videos like this weekly that's all I got for this

was randomly searching for nice quality white t-shirts since i do love a good quality white basic tee and i stumbled upon a gq article referencing cotton and i looked it up i liked it it was inexpensive to my delight it's also canadian the company is based in toronto and they have a store in montreal in toronto another part of their company about making a better product for the planet for the people they work with egyptian cotton which is finer softer and stronger than any other cotton in the world and according to their website since they work directly with the farmers that ensures fair prices for the customers so good news for me and you and it reflects quality as well as providing farmers with better prices and business practices and then the next five years they are planning to ensure that 100 of their natural fibers are certified organic cotton also supports local ngos and with every purchase helps to fund the build out and operations of school infrastructure salaries for teachers and all of the necessary equipment and education to those in needs in rural communities the shirt comes available in white and black which i bought both of because you can never have enough white and black t-shirts literally my wardrobe is white and black when i do laundry it's white or black and if i have one color item i don't know what the hell to do with myself this is a very thick weight shirt t-shirt it's got a nice little ribbed collared pattern here nice quality good build i love the way it fits and feels there are two stores one in toronto there's one in montreal they run out of stock the times i've been there so if you want to try different sizes that's been a problem also for the band t for the men's i found that the sizing was completely off i would just like to pause this right here because this whole segment that i filmed about their size chart being wrong and inaccurate they have updated their size charts from october to now they used to show the garment size and now they're showing suggested measurement sizes to follow so in my experience what i had measured pre-wash and after wash is as follows feel free to pause if you need to the items are not pre-washed i would say try one size up and then factor in that it's gonna shrink about five percent because it will shrink even if you wash cold and you hang dry it will shrink so what i tend to do when it's out of the wash and i'm about to dry give it a little bit of tug in all directions and then let it air dry definitely don't wash it with hot water warm water i don't even know what will happen you'll end up with a t-shirt meant for your like chihuahua or something trying one size up i would basically get that result after i washed the t-shirt so this is why i have a medium because i like my shirts a little bit loose fitting it's really nice thick t-shirt as well um if you're a woman and you wear these kinds of tees you basically don't have to wear a bra with these because no one's gonna see anything because it's so thick but i mean probably most people that are watching this are going to be guys so that's not something you have to think about although i think that you guys were undershirt so no nipple showing there okay this is getting into a weird place let's move on from that like i said this is a really thick t-shirt which is really nice keeps you warm keeps nice shape feels like quality hopefully will be more resistant to little holes that you get in other t-shirts i found that the women's tea when i put them on top of each other in the store the angle of the the sleeve was a little bit more like sticks out a little bit more like upwards and it was a little bit shorter by like about an inch the large women's was the same width as the medium men's just just give you a little bit of an idea of how that is for the women's versus the men's men's tea this is like 38 canadian which for some people might be expensive but for me i will pay i'll pay like up to 80 bucks for a t-shirt i don't think i ever have though but i will because if it's quality that's the one thing that's gonna last in your wardrobe there's a good white tee a good black tee those are basics and uh pretty much takes up my entire wardrobe now i just don't do color i just can't do color because my personality is colorful enough moving on quality value price is really good i'm happy with that egyptian cotton which has really long quality fibers which translates in a better durable better quality nice soft t-shirt i've watched it a few times there's been no pilling so far that was just a brief review of cotton i really like their t-shirts now that i figured out the sizing thing which was very annoying at first i heard that the bottoms don't have that issue i heard all of the tops have that issue if you go on reddit you'll see other people noting the same problems but once you've figured out the size that you need it's pretty easy just like you can get any you can get all the other products which i haven't explored yet i know a few people that got their sweatpants sweatshirt ensemble which is like the quarantine uniform these days and they they are very happy with it so that would be my review of the cotton tee i just made this really quick and dirty review because i've heard about this brand and i feel like a lot of us are buying these staple basics now and we're more interested in slow fashion and more classic long lasting staples and i didn't see anybody really review these t-shirts so i figured i would put this online for all of you since this is a t-shirt that i've been wearing a lot a lot lately it's um very comfy very different looking it has a nice structure to it which i really like so that's it i hope this helped you out comment like share all of those stuff subscribe if you want to see my face and more and that would be it if you have any questions let me know below i will do my best to answer you peace out", "Byxu8t88O4k":

y'all rocking with me and putting up with me saying yeah 80 000 times so love y'all to the next one", "jD9PT402sAc": "[Music] all right guys so i'm going to walk you through a process of making a shirt the first thing that you're going to want to do or at least what i do is i turn my heat press on it needs to be to 400 degrees and this takes a little bit so while i'm printing my designs and getting things ready i just wait for that to heat up all right so i'm going to go ahead and print a design okay so we're going to hit start creating and we are going to go to the files that we have already loaded onto our computer and the design that i need right now is the halloween town and chill so we're going to select that one and it will already have your measurement set over here depending on the size of paper that you're using so then you're going to hit print and then it'll give you another screen after this to start the printing process okay so now we just wait for it to give us the next prompt to print okay so this is the screen that's going to come up next and you can adjust the size and it'll let you know if the size is too big so that's probably as big as it's going to let me do it you can also adjust your colors here if you need to sometimes i bump up the orange and the yellow all right so then we're going to hit how many copies we need this is something that i sell a lot of so i'm going to go ahead and do 10 copies of that and then we're going to hit print and our printer will start printing all right so the heat press still has about nine degrees to go um so i was going to go over the shirt with you really quick so i am going to be using a dark shirt so the design obviously is not going to show up that well but i am going to be bleaching this shirt um so as i've said before you need to make sure that the shirt that you're using is at least 65 polyester so the shirts that i typically use are the gildan soft style you can see on the tag that it is 65 polyester all right and then going over my heat press a little bit this is a newer one that i've just got so this one pulls out on the bottom and that way you can lay your shirt down lay your design down line everything up so you're not underneath here burning your hands so while we wait i'll go ahead and lay my shirt down and we can go ahead and place the design and you can either use the butcher paper or the teflon sheet right now i'm just going to be using the teflon this is just to protect the shirt from getting scorched because of the high temperature that we are using okay so we're going to lay that down it's taking about 10 minutes for the heat press to get up to 400 you can either do 55 seconds or 60. um here lately i've been doing 60 seconds i think that it just helps get all the ink onto the shirt and when you get a heat press you want to make sure that your pressure is correct the way that they recommend doing that is the paper test so you could take a piece of computer paper and put your heat press down and make sure that the piece of paper when it's like shut on there can't be pulled out so it needs to be tight enough to keep a piece of paper underneath there all right so we're just going to go ahead and press it it's still probably has two degrees to go but it's all right so we're going to push that back in there and we're going to push it down and it's going to count down while we wait okay all right so we're going to lift it up pull this out it's going to be really hot but make sure that you remove the design as soon as it's done to prevent any ink from smearing around and then here's your design okay so when you bleach the shirts you want to make sure that you're putting something in between them i have all these cardboard cutouts that i've made to put in between the shirts so the bleach doesn't bleach through you can also find these at hobby lobby for 1.99 if you don't want to make your own i typically bleach about 17 shirts at a time just because i had so many orders so yeah okay so i just take i'll probably cover my microphone so i just take this shirt and cover it or cover the piece of board with it just like so and then i'll end up taking all of them and laying them out and the bleaching process works best in full sunlight you will get your quickest process if you have sunlight onto the shirt it will take twice the time if you don't have the sunlight all right so now we're going to bleach this is the bottle that i use it is a glass bottle i will put a link to that i got it on amazon you got two of them before i started using this i was just using a mrs meyers bottle that i cleaned out and put bleach in i just use straight bleach some people will mix water but yeah it's just straight bleach and i will completely coat the design i will completely coat the design and then i just go through and splatter all around it and then once once this once this bleaches i will flip the shirt over and i will do the other side i do this because sometimes it will bleed through and it just makes it easier if you have both sides done just in case that happens now that they're all sprayed they're going to take about 15 to 20 minutes if we were in direct sunlight right now it would happen almost immediately but as you can see some of the gray ones are orange and we want them to have more of a white tint so we're going to let them sit until they turn a little bit white and then we're going to flip them over and do the other side after that we will put them into the washer using only detergent no fabric softener and then dry them and they'll be ready to go okay now that they're lightened up enough we're going to flip them over and repeat the same process on the back so [Music] so [Music] you", "3N84Fvw18yE": "hello my name is megan bender and i am the creator of maddiebanks.com um and maddie bugs creation on facebook if you want to and instagram and all that stuff if you want to um follow me on all my t-shirts and stuff like that i will link everything down below um i've had a lot of requests on facebook about how i make my poly tea spray and how it actually works because a lot of people say that you have to have 65 cot or polyester or more and that you cannot sublimate on 100 cotton well i'm going to prove him wrong today that she can actually sublimate on 100 cotton and the shirt i have on is actually 50 polyester 50 cotton and my poly t spray was on this shirt and it made the image pop out more than what it really would on a 50 polyester 65 is also very great to have because your colors you don't need to use the poly t spray and your colors come out more vibrant and this is without poly t spray on a 65 cotton or polyester and the colors came out perfectly cool on those that's what the colors look like on 65 polyester now i have already used my spray on one of my shirts that is 100 cotton and i've already pressed it and i'll show you what that looks like before i make the spray and that came out looking like this so the colors are still just as vibrant as a 65 cotton or polyester i'm sorry 65 polyester all right so i'm going to take you over here to my table and i'm going to show you how i make my spray okay in this spray you are going to need sorry i gotta get this situated right in this spray you're going to need not this a spray bottle that is eight eight fluid ounces or you can do 16 fluid ounces just like my dawn spray bottle is here which i like using these because it's got that power mister and you don't have to spray as much and work as hard and then you're going to need this poly acrylic i've got the poly acrylic clear matte i got this at walmart for 18 i got the big jar and it should make quite a bit another thing you're going to need is a tablespoon because you're gonna need for every eight fluid ounces you need two tablespoons so for this particular bottle i put four tablespoons of this poly acrylic in it and then i fill it up with water and it works perfectly fine it made that shirt that i just showed you all so i'm going to go ahead and let's pour this out i don't have very much in there i'm going to go ahead and make it for you guys so what i do first is i open up my polycrylic and i dip my spoon in here make sure that it is level with a teaspoon and then i put it in here try not to make a mess like i do i'm one of the messiest people in the world yep just put four in here one that's two just make sure your teaspoons or your tablespoons i mean tablespoons are level when putting them in your jug or your bottle and you can use any spray bottle you can go buy one for a dollar at the dollar store or you can get your if you use this kind of a dish liquid you could just wait till it's empty and use it or you can use it you can just use any kind of spray bottle laying around i think that's four one more perfect all right and then after i get my tablespoons in there i will just fill it up with water i use cold water for this you want to use cold water for this and shake it up and that is how you make polyt spray it will be white looking should be white looking when you're done and that is my magic poly tea spray", "3vuQseWRksw": "hi everyone thanks for joining me I'm excited today I have partnered with a dye press and they are a company that has a product that allows you to use sublimation ink or your infusible ink on 100% cotton t-shirts yeah hundred percent cotton t-shirts we're no longer limited by the t-shirts that are available in the infusible ink line or the t-shirts that are available in the sublimation line so now we can use 100% cotton t-shirts that's what I did for this this is a 100% Gildan t-shirt just like you get at Joanns we've all had some of these and look at those results that's 100% cotton t-shirt with sublimation printing this is permanent washable dryable not going to go away this is a permanent design it's not going to crack it's not going to peel you can see if I spread it apart it's part of the fabric it's not laying on top it's not a transfer like an iron-on this is 100% cotton t-shirt with a very permanent result this is in fusible ink on a 100% just a plain old fruit of the line 100% cotton t-shirt in fusible link I used this in fusible link this one 100% cotton shirt you can't feel it this is permanent it's not going to go away you can wash it dry it again permanent I also tried it on a colored shirt now keep in mind anytime you use in fusible link or sublimation ink on a cotton t-shirt it's a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through but it still worked on this fluorescent pink shirt I got a transfer and you know of course it's colored or kind of changed color by the color of the shirt because it's a translucent ink but this is permanent so we can now use in fusible link on colored t-shirts we can use sublimation ink on colored t-shirts we can use our favorite cotton t-shirts I mean come on the possibilities are endless and I am absolutely thrilled with the results of this product this is the product that are talking about it's called Die Presse this is poly T plus it comes in a concentrated bottle like this you you mix this with water we'll go into all of that in the next part of the video but you use the concentrate you mix it with some water you put it in the spray bottle and you treat the shirt and then you can treat it just like any other iron-on or any other sublimation transfer or confusable ink transfer it does something to the fabric there's something magical in it but it does something in the fabric that allows it to take the ink so this the beauty of this is that you can't feel this it's washable it's dryable not gonna crack not gonna peel it's on there for good and why not I love it so let's get started into the video and I'm going to show you how I made each of these projects so let's take a look at the instructions here so it tells you for one ounce of poly t+ mix it with three ounces of water and that will give you 4 ounces of spray or you could take a quarter cup mix it with 3/4 cup water and that makes eight ounces of spray for this particular spray bottle they've got it right on here I need 2 ounces of the poly T plus 2 6 ounces of water and it's going to make eight ounces of spray so that's what we're going to do it goes on and has more information if you have a bigger or smaller spray bottle or you just want to mix up a little batch so one bottle of this is going to go quite a ways so the first thing it tells me is 2 ounces of poly T plus so let's put two ounces of poly T a plus in here and I have a little funnel just to make sure that I don't make a mess I haven't opened this yet so let's see I don't know if we have to open a tap here yep so we need two ounces of this got a measuring cup here two ounces of poly T plus now we're just going to put that in our spray bottle and it's telling me to add six ounces of purified water so I'm going to fill this up with six ounces there we go so that's it that's all you need I think it's pretty cool that they let you mix it themselves I watched her video and she said why should we why should you as a consumer pay to ship water when you all have water at home so they've made a concentrate which makes the product go much further and saves on shipping cost we're almost there all right we've got six ounces of water so I'm just going to go ahead and turn my spray bottle into mix shake it up and it looks like that so let's make sure we've got it primed must be a oh there's a little stopper right here you just need to turn that to the side to get some bottle to work oh we're already primed so we're good there okay so you can see I have a Gildan 100% cotton t-shirt right here this is 100% cotton now if you want a more vibrant print the more polyester that's in it the better so even if you had a 40% it's going to give you a little bit of a more vibrant result but we're going to go with 100% cotton because I want to see it actually works so I'm just gonna put a towel on my surface just to absorb some of the moisture all right and I have a design that I'm gonna put on the shirt that's this so it's about an 8 and a half by 11 size so I'm just going to use a piece of card stock just to kind of give me a guide and I'm gonna spray the corners just to give me a guide of where I need to spray and we're just going to begin spraying the shirts within that area the white a little bit harder to tell when it's wet I've got it pretty wet she suggests that you use a foam roller I don't have a foam roller but I do have my cricket brayer so I am just going to break it push that moisture down in the shirt and I can see now that blue behind there that I need to add a little bit more spray you want to get it pretty saturated but not sopping wet I'm just gonna push that down into the fabric so we're going to press it for 30 seconds at 330 degrees that's going to dry the poly t+ and it also removes any site and you'll probably see a little bit of steam coming out of the press that's the sizing and that's exactly what we wanted to do so we've got about ten seconds left and then we're going to give it a second coat of the poly T plus I'm just going to do that right on the press according to the directions it does not need to be as heavy of a coat this time so we're just going to take the poly key plus so we're gonna get to see what it looks like on a colored shirt I'm gonna take my roller and just roll it into the shirt place it with my parchment paper and again 330 degrees for 30 seconds now if you have the first version of this product you might have gotten a separate product to remove the sizing this new poly t+ apparently you don't need that it takes care of everything all with one product now this is the second shirt I've done you can see I've only used this much this jar is still full up to here so you can just imagine how many shirts I can do with one bottle of the poly T plus alright we're coming up on 30 seconds for our second press and we're going to open the press now the next step we need the press to be at 385 so I'm going to go ahead and raise the temperature to 385 and it's going to be at 70 seconds so while that is preheating I want to show you what the shirt looks like all right so that's going to heat back up to 385 so here is our shirt so it feels kind of starchy like it's a little bit stiff but the first time you wash the shirt that's going to come out but it as if you would put spray starch on something and then iron it kind of feels like that but it's totally dry and that is the poly coating that's going to make this so that we can sublimate again this is a 100 percent cotton Gildan t-shirt pick this up at Joanns nothing fancy about this whatsoever we're going to try it on a colored t-shirt but I want to show you this one which I look gun I forgot to turn the camera and this is the white Gildan 100% t-shirt that I was just working on and just look how good that transfer came out now again it feels kind of stiff but as soon as you watch this it's going to feel just like the t-shirt because it's now the ink is now in to the fibers of the fabric it's not laying on top so it's going to feel just like a t-shirt once you wash this but that's amazing there's not one ounce of polyester in here and we have a polyester or we have a sublimation shirt so really really believe in this product I'm really interested to see how this pink shirt does now the next step tells us to raise the heat to 385 and then pre-heat for five seconds we no longer need this on here because this has no moisture in it so I don't have to protect the press anymore so I'm just going to put this down back on the press just like it was and as soon as this hits 385 I'm going to replace my parchment paper and press it for five seconds at 385 again all of the instructions are clearly printed out for you so that you can be very successful they've taken the extra initiative and made sure that you have a good experience with this product it's not difficult at all and again she walks you through every step if you want even more instructions this it's included inside there is you can just if you put your camera on your phone on camera setting and just scan this it will open right up to their Facebook group which you can join which is called dye sublimation or you can scan this and it will take you to her YouTube video which again walks you through this step-by-step so that you are successful with this product it is I'm totally totally wild and amazed by the outcome I mean that that is just a plain white t-shirt there's nothing special about that so that means I could now open up sublimation to a whole wider variety of products so for our next design I am going to send a another picture to the Sawgrass printer there we go that should be printing out here in a second and we are almost up to 385 it's at 375 so we're gonna wait just a few more seconds one question that I wanted to address that I keep getting in the YouTube comments and on my other sublimation videos and getting messages on Facebook there seems to be some confusion about the sublimation ink and using a inkjet printer the magic is in the ink it's not in the printer it's in the ink so if you are using an inkjet printer you have to convert it to sublimation ink you can't just use regular inkjet printer some people are under the impression that if you use sublimation paper printed it out with an inkjet that that's what was happening and that's the magics not in the sublimation paper again I'm just using copy paper the magic is in the ink so you need an inkjet printer that can be switched out to sublimation ink if you're going to go that route this is a dedicated sublimation printer by Sawgrass this is my what I prefer to do I didn't want to convert a printer once you convert an inkjet printer you really shouldn't convert it back to ink jet so it's you know you you can't just go back and forth and switch it anytime you want unique because then you would have to clear out all that ink out of the lines so a sublimation ink comes out very dull you're not gonna want to use this for everyday printing plus it's going to be much more expensive so if you're going to use an inkjet printer keep in mind that once you switch it to sublimation ink you're not going to be switching it back and forth again and so you can't use regular inkjet and do this method that nut needs to be sublimation ink all right so we should be up to three eighty five we are we're going to press it for pre-press for five seconds there we go I am going to add my design facedown right on top again this is not a pink shirt so remember when you're doing sublimation on colored shirts it's not that it won't work but your ink is it's a clear ink so if there's not something white or light behind it it's probably not going to show up as well as if you were to put it on a white background so keep in mind that the ink is transparent so when you put it on a color the color is going to show through the color of the garment so we're pressing now for 385 for 70 seconds and again it's all in the instructions you can't go wrong with this process you make sure that you have all the information you need so that you have a great press all right so we're counting down we are at 7 seconds so that parchment paper is no longer any good again I press I printed this on regular copy paper so there you can see what's left and you can see this is just plain copy paper and again this is on a colored t-shirt so it's not going to be as vibrant but still absolutely gorgeous result a gun it's still a little stiff but once the first time we watch this then it's just going to feel like a regular cotton t-shirt here it is on white so you're always going to get a better result on a white or a light-colored t-shirt but I really wanted to put this to the test and see how it looked on a this is live like a fluorescent pink t-shirt I'm not sure how well it's coming through so it's kind of on the medium side as far as a darkness so I've prepped one more shirt with the dye press product and this time we're going to try the cricket in fusible ink I have cut the words be kind out of the infusible ink course it's weird and we're going to try that this is a hundred percent cotton Hanes t-shirt just a plain old t-shirt and we're going to try the cricket and fusible link with the dye press treated cotton t-shirt so let's see how this goes I've already done the two layers of the poly tee I'm gonna go ahead and put the words on we're going to cover it with our parchment paper three eighty five seventy seconds and let's see if cricket infusible ink also works on a cotton t-shirt I enjoy finding new ways to use this cricket and fusible ink I know some people are limited by the fact that you could only get the white or the gray t-shirts now that's not going to be a problem we can use cotton t-shirts in fusible link and get some really unique projects just keep in mind that just like the printer ink this is a translucent ink so the color of the shirt is going to show through the design just like it did on this but if you use a white cotton t-shirt you're going to get the more vibrant result so let's see how I did on a white t-shirt take off my parchment paper wow so here is the transfer after the ink has been lifted and here is your fusible ink on a white t-shirt I don't know if you can see the label but this is just a plain Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton t-shirt and look at that result so let's take a close-up look at some of the shirts that we made today I am so impressed by this product to be honest I thought it would work but I didn't think I would work this well and you really cannot tell that this is not a hundred percent polyester shirt everything is vibrant everything looks amazing and the transfer is solid so very very impressed I hope you guys enjoyed this video and you're enjoying the sublimation series if you did please like subscribe and share click that bell so that you're notified every time there is a new video and if you like this video stay tuned I've got a couple more linked for you thanks I you", "5x2HQcUZEhY": "hey everyone welcome back to well and sarah's channel today we're going to be sublimating on some dark colored shirts that consists of more than 40 cotton so we're going to see how we can make this work i got this bright spray off of etsy it claims to make your sublimation images brighter let's see so here on the left we have our 50 50 cotton and then over here we have 100 percent cotton and this is a green shirt so you know we try to sublimate it it's not going to show up but i have a special trick all right so the spray brite i did buy the more expensive stuff because it comes with a spray bottle being super lazy and not going to the dollar surplus i didn't want to mix it with my bleach i have no idea what is inside of this liquid i got this stuff in the mail it does not tell me what the ingredients are it just tells me to shake it very well shake shake shake spray it over where my image is going to be pressed and also they recommend you know squeegeeing it in to the fabric however i did not have a squeegee so i ended up using the rubbing material together method so you'll see that again it was pretty expensive so what i personally did a little pro tip once i'm done using the spray i actually pour it back into the bottle and save as much as i can obviously we're not mixing it with anything else so that's okay you know we added water and diluted it we don't want to do that but since it's just a straight chemical concoction whatever you want to call a potion um we just poured it right back in there to save every last drop i think i've done maybe five shirts total and my bottle is almost empty because you really have to saturate saturate it in order to get it to do what it needs to do so this is not how you want to spray the shirts now these are my very very first times i wanted to see you guys i wanted you guys to see me making the mistakes so you don't have to so here i am just spraying it like a mad woman it's going all over my shirt this is almost like a glue it's very adhesive so as soon as i open the bottle all i smelled was like a glue scent um so as you can see i'm spraying it all over the shirt and that means that my shirt is gonna have that dried glue texture exactly where it landed and that's not what you want like fortunately the shirt on the left i end up giving to my mother and then the shirt on the right i'm actually making for my husband so it's not a big deal but if you're looking to make money from your t-shirts your sweaters whatever you'll want to make sure that they're very nice and you don't have little mistakes like this because if you're going to upset somebody especially when they're paying 25 plus for a t-shirt you know you don't want to upset anybody or waste their money and you don't want to waste your time so learn from my mistakes learn from this video do not sprite like a mad woman get a nice spritz instead of the stream you want a nice little mist spray just where your image is going i've also after doing i think like my fourth shirt i did just a pretty block image with some lettering and i sprayed very large and the whole area was hard but really i just needed where my image was going to be sprayed and dried um so i actually would describe the texture once the glue dries i'm gonna call it glue because it's more of like a glue after it dries the texture is just like dried glue think about if you get like glue on your fingers and it hardens up that's kind of what's gonna happen to your shirts so think back in the 90s if you're old enough think back in the 90s when you were a kid and you had those sweatshirts the non-hooded sweatshirts and they had the barney image on them and barney was kind of hard it was kind of like that was like cardboard not that hard but it was very stiff the rest of your sweater was nice and comfy but right where the image was was very stiff and that's what's happening with these shirts wherever you spray it's going to harden so you want to make sure that you're only getting where your image is you don't want your shirt or sweatshirt to be harder than it needs to you want to be comfy and wearable so here i am spreading in the glue concoction potion whatever you want to call it i am spreading it in trying to make sure that it's attaching to the fibers as instructed by the bottle again don't have the squeegee like they recommend so i'm making do with what i got here you know we're kind of low budget so i am rubbing it in there i know that the image i'm going to use on the sweatshirt is a little bit longer but so i'm trying to make sure that my image is going to be placed all over this concoction i don't want to waste any more than i need to but at the same time i want to make sure that i'm covering my workspace so that way it has a chance of working so you'll see you're going to learn from my mistakes that this video is me making and wasting shirts so you don't have to i'm trying to save you money by wasting my own money but yeah and also pro tip i ended up saving the shirts anyway thank god i have a husband who deals with my craziness and whether he wore the shirt you know on the right regardless he would have taken it regardless of what it looked like and on the sweater we're able to save so i'll show you what happens once i press this and you'll see why i had to do what i had to do all right so here we go we are layering our press we are giving it our 60 seconds um so just a little fyi i did not put any butcher paper or parchment paper whatevs in between the layers of the shirt inside of the shirt because it is a dark color and because it is thick i've never had an issue with the with the ink showing on the opposite side of a sweatshirt hoodie or anything like that so we do not put anything in the middle that would be kind of like an unnecessary step all right here goes the big reveal let me uh let me stop talking for a second so you can see this baby it's cold outside and here we go so it's kind of a womp womp did it work on a sweater 50 50 material no did i think it showed better than it would have if we did not use it no no how did i save it i bleached it you know i love bleaching i love bleaching my uh sweatshirts and t-shirts so yeah i ended up taking this down in the basement just bleaching it out to save it it was hard i ended up washing it two times to try to get the adhesive out of it but yeah so that's that's how we fixed that bleached it um it did still have kind of a brown line around it to where the glue was but that's okay it's a gift to the bomb so and here we go this is our 100 cotton shirt green shirt dark color and as you can see so far not so good all right so to answer the question no it does not work on dark colors do i think this showed up better than it would have if i did not use it yeah probably i don't think we could have sublimated this on 100 cotton at all but is it vibrant and clear no no it's not so that's it guys i made some mistakes hopefully you learned from them thank you so much for watching hit that subscribe button and we'll see y'all on the next project bye guys", "caUlh9mGySo": "[Music] hi guys its Cristo welcome back to my channel today we're going to be sublimating on 5050 so poly-cotton blend as well as a hundred percent cotton yes you heard me correctly a hundred percent cotton I've got a onesie and we'll talk about shirt that we're gonna do a hundred percent cotton on we're in a short with the 50/50 now I don't know if you guys have heard of this or not but there is a company that is called dye press now what they have invented this has been out for a little bit I've been watching some videos on it and I finally reached out to them a while back and asked if they could send me some of these to try out on the channel and they totally agree right away they had them in them in the mouth so we're going to be not only trying today's going to be cotton but not only are we gonna be doing cotton shirts or cotton material we're going to be doing poly gloss so this is going to be four glass metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic white board and wood so we could get those Dollar Tree cups and coat it with this stuff and be able to use those in our press instead of have an order and then also they carry poly natural this is for coating wooden stone so you can get some of those nice wood you know to make some coasters and stuff coat those and be able to sublimate on those as well so any type of cutting boards so no longer having to special order anything you could run down to Walmart and grab some cups or shirts or whatever it may be and do this okay so let's start with today doing the cotton this is gonna work if you're working on white grey or colored shirts that is oatmeal she has created videos on this so I'll have those linked down below there's three different videos so you can check those out so you can learn what the Desai's are all about and all that I'm not gonna get into it just to save a little bit of time but if you have a white shirt a grey shirt or an oatmeal you're gonna want to put decider all the colors you're not gonna have to worry about this alright so first step on those will be the decider and then the next step is going to be the poly teeth this is what's gonna give us that coating like the polyester type coating and that's what's gonna make us be able to sublimate on a hundred percent cotton is we're gonna go in and I'm going to show you how to mix it up and everything walk through spraying it and we're going to press it today we're going to press it with the cricket easy press you can do the same thing with or heat press she sent me two bottles that are already just like this these are 8 ounce bottles because you want to mix 7 ounce water to each ounce of these so you need 7 ounce water 1 ounce this dirty has them so this bottle right here is the Desai's or hopefully you guys can see these so we're going to mix our the sizer in here and then the poly tea and the other one so let's get started so we need 7 ounces of water and you need to use purified water so I just I'm using bottled water from Walmart ok so I've got my bottled water and I'm gonna fill up my cup here so I've got a little measuring cup to 7 ounces all right there we go but it use a funnel these funnels come in like three in a pack I think it Walmart $4 where I got these long time ago so I'm going to pour my water in here alright just like so and I'm going to go ahead and Robert a date and pour the water in the other one do what we need to do now is I've got these little measuring cups even sent me the measuring cups into everything so I'm going to take some of the Desai's are here I'm gonna kind of mix it around just a little bit I don't think I need to but doing it anyway we need one ounce of each one so I'm gonna find where my once's are on here yeah seal on top so get that off and pour this in very carefully pour that over here all right and then what we need to do is put our lid on here and shake it up now she showed on her channel just kind of going like this a little bit and not just vigorously shaking it so that's what I'm gonna do just do this a few times and we need one else same thing we want to get this in here and then same thing she just kind of showed knocking it she just kind of showed going like this back and forth she didn't show lime vigorously shaking it so I'm just gonna kind of do what she did and if you guys notice this you guys probably noticed this right off the bat I put them in the wrong container because that's what I do so what I'm gonna do right away is I'm going to I was gonna fill that off but that's not gonna work I'm gonna have to mark them out I'm gonna have to just kind of you know scribble this I'll get some vinyl and vinyl this later you know me it's gonna be vinyl so I'm gonna go ahead and put poly T on it and then do the same thing because I already know I'm fixing me messing that up alright and then I'm gonna put D sizer there we go and all like I said I'll just put vinyl on them later but try not to do what I just did but just wanted to show that really quickly because you don't want to do these backwards obviously okay so let's go ahead and get started we've got my shirt ready to go and so I'm doing white so we need to use the B sizer so I'm gonna take a piece of cardboard I'm gonna protect my Cricut make her back there by the way so this cardboard is actually just from by those inserts that come in our chocolate or packages so I just been saving them for stuff like this okay so what we need to do is you need to spray around the area that you're going to be sublimating because obviously that's what we need to take care of right and in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and get our keys II press ready to go I'm gonna move my design out of the way we need to get our easy press to three eighty five so I'm going to push the temperature there and go all the way up to three eighty five now this first press is not going to be timed we're just doing steam so I'm gonna have that ready to go so the first thing we need to do is the decider so making sure I got the right one so what we need to do is you want to spray about where you're sublimating so go bigger than the area hopefully you guys can see all this I may have to zoom out so you want to go ahead and spray within the area where you're going to be sublimating or obviously it defeats the purpose so I'm going to spray a big enough area is what I'm just gonna do to make sure soda size there so I'm just going to make sure so you want to make sure you're coating everything very well and then she showed just kind of patting it down to kind of get that moisture in there so just want to get it nice and wet obviously I don't think she got a drench so we're just making sure that everything is getting cutted because when you look at it in person you can kind of see what's wet and what's not wet so I'm just kind of pushing that in okay and I think I'm going to go over it one more time I'm gonna press that in there so now I'm just kind of going and patting that down a little bit just making sure everything seems pretty nice too wet all right so what we need to do in our easy press is almost there I'm gonna go and get my shirt off of this and kind of rub it as well and I think she only really showed that with the poly tube I'm doing anyway but it kind of helps get that you know even on there so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna spread this out now for this next step what you need to do is you need to take she said a piece of cotton but it has to be washed already it has to be used because if not it's got decider in it because it's no so you're just putting right on top so I'm using my husband's old white t-shirt ignore it because it looks really old and dingy so you can use a hand towel whatever it may be but you want to use a used so now what I'm going to do is we want to give that out of there so I'm going to go ahead and press until we see steam coming out okay good so once you see that steam coming out you can lift that up and move this out of the way go ahead and I'm gonna do it one more time just because sure that I'm coating the whole area where my stuff's going so I'm just going in the area where I haven't done yet so just over here on the side now if yours completely covered that area you would not need to do this again so I'm just kind of waiting for that steam to come a little bit just being super safe alright so now for the next step is we're gonna need our cardboard back Harper back in here and this time we're doing 385 for 70 seconds 385 for 70 seconds so before I forget I'm gonna change my deal over here to 70 seconds now what we need to do is spray our area and I'm gonna measure down three just make sure okay we're gonna spray our area where our image is gonna go once again so we're gonna take that poly tea this time so we're taking the poly tea and we're going to spray and coat where our image is going so we're going all the way around she shows kind of you can use your image to poop it over and spray around to get like a an area but I pretty much know I'm going to be right in here so that's just what I'm doing so I'm just making sure everything is getting nice and coated alright so that looks good to me in half like I showed a while ago and we're gonna go ahead and rub these rub this down to get that fully coated once we have it ready to go we're going to want to air dry this or you can dry it with your blow dryer or your heat press or your ez press the way that you're gonna want to do this is to get this dry a little bit I'm gonna go over just hovering over it with my iron so I'm just kind of hovering just to kind of help dry it a little bit I don't have it on there now you wouldn't want to sit here and do these one after another like that I wouldn't want to what I would do is I would a head of time Desai's my shirts and then I would come back spray em with the poly coke that way they're all ready to sublimate and then you're ready to go that way you're not back and forth back and forth with each one so now what we're gonna do is I'm going to put my image down where I want it and I'm gonna actually to kind of avoid these harsh lines I've showed you before is to kind of tear it like this I'm bringing it down so I can see where I'm putting my image all right so what I'm gonna do is come down three I know where I'm going here and you know me I can eyeball where I'm at all right so say I'm happy with where that's at she shows that you need to coat it with two pieces of parchment paper this time so we're doing 385 for 70 seconds so we're gonna go ahead and get this down remember you want to stay completely still when it comes to sublimation so I'm just going to give it some firm pressure and hit go you all right there we have it so now I need to carefully pick this up so we don't get our ghosting and there you have it so you can hear that kind of stick just a little bit and now you can see how vibrant that is now I've sublimated already before on 5050 so it's nothing new but you can see how much more vibrant that is all right so now for our last step is you want to go over this one more time with your poly T and that's gonna give it a final top coat so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna put this back underneath here to protect everything got my cardboard back alright get my shirt up here and we're going to spray it with that poly T one more time just coating everything so you're just gonna go over with a nice little thin layer just like that that's gonna help hold that ink in you need to do is just press this for 10 seconds at 300 she said if you press it again at 385 at a high temp you're sublimating again so what we're gonna do I'm gonna change the temp to 300 so we're gonna hit temp come down to 300 all right now while the temperature was dropping and I need to change my time hold on now while the temperature was dropping what she did was hover again don't stick it directly on there I'm just hovering on top this is how she was drawing it as it was going down except for she was using heat pressing obviously but you just take your easy press and you're gonna hover over it as that heat is dropping plead this dry before this finished I'm dropping and that's totally okay so I don't have to hold it the whole time so I mean that's gonna get heavy it only took me about 10 15 seconds to relieve that dry so I didn't take no time at all so this last press all we need is one piece of parchment paper and we're going to go down for 10 seconds so we're gonna hit go so I've got it at 300 for 10 seconds all right there we have it now this shirt is completely finished so it's completely done now the only thing that I do notice with this is whenever you do this whole process here hopefully you guys can see this there it is and it says this heifer needs a vacation this is an image from Etsy I will link you down below the one thing I am noticing is it's given like a almost like a different right here and it feels like now it has almost like a like this is just hopefully you guys can hear this now it's not like a thick plastic or anything but it's got a coating you can tell it has a coating there I want to say because she does have like a whole group and like a Facebook page and I'll have it linked down below as well as to where people talk about you know how to use this stuff you know just basically kind of like one of those like a Facebook gun like a cricket group so anyways but there is one for this die press where they give tips and tricks so I'll leave it link down below but I think somebody said once you wash this that that all goes away so we're gonna find that out I'm gonna do that before I sell this because I'm gonna sell this down at my booth so I will let you know how that works out so there's that isn't it awesome how cool is that and this is about 50/50 because 50-50 doesn't usually come out this bright so I'm really excited about that now let's do some hundred percent cotton this cute little tee here this is another one of those wonder tees I got from Walmart I told you guys the other day this is a hundred percent cotton and I'm gonna show you guys this is that one donation higher percent cotton I'm gonna bring it up hopefully you guys can see the information there 100% cotton we're going to take our cardboard once again I'm gonna get our cute little shirt down and the first step that we're gonna do is cover it with the Desai's or making sure I'm grabbing the right one and we're gonna cover the area so I know about where this is going so I'm just going to go over it again and like I said she was kind of padding which is just kind of pushing the the Desai's are into the material you know how if you get something wet it kind of wants to hover on top for just a second so until it soaks just to kind of speed that up a little bit pushing right in now like I said I'm probably going excess with the Desai's er you really don't need to use this much but I'm just making sure I want to coat everything so obviously I'll get the fill about the more I play with this stuff all right I cannot wait to play with the other ones and get some dollar tree mugs okay so same thing I'm gonna fold this in half and kind of push on that just a little bit to kind of really get that in there now we need to bump our temperature back up to the 385 all right and this one we're just doing the steam and this one we're just pressing until you see that steam I think it took about 15 seconds last time I had a cleaner spot so you guys aren't having to look at that ugliness of it all right so I'm gonna press and oh I don't know why I hit the timer I didn't need to hit the timer but I hit 10 seconds so let's see if it does it in 10 seconds I guess if not we'll hit time again I guess we could kind of figure out how long it takes I'm gonna hit it again all right so about 30 seconds is what that took to get that steam out okay you bring our cardboard back in all right just like so and we need to do that 70 seconds again I'm gonna take our poly tea and we're going to coat it so we need to coat it to where whoever our image is going to be all right so once we've got that coated I'm gonna fold it in half and rub that in and I'm gonna go ahead and move this out of the way rubbing a little bit easier and better try not to stretch my shirt obviously there we have it so what I've been doing to protect my my mat I didn't mention that before is I've got down a piece of just paper is what it is this is just butcher paper I've got that down and then we're going to take our image for this one here we're gonna do like a fourth of July theme so it's gonna be America alright so we need to make sure and cover this until that's pretty much dry you really would want to do this stuff just ahead of time so you're not sitting here having to individually dry these because you can air dry them and that way they're just completely ready to go and the last step you're having to do is cover them with the Polish brain one more time all right so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get this down just kind of making sure it's where I need it to be I didn't do this on the last one but I want to try it on this one is I want to use that die trans pro-spray that's gonna help hold this down I know it's not going to shift and you can use the tape as well but let's try it and see if it works with this product are you giving it a second all right so just making sure and going where I need to be all right so say that looks good to me now I've got that in place I also mentioned and I want to try it this time she used a piece of just regular copy paper but I'm gonna use butcher paper and then she used her two pieces of parchment paper just to protect the parchment paper so you can use them more so they don't yellow right so or get the ink coming through so we're going to hit go 70 seconds all right pull all of our paper is here and now we're going to peel this off there you have it this is a hundred percent cotton so hopefully you can see that there it is sublimating on 100% cotton how cool is that 100% cotton so let's see if I can see the ring on this one I don't really see the ring as much as I do now obviously you can see where my press was setting but I don't see it like I did on the other one so I don't know if it's because it was a blend but this is 100% cotton and I'm not having that now you can feel the difference so this is you can hear and this is t-shirt and then that I brought you over to my mic so you guys could hear a little bit better so anyways but look how cool that is 100% cotton so you can go down to Walmart and get some of these t-shirts you can go down Target wherever it may be somewhere locally grab some t-shirts and make them and so wouldn't that be awesome to be able to have on hand so I'm really excited about this stuff and I mean look at how much I have less so far from doing two t-shirts oh really don't take much if you guys can see that there's still pretty much full it's hard to tell you but I just I've used a lot of decider I think I've used too much all right now let me go ahead and quickly the last step that we have to do is protect this with one more top coat of that poly tea but I'm going to set this aside and let's go ahead and do two baby onesies really quick so these are 100% organic cotton from Walmart and we're going to be 282 different design so I'm gonna go ahead and cut these down cut them in half just really heavy and then we're gonna start on our process really quick just so we have these I want to make sure they're gonna fit because I haven't double-check those you know I've already printed these once again all these images I got from Etsy and I will have them linked down below so that's gonna fit on there very well and then same with this cute little cat one okay so let's go ahead and get going so two little onesies and I'm gonna spray them at the same time so I can be do them together get our onesies and I'm gonna get both of them up here hopefully you guys with us and both and I'm gonna spray em both at the same time okay one is the 12 months 1 2 3 to 6 months so remind me unifor and over here cow cuz we're gonna forget you I'm already gonna tell you this size our first so we're gonna go over both of those so just kind of spritzing those just making sure wherever that image is gonna go that we've got it spritzed pushing that in I'm gonna go ahead move over to the next one and it's super hot in my she shed right now because I'm waiting to get my I'm still working guys another lot of you guys have questions what's going on that I have so much it's just been crazy we saw have everything to do basically I mean just well basically I've got to go to Ikea and we're gonna do that at the end of the month and I need to put my floors in and that's pretty much it but um my I've got to get my mini split you know my air conditioner but I can't turn on my fan because it's super loud for the video and I'm dying right so anyways I'm gonna finish spritzing these really well alright am I gonna fold these in half this I'm not gonna worry about it all right we're just gonna make sure they're spritz okay so what I'm gonna do well actually I'm gonna fold them in half I'm getting them off of here so there we go so you can see how we're protecting our workspace get this down now I could use my 6 by 7 and I think that's what I'm actually gonna do I'm gonna move this guy out of the way and let's use our 6 by 7 to sublimate all right now this one's gonna be the same thing where we need the cotton t-shirt as you guys can see me and my husband went out on the boat this weekend and I got super sunburned so it's been great we're gonna be pulling out the steam what we're using for this one is the cotton t-shirts I'm going to cover up our onesie and I'm gonna go ahead and press now this one there's no time we're just pressing until that steam comes out giving it firm pressure steam coming up so now I'm gonna pull this off and this one is ready to go let this one aside and press the next one we're ready to go so I'm going to spray it again now with a poly tea so we're gonna grab these cut down our cardboard here and I'm gonna spritz both of these with that poly tea so I'm gonna go ahead and get these on here you may not be able to see them both but they're both here okay well let's go ahead and get that poly T so for the pointy once again you're just spritzing where you're working all right so same thing you're gonna want to fold them in half fold them in half and I'm gonna move them over to rub them Medwin rub it so I can make sure that's nice and even try not to shake my camera everywhere for the 12 months we are going to have the unicorn right ahead and dry this I'm just hovering it over now this one I'm not going to use the spray I'm gonna do it without and so now we're gonna go ahead and get our image down about where I want it to be so say I'm happy with that I can see it you guys I think you guys can lightly see it so I can kind of see where I'm going with this just stick it down just like that I'm gonna go ahead and do the same thing where I've got the I've got three layers here so I've got the paper but put your paper and then the parchment paper I'm gonna get these down and then I'm going to go ahead and get my iron down on here so just like this and I'm gonna hit go 70 seconds all right with this out of the way movies and pull this up there we have it super cute 100% cotton organic cotton it's that if that it's 100% organic cotton look at that on a percent cotton how awesome it's hot so I'm trying to hold it here and with a crooked easy breast um once again I don't really see that outline like I did on that first one so I must have overdid maybe the desizing or even the spritz I'm not too sure but there you have it how freaking cute is that it says whatever I do what I want in that cute with that uniform we put this on that cup a while back okay so I'm gonna set this out of the way already got it ready to go so all we're gonna do is let's dry it just a little bit um same thing once again you wouldn't have to go through this if you pre did this and let them air dry I think that's ready to go this one is going to be new to the herd with these foot with cows I know it's backwards until we press it but look how cute so what we're going to do is line this up once again I can see through it y'all may not be able to and we're going to get this down I'm gonna go ahead and do the pro-spray again alright so I'm gonna go ahead and get that about where I want it so say I'm happy with it here making sure my shirt is flat same thing I've got my butcher paper and my three pieces my three pieces no two pieces of parchment paper I'm going to be making sure I'm staying right between where I need to be and just get this down just like so and hit go first so we're gonna pick this up alright and we're gonna put these out of the way now one thing I want to mention too with this spray as well as this because it sticks down you can always test so in case I didn't get over here over here you could always test it first and take a little peek so say you see how peaking like that I can actually lay it back down and go again and I wouldn't have to worry about ghosting because it's got such a strong grip on it now I'm going to kill this off and there you have it super cute look at how cute that is new to the herd Oh cute look at those colors 100% cotton organic cotton I'm gonna show you guys really quick um organic cotton is what it says Gerbert organic cotton there you go I don't maybe a little bit blurry this one's a three to nine months but look at how cute once again on this one I can't really see the difference on here you can see where my iron was but you have a little bit of that scratch hopefully you guys can hear that bringing it over and compared to the shirt not as bad I really think I just overdid it on my first shirt but there you are I love it so cute awesome okay so for the final step all we have to do is we've got these last three here we just need to spray them one more time with that poly tea now what you want to do is you want to air dry these first because know they need to be dry and then we're gonna press them at 300 for 10 seconds so I'm gonna go and change my timer but what I would do once again if I was doing a bunch of these at once I would go ahead and let them air dry and then come back later and get them all at one time so I'm not having to hover over these or blown with a blow dryer so I'm gonna go and bring my temperature my temperature I brought my temperature down to 300 now I'm bringing my time down to 10 all right while that temperature is dropping I thought I go ahead and talk about these one more time they're you know eight ounce bottles so like you could get them bigger though you can get them in bigger bottles like this like the 16 ounces and stuff but the 8 ounce bottles you're gonna need the decider and you're gonna need the eight outs now if you're doing colored shirts don't worry about this just spray it with the poly tee and then you're ready to go with that if it's colored but if it's white gray or oatmeal color you want to push the potion put the v-slicer but think about it this way with eight ounces it takes one ounce of this for each bottle and then the water so you're gonna get eight bottles each of this stuff right here so you can see how much I've used hopefully you guys can see that I've barely used anything hopefully I'm trying to hold it cuz if I hold it sideways it's gonna go this way so let me put right here so I'm only used to right about here where my thumb is on this one I've probably excessively used that I've went to right about there but you're gonna get eight of these eight ounce because each one's gonna fill up to eight ounces you're gonna get eight of these so that's how much clothing you can do I mean quite a bit and like I said I go ahead and and do all the ones that you need but you do not need the decider so if you weren't doing the on the colored shirts you're only gonna need this one bottle which is decisive but remember I marked it out and put poly tea crystals can a vinyl that so you would only need one of these if you're gonna be doing just colored shirts so it's pretty awesome and then like I said they've got other stuff too so you can do the poly gloss which you will be seeing very soon I'm fixing to be going and I might get some Dollar Tree cups I'm gonna get some Walmart cups and I'm gonna get maybe some like the glass cutting cutting trays and stuff like that and then with the poly natural maybe I'll do some tiles and stuff - I'll get several things because like I said it is for the gloss let's say it one more time it's metal marble stone ceramic glass acrylic whiteboard and wood so I will have a bunch of these items to try with that when we do that video very very soon with the wooden stone you can do it on those awesome pieces of wood you can do it on the cutting boards stone stuff like that and so I will have some of those to work with this so I'm pretty excited now with those two so the decides are you're gonna need this stuff here it is called catalyst I'm gonna take it out just yet but there it is by press catalyst and this is when you use the poly gloss or poly satin or the poly natural okay so you add one milliliter shippable of measuring things in there she's just like really I mean was a she made it perfect for me to be able to fill it up with the little measuring cups to display bottles gonna send a huge shout-out out to die press for sending these to me to try and like I said for the quick response and the fast delivery I asked and you guys delivered quick so I really truly appreciate that and so here we go so let's finish up these shirts last things we need to do is add the poly tee one more time lightly Kellie make sure everything gets its moist with it right this again protection everybody and everything alright alright there we go alright this time I'm going to show you just using your hair dryer to speed this up it's like that you're done it's really fast move that guy out of the way and I'm going to point this out it doesn't matter what drop blow-dryer you use this one's more expensive so don't go buy this one but the point this is just what I have it's just became my craft tool I've taken it from the kids my point is if you if yours has this nozzle or if you can make by this attachment separately super cheap I highly recommend that you use this nozzle because it it directs that air perfectly so when you're using this in the craft room it doesn't blow anything anywhere and it really directs that heat so highly recommend whatever dryer you get whether it's a ten dollar dryer make sure it has one of these or if you can attach one that way you can direct this however you want to you thing I'm gonna point out really fast is that I just now noticed when you spray that final coat of poly tea and don't over spray or you're going to make that bleed okay so you're going to end up making that blade you see where you can kind of see around that so don't over spray it with that poly tea now this one you can see nothing happened because I didn't know where spray that so be careful not to over saturate and I could tell you because this was really wet so just a tip alright so we just need one piece of parsnip for these and I'm gonna just go over it for ten seconds just like that so all the shirts completely done and ready to go toss that out of my way and bring in this one here cover it up here it go alright so there we have it's completely done so once it's not ten seconds you're good to go like I said be careful not to over spritz I'm going to slip it out of the way and we've got our last one here so America what I'm gonna try to do with this is turn it this way and put my press on there this way I'm gonna you can see I didn't know I didn't know where spray on that one either so I'm gonna hit go oh gee so there you have it so you have America and actually it looks like it did use so tiny bit there on the sea so just try not to over spray on that so there's booze and then here's this one there we go super cute love it and then while we're trying here's our first one we did and you can see how obviously did not overspray on that one I did really good look how vibrant that one now this is 50/50 so if you spray on 50/50 you're gonna get even more vibrant than before so basically when you're spraying on hundred percent cotton you can see that's a little bit lighter and I know there are two different images but you can see this is 50/50 so half polyester half cotton and before if I did it without the spray this is the color tone you would have had with this so basically these kind of are now like 50/50 cotton if you if that makes sense but before you could not sublimate at all on cotton and make it stay without washing it out but this type of color tones is what would have been in this but because this was without spray look at how vibrant it was like BAM so I'm pretty excited about that so huge shout out to die press for sending this stuff to us and letting us test it out super exciting about that highly recommend that you check this stuff out maybe we can sublimate on 100% cotton and so I'm really excited we can do dish towels all kinds of stuff possibilities are endless so stay tuned we got two more trials to do with two more different type of videos for the poly gloss and they're probably natural so I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "Ue0_AsqOEA0": "hey this is Tom with the father's workshop screen-printing and what we're gonna do we've got something in the mail that we want to check out and it's for putting sublimation on t-shirts not Polly t-shirts but gah so you don't come back right after the intro [Music] [Music] hey Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and we're here again and we're making another video and I don't know if you like him or not if you like to mother to that we made but anyways we're not real big on videos but anyways we're gonna we're gonna do something today we got some stuff from a company and we're not advertising unless you want to sanitize for you but we we got some stuff and it's it's from a company called Dai France and we we bought some stuff because we're curious about sublimation on garments now it's nice when you can put a nice graphic on garments by just using your heat press because I mean I have I have I have other graphics and stuff that you can actually heat press on to the car but this is something that we can print with our printer with the sublimation ink and be able to have a nice graphic and hopefully it would come out nice on shirt now I have heard that it really worked good now this is a little bit of a process because first of all you've got to use the the Desai's are on white and gray shirts to get the decides are out of it that they put into it it has to do with something when they when they're doing this church when they're making the shirts knitting the church or whatever it is it has something to do with with with with that process but they take the D sizer out it is it's removed when they put the ink in them so your your blue shirts and your yellow shirts and your orange green all your colored shirts don't have the D sizer and I'm so you don't have to go through this process but then once you've done that once you if you're gonna do a white shirt once you gather these sides are out of it then you have to use the the other chemical that you spray on there let it dry put in your heat present cure it spray it again cure it again and then you can put your sublimation graphic on to the garment onto the cotton garment so this is sublimation ink on cotton shirts and I have supplemented on cotton without you know without without this stuff and I know what it looks like and you got to be particular when you do it you can do it you still put that on yours on the shirt but it's it's it's it's really kind of blurry faded it comes out but it just it's not crisp but you know hey that you want say a nice clean crisp image it's not like that if you don't use this stuff I guess because I haven't used it yet and what I say haven't used it yet is is it's this stuff right here still on a package haven't even open it yet now this is the B sizer this is what you use on the white and gray shirts you put that on there and there's a process to make sure that you do that then once you've done that and you finished that process then you use what's known as this and it's the poly tea spray anyways just a bottle without a sprayer but this is a probably teach spray anyways and this is it's as concentrated so it'll make up as it's eight ounces should make up to 64 ounces I think it's seven ounces per ounce so that's the way it works what we're gonna do that so come back let's see how it does let's see how it works [Music] [Music] [Music] everything's gonna go [Music] it drops of spray on there now today we're back in this morning time and my Chinese food was great all right we have the heat press getting warmed up and we've went ahead in time to 10 seconds because we need to press this shirt now now that we wet it last night we let it dry overnight come back out here to the shop and I'm going to do now is let the heat press get hot when it gets hot we will press it I think it says for 10 seconds then I've got my he press yet for 10 seconds once it goes down and then we'll bring it back up and we'll take it back over to the platen over here and spray it again and maybe we'll go throw it out in the dryer and let it dry quicker so we can get that second coating on there and you know going to get the second Curie and then we can go ahead and see how this stuff works we're gonna print some up on our printer [Music] only say what said sure did you do yes last night I didn't do front of the back battle I'll just press both sides and I'll have to spray both sides I'm just kidding [Music] [Music] way and then we know that we've sprayed all of this so we'll take these depressed and it is set 385 degrees and we depress it for 10 seconds [Music] offensive ten-second charity thing not again anyway I went a little funk see that smoke I'm assuming that that is the D sizer not the sizer for that is the puck I seem that the smoke there is quality I don't want a bunch of spots all over my shirt [Music] that means we have to [Music] now we're gonna take the shirt we gon spray it again again now what I need to do now that I've done the two cures I've sprayed it let it dry now I'm doing then I did two cures what I'm gonna do now is we're going to put our picture sublimation ink and I did this I run this put together there on the computer there is we gonna put it on the shirt and it says to use butchers paper I'm I don't get that yeah I know I know I need to put something in between where the shirt is here so when you open up the inside of the shirt because that's what's gonna happen is it breaks into a gas so it's naturally gonna go through the material now I don't know if this poly tea is supposed to stop that but I'm gonna put something in between there anyways just to check and see maybe that's why the butchers paper for I have I have some Teflon paper I have up sheets that I put on and so we'll go that route on as far as put it over the top so anyway let's let's just go ahead and work with this thing and see what it looks like so I'm dying to see how it's gonna look now that I've got it it sure twice let me take these glasses off now I can I can see them reading glasses okay so we're gonna go ahead and put this on on the shirt put it on the shirt I think all we're gonna do we're not let me let me let me get the camera set up and we'll come back just hang on okay we're back you had to get the camera set up I hate that's over the cameras and and I'm using a cheap camera anyway so anyways what we've got here now me let me direct down here [Music] [Music] [Music] now this says this says we're supposed to [Music] get our feet press in a 385 degrees and we're supposed to press it for 70 seconds so I'll get that ready in just a second what I'm gonna do open this up [Music] [Music] I went to break into a gas it doesn't bleed through and [Music] [Music] thanks but when you got pictures like this it's kind of crooked anyways so if you put it on there little bit crooked it ain't gonna make any difference [Music] try to get a straight from cans [Music] I do what I need units I need to set this 70 seconds [Music] [Music] here we don't put it on there upside down set it up on shirt [Music] [Music] drop this all for 70 seconds [Music] I can notice temperature dropped you see that [Music] and that's gonna happen who says 70 seconds is up that seemed awfully quick only a few more seconds because the heat dropped and when it did it didn't maintain that no that's really why I set the temperatures a little higher can see it still it's 372 degrees and so it we didn't exactly press at the temperature so normally I set my temperature is higher so one actually is it cools off but it still does all right here we go [Music] when they say 385 and I'll tell you what man I normally go about 400 degrees [Music] not a real of course it could be mine my friend maybe I didn't turn it out as perfectly as I shut it that was treated [Music] treated a couple of times and like I said it's not supposed to be straight it's supposed to be crooked like that his head supposed to be straight got a nice feel to it where you can feel the regular shirt here the softness this is 10 of May today yeah that's pretty good like I said the purple see this one's got left over after after all that it could be the either idea I left it too long and the purple started to burn which is what your red and stuff will do that they'll actually start turning brown and this did turn a little brown instead of purple so maybe I'll do it again on another shirt and see what happens with that because yeah my my Reds turned a little but I mean I got the donut here but I think that dome that was supposed to be pink and it's red so I think it got too much heat for too long so seventy seconds and the thing about it is now these presses are not always accurate either something else too I wanted you to notice that remember when we put the paper in the middle and put the paper in the middle there because we worried about bleeding through [Music] you look after treating it twice it didn't even bleed through so that's good and actually that's my my purple turned brown and I think like I said because of too much heat but actually I kind of like the brown wool over there because it Ronnie coffee coffee face that's your coffee face I got the face so that's pretty neat I think what I'll do is I'll treat the back for Manila face on now put donut faizon sir that's uses sublimation ink and using a product called poly tea by company : Die Presse and next time next time what we will do we will and this is it this stuff here mixes one ounce with seven ounces of water give you eight ounces of spray and I imagine you can do a lot of stuff with that that's a lot of spray and [Music] stop father's workshop screen-printing and there it is who is what you think get the product spray on the cotton t-shirt let it dry cure it with the heat press doing it to do this repeat that over again and then put your picture on there I'm only experiment with some more I'll get them and sell em on eBay I'll experiment the ones that I experiment with you're still good-looking shirt I'll sell them on eBay so be looking father's workshop screen-printing TF w is screen printing I think it's pretty neat anyway that's that's all for this video so thank you for tuning in and yeah we had to little naughty sometimes but that's just where we are some folks say that we're handicapped from the neck up maybe they're right this is Tom the father's workshop screen-printing and thank you for tuning in and again god bless so until next time [Music] [Music]", "7UEO_gXGghs": "Welcome back to the Gentleman's Gazette!\nIn today's video, we'll discuss how to wash your suits at home in the washing\nmachine. Sound crazy? Well, just stay tuned for our techniques and you'll be\nconvinced. This video is the third on another series we've done on garment\ncare and maintenance the previous two videos in the series focused on shoe\ncare and how to fold different kinds of garments you can take a look at those\nvideos by clicking the banners at right. also if you haven't seen them don't\nforget to take a look at our previous series on garment care which discussed\nremoving the musty smell from vintage clothing how to wash and maintain wool\nsweaters some cheap and easy laundry hacks you can use and also how to remove\nstains from different kinds of garments. As we stated in the intro though, today's\nvideo will focus on washing suits at home. Now, you may be thinking why would I\never want to attempt something so sartorially risky as putting a heavily\nstructured garment like a suit jacket or blazer in my washing machine at home? The\nsimple answer is because there are techniques you can use to wash them in\nyour machine without any fear of damaging the garments and therefore, save\nmoney that you otherwise would have had to spend at the dry cleaners. Wouldn't a\nwool suit get ruined and shrink in the wash? You might be wondering. Again, the\nanswer is no. Not if you're using the proper techniques. We've already debunked\nsome of the myths surrounding wool and how to wash it in our video on\nmaintaining wool sweaters. In the broad strokes though, do fight the urge to take\nyour garments to the dry cleaner every time they need to be washed because the\nharsh solvents used in dry cleaning will degrade and break down garment fibers\nover time. Furthermore, water doesn't actually shrink wool garments rather the\nagitation that can be caused by a washing machine or more likely a dryer\nwill cause wool fibers to seize together or felt. Therefore, the\nprimary thing you should be looking out for when washing your garments is preventing\nfelting or for non woollen garments, other damage to the fibers. Convinced yet?\nWell, if not, we'll go over the washing process step-by-step. First to start out\nwith, you're going to want to make sure that the garments in question are\nproperly folded in order to minimize excess agitation that might occur during\nwashing. We covered the best way to fold all different kinds of menswear garments\nin our previous video in this series you can find that video here. You should then\nsimply use those folding techniques with two added caveats. First of all, turn your\ntrousers and/or your waistcoat inside out before folding them so that any\npotential felting will be on the inside of the garments. Of course, your jacket\nwill end up inside out using the folding method we outlined as normal. Second, you\nshould end all folding processes not by folding into thirds but by rolling from\nthe bottom to the top as tightly as possible but without causing any undue\nbunching. By rolling your garments tightly, you're going to minimize how\nmuch they can move and thus prevent any felting that might occur. Next, place each\nindividual rolled garment into its own separate mesh washing bag. The bag should\nalso be rolled up as tightly as possible and secured with safety pins as\nnecessary. Next, add an appropriate amount of cleaning agent to your washing\nmachine depending on the number of garments being washed. A general ratio of\nabout one tablespoon per garment works well for small loads and for larger\nloads, just follow the standard directions for your specific machine. A\ngentle cleaning agent like wool and cashmere shampoo should be added to the\ndrawer of the machine if you are washing wool suits, and soap flakes can be put\ndirectly into the drum of the machine if you're washing non woolen suits. You\ndon't have to select the cycle for woollen\nor delicates on your machine if all of your garments are properly secured in\ntheir individual mesh bags; the Express cycle is fine for most applications. Once\nthe machine is finished with all of its cycles, promptly remove your garments\nfrom the washing machine and take them out of their individual mesh bags to\nprevent any additional creasing. Next, let's cover drying. A word of warning\nhere, don't use your dryer as the heat and\nagitation that will occur inside the machine are prime conditions for felting\nyour garments which of course, you don't want rather each of your garments should\nbe laid flat in their natural shapes on a drying rack. You can speed up this\ndrying process a bit by first laying a clean towel down on a work surface. With\neach item in its original shape, gently roll the item up in the towel like a\nsleeping bag to remove some of the excess water. Wait a few seconds, unroll\nthe towel, and then place the garments on a drying rack. You can reshape or block\nyour garments a bit with your hands while they're on the drying rack just to\nmake sure that everything is shaped as properly as possible. After most of the\nmoisture has evaporated, you can move your jacket from the drying rack back to\nits original hanger just to make sure that its shoulders and other padded\nareas dry in their natural shape. A few additional tips here, avoid placing your\ngarments in direct sunlight or near heat sources like a radiator while they're\ndrying as this can cause shrinking or yellowing of the fibers. Also, never hang\nwet woolens up right away as gravity will pull on the water that's still\nlocked into the fibers meaning that your garment's shape will probably be\ndistorted. To remove any wrinkles after your garments are dry, using a garment\nsteamer is best on structured items like jackets. If you'd like to intentionally\nreintroduce a crease to a garment, say on the legs of your trousers, for example,\nthat would be a good time to use an iron. If any pilling\nhas happened to occur to your garments, you can take a pill comb and gently run\nit across the fabric in one direction to remove those pills. Also, using a clothes\nbrush in between wears is a good way to more generally remove lint, fuzz, and hair\nfrom your clothing. Finally, today, here are some quick notes on hand washing and\nspot treatment. If you can believe it, hand washing suits is actually a little\nbit trickier than machine washing because working these structured\ngarments around in a basin and trying to wash them completely can be a little bit\nunwieldy. If you're trying to wash the entire garment, using your machine is\nactually best. For spot treatment of specific areas, all you have to do is use\na small amount of the relevant cleaning agent and a little bit of warm water and\ngently blot at the stain. Don't scrub at it or you might felt woolens and\notherwise damage different types of fibers. We've just washed the jacket\ntoday for illustration purposes but obviously, these techniques and methods\napply to all other elements of a suit as well including the trousers and the\noptional waistcoat. What you're seeing here is the jacket after it was allowed\nto fully dry, this is after about two days time and what you're seeing here is\nthe jacket after a garment steamer has been used to steam out the remaining\nwrinkles so that they're either gone or mostly gone. In other words, the jacket\nlooks just as good as it did before it was washed and there you have it! All the\ntechniques necessary to wash your suits in your washing machine at home. If\nyou're still apprehensive about trying this method, we would suggest that you do\nit with a non woolen suit first as it will probably be a little bit less\ntemperamental and there will be no chance of felting.

really it just went it had been on pause for a long time and i think the preview so many of the things were sold out so i don't know whether i got 10 full items but it is a huge huge box though it's not extremely heavy so it's funny it was coming in a box then it came in a bag and now it's back in a box so let me rip open this tab so cover your ears there you go and we'll see what's in here and if i remember correctly it everything is in plastic so i will just go and get everything out and then come back to you so that you can see what's in okay i unwrapped everything and my paperwork is non-existent i got the little piece from them but it doesn't have the paperwork in here so unfortunately i have no prices um so i'll pull it up on my phone in a little bit when i do the try on and see if i can find the prices on there but first of all i've got a pair of snake skin naturalizer shoes size eight these are really cute aren't they those would be great going into spring and then there was a pair of dr scholl's blacks and i had a pair of black vans and they're getting very old um and the soles are getting old on them so this is kind of cute they almost look like they've been worn i don't know don't they kind of odd um but these are cute and these are size eight as well which i wear seven and a half or eight so those are the two pairs of shoes then there's a daily ritual shirt and boy this is heavy very heavy like like sweatshirt heavy and it's crew neck long sleeve with a ribbed cuff and then down at the bottom there is a u-shaped opening on the side and then it's reinforced down at the bottom with the last about four inches but it's the same um in the front and the back and it's striped and i i can't really tell whether this is black and white or blue and white it's very substantial very very heavy i mean i like it but boy i bet you it's extremely warm and let's see there is a tag on it but it doesn't have a price on it very pretty then there's a good threads size large heavy heavy gray sweater with pockets very nice heavy heavy knit and it has a band all down the front so it would lie flat very nice like that and then there's a top by monroe and this appears to be just a like t-shirt top and it i think it must be cropped it's very short i don't think that maybe it would hit my waist i don't know and it has stars on it and they are embroidered stars very cute shirt but i i don't really wear cropped shirts but we will do the try on thank you okay i have on the amazon brand good threads women relaxed fit bonsole shaker stitch cardigan sweater in heather gray and this is a large and it is 52 or i'm sorry 42.50 i really like this sweater but i think that it is too big on me i think i could take a medium but it is really nice it has the like v-neck with the band that goes straight down long sleeve pockets it's a thick thick knit with the ribbing all the way down the nice pockets at just the right length it comes to you know about three inches above my knees very nice sweater and this is made of as i'm saying but it's really nice i really like this so i think i'll see if i can get this in the medium even the sleeves are long on me you know you would have to cuff them which would be fine but i just think it's it's big you know overall and i have on the shirt underneath this is the amazon brand daily ritual women's terry cotton and modal pullover with side cutouts black and white skinny stripe and this is a large and it's 28 fits very well up here it's crew neck it has a band and i had to roll it up they're very long sleeves i'm not crazy about the u-shape i like them better when they're just straight cut and this is really kind of big i probably need a medium in this as well it's long you could wear it with leggings and because the way that this is cut i you can't really and it's so long you can't really front tuck it it does have a very large band in the front if you can see this it has a double stripe here it looks you can see it across here and it's double material very thick so it's heavy like a sweatshirt very heavy okay and these are the dr scholl's shoes women wander up sneaker in black 48.95 very nice very comfortable they are a little big on the heels if you can see that i'm very narrow feet so it's hard to unless i find narrows to find shoes that don't do that these are the naturalizer women jade loafers alabaster snake and these are in a eight narrow and these fit perfectly they do not slide up on my heel at all and i really like these can you see the the snake print very nice i like these a lot i think these would wear well into into spring i like this snake print and this is the monroe women's vintage crew with all over star embroidered embroidery faded maroon in a large and it is 46-28 and it's cute it's just a crop top and i don't really wear crop tops but it is very cute for those of you that do and the embroidered stars is just darling i really like that it would be great for fourth of july wouldn't it so it's not too bad i mean it you know and let's see if it's 100 cotton 50 cotton 50 modal so it shouldn't shrink very cute let's do the wrap up okay i'm back the first thing is the dr scholl's shoes i like these and i'd like to get another pair but these are just too wide for me these were 49.95 so these will go back the naturalizer shoes snake print i think these are going to stay with me these are 56.46 i will check the naturalizer site just to make sure these are the best price but i like those and i think those will go into spring and summer really really well the cute little top if this wasn't a crop top i might keep this this was so cute and it is so so soft it is just really nice it is 46 28 which again that's kind of high for you know a little top this um top was had that big u shape um on the side that was cut instead of just the opening it was a big opening this is the amazon brand daily ritual women's terry cotton and modal pullover and this was 28 good price but i didn't care for that opening on the side and then there was this really beautiful beautiful knit heather gray sweater and i really like this and this gray sweater is only 42.50 and i'm gonna check and see if they have this in a medium because i think that i really like this sweater and i think i could get a lot of use out of this gray sweater so i will check on that so overall not a bad box i i've gotten some really cute things from amazon prime i got that one kimono that blue and white kimono that i wear quite a bit so um you know it's hit or miss but when they you know hit with something it's usually something i get a lot of wear out of so even if it's just the shoes it's great for me so i know you have a choice and i really appreciate that you take the time to your time to spend it with me i really do appreciate that very very much so until we see each other in another video i hope you have a very blessed day bye-bye", "FAtPNKpc-iY": "[Music] hey what's up everyone thanks for joining us in another video I haven't done a video in a while we've been pretty busy um as you know if you follow us on Instagram we picked up a Sawgrass 800 so I've been busy trying to learn how to work that thing so with the Sawgrass 800 you to print sublimation prints we've been putting stuff like this right here we got that we did do some mugs so I told you with that fiber one he pressed whenever I got a supplement printer that we would do some mugs because the only thing that we really did was the cat press and we pressed a shirt on the platen that it came with but do a video later on with the mug press so we've been looking for something that could print onto cotton with supplement so we've been doing a little research and I found this right here it's called forever sub flex - OH - so it claims that it could press on to 100% cotton so we're gonna give it a try obviously if you've checked my Instagram you know that I've done it and it does print here's a shirt that I did but we're gonna go through what we're gonna do now we're gonna go to the process of how it works so here's one of them right here that is the actual printable vinyl that prints up lamay ssin and you're still gonna press it in Reverse and as you can see if you can see that's 100% cotton um it has the vinyl feel to it because it's actual vinyl here's a here's one right here so here's here's what it prints right here prints like this so you print this after you print it you have to weed it some some vinyl so you look at this one I went to I put this contour cut on here so we could do a contour cut to cut it out but what it did is it moved it over a little bit and then it cut the end of this off over here so this is a waste but we're gonna learn so this like I said this is the bun this is the vinyl right here this is the forever sub flex - OH - it's the actual vinyl so has actual vinyl on it but if you use the polyester shirt like this right here you're going to whenever you press there's no there's no backing on it it actually goes into the actual shirt and you don't have to worry about any vinyl or anything so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna in this video what we're gonna do is where you are going to press this I already printed it and the reason I already printed it is because when it prints on here when it prints on this vinyl you have to let it sit for a while to dry or to cure whatever you want to call it because if you don't once you start to weed it or once you start to cut it you might smear it and that's what happened with this one here whenever I was cutting this out I actually rubbed some of this black and it got onto this right here so when it comes to when you get something on this and then you try to wipe it off it won't because you'll see whenever we press this the image is in Reverse so the ink is actually touching the shirt and then bleeds through the vinyl so we're gonna show you the process of how we do this use you can always put registration works on there and then print it put it back into your cutter and then do a contour cut around the whole thing but with this image right here being that this is a jpg and these are JPEGs this is a jpg it wanted to cut a lot of the it wants to cut a lot of the white out so what I did is I'm just gonna go ahead when I do this we're gonna use an exacto knife to cut around it the best that we can so that we're able to weed it and then we'll press it so let me follow us on Instagram you know that I started selling the Gimme five from B flex I picked up some white and some black I picked up I picked up fifty yards of white 50 yards of black from them we got about 20 yards of white left and about 30 left of black so if you guys need some a hit us up let us know I'll give you a really good price and for those of you that have bought some within this first week started selling it I appreciate you guys 100 percent and also if you're new to my youtube channel thank you for joining thank you for stopping by good to go like our Instagram page alright so for this next part we're gonna take this exacto knife and we're gonna edge around the whole thing if you don't want to watch it you can go ahead and fast-forward to it I'm going to put the camera down while I cut through this and we will fast-forward through one of them I won't show the process for both of them because we're doing two shirts so we're gonna cut this one like I say with the exacto knife if you want a fast walk go ahead so like I said in the last the last one that I did whenever I was whenever I was cutting this as I was cutting around like this being left-handed I smeared a lot of this but now it's dry so I don't have to worry about that I actually printed this and then I waited about an hour so it can get full cured or fully dried so now we're gonna go back with the exacto knife and start to cut this out since I didn't do the contour cut as we're doing this I'm just doing a light cut just to cut through the vinyl so that we can weed this and then press it on to the shirt all right so we got the whole thing done we got the outline done so now I'm gonna come back same thing like whenever you're weeding a piece of vinyl just come in here grab a piece of it then you can just come back in here and do the detail work so if we look here this could come out then I'm gonna pull some of this out all right so we got one of them done went through trimmed up alright so we got one of them done I went ahead and I took this out right here took out this middle part so when it's on the shirt it doesn't feel like a big blob of plastic right here um what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna cut the other one and then we'll press these shirts to see how they look want to say happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there the mug that we did for somebody got their personal pictures on there so I'll show you but picked up this box at Hobby Lobby for $0.99 put my logo on there not bad though happy Mother's Day right so there's our image all right so here's our image right here we got it it's ready to go the thing with this right here is when you print this turn it upside down so if you do decide if you do have a sublimation printer and you do decide to go with this you do have to flip your image when you press this or whenever you print this out so that whenever you do it it's gonna be this way and the ink will then bleed I guess through the vinyl and you got to press it two times so let's go ahead and put the shredder on here get the moisture out of it alright so as you can see we are gonna be pressing this on 100% cotton so let's go ahead set this up so here it has two different ways to do it we could do a matte finish so we could do a high-gloss finish we're gonna go ahead and go with the high-gloss finish it tells you here to mirror your image and then cut the outline read the white areas we already did all that then it says the press our shirt for five seconds like like you do with any shirt to remove the humidity or the moisture so we're gonna do that so we can get everything out of there the lint roller another thing I didn't tell you is you see this the carrier sheet is not like regular vinyl where it sticks to it so the backing isn't sticky so so this isn't sticky and this isn't sticky it's on there but it's not sticky cuz he's mighty square I usually come three inches down from the neck from the bottom of this arrow so create cheese right there what's ignite 11 inches on both sides all right so here we go we're gonna put this here we're gonna Center it same thing as always I put my hand here to hold it in place this one is not sticky at all we're gonna move it and then we're good there so the next thing so the next thing I'm gonna read right here it says place to place the forever sub flex - OH - transfer onto the garment and put 10 sheets of copy paper on top of it so that goes for matte or gloss so we're gonna put that on top of this so we're gonna do that and then it says for the the gloss Onis it says press 15 seconds then remove the 10 sheets of paper so we're going with the gloss so we're gonna do that I'm still going to put Teflon paper over this so the temperature for this right here is 180 degrees Celsius or 356 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 seconds high pressure so here we go we're gonna press this first one let me make sure I got 15 seconds yep so we're going to press this for 15 seconds they will remove the Tim sheets of paper will set the time for 30 seconds and it should be good so remember with supplementary print sublimation the picture should be shiny and obviously you can see working with right here it should bleed through so says that it bleeds through the vinyl sole scene let's press this [Music] alright so imma go down I'm gonna switch my time now to 30 30 seconds for this next one so there's the first part you can see it started coming through we're gonna go ahead we're gonna press it for 30 seconds like it says let's see what happens so we remove the ten sheets of paper now so we're pressing it for thirty seconds without the ten sheets it says peel backing off once it is completely cold so we're going to do that and we'll see how it looks so as you can see the vinyl press through I mean the sublimation went from the backside it's now on the front everything is the way it's supposed to be we're gonna let this cool down and then we'll look at it well this one cools down I'm gonna press the other one all right so we got one here it's fully its fully cooled its cooled down so it says wait till it's cooled down and it should be should peel right off and there it is so that doesn't look bad at all actually looks pretty good good thing is I cut a lot of this out so you don't have that you don't have that feeling of a big plastic chunk right here it doesn't have the same feel as regular vinyl it's I don't know what it what they use for this but the pictures real shiny alright so there it is we know now that you can buy some vinyl that you could print on with supplement prints it's cause it's forever sub flex - OH - its su be Li sub lies sub lie flex - OH - for light or dark garments for 100% cotton so here's the shirt right here here's how it looks so right here as y'all saw whenever I did whenever else I guess we could say whenever I was using the exacto knife to cut this out I cut this out because when I did the other shirt then I was doing a test on so when I did the test like this I just I had just try it just to try it out it has a big piece of plastic right here in the bottom so I didn't like that the way that plastic stuff feels so it to it to eliminate that I'm on these right here I wonder what they had the knife and I cut all that out so we know that it does work then you can also do it like when I was reading it you could do a matte finish or the high gloss finish inside I'm not gonna tell you who I got it from because I ordered it on eBay just type in the forever sub flex - or - I'm pretty sure pop-up I'm not gonna tell you I ordered it from because the people that I ordered it from a guy here three days late so I'm not gonna put you in that situation yeah we've been we've been rocking and rolling with this supplement stuff if you guys need a mug made if you need some banners may we could do the banners we could do banners like this this one was one of the first ones I did and I printed on the wrong side of the paper when I did the paper I put it on the wrong side so it didn't come out like it was supposed to we could do drawstring bags like this if you need some drawstring bags or if you just want to print you can send me your image as long as it's a good image we could print it on here for you and then once you get it this right here is for polyester only this paper right here you only be able to print onto 100% polyester so if you're trying to clip this onto cutting I don't know if it'll work I'm gonna do a video where I do 100% cotton 100% polyester and then 6040 and then we're gonna print printer up turn on this paper and then press it on each one of those and then wash it and then see what happens after we wash it we'll do that for another video but for now like I said you if you just want the print I just sent some out I could print what you want on it and we could do like the gang chic thing where you put whatever you want on there price will vary between the colors that you need but we can also just send them to so let us know also if you've been following me on instagram you know that we got these right here we we do the mouse pads if you need a mousepad let us know got somebody I haven't done these yet these kingless I ordered a sample pack when I ordered my stuff but these are actually flip-flops so I guess you can put a picture on here you know it's gonna work the same you put your picture on here then it comes with these right here to where you just then it comes with these right here to where you put them in then you have your own personalized flip-flops and then this came with the sample pack - it's a natural puzzle see if you can see the you should be able to see it you can see the puzzle the jigsaw puzzle again same thing put your own image on there and you can make puzzle for yourself let's let us know if you need anything and also last and also don't forget we are selling the bee flex vinyl if y'all need any of it let us know we'll give you a really good price whenever you I don't have the website up so if you if you need some send me a direct message on Instagram you'll be talking to me straight we'll be talking back and forth it's not something get to do online right now so yeah I just hit us up and let us know but so as you all know we're doing the vital thing we started doing the supplement thing so like I said y'all need anything let us know and then last but not least we ordered a four in one screen printing kit to see give it a try see how it goes so that thing came in yesterday FedEx jacked up the whole box it was all jacked up so the company that I ordered it from was like open it up and there's anything wrong with it let me know and we'll take care of it so that's cool hello so hope I didn't do an unboxing on the 4700 I did but I think I'm doing unboxing on the four color one

it wednesday i can't remember i pushed the the thing that i needed more time because well i needed more time with covet on the rise um being stressed at brick i really didn't want to what are the words one had to change my clothes after um you know being home and relaxed and just going into this with a shitty attitude so what i have is um i have my stitch fix stitch fix for anyone who doesn't know is a clothing styling subscription box you get five items and keep what you want you send back what you don't i used to have the styling fee which was like fifty dollars and i took care of the styling fee for the year but because i decided to get less boxes um because of well essentially cooping uh i opted not to do the style pass so i'm just doing every other month you know i paid the 20 styling fee that is my new normal because i don't go anywhere and i don't need new loungewear every month so let's get in here first let's get into the informational portion of our video for anyone who is new hi i'm gladys on this channel i mainly do unboxings like ipsy boxy charm that fit fun i did the occasional stitch fix i used to get them more often but because of coping i don't need to which is helping my bank account um yeah if you like what you see stick around stay i be part of our family uh if not just move on to the next it's okay you're not gonna hurt my feelings all right with that said let's jump back into the rest of this specs you always get a i should do this uh you get a return bag shipping is free both ways that is to ship back anything you don't this envelope is supposed to contain your letter nine out of ten times the letter doesn't end up in there here is my burrito as i call it there's one extra thing did not fit in there so you guys that says hi gladys i wanted to give you a variety of fyi on stitch fix you can leave a note for your stylist if there was something that interest you or something you specifically wanted you can put that down there's nothing really that i was like so i left mine blank but she said i wanted to give you a variety of everyday clothes and styles to wear on a night out that's not happening anymore these 18 22 denim jeans are a girlfriend fit similar to the ones that you like in your last fix i think they will be very flattering on you plus they will look incredible paired with the beach lunch lounge button down that will be great for this amazing fall what weather not that i know because i i'm inside all the time oh amazing fall weather we have been seeing this year and it looks so cute layered under this market and spruce cardigan on a colder day ooh a grandma sweater my husband hates a grandma's sweater now for when you're wanting to get dressed up this michael stars tie front dress will give you a classy stylish look that i'm sure your spouse will love happy late anniversary by the way my anniversary it is november my anniversary was last month 18 years this soul society handbag crossbody matches it so well too and we'll give you the perfect finishing touch happy styling exo cara okay a dress i'm not too keen on the dress if i don't go out and if i do go out is to go food shopping home depot maybe you know i'll be starting some christmas shopping we're not going out to dinner anytime soon we did for our anniversary and our anniversary like family dinner that was last month ain't no way in hell i'm trying that now all right so let's start with the handbag just move myself over here so you can get a thing here it is it is a burgundy color this is from soul society handbooks this is the colia clutch this retails for 54.95 feels very fake leather to me has many pockets on the inside you've got like a polka dotted sort of animal print in there like a pocket did get a new phone and it's a little smaller than my old phone so i have no problem there you have a zipper one in the middle you have a leather well leather uh burgundy strap there in the center i love a good crossbody and then there's the third pocket in the back i love a good crossbody as i was saying i don't need one because i'm not going out um but yeah that's that because like you could hold it like a clutch i'm holding it like a football right now but with the long strap you can you know put it across your body i like these the butcher paper yeah i like that more than i like the old paper okay my next item is from beach lunch lounge this is the charlie button down top in mustard it's a flannel it's a kind of boxy but might work looks kind of wide no thrills there um this retails for 64. i will give it a try i love a good flannel of course i love a good hoodie you know all right here's the dress she was talking about from michael stars it's the rodel tie front knit dress in burgundy so large 98 okay all right let me get a good look at it right essentially what you have here it's like a stretch cotton with just a little extra material in the front it's a faux wrap technically sleeveless and you just have this extra time right here it's supposed to give you shape without extra layers i don't know okay one is it's winter you gave me a sleeveless dress and it's just a knit i don't know about that and 98 for this oh that might look cute with this sweater though i'm taking this sweater you can't tell me you don't need a new switch oh it's got pockets this is the market in spruce and and and tony cotton blend what else does it say because it's cut off on mine jay parket cardigan in white it is a large and it is 68 dollars i like the the suede elbow patch i like the how long the sleeve is oh i like this that's not too heavy it is a bit dense um white is not a good color just saying you know what you could wear this with anything and my last item is from 1822 denim these are the berlin girlfriend distress jean in indigo size 14. let me see there you go when they say distress there's no actual holes or anything it is cuffed at the bottom it's just a little faded in the front and the back yep nothing too spicy about this and these are how much 48 48 i can deal with those are all my items let me get to trying these on so be right back all right here is the dress i think with the clutch it does match quite perfectly you know so just put that aside this just hugs everything but not in a bad way okay fyi not wearing a regular bra bring one of those support well this work for all tank top thing that i got last time because any time i not to wear a bra i will do it um so that's what this is all about but i don't mind this it fits and it's you know it hits me at the knee which i like the rear looks fantastic and like this i'm bloated okay this is where to get on the side and i don't mind it if i wore some spanx suck that in it would look a lot smoother so i don't mind this he would be really happy with this i'm going to try it with the sweater all right here it is with the sweater which i love it even more because if i was to go out i would not go without sleeves not in this weather you know i can put my hands in my pockets feel kinda or just you know it covers the tush here it is with the bag i like this i like this a lot do i know of a time and place i'd be able to wear this i don't know if we did like a senior citizen's dinner and went out early but i would have to again justify a reason to to wear a dress to a local restaurant like you could wear some you could wear heel or a booty you know and put some tights underneath whatever it's very versatile you could also wear this in the summer you know but i like it all right here is the other outfit which is so much more comfortable uh plenty of space in here so if you were to be going out it's like christmas shopping you'd be so comfortable in this these jeans are a little tight in the cap area but i love i love it it feels kind of like a legging i like the length of it and you can fold it all the way down you want to put like your uggs on i would depending on how cold it was either do the ugg thing or where my toms let's see the back looks fine i mean it's all covered up by the shirt anyway so it's not this is leaking i'm going shopping kind of outfit for me is really comfy let me try it on with the sweater let's not just weather the sweater that they said that it would go wrong with oh i had plenty of room in the arms you can button this down more if you want some ventilation again see i told you that sport for all uh tank top and this is exactly how i'd wear it i'd wear a tank top underneath preferably this one so i didn't have to wear a bra and i'd go about my day you can you know do another button you can have it up here if you're feeling conscientious this is just comfy all right here it is with this when the this sweater once you put this on it's a bit restrictive i feel like you would have to yes i barely ever wear sleeves all the way down to my things unless it's cardigan feels a little better once you undo that but it does make it a little bit tighter i don't like it with this maybe with just this sure any other shirt sure not with this particular color so i like this i like it love it with a dress but not with this shirt why would she suggest that i feel like you would need like an olive or even a blue or a black cardigan and not this way but it's just very off-putting but that's it i like all of it except for the bag okay let me get back into my clothes i'll be back hi i'm back all right so what did you think god damn it besides the purse i like it all these 18 22 denim jeans they were a little tighter in the calf area but i like that you can just roll that up you can have it long versatile you could wear jeans all year round as long as it's not blazing hot and these were only 48 this top from each lunch lounge so comfy so comfy this is definitely something i would wear something that i could already find in my closet but i don't have mustard yellow this was sixty four dollars all right this cardigan from market and spruce love a great grandma sweater was 68 this clutch from seoul society was 54.95 i really didn't care for it just because i have many handbags i don't need a new one for every outfit but there is one that i keep thinking about it's way overly priced and inexplicably too expensive to be justified i saw it in the oh gosh don't do it to yourself the old magazine the oprah's favorite things you know i just took a look to see what it was what her favorite things were and most of it i didn't like there was this bag oh my god it was just so beautiful it was from a brand called brahim b-r-a-h-i-m it was like it was a burgundy ombre kind of color and in my mind i know it's alligators or crocodile or something because it was really had that intricate detail of like the back of an alligator in my mind i want to just think about it being a dragon and it was just beautiful i don't want to really own something that an animal had to die for but then again i eat meat so but anyway i saw a commercial today macy's has it and depending on the size they range from 195 to 295 and i know it's extremely extremely expensive but it was so beautiful i don't i could not ever justify buying a bag that much i really couldn't but it was beautiful and that's what i've got my mind set on nothing's just gonna compare to that bag so there's that and then there is this dress from michael stars it is simple in its construction simple in its material but looks so good this was 98 i don't think it's worth 98 but i feel like i just looked amazing and if i wear the cardigan with it it's fine for fall and winter and spring without the cardigan i could still wear it in the summer it was a lot of money for a very basic simple dress that when am i gonna wear this so uh with everything put together my subtotal is 322.95 if i kept all five pieces that is eighty-three twenty-four dollars i mean eighty-three twenty-four eighty-three dollars and twenty-four cents off there's my styling fee credit because that soundly feed that you pay 20 does goes towards this that's an additional 20 off so it brings down my total to 229.71 so essentially that dress would be free if i kept off pieces i really shouldn't though if i kept everything but the purse my total would be 271. not okay with that all right if i kept the jeans the flannel and the cardigan that's just 180 because to be honest i don't need the bag and don't really need the dress and i feel like i could pick up that dress anywhere maybe even one with sleeves for a cheaper price than what it is i think that's what i'm gonna do the jeans the flannel the cardigan because that's what fits in my life right now and i have a million dresses and you know i'm kind of dead you know can't go anywhere i can't do anything we have addie like three days out of the week so something that's more mom grandmom friendly fits more into my lifestyle right now so i think that's what i'm gonna do and that that sweater can go with anything those jeans will go with anything that shirt will go with any pair of jeans yeah that sounds versatility all right that is it what did you think i have until wednesday to ship this back so give me your thoughts i'd love to hear them till the next one bye you", "J0klUeko1Zc": "hey guys look at what we got in another plaid but it is sherpa lined so safe and soft i love it so it is a gray black and red plaid um it has this cute little pocket right here um these are a little bit warmer because it has the sherpa line but it's just in the body the sleeves are not sherpa lined um i'm in a size small and so it's true to size i can button it um shanna was in a 2x so her normal size there is no stretch in these sleeves whatsoever so you can see it is loose on me but in the shoulders no stretch at all so true to size but if you're not 100 sure because like if you want to try it on because there's no stretch come in and see me but we do have all the sizes which is super exciting so we have small through 3x and yeah i mean i can button this up in a size small i love flannels you guys it is just now that it's cooling off it's like flannel season and you can go sit outside in the cool mornings and drink your coffee and this would be perfect for that so again small through 3x um i think they're gonna go quick so snag it online or in the app anyways hope you're all having a great day", "lPz74Cpn7b8": "all right so today we have a fairly common household issue we typically see these clocks that some of the numbers are not showing up right it might have the temperature humidity those type of measurements and this is pretty typical some of the numbers don't come through now the first thing to do usually won't solve it but the first thing to do is install fresh batteries in it which I have done that and as you can see that it's still not helpful if you play around with it when it's on you'll notice that if you press in certain areas sometimes on the screen I'll do it lightly it's made out of glass but you'll notice sometimes that they'll come back especially around the edges and I found this sweet spot here is there so you notice if I squeeze this just right there it is 10:58 perfect but if I of course release the pressure something is not connecting right and those numbers don't appear and you can kind of now if you had a really large clippers you could probably not have to take anything apart just put it here and find the right spot and be done with it but then you're gonna have Clippers hanging out so we're gonna take this apart and see what's causing that and if possible if there it's worth fixing so I've got my trusty jewelry screwdrivers with me and we're gonna set on taking this baby apart all right that's one oh boy these must have been the other a machine tightened or about Hulk they're so tight all right now of course this happens with cheap clocks expensive clocks you see this on watches to tend to cause issues where some of these numbers just for some reasons start not to show and we'll probably find out that it's something to do with a display contact the middle context are coming off but these are not necessarily meant to be user replaceable so you make sure there's nothing hiding there is a screw hiding underneath of there see if we can pop this up some of these companies like you put a couple extra they went out of their way to put as many as possible I guess that's good and I'm just check the battery compartment make sure they don't have any screws underneath there as well no they don't wonderful so quick shake about five screws out and hopefully the back will lift right up for the most part to reveal yes this is not all the way undone let's see here and we've got this panel here so I can't just pull it straight off so it's probably still sticking to it somehow yeah there we go all right let's see what we have here ah we may be in luck we'll see so we've got the battery compartment here we'll see how I can turn this this makes sense this is where we have the buttons for temperature humidity setting the time and most of that is fact all of the controllers going back to this bottom circuit board so we'll take a look at that in a moment and then we have this beeper here this is what was making that beep so you can set an alarm standard double-a batteries for a total of 3 volts and these are the hinges so let's take a look what we have on this side because this is where the problem is that so we've got a whole bunch of screws wow that is see if I can zoom in on that a little bit that is a ton of screws and that makes sense because I think on the other side is where those connections that we need to address are it's got a bunch of connections under here and it's actually quite interesting that's not me was it no look at that there's already kind of a scratch there and if the camera can pick it up look up these screws if I turn the sideways you're going to see something that I find quite interesting some of these are screwed in a lot tighter while these ones are looser and this one's pretty high so oh this is almost beveled in the sukkah was driven in with force got a little scratchy from it which makes me think it's someone manually did this it's not an automated system but then we have it again we have this one is positively different in terms of height and all the way screwed and then this one so this inconsistency of pressure most likely is causing some of this so sure at first it wasn't an issue but the contacts maybe it's starting to starting to Oh No the environment starting to make those contacts potentially rust or degrade in terms of connectivity and that's typically what happens with these clocks so all things will break down over time so we may get lucky be able to clean those contacts off and save this precious clock all right and if not then we learn something new and fun let's grab the rest of these so in case you're wondering always be careful with these types of circuit boards because these black things that are really evident here those are traces I they're pieces of flat wire that are connecting one thing to the other just the same as these guys are they're no different only this time that's on the circuit board if you accidentally scratch one of these and like it's cut straight through it you've severed that wire so just be a little careful all right so if we pull this one off let's see what this reveals all right all right we are gonna be in luck I'm really actually quite excited because my guess is we can fix this so the first thing we have is we have the actual sensor believe this is what's measuring the temperature that's a little-little thermistor so hopefully that's coming through nice and clear so we've got a nice thermistor there and we have a couple of diodes capacitors resistors supporting this I've got the main brains of the clock if you will here along with the crystal to set the hertz and cut more resistors so this pad here that you're seeing right now this is the pad that's relaying the right to right voltage to the display and as I mentioned these can experience corrosion from weathering from different environments if you're in the South probably quite familiar with things corroding and that's generally what happens these things start to cause issues see if we can get that to focus a little bit more I'll do that there we go so potentially some of this can be now the other part that can cause issue is of course how are these pads connecting to a display well it's got this guy right here and ever since I was a little kid I've always found these quite fascinating it's simple at its heart but I bet the manufacturing process it can be a little bit tricky and what I'm referring to is this beautiful let me see if I can pull this out actually maybe that would be even better hey there we go we've got the display out wonderful there's the display tada now this display runs by electricity so how do we connect metal pads right which are sending a voltage through these to the actual context I mean it's glass right well in between these panels you can see very lightly there are leads special conductive leads to these numbers and those leaves right small thin thin thin wires come all the way and touch one of these guys see that same width as you're gonna find on this back daughter board or mainboard however you want to address it so what's really neat is in between those two we have this this is a rubbery type of you know conductive device I'm not quite sure the name of it it's pretty neat though and it relays the contacts from the glass to the actual board so the board comes on and smashes it straight down on it if there is sufficient pressure not on even pressure those contacts I'm not sure if this is coming through those contacts press on here just so and conduct electricity so what can we do to improve this that's the tricky part I don't want to remove this from the glass because I'll probably cause issues with it I can put it back but it might be air pockets and might introduce dust and something's not contacting plus as you can see I may not get it perfectly aligned so what I'm going to do other than just to look at it from this video I'm gonna leave it alone because I suspect that if there's any gaps between the glass and this guy there's nothing much I can do I don't have that process to fix it or add a new one in I'm sure there's possible but I don't want to do that so what I will do though is I'm gonna gently put this back gently clean this off and then we're gonna clean the contacts on the other side apply a little power and then maybe we can add the pressure based on the screws so it's even I get her back all right so I'm gonna reassemble this display gently fit this in here there we go and now we have our display put together in this manner and then I'm gonna grab something I'm not sure what I can I'll grab some alcohol and cotton and gently wipe this up and then I will get some alcohol I don't have really anything abrasive but I'll get some alcohol to clean these up and then we'll apply some pressure and see if that does it for us so give me a moment to grab that and I've got my trusty cotton shirt make sure you don't use cotton swabs or anything of that nature because the cotton particles are so loose they'll just get lodged in here they could wrap on this and pull this rubber thing off and if you do that you might just want to lose it so I'm going to add just a dab of alcohol on this my fingers like this if you ever were in the military and you had to do shoe-shining none of that then you will understand how that is back to the old days and I will just lightly rub the alcohol on here in order to remove any debris any issues at all or any yeah mainly should just be the breeze but if the metal is tarnishing somewhat there might be a little bit of residue on here move that press it down a little bit being very careful not to dis okay and there you go and there's a little bit of dirt most likely coming from what I would think is ten on those contacts so this is done nothing else I can do about it now with this guy gonna do the same thing very very similar grab a new there we go smooth it out get some more isopropyl alcohol now I wouldn't suggest you don't use water because you need something that evaporates quite quickly and will just rub vigorously on these contacts to clean them off and if we've done it right I would suspect that they'll it might even look a little bit shinier all right be careful not to dislodge that crystal or break it all right all right wonderful so I don't see very much residue on here and you may not it seems very very clean this certainly looks nice and clean didn't really look dirty before but it's hard to tell so we've got these contacts nice and clean we didn't use any cotton that comes loose so we are set to put this back together hopefully we can apply even pressure and we're set now we're dealing with very low voltage here so there's no real concern and powering this up so we can do a quick test run and configure it so this clock is working and it's providing juice out here for the display so now we kind of get the display set up all right so being ever so gentle not to break these wires which is a lot easy to do set this here I'm going to marry this as it was and then there are other the camera can pick it up there are other guides so this is not just sitting just within the center of this post there's other guy it's one right here that pokes through and one that's on this and that pokes through see that to assure that this is being aligned properly it's not being skewed as we're lighting it so if we take a look at this very gently you can see sometimes you see something I'm gonna press on it a little bit oh you can't see anything all right so I'm gonna press on that a little bit and you'll see some numbers yeah there you go Sunday and I'll try and press evenly on everything and there we go we see the bottom and we see the top coming so let me get a couple of those installed and then we'll go through the configuration now I mentioned that these screws the way that they were installed was impressively tight and they seemed to not necessarily be the same height these are all the same ah they are not okay so we have two types of screws within this that's interesting we do have two types of screws so if you take a look real closely we have one that is beveled that's over here and then we have this guy here who is not beveled so see if I can figure out which one goes in which area I'm not quite sure hmm I did not pay attention I did not pay attention well I could rewind the video and look at the type of screws however I won't they all looked about the same I just don't tell anyone should be okay you know like this here and I will put start putting some on the other side so we don't warp the board as we are installing this screws then I'm gonna put one more and then we'll take a look and see what we see on the actual image beautiful nice and tight so let's see if we've repaired anything well well well now there is no one here when you power this up it starts at low 3 so let's go to the back press a couple of things how about there set okay let's do 24 hours I'll get that set just 24 so we should do the most illuminating okay 68 without me yeah what's going right through all those numbers fan 268 there's eight we'll just leave it there we'll leave it blinking okay so it appears that it's actually solved so we got to put more screws in because it may be a little bit finicky right temperature change comes about and all of a sudden little contacts don't work anymore right enough space so how to make sure we're putting all of these in and I'm not going to over tighten these but certainly they need to be tight because that board used to be snug against the glass and sandwiched in between that plastic that rubber strap to screw all right so let's put this one here and finally and make sure that snug well put the last one there and keep that snot so it is interesting why they have this design of the different screws it seems kind of bit unnecessary to have two different types of screws but there we are we have ourselves a nice nice clock cool so now we just need to put this back together now how did it go back together don't think I need anything else for that so we're gonna watch those wires and sandwich this end a little bit alright just seeing what screws have fell out I think only this ones that remaining can hear it making noise alright so let's put I'm going to just do a quick spot check so I'll put only about two screws and turn around make sure all the sudden decided to stop working and there we go yeah it's fantastic all right let me put the other ones in we'll run through the test and we're good to go so we saved well I saved but you may save one at home if you have one of these and you want to have a little fun saved ourselves I suppose I don't know 15 20 bucks it's pretty nice clock let's get one more of these these vents on the side are so that the temperature can more easily reach that thermistor that we sought to measure the temperature all right so we didn't lose any screws so we didn't make it any lighter but it is solid Lee belt all right so let's take a look and see what the temperature is reading because I'm not as familiar with Celsius 74 if I take a look at my Galileo says 75 perfect so we're really quite within spec let's run through our numbers all right wonderful oh it's like me when I'm running okay walking up the stairs haha all right so hit this fantastic I don't know 13 and it is a Thursday look at that it's set again what does that do us all right so let's it set one more time 24 is okay what's the time so it's military time now and it's 8 so it's 20 all right so it's set ready to go and this is awesome and I think the last thing that I'm going to do is I don't really use this alarm so there's an alarm function on the back of this that I will shut down all right so tried the batteries suspected it wasn't but want to make sure it's not something that simple and it turned out it was it took it apart clean the contacts truck did not remove that long rubber piece from the screen important not to do that but gently cleaned it off with rubbing alcohol and cotton shirt make sure you do not use a cotton swab the cotton will separate and it gets lodged and into the electronics and the rubber and it's hard to clean so you want to make sure you have something that's not going to so easily break apart like you're on a white undershirt and clean the contacts on the main board again being careful not to wound any circuits and then put it back together make sure we had good pressure on the board and we have ourselves a nice clock thanks for watching you", "2X7lps30L9A": "hello everyone in this video I'm going to show you how to use the good ideas portable washing machine now the instructions that come with this appliance aren't all that clear so hopefully by the end of this video you'll know how to use the machine properly I'll take you through the various stages how to fill the machine how we go about washing rinsing spinning and then finally how to empty the machine so the first thing we need to do after plugging it in of course is to fill it with water this is the fill hose you get supplied with a machine it's not very long and to be honest it's not very strong either but so far it's done the job for me now you get two ends for this this end is designed to fit into your tap and this end is designed to go into this hole that's marked water inlet once you've connected both ends of the fill pipe just turn your tap on and you can start filling your washing machine it's a bit hard to see but this is where the water is actually entering the water and you need to fill the washtub until it's about two-thirds full okay I think about enough water in there now the next thing you do before you add your clothes is to add your detergent you can use any detergent you like in this machine liquid or powder whichever brand it doesn't matter so I've got one capful of my regular non bio liquid detergent that I like to use so Musk and pour it directly into the water before you add the clothes you need to make sure the detergent is thoroughly mixed into the water so just close the lid and turn the machine on using the wash timer button just for a few seconds okay that's enough so everything is thoroughly mixed and it's ready for the clothes the instruction book says that this washing machine will handle 3.5 kilograms of laundry and spin-dry about two kilograms which basically means you could wash 3.5 kilograms but you do need to split the load in two before you rinse and spin but I've actually weighed this out this is approximately 3.5 kilograms of washing and to me it does look too much for this small capacity machine so I'm going to only wash half of this and I suggest that you do the same don't overload the machine you'll get the best results if you put in a bit less than it says and it's easy enough to do two loads and these aren't very heavily soiled items so I can reuse the water ok the waters in the detergent scene and thoroughly mixed into the wash I'm now going to start adding the clothes I find it beneficial to add the laundry to the machine while it's going it's easier to judge then how much more you can put in so I'm just going to turn the timer on and add some of the clothes why that's approximately half the wash load I showed you and to be honest that's all I'm putting in so really I think 3.5 kilograms is a little bit ambitious also when you're watching the load you can tell if you need to add a bit more water and obviously it's starting to struggle now so either you need to take some of the clothes out or add more water and I think I'm going to add some more water to this so I've turned on the tap again and we've got some more water entering the wash tub as the machine is washing okay I think that's about you know water so now let's take you through the controls there are three controls on the top of the machine this one is the wash timer this one is the washer selector and this one is the spin timer the first thing you need to determine is how long you want to wash your laundry for so as a general guide for lightly soiled items or delicates you don't want to be washing much beyond six minutes but if you've got a load of heavily soiled items then possibly fifteen minutes would be the setting to choose or you can choose anything in between for these shirts I think six minutes is more than adequate so that's what I'm going to select for that you've also got two different types of wash action normal or gentle now for these cotton shirts I'm going to use on normal but if you're washing anything more gentle then obviously you'd switch to the gentle cycle and it doesn't a j't eight quite so much obviously also the water temperature is important if you're washing heavily soiled items that need a hotter water then put in hot water but not boiling water you can damage the machine obviously if you're washing more delicate items you need to put in some cold water as well as the hot so basically deceives your common sense as you would anyway the other selection on the wash selector dial is drain and you only need to do that when you're emptying the machine so it's set on normal I'm going to turn the wash time out to six minutes and then basically I can leave the machine until I come to rinse and spin so that's the first load wash now we need to spin it for the first time this on the summit of the machine is the drain hose obviously before you start spinning or emptying the machine you must make sure the bat is either over your sink or in your shower or directed outside depending where using the machine now if you're using it in a standard kitchen unfortunately it really isn't long enough to hook over the sink that's what I found anyway even when the machine is really close to the sink so you might have to empty it into a bucket it is a bit inconvenient but obviously it's better than going to the laundrette but because I'm going to reuse this water I'm actually going to hook the drain hose over the wash tub that way when it spins out the excess water from the clothes I'm going to have all the reused water going back in the tub so I can use it again so here's the spinner and as I said earlier you can only spin dry about half of what you can wash this is the spinner map that you get included you must use that I'll show you that in a minute but first we need to transfer some of the clothes into the spin tub obviously if the water is very hot and you've got some tongs use tongs or brother gloves the water in this laundry isn't very hot so it's ok for me plus I'm using an eco-friendly detergent so I know it's not going to affect my hands as some or harsher detergents could so I'm just turning up the spinner up to the top you don't want to overload it I think I can get maybe one more shirt in there it does tangle the clothes a bit so you don't have to untangle the clothes from each other skip that wait there we go that's about full now just press it down I could have to push get another t-shirt in there but nothing that's enough then you need to put the spinner mat on top of your laundry again press it down close the inner lid and then close the outer lid and I'm going to spin this for about two minutes obviously make sure that your drain hose is hooked properly over I I always do this you can close the lid over it now that holds it into place so I just got to spin it for two minutes now okay so it stopped spinning now the machine will continue to spin until you open the lid and then it will automatically stop that's a double safety feature and of course you can remove the laundry now I've just done the initial spin obviously you haven't rinsed yet but it's got the majority of the soapy water out of the clothes and you'll get a better rinsing result if you do spin them before you start to wince now before I rinse I'm just going to reposition the clothes in the top just loosen them up a bit and now I'll show you how to rinse the clothes you'll notice is another water inlet just over the spinner so that's where you need to connect your fill hose but this time we don't to be adding hot water we want to be adding cold water or warm water to the roots tub so again connect one end of the hose to the tap and one end of the hose to the water inlet and then switch the tap on if I lift the lid of the spin tub you'll be able to see where the water is actually entering the spinner so as you can see it's saturating the washer now with clean water helping to rinse out any detergent residue again you need to pop up and spin a mat back on top before you start to spin now you can start spinning while the malt is actually going into the machine which is what I tend to do at first then I turn the water off and allow the machine to spin out all the excess water before I start spinning I need to take out the drain hose from the wash tub because I obviously don't want the cold water going in here we need to drain out the cold water so if it will hook over your sink cook it over your sink or wherever you can find a suitable place for it to drain right that's the first rinse and spin done and again the clothes are damp dry depending on how much you want to rinse the garments if you've got allergies you may want to rinse it even more to get the detergent out I'm obviously going to do at least one more rinse so I'm just going to pop the clothes back in and add some more cold water again when the clothes are fully saturated turn the attack off and then you can do another spin or I think for about three minutes so that's the second spin completed one tip if the machine vibrates too much you need to reposition the clothes in the spinner it should be more or less rock steady like you've seen it here if it's not jiggling about it means that the load isn't distributed evenly so you just need to readjust the load or add some more clothes it doesn't cope well with an unbalanced load so if you just say a washing one bath mat it's not a good idea you do need to more or less fill the capacity of the spinner but anyway I think I can't release Melanie detergent residue on that I think for me to rinses and spins is more than enough now if you want to add fabric softener as many people do you can but it is a bit more tricky now you can do either one of two ways as you're filling the spinner with the water as the water's coming out of this jet here you can pour some fabric softener in the stream of the water and that way you'll get the fabric softener distributed into the load a better way is once you've finished your washing empty your wash tab fill it with cold water then a cap full of your fabric softener then put your load back in put it on for a couple of minutes and then just spin it you don't need to rinse it again obviously then you just put them back in the spinner spin it and then that's your washing done but there we go it's they're pretty dry the clothes that come out maybe not as dry as say full-size automatic but certainly far drier than you could get them by hand trying to wring them out and believe you me when my washing machine broke down I was trying to wash everything by hand easy enough to wash things but how do you drive them it was an absolute nightmare so there we go I've washed that and rinsed it and spun it obviously it's not the full load I put it into the washing machine I can put those to one side they're done they can be hung out to dry so you just repeat the process the best of the washing will now go in the spinner put everything out press it down pop on the spinner late and spin a cap and then get an initial spin and then of course add your rinse water when you finish your washing you obviously need to empty out the wash tub now this does look a funny color I think some of the dye in one of the t-shirts has bled a bit it's not affected the rest of the laundry which is why it looks a little bit too red all you need to do to empty the tab you of course you need to direct the drain hose over your sink or outside or going into your shower wherever you've got the machine and you need to turn the wash selector to drain right so that's the wash tab all emptied now when I suggest you do before putting the Machine away it's just swirl round some clean water all around the wash tub give it a bit of a rinse and then switch to drain again to make sure that water is drained out and then give the tub a bit of a dry out or so you can dry the spinner just give the Machine a wipe out don't leave it like this when you put it away and then it's fresh for next time that concludes my demonstration of the good ideas twin tub washing machine if you have any questions please ask them in the comment section you'll also find below the video a link to another video I made of this machine a few months ago that goes into a little bit more detail but it does it does go on for a long time so I thought I'd do a quicker video for anyone you just want you to know how to use this machine", "-6ZJhE-kmiY": "[Music] what's up guys it's Koide from gentlemen but then a channel dedicated to helping men dress better and feel their best and in this video we're talking the best white t-shirts for men stay tuned in this best white t-shirts battle I'm gonna be showing you how the shirts wear and fit on my body in addition to design shirt sizing thickness and more as always if you want more details on the shirts you can head on over to my blog I'm gonna link that down below first up is the brand ask it now they offer minimalist basics ferment and so their shirts are made in Portugal and they offer three different sizes and so they have short regular and tall extra small all the way to double XL and so this is great for shorter guys like myself and so I got this short and so let's talk about the fit now putting the shirt fits are really well it's perfect on the sleeves it ends right where the shoulder bone is and it hugs the bicep nicely it's not too tight not too loose and even through the body if there's some room here to breathe but at the same time its fitted and I'd say the short length is pretty on point ending around a little bit above mid crotch so I'm really impressed with the fit of the shirt from ask it and the quality is really nice too it's 100% Egyptian cotton and so it feels really soft but there's a little bit of a thickness as well and so I believe it is 180 grams and then they offer a lightweight version which is around 120 grams the regular t-shirts come in at $45 which is quite pricey for a t-shirt it's more expensive than all the other brands on this list but sometimes you pay a little bit of a premium for high quality products in terms of quality and fit I've got to say the ass t-shirt is quite flawless and I love the ribbed neckline as well it's not too tight around the neck not too loose it's just perfect and so the asket shirt gets a high grade second up is Yoona clothes supima cotton t-shirts and so you close got a reputation for having a really nice quality best bang for your buck t-shirt out there and so I have this white shirt I have two grey shirts and a navy shirt from Uniqlo and they are just great t-shirts for everyday wear and they last for a really long time so I've been wearing my Uniqlo shirts for quite a while now at the white shirt here it is the neck and so the neckline is nice and I feel like it's the perfect neckline is not too tight not too loose the sleeves are also good where they end around mid bicep not too tight not too loose again to the body same thing so similar to ask it in the previous round it pretty much fits the same except it's a lot cheaper and so does that cause come with the price well I mean you know clothes supima cotton tees come in at under $10 at 990 and for me I've had this shirt for quite a while now maybe two three years has gone through a lot of washes and dry cycles for the most part I like to wash and then here dry my shirts and so that's just what helps it to last longer in terms of weight it's a little bit of a mid weight it's not thick it's not as thick as the asket shirt and it's not all that thin either but for a clean and classic aesthetic Uniqlo shirts fit really well for me I'm a shorter guy and around five six and I feel like the fit is pretty long point and so can't go wrong with a you know clothes - pima cotton tees I've done a previous video on the best fitting t-shirts and Uniqlo is also included in that and so I think really highly of the unit clothes - pima cotton tees there's no secret all right next up is banana republics authentic 100% supima cotton t-shirts and so just like the other brands on the list Banana Republic has their own supima cotton tees it's cool about PR is that they offer a tall length so if you're a taller guy they got you covered and this is their regular length which fits me really well it's just on your mid fly it's a little bit longer than a skit and yoonah Club but it's still a proper length in terms of the fit it's a little looser than the other brands just a little bit though it's not loose to the point where it looks too sloppy and so also the sleeves are a little bit looser as well and so you can actually cuff them up if you want them to be a little bit tighter to wrap around the bicep even without cuffing it still looks good I personally do like the looser fitting aesthetic especially as in the warmer months sometimes you don't want your shirt to be like skin-tight sticking to your body and so the looser aesthetic is nice in terms of the thickness of the shirt it's about the same as a skit and so it's a little bit thicker and it feels good the neckline like Uniqlo and ask it is good it fits perfectly around the neck their shirts are made in Jordan and I gotta say the quality is quite nice I have another Navy a v-neck from Banana Republic it's held up really well through many washes and so feel be our t-shirts are quite reliable and a good value they're around twenty six fifty regular price but often times you can find them on sale for forty to fifty percent and so at that price it's just above Uniqlo and a killer deal next up we got another mall brand and this one is Express and so their shirts are a little bit tighter than all the other shirts they're pretty skin tight it fits more like an undershirt the shirt is there slim cotton shirts they also have a flex stretched shirt which is even a little bit more tightness but in terms of the fit fits really well around the neck and around the biceps it really hugs your bicep and it follows up our ground mid bicep which is good a good length the length of the shirt is a little bit longer than all the other shirts it's a little bit too long for my liking so if you're a skinnier guy and that's a little bit taller Express slim shirts are perfect for you as for me if I really want to show off any type of games that I have then I'll be rocking this shirt because it's really form-fitting on your body price comes in around twenty six fifty and oftentimes you can get them on sale for 40 to 50 percent off just like Banana Republic as for the weight of the shirt it's pretty thin it's thinner than most of the other shirts on this list but it's definitely super soft and pretty lightweight and so a great value again if you're a taller skinnier guy next up we got mutton bow not a mall brand but an online brand their shirts are made in Peru and similar to a skate it's got this rhythm neckline that's a little bit thinner and as for the weight it's a little bit thin but it's I think it's wonderful for tee grams which is somewhere between a skits regular t-shirt and their thin t-shirt and so it's a nice weight it's on the thinner side but not quite as thin as the Express from the previous round the shirt runs a little bit long it's a little bit long on my frame but if you're a little bit taller every guy maybe five eight five ten it's gonna fit you perfectly as for the sleeves it's a little bit looser but I kind of like this looser aesthetic of the fit of this shirt I think overall it fits quite well and it comes in at thirty dollars which is fifteen cheaper than a skit and it's about around the same price as banana and Express and this other brands and then you know you know clothes of course the cheapest I do like the fit and feel of the shirt it's a little bit long for my liking but overall it's a good fit that's certainly not least we have the brand Laurel and birch they are a new brand just came out recently shirt is made out of 100% Peruvian pima cotton it's a hundred sixty-five it grams and so it's not lightweight and it's not super thick it's somewhere in between a skits regular t-shirt and their light weight shirt in terms of the fit it fits well through the body it's got a nice looseness to it but not loose sloppy the sleeves hit perfectly around mid bicep it's a little bit wider than some of the other shirts in terms of the length it's also a little bit longer and so it's a little bit better of a fit for taller cuts the neckline fits really well it's the perfect neckline just like all the other shirts and this around up then there's a little detail down here at the bottom which is the Laurel and Burch logo since they're a new brand they offer four different versatile colorways white gray navy and black and then they only have sizes small through extra-large and so there's no extra small or you know smaller or shorter guys but I'd say the small does fit pretty well but an extra small will probably fit me better now I've got another video for you right here if you want to take a look at some other best fitting t-shirts alright it's all I got for this video if you liked it please give it a thumbs up if you are new here please consider subscribing I put out new videos like this weekly that's all I got for this video cheers to your style and I will catch you on the next one peace", "EeAWjlOIA-M": "that I just spent $400 to find the perfect white t-shirt for you I did what's up guys my name is Marcel welcome to my youtube channel one dapper Street today is gonna be all about the white t-shirt a lot of you guys have shown interest in white t-shirts and I went out and found 12 of the best white t-shirts that I could find not all of them look the same there's differences there's small differences but there is differences and we're gonna take a look at those we're gonna talk about price we're gonna talk about fabric we're gonna talk about fit some of us like color differences in the whites and lastly about the styling of the shirts everything except for this one right here is available online all the links are down below for you guys to shop so I hope I can help you guys find the perfect white t-shirt for your style today the t-shirt that I want to start with is the one I'm wearing right now and it's from a brand that I believe is a fan favorite when it comes to white simple t-shirts and that's Uniqlo this is their dry packaged t-shirt for five dollars and ninety cents I honestly love this it's a really great fit nice and slim and even throughout the sleeves they just hug the arms nicely there's no excess fabric it or not standing off it's honestly an incredibly versatile t-shirt that we're starting with you're gonna see the other ones are a little bit more specific when it comes to the styling this doesn't have any particular styling there's no pocket no special seams no nothing straightforward it's a little tiny bit see-through it's a 2 to 1 cotton to polyester mix while pullies not considered one of the most high-end fabrics this is where you get your low price point and it really still feels comfortable I actually prefer this over the regular supima cotton t-shirt at unique Ledet I think a lot of you guys love I think this is more affordable for one and it fits better and feels better in my opinion let's put it to a quick test and see how easily it wrinkles if I do something like this right now we have some wrinkles but if you kind of just shake it up it works really well which is something I am looking for in a white t-shirt because I want to be able to like sit down and Ike not have to worry that it's gonna be super wrinkled because the fabric is a little bit too stiff but this I think is already in terms of versatility really really far ahead just because of the styling the quality of the field and cost so a great start with the first one but let's shake out number two this t-shirt that I'm wearing right here it's from H&M cost me $9.99 and it's from their divided collection the divided collection is the one that's a little bit on the lower end of the hmm quality but I personally really like this we're gonna start talking about the styling with this one because it is a little bit more special than the first one we have a pocket on the left chest and then the sleeves are actually rolled up and stitched up which is look I really like I don't have to worry about ruling them up I don't have to worry about making it look clean or making sure that they stay up so that for me is a big big thing the fabric itself has a little bit of a pattern to it so you see like a little bit of a stripe like a Marling I like that it is definitely a more particular look so this shirt is a little bit less versatile I think then the first one from Uniqlo that we looked at but if your style is a little bit more casual and you're planning on wearing this with a bomber jacket or a leather jacket then I think this might be a great way to go it feels really nice it's a little bit more breathable than the first one and nice and stretchy the fit just like the first one is awesome it's a little bit longer than the first t-shirt we looked at also playing back into that casual vibe but overall for me this is another great option but you see that there's just different t-shirts that might work for you better and that's the point of today's video so I'm excited to show you the rest of it t-shirt number three and back to Uniqlo I was throwing a little bit of shade on that supima cotton t-shirt the regular supima cotton t-shirt that is but this is a pima cotton t-shirt from their unique lo u collection back selection plays a little bit more with silhouettes and there's a little bit more fashion forward rather than your basic basics so this fabric is a little bit of a stiffer feel to it which makes for a nice and clean look but it's a little bit rougher against the skin I personally don't mind it or having that added hmmm I don't know ruggedness of the t-shirt the cost is $14.90 which i think is reasonable for a high quality t-shirts the pima cotton is amongst the best cob and you can get and the fit like I said is a little bit more boxy a little bit less slim you see that the sleeves are a little bit more roomy first Uniqlo or ii am sure that we had looked at which is fine because this fabric is stiff i won't have any trouble rolling up the sleeves and actually not having to worry that they stay up there because it's a little bit stiff and it keeps up nicely I actually have this t-shirt in my closet and I love it I wear it a whole lot and I think from a versatility standpoint it works just as well as the first one there's a little bit more fabric and it feels a little bit more rougher which is great for those days with maybe just a little bit colder outside so you actually get a little bit more warmth from this the color feels a tiny bit more natural so not like a bright white but a little bit more relaxed which actually makes it a little bit more versatile in my opinion easier to combine with other pieces the fourth t-shirts were back at H&M at a price point of $14.99 this t-shirt has a lot more surface interest it's a little bit like a sweater I believe this is called a pique knit I don't know don't quote me on that I did go to fashion school but it's been a while I like this it's definitely more of a choice it's not as easy a white t-shirt to just wear with everything this to me feels a little bit more elegant just because of the structure of it overall the fit is a little bit more roomy for me personally for this fabric I wish it was a little bit more slim more like a polo shirt but without the collar the sleeves feel nice against the skin it feels okay it's a little bit rough I would prefer to go if I'm going for a rougher t-shirt I prefer to go for the Uniqlo you honestly but I want to show you guys this so you also know that if you are into things that are a little bit more special and a little bit more elaborate you can also get a white t-shirt that is more interesting than just a white t-shirt and that's what I wanted to include this guy today from H&M s collection wait I keep forgetting about the wrinkle thing so let me wrinkle this up really quick ooh that's that's looking deep deep wrinkle it's a fairly structured shirt so that will happen so this is not ideal like it might wear out a little bit but even then you see that the fabric is a little stretched out and let's do the same thing to the Uniqlo shirt from before not too bad you see a little bit of it but it's better it's very better I think than this white t-shirt right here moving away from HTM and unique little we're at Urban Outfitters now where you have this t-shirt for $29 this is what we're having a big difference in the styling of the t-shirt it's a long line t-shirt with an asymmetrical hemline which means that it's longer in the front than it is on the sides that is a very particular look if you're into that that's awesome I think underneath the hoodie I always like this look because it Peaks out and makes it a lot more interesting that's why I like long line t-shirts in general the feel of it is nice the quality doesn't feel super-high I feel like the I feel that seams on the shoulder rubbing just a little bit and for me the one thing with these t-shirts has always been that the sleeves I don't love the way they look they're just a little short and the fit doesn't particularly work for me I usually have to end up rolling them up a tiny bit and then it works better but this for me I like these t-shirts for particular looks but it's not super versatile in my opinion even the neck is a little bit more of a scoop neck so you're showing a little bit more you guys know urban outfitters and you know the vibe they're going for so this is their in-house line which is obviously reflective of what the brand's aesthetic is so this is just a little bit more casual and a little bit more extreme wrinkle test [Music] yeah not that great I think it again it feels like the fabric stretched out a little bit you barely see the fabric but like from my point of view you see a little bit of like the stretch off fabric which makes sense because there's a lot of stretch in here and like I said the quality doesn't feel that crazy high so that makes sense to me next up we're back at H&M but this time we're looking at H&M edition one of their higher and collections and this is an entirely linen made shirt which I really like what that means it's gonna be a little bit more see-through because it's linen has a little bit of a rough feel against the skin but like the good kind of rough feel that you'd expect from linen that might sound a little weird but you know there's differences in linen and sometimes it feels comfortable just like you feel it a little and sometimes you're just scratching your skin this does not it feels nice the fit is somewhat relaxed but this is a relaxed t-shirt I think for the summer this is amazing something for the beach and more beachy look something more relaxed for your everyday usage obviously it might not be ideal since it's not cotton and cotton is one of the best fabrics for like everyday wear the color of it is also just a little bit more natural because you'll often find that with linen fabrics you don't get that clean white which i think is beneficial it just works with the more natural look of linen and usually we know Lynn and wrinkles pretty badly so yeah you can kind of still see it it's not it's not ideal but for a linen t-shirt it actually works out pretty well so that's oh very out there option I think this is the most out-there option that we have in terms of fabric today while looking at these 12 teachers almost halfway through but stick with me because I went in the stores and tried all of these shirts on for you so you don't have to all you have to do is watch this video seventh tee shirt is from Topman but not from the top man brand it's actually someone rents that they stock that's a European brand called selected home and ironically it says on the back of this t-shirt the perfect tee you know what in my opinion like I'm giving away a little bit of like the rest of the video in my opinion this this really could be when it comes to straight-up versatility it's 100% cotton t-shirt price at $35 we're getting into like a steeper price range but this is where you really want to look out for quality so you can justify spending that much money on a t-shirt it needs to hold up over a while and it needs to feel great and this feels great the fit is phenomenal the shoulders are hitting for me exactly where they're supposed to we once again have the nice and slim arms and a nice slim fit throughout the body the fabric is just a tiny bit see-through but it feels amazing it's just a very it's not a clinical white it's just a tiny bit off but it feels phenomenal and this is I think to me the most versatile t-shirt that I've had on so far I've probably also will have on it is very close to the Uniqlo t-shirt the very first one and that's a $30 price difference so depending on your budget I say you could probably go for this because there's not a big difference but I really really like the small tiny little differences in this one for me personally last thing wrinkle test at this point I don't even know anymore I feel like you've looked at so many wrinkles what do you guys think all right I can still see it a little bit just imagining if I was sitting in a car driving for a little bit it's not that bad obviously what I'm doing with them with my hands is also pretty extreme but I feel like it'll bias not because I like the shirts I'm trying to say it's not wrinkling that bad now we're moving into the $45 price range and we're inside of cos stores at that price point you're going to want to see something that's special about the t-shirt that justifies that extra money going towards a simple basic t-shirt in this case it's a cotton t-shirt 100% so the fabric is not what makes it special but costs it's focused on basics but then it's taking a little bit more of a contemporary spin on them so in this case we have heat bonded sleeves and a heat bonded hem which take away two seam that's one thing that you're gonna notice but also because it's double layer you see like a little white blocking around here and around here which is a cool little feature if that's something you're into another thing it allows for is rolling the sleeves up really nice and neat because there's a certain structure to that heat bonding that allows for that to look clean the fit is a little bit more boxy again in line with that contemporary vibe that cost stores has going on I personally don't think it's gonna be one of my favorites just because $45 is pretty steep and the versatility with this is a little bit limited in my opinion the feel is interesting like the cotton feels a little bit more dry than the other ones which is not necessarily a great thing our last thing I feel like that's worse than some of what we see isn't it maybe it's just because the rest of the fabric looks super clean so when it is steamed or ironed it looks great but the wrinkling I'm not personally super convinced about just because it stands out against the other cleaner parts of the t-shirt but I have one more from cause that I want to show you guys right now and this is it it's also $45 and it's also 100% cotton but with this one you can probably easily detect that it's all about the fit so looking for the perfect white sheet this one is for you if you're into a larger silhouette if you like oversized things and if you like a little bit more of a non-classical so hood a modern silhouette that sounds way better than non-classical we got really nice and roomy sleeves and obviously a roomy body as well the length is not as long as I thought it may be for something that's literally denoted as oversized or I think it's called the long t-shirt on the cost website but the quality of the cotton feels great it's heavier than the first one that I showed you guys and very similar to the unique loss of pima cotton t-shirt and last thing with this one yeah similar judgment as with the last one I think the rest of the shirt looks so clean when it's properly aren't that this will kind of stand out once again a little summary for me it might not be my everyday t-shirt but for you it might be if your style is a little bit more relaxed three more to go on the next two are gonna be from all stains both of them priced at $60 this shirt is surprisingly similar to the shirt that we just saw from costs the color of the white is a little bit more natural which I once again think makes a little bit more wearable the silhouette is a little bit less extreme as the cost one I think this is easier to pull off than the one I was wearing just before is it worth fifteen dollars more I don't necessarily think so if it's right up your alley and great for you then that's awesome but I wanted to include it because I do like it I do like the roominess of it I do mess with the fit like I I think it's fun when you have a little bit more fabric you can also have more fun with the styling and I'm about to release a video coming up really soon styling a white t-shirt we're gonna focus on a simple one but if you guys need some outfit ideas for white t-shirts I got you covered it's coming up really soon after you find your perfect one I'll teach you how to style it as well but again back to this t-shirt I like it it's also not the one I would go for if I'm going for versatility for my personal style before we take a bite of this one first pretty well on the wrinkle test the fabric does feel nice against the skin it's a little dry but comfortably so it's fine by me let's take a look at the other All Saints t-shirt and this one to me is a lot more classic All Saints it's slimmer a little bit elongated nice and slim sleeves we got a slim neckline and I've seen a lot of people with the alsace t-shirt with the logo on it I like that they also have a clean version I don't like any logos on line t-shirts personally it's just a preference but the fabric is super soft it feels great it's a little bit more see-through which also goes back to that All Saint's aesthetic of being a little bit more rugged and rock and roll I think like it just works great under a suede trucker jacket or suede biker jacket I think that we or a biker jacket can also be leather this is all surprised at $60 and like I said $60 we're like in a price range that for a white t-shirt really needs to be worth it if it's you're selling you are a little bit more rugged and you can't swing it because you love All Saints brand then that's great otherwise I think we have a couple options in here that I might opt for before I spend $60 on an All Saints shirt finishing up with a big note on comfort that's what you're paying $69.95 for with this Tommy Bahama t-shirt I walked into that store because I had a Tommy Bahama t-shirt in my closet that I loved I was trying to find it if it's still available but I found this instead and this is the only t-shirt I would actually prefer to have a size smaller than because it's just too roomy I decided to include it anyway because you have no idea how good I feel right now in this t-shirt it's ridiculously light it has a cooling technology in it it's a mix of 42% pima cotton 25% Modell 25 percent poly and then 5% spandex spandex just means it does this and it feels amazing now the the size medium can definitely work support some more grungy or street wear looks because it's definitely oversized the like you can tuck it in a little bit but I would for this t-shirt go for its size small that's really where you guys have the choice to make whether you want to spend $70 on a t-shirt because it's amazingly comfortable and it might keep you cool also I again I bought this yesterday I don't know how cooling technology works in this t-shirt that they apply to the fabric but I'm excited to put it to a test and even for a beachy t-shirt like it's almost like an active wear t-shirt a little bit in terms of the styling the shoulder seam is just dropped about an inch board so you see it a little bit more prominently also adding to that more active wear aesthetic and then we have these little finishes on the side of the seam which I honestly could do without not gonna lie to you but I wanted to show you guys this because it's just it feels amazing so great wrinkle test with this yeah that's what I figured with this fabric you can almost not even see that I just wrinkled it which is amazing so this is definitely about comfort a great teacher to be traveling in a great teacher to just be hanging out and if you're you know worried about feeling phenomenal and that's it man that was a mouthful just talking about white t-shirts for I don't know how long this video is by now but I hope you appreciate the effort that I put in for you guys I went through all the stores and tried all those shirts out so you don't have to and I hope you found whatever is perfect for you like I said all the links are down below for you guys to shop let me know in the comments section

bought from Coco twins are you gonna do the heat press put your paper transfer tape I think that's it alright let's get started I'll go ahead and go to design that's Cricut I'll try to get some to look at while I talk that's quick website to show you two new little mini aren't they have which i think is gonna waste some money well it might be good for um hats I think that'd be a good but I'm

go ahead and push these I new project okay all right be not my project I'm already have the item that I want to I already have the image that I want to use let me go back to my projects click on that and I already got it I didn't do anything to it I just uploaded it some go here to push customize like I said own thing only step I'm missing is when you go to basically upload and you go into your files and define your own SVG or PNG whatever you want to use and I have another video on that also how to upload PNG is how to change your colors SVG's and videos are all that so I'm not gonna go below okay I have this beautiful woman right here I love her I love her and you reach my chose reason why I purchased this SVG is because of the colors except the mission it's all about the colors to me well it's also because sublimation when you really can't feel it and your shirt so I love that because if I know you can feel it but something mission you can't feel it so I really love some elimination because of two things you can't feeling on your shirt you don't feel like anything else and then plus the colors are so vibrant so when I seen this on Coco twin attack comics I have I gotta have her I gotta have her the colors are vibrant they're pretty this colorful and I've been doing lot of sublimation not my civilization being really like black and white and a few colors I want to show my colors out on my cell emission printer that's why I purchased I'm gonna put her on everything I'm gonna do this shirt today I'm gonna do another video of me putting her on a mug yeah she's gonna be on everything I'm thinking about putting her in the bag too she's beautiful I love the colors I need to find more color more images with colors like this they have a lot of cartoon colors a lot of cartoon characters with a lot of colors but I love to find my african-american women with different colors and I can change the colors on this SVG you could change colors like I said I have a video that shows you how to change the colors of SVG's so I'm not gonna do all that today I don't think I'm gonna do today is size this up and put on the show you got to put on the shirt okay first of all let's go ahead and do this the sighs wood creaking to cut and print which is caught we have to do a cut print for sublimation with Cricut so we have to go by the size and the size is just 0.75 by 9 okay I'm gonna do 6.75 go ahead and go across like this right here 6.75 go over okay that's the picture right there i know ii said i just don't like i hate that I have to cook with um that side I wish I could do a bigger footprint could but I'm still trying to figure out how to um I can do it you can't print bigger on um silhouette but I don't have a cutter to cut my glitter bigger you know I'm saying so I have to do this size because my glitter has to be good okay on my Cricut so yes that's it like you say you if you want that you can't print this bigger if you're just doing to the mission but since I'm using glitter I might just use that size right now until I figure it up to figure out the other ways of doing it then put the words I'm going to make it bigger I'm gonna make the words vital okay this is my shirt since my own pictures that I'm gonna make my words I'll stay in my picture so I can have some my picture so my shirt can be evened out let's see okay everything said now I have the UM the width six point seven to seven and then um the height is seven point seven three eight I like the way cuz if I go any I could go down to nine but it's gonna it's not gonna look right so I like the way it look like like that then I have her on the words this is gonna be my no on black and this is gonna be glitter one black okay so I need to do is go here so I got my size everything together I need to go ahead and duplicate her make sure you have everything situated before you duplicate it cuz you do not want to change you okay so now this is a cutting print files I got a highlighting right here it says cut and print okay and then this one also says cut and print but I do not want this to be a cut and print I want this to be a cuts okay just so right here it's flattening and you sit down here she's flattened and she's ready to get cut pretty cooked just right here now I'm siding her and I'm going to go ahead and go to see it's print right there I'm gonna no field I'm go ahead and wheeled her see how that was just the UM cooked so it's gonna cut around her butter arrange and sent to the front so you can see just what I'm gonna do when I know my shirt this is how it's gonna be okay cannot sub on 100% cotton or dark colors unless you put it on vinyl first on white glitter vinyl okay I tried to so I tried to do the super fine it was a little bit too dark so just keep it with the white vinyl the white glitter vinyl okay look at like I said before this is gonna be my white glitter I'm it's red but it's this color I wanted to do it you want me to put it white I can put it right someone be confusing imma go ahead and change the color up here to make it white okay okay but this doesn't matter because I'm whatever vinyl I put in my cutter that's what's gonna cut out okay for all you're a newbie still all the ones that you know just started couldn't using the cookie get kind of confusing so now that you see over here you have the cutting print for her and you have this is um welded and she's flattened you have to flatten it to cut and print or to something mate you hit the flattener okay so now I'm gonna work with this down here this is just a cut so you see this this um go here so make sure that this is ready it should be welded and it's just a it's a cut so let's go ahead and see um this is this was already image so it's not words that I made this was a SVG already so it's not really ready to cut okay let's go ahead him to make it as you see right here she's on a white sheet of paper because this is going to be sublimation printer I have two printers you can use both print you can use the same printer for each you gotta have one sublimation printer if he does information you have to have a regular printer if you do a regular cut and print okay we're just gonna be sent to my sublimation printer and then you see this mat this is gonna be cut on my silver glitter I think this is gonna be cut when you know what I changed this to white I'm gonna change this to white because I'm going to be using um black shirts when you go ahead and cancel that and go back and change this so even though I could have left it black cos might like I said doesn't matter but I won't let you so you won't be confused I'm gonna change this to white I'm thinking about putting your own white glitter also okay cuz I'm using a black shirt okay go back to this okay so everything set this is one to my printer this is going to not both of these are going to my cutter and they're sitting on the same mat so I'm gonna worry about having two different mats with these to make sure it even so I won't um it's good over since we want I can say be some vinyl cuz Rhino ain't cheap y'all I know is not cheap okay so you have to mirror because you're putting this on heat you have to mirror both of them so it's clear to mirrored this cuz you're something mating and this is on heat two side mirror that also okay all righty so let me go ahead and get my sublimation everything printed out and I'll be back okay I just want to show you something real quick I got my image RVD cut up I mean print it out from my printer from my own sublimation printer and then I'm gonna show you this when you put down the UM vinyl the glitter bottom make sure you put the shiny side down on the mat okay I'm gonna show you how to yard first so y'all know make sure you put it the shiny side down on the mat make sure it's straight make sure you have a nice sticky mat so will not be moving by from the printer I want to show you that real quick okay and then why this is cutting my to me just cutting their words and then the body parts of the mayor the bottom layer of her I'm gonna go ahead and cut her out besties I'm gonna take this to the printer also I had the printer cut this out also okay and these black registration marks is what keeps the UM Cricut let you know how to print it out so let me go ahead and show you this real quick I already sent it to the printer and I was talking to send it to the cutters it actually where you want to send it to and they already noticed it right here number one it says it's already been printed okay so now it's time to cut it and I'm going to go ahead and send it with paper instead of cardstock I'm gonna put use paper okay and there's a paper I just basically took mine went to my finger and I turned my knife to paper okay so now you know the sitting thinking that that I put loaded into the mat after I put the paper on the mat downloaded then it's gonna cut it out alrighty there she is I got her on a mat this mat ought to be that sticky cuz you know with the paper tears really stands we're gonna show you all the process so you can know how to do it I was gonna skip these process and just go straight through it but I'm gonna show it to you because I already have this process already done I'm one of my printing cut videos but I'm go ahead and go through it again okay I put it on this kind of say I put on paper settings the arrows going because they're telling me go ahead and push the arrow catch they don't push the button [Music] it's so busy you think I'm doing a pretty cook but I'm not well I am but I'm gonna be doing some of the mission also okay so are you thinking this is a prank oh okay now I get the image out of the UM cutter it's cut and it's the same way deal stickers and everything else to cut and print okay that's it out now I'm going to discov I know it's the second step you have to do okay so I make sure this is on a mat upside down like I said it's shiny side down I'm good to my computer okay so now that we've done this already which is it's done today check your stance it's completed it's print and cut so now we got to go down to here to the cut and I gotta change my settings back over to vinyl you know what this is winter vinyl so make sure you change it to glitter vinyl so that's custom because it is tougher you need to get a tougher cut with vinyl okay and I have my I have my binary little already favorite some way to push glitter okay then I'm gonna go ahead and push the button and it's ready to cook and I was always home I met it to give it a little tug so after that now I gotta push the see here like to see my computer southern is dead is cutting and I back at this when this pretty everything cook I just have to read everything I'll show you that real quick to already have a video on how the weed I'm go ahead and show you again so you can all see you just be one quick process for you I'm gonna take my little scraper thing and just trying to pull on the paper pull it up okay now you just go ahead and poke around a picture how about I do it this way better huh hold it down with the best way you can I really want to test the ink on the other side and they put it would be much more vibrant when we um to be sublimated okay a little earring out of here so now I'm just gonna cut around the image stuff to stay with with my nose I can okay and I'm also gonna separate the image from the words okay okay so let's go ahead and read out this glitter Whedon glitter is not too hard so let me go ahead and do this with y'all to see me do it you can't see the camera because it's white for the best way to read glitter it's a good go from the back of course just pour a little part closer to the ears and just pour it all around it you can certainly be tough with glitter cuz it's so deep you keep on pulling that pieces of it all I like it I like this image because it's not too many cuts in it it's just not a round surface but it's not too many you know cut better to do this when you trying to even it up on the arm Matt it's gonna be better to do it this way let me go here to lead out my words my phrase around it just start from the corner get your little piece wrap it and put yankees you can be able just tear it off okay you said your perfect setup is he ever seen the camera with a pen john wetton is by now but I'll try to make sure I see the full effect in the camera so sorry about that okay and I go down and I'm gonna go ahead and see some spots again take over here the little letters and Gert y'all I was right on the money I almost thought I had to cut these this bird over again but I didn't make sure you have enough I know very sticky in here don't thing I don't like about I'm simply made known by no because you can feel it you can feel the vinyl on the bottom on the back of the arm sublimation it's like a patch patchy feeling like a vinyl of course regular glitter vinyl and some permission is just so much is so soft and you'll have to worry about me feeling anything but guess what you got a do if you want to do it on dark colors and tighten tighter percent cotton shirts you have to do it like this you

time to start getting some basic tees in place for the warmer weather you probably all know by now that uniqlo is my go-to when it comes to affordable basics what you get for the price is unbeatable in my opinion so for this week's video i decided to pick up the most popular and most talked about t-shirts i'm gonna try them on and talk about what i like about each one and what i don't like about each one i'm six foot and about 73 kilograms and i picked all of the t-shirts up in a size medium which is my true size i'll let you know which one's my favorite and which ones i don't like so much at the end of the video i've also measured each of the t-shirts just to give you more accurate information on how they differ in size but anyway without wasting any more time let's get straight into the first t-shirt so the first t-shirt that i've got is the crewneck supima cotton tee in white the first thing that i noticed is the color seems to be a bit more of an off-white than a pure white which i happen to like but it may not be what you want when ordering a white tee the quality feels lovely and the tea is so soft just what you'd expect from cp mccotton this tea comes in at 27.5 inches long a width of 20 inches from pit to pit and a sleeve length of 9 inches so let's have a look at how the tee fits the first thing that i noticed is the neck opening is a lot wider than i was expecting apparently they've updated this tee to have a slightly more relaxed fit so that's probably why i usually like a tight-fitting neck with my tees but i actually don't mind the wider neck here and i think it will look decent underneath an open shirt or a jacket this tee in the white is also slightly see-through not enough to the point where i wouldn't wear it but it may be for you if you don't like this then maybe opt for a darker color in this tee all in all it feels beautiful the quality is there but for me the fit is a little off i think i could have probably sized up with this tee for a more relaxed look but i'd still wear it as it is the next t-shirt we've got is the airism oversized u-range tee in black this is a very soft feeling tee and actually a bit thicker than i was expecting the quality feels really nice and i already know this is going to be comfortable this tee is made from 53 cotton 30 polyester and 17 elasto multiester this t-shirt comes in at 12 pound 90 and i think that's a very decent price for this tee this team measures 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of 10.5 inches the tee is so soft and it has a decent weight to it this one may be even more comfortable than the supima cotton t2 the quality feels great and this tee fits me really well for an oversized tee the sleeve length and the body length ratio is perfect for me sometimes tees can have massive sleeves and then too much of a crop in the body which some people do prefer but for me this is the perfect balance for an oversized tee the neckline is really soft just like the rest of the tee and it fits snug to my neck this tea also has a drop shoulder for an even more relaxed look and i really like this feature on this tee all in all i'm really impressed with this t-shirt and for the price you may not find anything better for an oversized tee however we do have another oversized tee coming up next so maybe that'll beat this one next up we have another oversized tee from the u range that i picked up in this petrol blue color it features a pocket on the front and a split at the hem which are nice additional details this one is made from 100 cotton but it feels a lot stiffer than the other teas on the list i don't actually mind a stiff tee when it's in a heavy weight material and i actually prefer that so it's not a problem for me this tea also comes in at 12p90 which is an absolute bargain for a tea like this due to the split hem there's different lengths at the back of the front of this t-shirt the t mesh is 27 inches long at the front and 27.5 inches at the back it's got a width of 23 inches and a sleeve length of 10 inches so now moving on to the fit the tee has a generous boxy fit oversized sleeves and a slightly shorter length in the body i'm aware this tea is designed to be a bit shorter at the front in the body but for me i'd like an extra inch of length so maybe sizing up a size would work better for me it's nowhere near as comfortable as the airism tea but that's not really surprising the neck is softer than the rest of the t-shirt though so that's a nice touch and you don't have to worry about it rubbing i'm in love with the colour and the details of this tea but for me the tea doesn't sit as well on me as the airism tea does the final tea we've got here is the ut this is a classic tea and one of the first styles i ever picked up from uniqlo the ut is made from 100 cotton and it has a bit of a heavyweight feel to it like the previous t it's got a bit of a rough feel to it too and although that doesn't bother me it's definitely worth mentioning this one also comes in at 12 pound 90 which seems about average for a u-range t from uniqlo the team meshes in at 28 inches long a width of 22 inches and a sleeve length of nine inches like most of the u-range products this tee has a slightly relaxed fit which i really like i feel this tee fits me perfectly and sits well on my body i've had a few of these tees in the past and i feel the material is slightly thinner on this newer model for some of you in the warmer countries this may be a good thing but i always prefer a thicker tee the neckline is ribbed and it has a nice tight fit to my neck which i really like the thicker neck also means you don't have to worry about the neckline getting misshapen in the wash the length and the sleeve length is spot on for me although the sleeves are a little floppy all in all this tee fits me really well and i'm really happy with the way it looks so for me each t-shirt serves a different purpose if i wanted to wear any of these t-shirts as an undershirt then the one that wins it for me would be the supima cotton t-shirt for an oversized tee i would go for the airism tee the fit on this t-shirt is lovely and it's so comfortable too i love the color and the details on the oversized pocket t-shirt but the fit on me is just not quite right and i do prefer the airism oversized tee over this t-shirt and last but not least the best all-rounder in my opinion is the uniqlo ut the fit is spot on with this tee and although it's not perfect there are a couple of things that i would change i don't think you can beat this t-shirt for the price and it's probably the one that i'll be wearing the most in the spring and the summer months but whichever t-shirt that you go for you can't really go wrong they're all great for the price so choose the one that suits you best but i hope this video has helped you out and help you decide which one you want to get maybe just pick up all of them if you can't decide like i did and let me know your favorite down in the comments but anyway as always thanks so much for watching please do give the video a like if you enjoyed it hit subscribe if you're new and i will see you next week see ya", "ZV8VouSkfjE": "[Music] [Applause] YouTube family welcome back it's your first time here my name is Devin on deck I discuss fashion and tech here and today we're talking about or rather on a journey to discover the perfect black t-shirt now if you already know this channel you know my favorite color to wear is black especially when it comes to my basics and over the years I have tried the hell of different t-shirts and I feel like I'm getting really close to find the perfect one but I would love your help in deciding so in this video I have six different teams from my closet from my drawer he's all been washed and dried from $5 all the way up to 95 I'm gonna try them on for you we're gonna go over talked about fit weight how things feel and the quality points and then hopefully by the end of the video we have a verdict [Music] now first up we have the unique little dry package teeth this is gonna cost you about five or six us and it was my favorite shirt up until recently now starting with the good things the price point is good the weight is great it's kind of like a poly-cotton blend so if you're really hot and run hot like I do when you sweat it dries up really quickly but for some reason recently they've been getting a little sloppy with the sizing like this is supposed to be a large on me and usually again I've been buying these charts for years but for some reason this one fits like a medium and a half like when I first put it on it was a tiny bit sluggish but it was fine but after watching and drying it it shrunk up on me so you see it's too short the sleeves are hella tight right now and it just doesn't fit me comfortably so I haven't really worn this shirt in a while but it used to be that you can wash and dry this and then fit fine so I don't know what's going on with these but they definitely are being replaced coincidentally by another shirt within the same company and that leads me to our next t-shirt the UT from Uniqlo it's gonna cost you about $10 USD but it's a total upgrade from the t-shirt from before the weight is amazing I love how this shirt feels when you have an on is very substantial you can tell a huge jump in quality from the dry package one from the previous shirt - this one right here the banded collar right there on the tee is a great touch you just like a fold over piece of fabric that makes a world of a difference as far as the collar goes it's nice and tight but not too tight and the only feedback I have is that the sleeves are a little bit loosey okay even when I cuff them there's still a little loose for me but I think this is a good trade-off to have a way heavier tee way more substantial tee and I would also say it's a little long ish but again not a big deal for me this is a great shirt everything's being consistent so far I've been buying these for the last few months and all the sizes are consistent and it stays black for a long time with the color fastness is really strong so thumbs up on this t-shirt I'm liking it so far now moving on up the price here we have this texture t-shirt by Zara now this is gonna be something you'll find here throughout the year they have different ones all the time and they'll run you around like 30 bucks and I love these t-shirts because they almost add a sophistication to your outfit so if you do want to wear a t-shirt but you want the same appeals like having a thin sweater or something a little bit more refined on then throw one of these on it's gonna look perfect and a little bit more dressy winter time I put an overcoat over it and it looks great or the spring summer when it's too hot for a jacket I can throw that on with like a pair of chinos or some slacks and like some minimal sneakers and have a great smart casual look that again it's a little bit more sophisticated than a regular t-shirt now I would say right now after watching like it's barely long enough before I actually watched you like the first where they fit perfectly bend is shrinking a little bit after washing and hang drying it but the sleeves are the great lip you don't have to really roll them but also it's a great t-shirt off the rack I suggest you look into them if you want something a little bit more elevated now this next t-shirt is in the premium category and it's by a brand called a sketch this is gonna cost you about 45 bucks but in my opinion for a premium t-shirt it is worth the price one of the first great things about a sket is you can pick a various sizing when you pick your size meaning that when I got a large I can pick a short a regular or along it since I am 6 1 then I have a long one and it fits me great now the sleeves are a little bit longer than I would like but I'm already asleep rolling guys so that's fine when you roll them they fit perfectly as far as like looseness and width around my arms it's great and if you look at the neckline I have that same overlapping hem similar to the Uniqlo you t-shirt but it's a little bit thinner and again it makes a shirt feel a little bit more substantial and elevates it in my opinion the fabric weight itself is kind of uh I would say medium heavy kind of a medium and a half as far as weight not super heavy and thick like I would like it like the Uniqlo $10 you shirt but it is very substantial and it does feel like a premium t-shirt so when you spend 45 bucks us on it you don't feel like you spin it much money so I will at least try one of these if you have Tim t-shirts in your closet maybe these are like two or three of them but I do recommend that this would be a good staple to have now as you move up the price tiers in the premium category we have a brand called Vince with your t-shirt coming in at $95 and the reason why I put premium in quotes is because the only thing premium about this is the price point this is a regular shirt it doesn't fit any different from any other insurance this list the weight is similar to the five dollar Uniqlo one it's like kind of a light medium ish weight so it feels a little I don't know not ninety five dollars it's kind of faded now and it's more of a gym shirt it's not really special everything else on this list right now I recommend way more than this t-shirt so now that we're double all the expensive shirts you're moving on to the very last one that I really believe belongs in a category all of this home it's from a company called lot it's more of a like a subscription service what I love about the subscription services you not only give me clothing you're getting accessories you're getting self-care items and everything is black black tees black crude names black pants black shoes and even black tutu brushes but as far as this t-shirt goes one of the best things about it that I love that is personalized with my name on it look at this it's a beautiful thing and the quality of the t-shirt is also very awesome I would say the weight of this t-shirt is probably the same as a premium weight from the skin team and I will say the only thing that I don't like about these is that I get it only once every other one instead of every month because I really love these t-shirts I wish I got I can give more I can get them in bulk but I just can't only can get one every other month but as far as thing and everything it's very comfortable I'm a big fan of it so I had to put it in this video but I would love to know from you what do you feel like is the best one on this list I would love to have been asked it cut but in the Uniqlo UT weight I love the heavy team

Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about cotton t-shirts if you've ever looked at t-shirts you'll probably notice that there are a ton of options in this video I'm gonna help you decipher what kind of t-shirt would be best for you by giving you a few details about each of our favorite cotton t-shirt the first t-shirt I'd like to talk about it's no frills it's your basic t-shirt it's the Gildan G 5000 this t-shirt is made out of standard cotton it's affordable it's got a boxier fit and it's got a ton of color options to choose from the next t-shirt is the Gildan soft style G 64,000 this shirts a little bit nicer than your G 5000 it's got a semis fitted feel to it so it's not as boxy shirt was made sure where it still has a ton of color options and it's a little bit softer and more durable because it's a ring spun cotton next we'll move up to the anvil 980 this t-shirt is also made by Gildan who owns anvil this shirt is a comb ring spun cotton t-shirt it's a sin I fit it as well it's very similar to the soft style but it's kind of in-between the soft styles and then the later shirts I'm going to talk about alright next I would like to talk about the next level 3600 this is definitely one of our most popular fashion fit t-shirts the next level uses the combed ring spun cotton so it's a very soft durable t-shirt this shirt is going to cost you a little bit more it's also got less color options and the other shirts we're going to talk about today next level they run a little small you definitely hugs me real a lot tighter than the other shirts so this shirt I would maybe consider going up a size another fashion fitted t-shirt that's very popular is the Bella canvas 3000 one one thing that's really nice about the Dahle canvas is although they are also manufactured overseas like all of the shirts were talking about today the dialogues where they actually dye the colors of the shirts are done here in one factory in California this helps them keep a very consistent color between all their t-shirts the Bella canvas is another fashion fitted tee they come out with all kinds of great colors all the time they're very soft it's a cone ring spun cotton or they call it an heirloom combed ring spun cotton and it's another great option if you're looking for a fashion fitted t-shirt and finally we'll talk about the American Apparel 2001 they got two options one of them is made overseas the other one is made here in America which will cost you extra with American Apparel you're paying for that brand name even though Gildan now owns american apparel american apparel is another fashion fitted teeth it's a combed ring spun cotton supersoft they've got a lot of color options so of course they're very nice shirts as well the point is there's a ton of different options to choose from so you've got to decide what's right for you it depends on your fit what kind of feel you're going for and of course your price point and if you're looking to have t-shirts made stop over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up as always thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next video [Music] I'm sorry Dan it's really hard when you're not here you stupid stop", "8ZUyLBQDl3g": "today I am testing my subscribers favorite white t-shirts basically I asked you guys on Instagram to tell me the brand name and the style name of your all-time favorite white t-shirt and then I dumped all that information into Excel I tallied up the top five and I bought one of each end of my size so we're gonna go through each one I'm going to talk about price size fit quality I'm even gonna see if it shrinks after I wash it and the goal is to just help you guys find your perfect white t-shirt so let's get started okay let's start off with the fifth most popular t-shirt the fifth most popular t-shirt according to you guys is this James purse vintage little boy T James purse is a luxury basics brand so this was the most expensive out of the top five the price of this is $75 it comes in five sizes from zero to four which kind of mimic like extra small to extra large and I got this t-shirt in a size zero and I'm just gonna read the description off the website like an old favorite from the first we're at this lightweight cotton Jersey t is garment dyed with extra softener and silicon for a lived-in feel and this one is a hundred percent cotton just like my previous video I'm going to be ranking each one on three things which is fit quality and value they're all gonna get a total score and then at the end we'll see how my ranking compares to yours so let's try this bad boy on and see what I think alright here it is the James purse t-shirts I really love this I have a mirror right behind the camera that I'm kind of like referencing the fit of this is so nice though like especially like the sleeves and the shoulder seams I feel like just lay really perfectly like this area is just so seamless and nice it's very boxy but I feel like it flows and lays really nicely on the body like it's a little bit tighter up here and then it's a bit looser down here but do you see how like if I kind of move like it it's not too stiff the fabric almost lays like this it's so flattering I also really like the Vivat this is a really good kind of like semi cropped length I love the sleeves they're like perfectly short this is what the back looks like it's so soft too like uh it's just super cozy and soft the material feels really nice and lightweight but it's not sheer it's like the kind of perfect opacity and I really like the weight of it how it's like kind of thin so that it floats on the body really nicely but it's not too sheer all the like stitching and seams on this are flawless I honestly think that this one deserves a five out of five in terms of fit I'm just so pleased with how it lays on my body I feel like all the details are just really perfect the length of it the neckline the sleeves the shoulders like everything just is perfect so I'm definitely gonna give this a five out of five in terms of fit I'm also gonna give this a five out of five in terms of quality just the softness of it and how it's nice and opaque but it's like a nice lightweight material and how perfect like the fit is constructed and everything I think this deserves a five out of five but value I'm gonna bump it down because it's so expensive I'm gonna give this one a three for value because I do think that you should expect higher quality when you're paying more so it kind of makes sense but not everyone can dish out seventy five dollars for a t-shirt so the total is thirteen so this one got a total score of 13 out of 15 which is pretty good I just knocked it down a couple notches in terms of value just because it's so expensive and there are definitely high-quality white t-shirt options at a much lower price this is a little sunlight test for this James purse t-shirt I wanted to see how sheer these looked when I kind of put them up against a window so this is what that looks like and then I also ran each t-shirt through the washing machine after I did my initial trial and just to see if they shrunk so I did a warm wash and a tumble dry low which is a pretty standard wash and dry I feel like and so this is what the comparison is okay let's move on to the fourth most popular white t-shirt according to you so before the most popular pair was the Zara basics white t-shirt this is what she looks like the price this is $17.90 it comes in four sizes from small texture large it's 49 percent modal 33% lyocell and 18 percent linen so let's try this on and see what I think all right so this was the fourth most popular t-shirt it's so interesting trying all of these white t-shirts on at the same time first impressions is it already feels a lot of scratch here then the James purse one like it's just like I don't know the fabrics kind of interesting but I could see why you guys like it because it has that kind of same like it's thin ish so it gives that kind of like casual laid-back vibe you know I feel like in general this is a slightly more fitted t-shirt than the James purse one that I just tried on especially in this sleeve area like the sleeves are very tight and I can kind of feel that as I'm moving around my shoulders and stuff the body is fine and it has a bit of like give to it but the sleeves are definitely a little tight maybe I should have gone with a size medium lengthwise this is a more traditional length so it's not as cropped I do really like the crewneck line though it's a nice light comfortable a little bit more open than the James purse one this one is really sheer though like it's very very sheer like I don't know if you guys can tell I'll do a window test for all of these but looking in the mirror like so I'm wearing these high-waisted jeans when I put the shirt over them I can see the blue in the jeans through the shirt and I couldn't also see like the details of my bra and I'm wearing like a nude bra yeah I just don't think this fits very well I'm gonna give this a 3 in terms of fit I also don't love the quality on this like the stitching isn't great and it's pretty sheer and just the fact that this like fit issue is happening I'm gonna have to give this a 3 in terms of quality as well I'm also gonna give this a pretty low value score because this is seventeen ninety which is on the pricier side of like the lower end brands that you guys recommended and I don't think that the quality of this matches that price tag and I know for a fact that the other t-shirts that I'm about triune are less than that and I think just from feeling them not even trying them on I think they're gonna be higher quality so I'm gonna give this a three let's see how it does tomorrow when I wash it okay this one didn't do so hot this ended up with a total ranking of 9 out of 15 there's just something a little bit off about this one I also want to mention that this one shrunk the most after I pulled it out of the dryer I wasn't sure how these interesting kind of fabrics we're gonna handle the tumble dry if you want to take extra good care of your clothing I would recommend hang-drying items that you're really concerned about but I wanted to give these like a good realistic test of putting them in the dryer and seeing if they shrunk so that is the Tzar one a little bit disappointing but let's move on to it the third most popular t-shirts the third most popular t-shirt is the one I'm wearing right now and this is one from brandy melville so this is called the Haley t-shirt and it's $16 on brandy melville it comes in one size as is pretty typical waste brandy melville stuff and it's 100% cotton the description is that it's a soft and stretchy cotton tee with a crewneck collar alright so let's cut to the Tryon portion and I'll tell you guys what I think ooh interesting okay this is kind of fun because this is a totally different style and silhouette then basically all the other white t-shirts which are more boxy this one is a nice fitted option which I actually think it's good to have like a more fitted tight option and a looser fitting option I really like the feel of this right now but I'm a sucker for brandy melville stuff because the materials they use are just so soft and comfortable I actually really like the way this fits you guys always choose the best stuff that's why I love these videos is because it like opens my eyes to all these amazing options I mean there's a reason that this stuff you know floats to the top if you're really pretty I think this is a great option I really like it when sleeves have a bit of like a gap here I just think it's nice and flattering and I also really like the length it's like a pretty cropped length looks good with like high-waisted stuff this fabric is ever so slightly ribbed which is kind of interesting it gives like a different texture than the others the other ones are just like kind of a straight-up cotton II feel this one if you look closely you can see a bit of ribbing to it which I think helps it with that stretch it is also pretty opaque like since it's tight you're kind of seeing a little bit of my bra here but like you're not actually seeing the color and like here you can't really see like my jeans or anything so I think the opacity is really good on this okay I actually really like this brandy melville one fit wise I'm gonna give this a 4 out of 5 I think this one fits really well for the look that it's going for which is that kind of like tighter white t-shirt look okay obvious con is that they only make this in one size and while I think like tiny t-shirts are good like this for petite sizes obviously it's not gonna work for everyone which is a bummer quality I think this is definitely better than the Zara one but lower than the James purse the stitching looks decent but it's not like pristine like the James purse one so I'm gonna give it a four out of five and then value-wise let me check the price really quick yeah this one is $16 so a dollar too cheaper than the Zara one but better in my opinion even though it's a very different look so it's hard to compare but I would give it a value of four because for sixteen dollars I think this is a really good option okay so Brandi did pretty good this one got a total score of 12 out of 15 I actually really really like this one and I think a lot of you guys will like it too if you're similar to my size this one is shrunk a tiny bit after I washed it but it is kind of like a ribbed material that kind of stretches out as you wear it it's kind of like jeans they kind of stretch out as you wear it and then you wash it to kind of return it to its original form okay let's move on to the second most popular t-shirt the runner-up most popular teacher according to you guys and it is this one from H&M this is called the slump Jersey t-shirt so this t-shirt is $9.99 it comes in sizes extra extra extra small to extra large it's 50% cotton and 50 cent mote doll and the description says t-shirt in slob Jersey made from a model and cotton blend with a round neckline and a straight cut hem so let's try this guy on and see what I think okay this one is hmmm very similar to the Zara one very very similar interesting it's interesting how the Tzar one and the H&M one the one I'm wearing right now they have kind of longer sleeves I feel like it gives a slightly different look I kind of have preference towards the cap sleeves that are a lot shorter and more slanted I think that gives off a more stylish vibe this one's also longer the sleeves are longer it's a longer length it has kind of an interesting texture it's almost like a cooling fabric I feel like this is very breathable it's slightly less sheer than the Tzar one but it's still one of the more sheer ones like it's I would say Zara so far has been the most sheer and then this one's runner up I also feel like the quality's not good like do you guys see this it's almost like slanting I don't love that and I also feel like the sleeves are having this weird bubble thing happen because this hem is so wide this like little trim part here that it's almost like bubbling over and then the neckline is also kind of flappy I noticed that when I was putting it on yeah I'm not loving this honestly the fabric also it it feels cottony but it's a little bit like a slick cotton it's almost too smooth it's like when I wear cotton I want it to kind of feel like it has a bit of friction to it this one is very very silky almost yeah I don't know if I like that I almost feel like it looks kind of pyjama hmm interesting fit wise I honestly don't like this I think I'm gonna give this a 2 the sleeves are too long the neckline is too big and it's kind of flappy this is weird I'm gonna give this one of three quality wise because the stitching is fine but like the fact that it looks basically like an asymmetrical hem even though it's not supposed to look like that is concerning and then I also just feel like some things are off with the construction value-wise this is the cheapest option out of everything that I am trying today so value wise I'm going to give this a three I don't think this is like anything amazing for the price I almost feel like the price should be lower this one was not good the total score for this H&M t-shirt an 8 out of 15 womp womp my biggest problems were with the fit I just thought it fit really weird it almost looked like I was wearing pajamas there was also some funky stuff going on like how be have mine looked like it was asymmetrical even though it wasn't supposed to be and the weird bubbling of the sleeves it was just it was just weird so this one got an 8 out of 15 all right let's move on to number one the number one most popular white t-shirt by a landslide this one t-shirt had more than double the amount of votes than any of the other t-shirts and that is the unique low you crew neck t-shirt you guys seem to love this t-shirt and I was really excited that it made it so high on your list so let's cut to the Tryon section and see what I think about your guys is number one white t-shirt choice ok this is the most popular t-shirt according to you guys I think this is like a very good super classic white tee option it's just a straight cut down it's not cropped it has a nice like inbetween sleeve like you can see you had a little bit of that slant that I like but it's not as like much of a cap sleeve as the James purse one or the Brandie one one interesting thing about the fit that I'm noticing is like when I was kind of just like holding up all these t-shirts in my hand kind of holding them up in front of me and feeling them before trying them on I noticed that the James purse almost looked like it flared out at the body but this shirt which when you lay a flat is completely straight down you can actually see that it's a lot tighter around here but looser around the waist area which can kind of create a weird like bunching up effect and make your stomach look bigger than it actually is and the James purse one the way that it's constructed kind of prevents that from happening just an interesting thought I feel like this shirt is like meant to be kind of tucked in and cropped a little bit like this looks perfect basically but this one is just super thick and high-quality like it's not sure at all it's completely opaque and this is the same price as the H&M one right now cuz these are currently on sale and they do sales for these like literally all the time it's usually the same price as the Tzar ones like 1790 I think right now it's like 990 but this one is like clearly a level up from the Zara and H&M ones in terms of quality so definitely a good one you guys picked a good one state wise I'm gonna give this up four out of five I think this is like a really good classic t-shirt fit but it's almost so straight that when it actually goes on like a body I feel like it like I just don't like how it's tight here and loose here you know quality wise I think this is definitely like up there with the James purse I'm gonna give this a five in terms of quality this is the thickest out of all the five t-shirts it's also really really soft and the stitching and the seams are just really good for this and it's very symmetrical value-wise I have to give this a 5 out of 5 because value wise this is just like one of the best so far since they do sales on this all the time this actually ends up being one of the most inexpensive of the five different t-shirts and since it's so high on the quality bar like I think you really can't go wrong with a t-shirt like this so this one gets a really high score for me and I totally agree with you guys alright guys the unica one was pretty darn close to perfect and the total score I gave it was a 14 out of 15 so these are how the rankings compare I think you can't go wrong with the Uniqlo one that's the one that I would absolutely recommend and then if you have the budget and you want to splurge a little bit more get the James purse one because it's really good so that is it guys that is testing my subscribers favorite white t-shirt please let me know your thoughts in the comments I really want to hear your opinions and give me suggestions for what you want me to do next because I love it this series and I think it's really helpful ok and that is it I love you guys so much and I'll see you in my next video bye", "z32xKFjoJf8": "hey there if you're anything like me then you practically live in t-shirts especially this year besides the odd polo button-downer sweater 95 of the time i have on a t-shirt i walked into my closet recently to pick one out for the day and realize that majority of the ones i own were either deformed torn or years old for such a staple i wanted to invest in some quality pieces that would not only look good but hold up over time as with anything once i get into something i dive way too deep i spent the next few days researching blogs reddit posts youtube videos and everything in between to learn everything and anything i could about what makes a t-shirt great a few more days and nearly six hundred dollars later i got the top few brands that were mentioned frequently across those platforms i put them all through their paces and made sure i tested them as thoroughly as i could to find the best t-shirt available for men right now if you appreciate the effort all i ask for is a like and free to consider subscribing it means the absolute world my ideal t-shirt is one that nails three things the fit the feel and the overall quality my definition of a good fit is one that drapes well hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but leave some room in the stomach for a large meal or those temporary quarantine pounds for the feel i'm looking for something that is soft to the touch in terms of quality i prefer a heavier t-shirt that has a solid collar is durable and doesn't shrink when it's washed i'll be giving away the shirt i rank the highest in whatever size and color the winner picks to enter subscribe to the channel drop a quick like and comment a video idea down below and i'll pick a winner in the next few weeks stick around to the end of the video to find out which one you could potentially win thanks for watching let's start with the uniqlos to pima cotton crewneck t-shirt i've seen such high praises for this tee on reddit and decided to give it a shot after reading glowing reviews made in vietnam the shirt is 100 supima cotton supima cotton is a brand of cotton that is grown in california texas new mexico or arizona and is amongst the top one percent of cotton grown in the world it features extra long fibers that supposedly give it more strength softness and color retention and less pilling than normal fibers there is no weight that is advertised but the fabric feels pretty thin in comparison to the others on this list the fit is between a slim and a regular fit it hugs the arms well and leaves room in the stomach but shrinks a bit after a wash i opted for a small and it fits well the neck opening is on the smaller end and wears higher than the rest which may be a plus depending on your preference for 15 the t-shirt is pretty good but leaves a lot to be desired the quality definitely isn't there and the t-shirt doesn't hold up after a few washes i noticed a little bit of shrinkage after a wash but nothing too significant it definitely lost some of its initial softness when i washed it and feels like a normal jquery t-shirt afterwards the color feels pretty weak and although it's fine now i suspect i'll develop a bacon neck and a few more washes people have said that the quality on these used to be very good but has gone down in recent months when the production shifted from cambodia to vietnam the fabric feels thinner fits worse and doesn't hold up nearly as well overall for 15 dollars it's still a solid t-shirt for anyone on a budget but it isn't as great as it used to be considering companies like bella and canvas make a similar quality t-shirt for four dollars i'd rather spend my money there and save up for something a bit higher end ask it is a swedish company started in 2015 with the pursuit to create the best basics and as a minimalist favorite i've heard a lot about this company and i've always wanted to try them out so i went with a regular t-shirt ascot uses 100 egyptian cotton and has a weight of 180 gsm the fabric was soft to the touch but not as soft as cuts it offers enough structure for it to feel well made but flows enough to drape over the body really well ask it offers 15 different sizes for the t-shirts from an extra small to an extra large and then breaking down even further into short regular and long it lets everyone find their ideal fit which seems like common sense but is rare for some reason the t-shirt was dyed sewn and assembled all in portugal and the craftsmanship is great the collar is ribbed and feels very sturdy after a few washes i can confirm it holds up just as well as it did when i was brand new the fit is what shined through the most this was snug in all the right places but left just enough room in your stomach without looking sloppy you'll still get that streamlined silhouette and tons of versatility with this t-shirt i opted for a size small and it fit exactly how i expected it to i could also probably get away with the medium but i'm not sure if it would hug the chest and arms as well at 45 this is pricey but worth it in my opinion ask it offers a great product and their customer service is always willing to help it offers a simple well-made crisp t-shirt and a ton of different colors overall i was very impressed and it definitely lived up to my expectations moving along to the cuts split hem crewneck t-shirt just a quick heads up their marketing is insanely persistent so be prepared for them to take over your facebook youtube and instagram ads as soon as you visit their website the ads obviously worked on me because i eventually gave in just to see what the hype was about immediately out of the box the t-shirt was insanely soft and bouncy it's made of cut's own fabric called pike up the only info they give on it is that it's a tri-blend fabric but if i were to guess i'd say it's a mixture of cotton elastane and polyester the fabric feels very performance oriented in a synthetic way even though it's made to wear casually that isn't a bad thing but just something to note compared to the 100 cotton options on this list i opted for a medium as the fit is on the slimmer end the t-shirt sits a bit long and bunches up near my waist and makes my legs look very short when i wear these with cuff jeans i do prefer to wear them more with joggers as it looks a bit more streamlined they have a build your own concept where you can have a choice between three necks the crew the v-neck and the henley and three bottoms the elongated curve the split and the classic curve the color palette is always on point because they stick close to neutral tones while adding new shades every season the fabric is thin and breathable but not in a cheap way the collar is very thin so it eliminates the chances of deforming after a few washes i haven't experienced any shrinkage at all at 48 dollars we can definitely see where their marketing budget comes from i'm impressed by their buttery fabric the stretch how low maintenance it is and the fit but probably wouldn't buy another one due to the length and the price up next let's talk about the everlane premium weight crew in a size small although it is marked as a slim fit this is the boxiest out of all the t-shirts leaving plenty of rooms in the sleeves and through the body at 6.2 ounces i love the weight of this t-shirt but it was the most basic feeling out of the batch it reminds me of a fresh golden tee but with a bit more weight it was scratchy initially but has softened slightly after about a year of washes and wear the neck has held up pretty well and i love the color of this t-shirt coming in at 30 dollars i would say this isn't worth it in my opinion but if you like boxier fits and a wide variety of colors to choose from this might be the way to go next up we have the robert brockett t-shirt i was introduced to this brand when my girlfriend snagged me the white one from nordstrom's anniversary sale last year i went back shortly after and bought the dark gray one for myself and then picked up the navy one this past year the canadian company calls it the rocket tea but it is also known as a georgia crew and some retailers it's made from 100 ultra fine us grown cotton and is finished with a heavy enzyme blush robert brockett claims this helps give it a worn and broken in feel and gives the fabric a slight sheen both of which i can attest to the material is cool to the touch and very smooth these have been a part of my rotation for about a year now and i've experienced no loss of color all mine are a size small they might fit a bit large initially but they shrank a decent amount on the first wash so something to keep in mind when sizing the shirts length was perfect when new but is slightly short for me after the shrinkage the arms and chest region came in nicely and were perfect for me after the wash the collar shows no sign of wear even after wearing these regularly for about a year the split hem is a nice feature that prevents any pulling for more athletic legged people there are 60 on the website but please don't pay that much for this t-shirt nordstrom's anniversary cell brings it down to 38 for all the staple colors and i've seen quirkier ones go for as low as 20 on nordstrom rack just be sure you search for the georgia tea on the discount sites at that price these are some of the best bang for your buck and are worth stocking up on 316 specializes in raw denim so i was a little hesitant adding them to this list however there seems to be a cult-like following for their t-shirts and i had to see what it was all about the regular crew was sold out so i opted for the pocket t-shirt but the material and fit are the exact same right off the bat these are super soft to the touch almost a viscose like softness to them but they're 100 american grown pima cotton the fabric is roughly 160 gsm so it feels substantial in a good way the triple stitched collar feels very sturdy there were two lines of stitching on the collar and one line right below after looking at the size chart i opted for a medium the fit was okay but was easily the biggest drawback about this t-shirt the sleeves didn't hug my arms and it was very boxy around the torso area i might need to try the small and report back if it's any better the shirts are made in the states so they come at a premium they're only available in packs of 2 which i don't understand why but many higher end t-shirts seem to go this route colors are limited to black and white in the pima shirts as of me making this video they come in at 95 for a pack of 2 or about 47.50 a piece they're really high quality so the price is justified but they aren't my favorite solely due to the fit lady white company was started on this one t-shirt i was super excited to get this shirt in because i was intrigued by their claims of no side seams it's something that i haven't experienced before this model is called the hour t-shirt it's made of 100 cotton grown in north carolina the t-shirt is then knitted cut and sewn in los angeles the construction on this t-shirt was flawless the double needle stitch sits perfectly on the collar and lines up perfectly with the shoulder seam which is actually very hard to accomplish the fit was relaxed and boxy so i'm glad i got a small to get the fit i was looking for the main feature about this is the lack of seams on the side they claim it helps achieve a more natural drape and allows a t-shirt to conform better to the body they accomplish this by using circular knitting machines that allow the torso area to be sewn as a tube it's super unique and is something i found really cool the fabric itself is six ounces so it has a very good weight to it i ordered a size small in the dark gray color and it fit really well however i was disappointed when i took it out and the fabric was very rough the fabric didn't have that soft brush-like finish that i looked for personally it felt like a fresh vintage tee from the mid-1900s which isn't a bad thing just something i don't prefer i would almost compare this shirt to raw denim it's not the most comfortable and soft out of the bag but you can feel its heft and sense of quality it's supposed to break in and get softer the more and more it's worn so i'll have to see what it's like a few years from now gray navy black and white come in a pack of two for 99. if you want a different color you'll be looking at 55 for a single one the construction and fit were great and check my boxes but overall the t-shirt was okay i'll probably get heat for this since this t-shirt is supposed to be the holy grail but i just wasn't that impressed by its feel maybe i just don't get it maybe i just haven't worn it enough but i don't think i would run out and grab another one anytime soon i know there weren't many negatives or drawbacks in this video but it just goes to show how great most of these shirts actually are all of them are worthy enough for a spot in your rotation but it just depends on what you look for in a perfect tee based off the fit softness and overall construction ask it took the top prize for me i love how it doesn't look out of place under a suit or on shorts it's a crisp t-shirt that only gets better with age i would give robert barakat a close second followed by cuts 316 lady white co uniqlo and then everlane in that order i can't wait to give away an ask a tea to one of you guys if you enjoyed the video please drop a like and subscribe it helps tremendously i'll catch you guys in the next one thanks", "uauA31ZEJ7k": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to my channel in today's video I'm gonna talk about the perfect white tea so I asked you guys on Instagram if this is something that you want to see someone requested it and so many of you guys said yes so here I am I'm going to talk about the t-shirt I'm wearing as well as all of these ones on this rack right here I have about seven or so t-shirts I want to show you and talk about all different price ranges so hope you're excited about this super simple video so let's begin so some of the things that I look for in a really good perfect white t-shirt is number one structure if you've been following me you know I love that word structure but I like a good white t-shirt that sits on your body really nicely that's not gonna make you look too slouchy or too sluggish so this part right here is very important where it sits on your shoulder that's gonna make a t-shirt look like it fits you nicely or it's gonna look like it's too big another thing that I look for is sleeve length so I want something too long or too short but of course it depends on the look you're going for material is another very important thing so something that looks nice something that looks more on the expensive side but it doesn't have to be expensive neckline is one of the top most important things I typically go for a crewneck but any type of neckline you prefer that you think flatters your body goes well also for petite women Phoenix are also more elongated than crew necks I just particularly like crew necks because I do feel like they look more put together and a little more polished and I like a crewneck that sits pretty high up on the neck and that's pretty much the basics of what I look for in a good white tee I understand that so many people are looking for different things when it comes to the perfect white t-shirts so I've gathered like my top t-shirts from my closet that I love all with different characteristics and things like that so the first t-shirt I want to talk about is the one that I'm wearing right now I actually feel like I just wore this in a recent video but this is the one from eberlein so weird thing when I first got this t-shirt I didn't think too much of it just because it's just a white tee but the more than I wore it in my videos the more I loved it the more uses I found for it so this is something you can wear it dressed up dress down and the way that I really like wearing this t-shirt is under Blazers when you kind of want to go for that dressy yet carefree and casual look so it's not too form-fitting but it's also not too loose on your body I love the sleeves how it doesn't kind of like flare out but it just is a nice length not too long not too short I also like this part the neckline it's a crewneck but this part of the neckline is very thin and it's not super thick I feel like when you get a super thick neckline the more casual it looks and so this is why this t-shirts very practical and very versatile and the length is great as well as you can see I'm wearing it tucked in it hits you right about here so like I mentioned earlier this is one of my favorite ways to wear this t-shirt is under Blazers it is a very good layering type of tea so if that's what you're looking for then you need this t-shirt I am wearing an extra small in this t-shirt and price point is very very reasonable I believe it's like $25 or under $25 so great find all around alright so for the second t-shirt is this one right here this is probably one of my favorite t-shirts that I own in my closet and it's from Zara so yes Zara is a very very good place to find really good white teeth believe it or not you just have to take care of them so they last you a long time or you just have to buy duplicates of it I did buy this shirt two of them so I have two of them in my closet because it's kind of just like when you find such a good item at a low cost you do run the risk of it kind of falling apart faster if you don't take care of it as well so it's kind of smart to buy doubles of it so this one is a more form-fitting type of t-shirt I love it because it's ribbed I'm not sure if you can tell I also really really love the sleeves so it's a cap sleeve but it's also kind of like banded or at least it gives a banded look just the same as the neckline right here and then the rest of the shirt is semi semi semi sheer so it's not going to be a full opaque type of white tee but I love it to just use it by itself to pair with trousers and then there's add some jewelry the way that I'm wearing right now so if you like your white t-shirts to be more on the snug side more to form and fit your body then this is a really great tee so I got this tee awhile ago it's obviously not available anymore but I am going to link really really really good alternatives and then also it is a really good length so it is like au style right here you could tie it in a knot just like that you can tuck it and what-have-you this is just a really great type of t-shirt to have in your closet and again this is a t-shirt that you can pretty much wear with anything layering dressed up or this down it's when I also gotten a size extra small Azara alright so this next T is also from Zara so again like I mentioned I got doubles of this one just because it was very unique it's a very any t-shirt because it's more of an off-white color and I don't know if you can tell from the camera but it is also a very sheer type of t-shirt here is what it looks like up close so I like this t-shirt for pretty much this reasons that I loved the previous one that I just showed you but I really loved it because of the Sheerness you don't really come across too many sheer t-shirts like this I feel like it gives it a different look so in a way a little more dressy so if you were to use this t-shirt with mini skirts or mini skirts even leather pants and things like that and then just some jewelry um again I got this in an extra small and also because ara is a really good place to find white cheese I will link all the current ones for any ones that are in stock that I would buy myself in the description all right so this next white tea is by the brand shop redone in collaboration with Hanes and I've had this t-shirt for I don't know how many years now but like I said I take really good care of it which by the way I forgot to mention with the Zara ones because with Zara you might worry about it falling apart so it's really important to take care of your white t-shirts I don't bleach my white t-shirts or anything I do just wash them with only white items don't even wash them with light colors or anything I don't ever have an issue with like the armpits turning different colors or anything like that either but the dryer I feel like is the part that can do a lot of harm to our clothing items so you can always hang dry your t-shirts or flat dryer t-shirts instead of throwing them in the dryer and then also hand wash them in your washer instead of doing like a normal wash treat it like a delicate I know so that way you're able to preserve the life of them and have these in your closet for a longer amount of time and get more uses out of them so moving on this t-shirt like I said is from chakra done in collaboration with Hanes so if you're the kind of person that is looking for just your basic white tee no frills no bells and whistles just something casual then these are really good white t-shirts they're cotton they are box sees so they're not gonna be anything like I mentioned previously you can still wear them as layering the pieces you can still wear them under things like Blazers it's just not gonna have that more polished look and then again these ones are a little bit more on the shorter side so nothing too long which I think it's great you can still kind of tie them up and I'm not if you wanted to and it's also a lot easier to tuck in just because of the length these are a little more on the pricey side I would say around the $60 range so I have this one then I also have this one so this is also shop redone in collaboration with Hanes so as you can see this is a true white and then this is more of an off-white so if you've been watching me for a while you know different shades of white are very important to me I just feel like you need different shades to go with different things in different colors in your wardrobe so that's why I like having white and off-white because sometimes you need softer types of whites to blend with neutral colors and things like that I have a lot of neutrals in my closet you guys already know that so these ones I believe they always make and I wear an extra small all right so this next t-shirt right here is from ASOS so aces is another really good place that has inexpensive t-shirts and just good basics in general this one I love so much and I had to have in my closet just because it already has a roll sleeves so I love rolling my sleeves when it comes to wearing a white tee just because I feel like it gives a white t-shirt some character some life something just a little different than just being a basic plain old white tee I just like to dress it up a little bit more so the nice thing about this is that it's already sewn on there you know sometimes it can be so annoying to fold your seat just because they unfold on its own so yeah that's why I loved it and also it's just a really nice shape I really love how it looks from a side view right here it just looks like a really cool top so this is what it would look like tucked in which is how I would wear it and then another reason why I like this t-shirt is because it just you know looks like you put in a little bit more effort than just throwing on a white t-shirt and some pants because of the sleeves so I love this one so much this one I got in a size extra small alright next up I have this t-shirt from the Frankie shop this one has some shoulder pads on it this is one of my most coveted items in my closet right now and if you're on Instagram and you follow a lot of different bloggers and things like that you might have already noticed or have been seeing t-shirts like this around so this you can kind of dub as like a trendier piece all those shoulder pads have been around for centuries I feel like my grandma might have had a t-shirt like this but I love this t-shirt because it's kind of like the star so if you're looking for a white t-shirt to do all the tricks that has all the bells and whistles if you're looking for a white t-shirt that is a star that stands out that can be your work piece your nighttime going out piece your dinner piece things like that then this is a definite you should that you need in your closet it is more on the pricey side I want to say around $75 but I feel like it's worth it the material also feels really really nice the neckline band right here is also just so pristine and so nice this one I did get in an extra small so this is what this t-shirt looks like tucked in um so it's kind of like the one I just showed you from asos except with shoulder pads this is what the size of planks so it's a little bit of a drop leg drop arm or drop hole whatever you call it on the side so I just wear like a strapless new bra oh yeah I just would wear it just simple with jeans with some Knights trouser type of pants a miniskirt would look really nice leather pants would look really nice so if you don't want to spend $75 on this shirt I have a lot of different places where you can find more inexpensive t-shirts like this one again that I will link all right guys that's it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed it and found it useful don't forget to check out the description box because I will have a plethora of links for all the different white t-shirts that I love that I have found that are

consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options price and print ability let's start by talking about comfort this shirt is made out of 100% combed ring-spun cotton what that means to you and I is this is an extremely soft t-shirt because this is a cold drink spun cotton t-shirt it's softer than your standard cotton which you'll find in like a guild in G 5000 and also your ring spun cotton is like your gilding soft style t-shirts the next level 3600 t-shirt is comparable to the Bella canvas 3000 won and the American Apparel 2001 t-shirt which are all combed ring spun cotton and what that means is they're all extremely comfortable t-shirts now it's time to talk about styling this shirt is definitely a fashion fitted tee which is why it's really popular with clothing lines and band merchandise this shirt has a baby ribbed collar it's got side seams and a tearaway label one thing that I've noticed after wearing these shirts for a very long time is after extensive use the bottom seam of the t-shirt can actually start to come unraveled so that's just something to take into consideration this shirt definitely wears a lot longer than a lot of other t-shirts so if you compare it to like the Gildan soft style G 64,000 it's gonna be come down lower on your body this is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts at Twin City tees and also one of our most recommended this shirt comes in extra small through Forex l when it comes to shirt colors the next level colors are definitely limited compared to your Bella canvas and gild and t-shirts although the shirt colors that they do offer are very good ones as for price this is definitely one of the most affordable fashion fitted combed ring-spun t-shirts on the market it will of course cost a little more than your ring spun cotton and standard cotton t-shirts as you can see here on our chart this is our price here at Twin City tees this is for 50 t-shirts with a one color print and this is just to show you where this shirt lines up among a lot of our other popular t-shirt options I want to make it very clear that these prices are subject to change okay next let's talk about screen printing when it comes to printing at Twin City tees we use water-based and discharge inks primarily and because of that the dye lot of the t-shirt is extremely important and what a dye lot is is where they actually dye the fabric of the t-shirt to give it its color next level dyes their t-shirts and multiple factories around the world and because of this they're starting to show a little bit of inconsistencies and dialogues here I'll show you an example right here as a counterexample Bella canvas actually manufactures their shirts all over the world but they dye them all in the United States which gives them a lot more control among their dialogues as a customer you shouldn't have to concern yourself with this too much I just bring it up to let you know that as next level has grown some of their quality control has fallen a little bit so that's something to pay attention to in the future but when it comes to dye lots at Twin Cities it's our job to make sure that you guys get a high quality product with consistent printing so we'll take care of the dialogue issues so you don't have to worry about anything as mentioned before the next level 3600 is definitely one of our most popular t-shirts we print thousands of them a month they're soft they're stylish and they come in a great price point so if you're trying to choose which t-shirt is right for your business band or group consider the next level 3600 so now there's only one thing left for you to do click on the link below fill out an estimate let us know you want the next level 3600 if that is indeed what you want and before you know it you'll have t-shirts of your own if you're curious about the guild and saw style G 64000 check out this video next we'll see you in the next video", "XR2jVs1iJJ4": "everyone my name is Mark wacht and we're talking about my favorite things so during this quarantine time I think people are their wardrobes have become a bit of a mess I mean you're basically wearing loungewear or some sort of like t-shirt and sweatpants maybe through the entire day if you're working from home and I know a lot of you guys are working from home and so I have this favorite brand or this favorite set of loungewear and I just want to share that with you guys today but we're talking about reigning champ I'm not sure if you can see the logo here reigning champ so out of the reigning champ stuff I'm a huge fan of what we're talking about today and that is the t-shirt I've been trying to find the perfect balance of like this high quality garment but also very comfortable and something that I can wear during the core team during any time where I'm just like lounging around at home and reigning champ has been that brand so as you can see I have a white t-shirt on right now a white t-shirt is a complete and utter essential in any wardrobe whether you're woman man old young it doesn't matter you need a white t-shirt so I bought a white t-shirt like this I would say black is the same way getting a black t-shirt like this as well is very very important for your wardrobe but I also even have a couple other colors so this is a navy I have an interesting story about this particular t-shirt in a second and I also have the gray so man this is the four t-shirt like this is gonna last me you know if you're not taking a shower every day this might last you a whole week potentially you know so what are you looking for in some loungewear so obviously you want it to be comfortable I think you want the quality of the material to be high because you're gonna be washing this quite often you might work out in them you might sweat like crazy in them it doesn't matter you need to be able to wash them over and over and over again and that's harsh on the fabrics the higher the quality of the fabric is the easier it's gonna be able to kind of withstand that and stay alive for a long period of time on to the story that I was trying to explain so this is the Navy shirt from writing channel this is a you know something that I've had actually for over a year and and I think it still looks great I mean there's not really there's no holes there's no stretching there's no it looks like a shirt you can buy off to the rack today I actually got in an accident where I was hit by a car while running so it's a long story it was crazy like I was in shock and everything at that but I did end up getting like you might be able to see here like a bunch of scars on my arm but you'll notice that the scar ends like in a line right here I don't know if you can see that right there but that's because I was wearing this t-shirt and it's so interesting to me hey that this t-shirt basically survived a car crash and this left arm is where that that kind of like where it would have like scarred me here but and I imagine the t-shirt would be completely wrecked after that but it's fine I don't see a single rip or tear or anything like that so I don't know if that's the ultimate test like you shouldn't you know don't go get hit by a car just to see how good your t-shirt is it just gives you an indication that like this these things are strong like they can actually the the fabric is good enough that you can put it through the wash of bazillion times and you're just fine now if that's the case though that means that you have to spend the extra coin generally here's the brutal truth these t-shirts MSRP retail are like 40 or 50 dollars like that's a lot for a t-shirt you actually can go to Nordstrom Rack or their sales that happen every year I would wait for one of those sales and they drop the price of these to like somewhere like $30 so my recommendation would be to wait a little bit and then get t-shirt in one of those sales again I'd point that Nordstrom Rack is one of those places to get it I would also recommend that you get the main colors now you know you've seen in my stack here I have black navy gray white I mean that's about is that's about as universal unit you can wear those with pretty much any outfit whether you're indoors and in a quarantine in front of webb-kim or you're you know when we've got back out there you're like out and about and you just have a t-shirt and a jacket or something like those colors will work with pretty much anything it is gonna be more expensive than other brands but your most of that money is going towards the quality and the design and not so much the brand yet I think they haven't quite gotten to that point yet and so for me like these have outlived the the reigning champ stuff has outlived Nike stuff for me neatest stuff for me you know gap and then or public j.crew like that's that's the sort of stuff I used to have and I think this is kind of the next step and I don't regret taking that next step during this time I hope everyone enjoys their loungewear cuz they super comfortable yet super fashionable and yeah so there it is reigning champ is one of my favorite things I'm mark Kwok I'll see you the next one [Music]", "yBGgKActrYU": "we all have recommendations from a Google review to Yelp to even someone just posting about it on Instagram we live in

sure to hit that subscribe button because I make content like this all the time but in today's video we're having a little faceoff of who makes the best budget white t-shirt as you guys may have noticed in my last several your girl has been scooping up a lot of white t-shirts and that's because it really is the go-to basic of the season a lot of publications were reporting that it was supposed to be the year at the tank top that's we're seeing on all the spring runway shows but like I've said in other videos that all changed when Meghan Margo was seen on one zoom meeting wearing a white t-shirt so now it's absolutely everywhere we've been seeing celebrities even Quarantine styling white t-shirts different ways so I wanted to see for the money from brands like Target Walmart hmm and more who made the best budget white teeth I spent my coin so you guys don't have to as always I will link everything in the description box and for size reference in this video I'm between 5 2 and 5 3 I'm very short I weigh around one hundred and forty five pounds and I'm typically a dress size 6 I'll share my sizes as we go because it does vary from brand to brand so now let's go ahead and hop in the video so when I was planning for this video I really thought that I was gonna choose one favorite but as I discovered ordering a bunch of white t-shirts and different styles some are better for different outfits so instead I'm gonna break this down more by category and then at the end I'll share with you guys my favorites out of everything so starting with the top that I have on this cropped pocket boyfriend tee this is from Walmart and it's around $8 but you could normally catch on rollback for even cheaper than that I did get my in a size medium but I could have definitely gone with a small this shirt is 100% cotton as well and I am so obsessed with this style if you guys have seen my last Walmart haul you know that I went kind of crazy and I bought this literally in every color that I could find it first of all of the boxy oversize style are what's really popular for 2020 I also find this to be very flattering on my body type because it is on the more cropped side and you can still see my waist especially if I do decide to do like a little front tuck the sleeve also hits me lower which I find extremely flattering it does have a drop sleeve some of these tees as you're gonna see don't hit me necessarily in the best spot for my arms but this one really does and it's the main reason why I absolutely love this style it does also of course have the pocket another pocket white team that I have is from Target and if you're more into feminine styles this is definitely the one that I would go with it does taper in a little more at the waist and it does have a scoop on the bottom and set up just the straight across crop and the sleeves do cuff up you can't undo this by the way it is how the shirt actually comes but I do like that this fabric is a little different from any of the other shirts in this video and that's because it's 50% linen so it does give it a little bit more texture than any of the other shirts the other 50% is polyester by the way and I did get this in a size small and it's around 16 dollars out of all the white t-shirts in the video this is really the one to me that screamed summer so I definitely like that about it it is on the more see-through side so I would expect to wear a white or nude bra or to wear a cami underneath it honestly out of all of these even a thicker ones I would still expect to wear a white or new bra but especially this one is more see-through and I do honestly grab for it often like I said if you're a more into feminine styles this is the one that I would go with and my last pocket tee I did order from Amazon and it's the jockey brand I bought in the medium and it was $13 to be honest I'm pretty disappointed in this shirt I was hoping to have it be comparable to the shirt that I have on but first of all it does fit very small I would definitely size up in this if I had to do it again also it has the word jockey across the pocket which it did not show on it was on this show that this was a completely white pocket now they don't even sell this shirt at all so I'm not even sure I can return this but I'm a try and it's not that it's the world's most terrible quality white t-shirt but I personally just don't really want to walk around in a jockey on the pocket Amazons brand daily ritual has a cropped pocket tee that I would recommend instead of this jockey one the website listed as a cotton in Modell's blend which is my absolute favorite that's what gives it that nice stretch and it just feels really smooth but I definitely would skip this so another Amazon white tee is this one and it was $60 and I did get this in a size large and yes I said large because this is a pretty small shirt it's 65% polyester 30% cotton and 5% spandex I love fabrics that either have spandex in them or they have a spandex feel it's super comfortable and I really love that the tied detail is already built in on this one I normally have to tie up my t-shirt so I like that this one already came with that with that being said I do feel like this is a really small I'd also wear it with high-waisted jeans or even some high waisted leggings but to do it again I would size up I do really like it though and they have this in a ton of different colors in different patterns in this same style so I'm definitely gonna order more of them but I'm personally gonna go with an extra large so next onto just the plain scoop neck tee that's what I did get from Amazon Amazon does sell them in a two-pack so I did go with this oatmeal color and you can get two white ones though and I know this is a video about white tee shirts but I absolutely love it in this oatmeal color as well and I did get both of these in a size small because I read their reviews that this is supposed to be a lot more fitted and more snug so that's just what I went with but if you don't want to just tie it just size one up although I do really like this fit both of them are a cotton and Modell blend and that's what gives the fabric comes done so much stretch and honestly you guys be sure to feel like butter and I really do love these shirts with that being said I understand that this is sleeve in particular hits my arm at the widest part and it's not necessarily the most flattering sleeve it also very see-through so I know I'll have to wear a lighter bra with this but these are still some of my favorite shirts in the whole video next I have the basic white scoop neck from H&M and I got this one in a size medium it's also 100% cotton I really love this shirt and it was only $4.99 you guys this one isn't as tight so even though the sleep still hits me at the widest part like the last one it's not as obvious as the Amazon one and overall it's a lot more loose fitting of a shirt I think both of these are fantastic options actually so it really just depends if you're wanting a tight scoop neck shirt or if you just want something that's a bit looser and overall has a more casual look okay onto v-necks although I find v-necks to probably be the most flattering neckline myself I really didn't think I would love them as much as I liked all of these options so my first one is from Old Navy and I got it in a size medium it's 95% rayon and 5% spandex so that does make the fabric very yummy and I don't even know what other word to use besides Yummie I'm absolutely obsessed with this white t-shirt it does have a lot of stretch and it is pretty big on me so to do it again I would size down in this and although it does have shorter sleeves because it is looser I find it to be more flattering than some of the other cap sleeves and the fabric is a lot thicker on this one too so my next Phoenix is from Walmart and it's the time and true brand and this was only five dollars you guys and I did size up and get this in a large so I could tie it up but these shirts do run true to size so keep that in mind it's 60% cotton and 40% polyester and you guys this really is the shirt that started all for me this is the first white shirt that I bought this season and I do really like it it's very inexpensive if you're looking for just a plain white v-neck this one probably is your best option and now comparing it to targets version I bought this one in the men's section it's the Goodfellow brand and I got it in a size medium and it's also only five dollars I did get it from the men's section because I just couldn't find anything comparable to this in the women's section this shirt is also 60% cotton and 40% polyester a target one because it's from the man section might be like a centimeter longer so I think my favorite still is the white boyfriend pocket tee that I have on I feel like this is just gonna look good on absolutely everyone plus it really is on trend and it's very inexpensive for scoop-neck tees I'm probably gonna have to give that today H&M one just because it is a little looser that I feel like it looks slightly more flattering on me the name is on a central one but just know that I do absolutely love this one and I know I'm gonna wear it often and for v-necks y'all gonna have to hands down give this one to Old Navy one it's just a much higher quality shirt that's it for today's video please comment below which white t-shirt was your favorite I would love to hear what you guys think also if you guys are wanting to see a styling video on how I would style some of these four different outfits please let me know below and I'm happy to make that be sure to subscribe if you guys enjoyed this video and haven't done so yet thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you on my next video", "LFyRo7ycDxU": "Hey guys I'm Summer from Bella + Canvas\nand we've spent years educating customers on the different types of cotton. Do you know\nthe difference between carded open-end ring-spun and heirloom combed and ring-spun?\nIf not in this video will be extremely useful for you. We're gonna compare how a\nscreen print and DTG print perform on these three types of cotton. Cole from\nShirt Agency is gonna show us how these different types of cotton print\nbut before we get started we just want to explain the differences in these\nqualities of cotton. So first you have your card at open end, your card at open\nend is your cheap scratchy heavier t-shirt? Yeah and then from there a lot\nof our retail customers have moved on to ring-spun because it has a much smoother\nsurface. And the next step up from ring spun is your heirloom combed and ring\nspun. And with ring-spun you can comb out one percent and still call it combed and\nring spun. But we actually comb out about 25 percent of the cotton that we start\nwith because it contains impurities that we don't want in that finished product.\nAnd we also only use long staple cotton which has a huge effect on the final\nresult so you end up with the smoothest printing surface possible. Yeah we\nabsolutely love printing on your guy's garments we get a really nice hand and\nfeel and our prints are really sharp. Today we're gonna show the comparison on\nthese three types of cotton that we talked about with a DTG print a plastisol print and discharge print so let's go see the results. So we have our\nplastisol prints hot off the press what are we looking at here? Well the\nmain thing good check out is on the carded open end when you look through\nthe loop you can see all the different fibers affecting the texture of the last\nscreen printing. And then obviously when you touch it with your hand it's got a\nrougher finish. Yeah you can definitely see some of the red fibers coming\nthrough mm-hmm. And moving on to the ring-spun one it is a little bit better but\nit's not necessarily like the best it could be. There's a little bit of\nfibrillation still happening and that's causing a little bit of a hand feel. And\nwhen you move on to the heirloom it's basically just a completely sharp\nfinished surface and on your hand it feels extremely smooth. So next we'll\nlook at our discharge print how does discharge differ from plastisol?\nSo with discharge instead of putting the ink on top like plastisol. We're\nactually removing the dye from the garment. So this to be honest isn't so\nmuch about the fibers anymore. This is about the quality of the dye and the\nquality of the base garment. So you can see with the heirloom we got a pretty\nclean sharp result with the discharge and then moving on to the ring-spun it's\na pretty similar result but we got a little bit more of the blue staying\nthrough it doesn't look like the true discharge. And then carded open-end\nnormally means that it's like a cheap shirt so we got a really nasty color on\nthis one which was a bit of a surprise. And I think that comes down to the\nquality of the dyes that they're using. Yeah how you dye the shirts is just as\nimportant as how you knit the shirt. So at bella canvas we dye everything in LA so\nwe can main that level of consistency and basically match all of our colors so\nyou have this quality when you have your discharge print. Alright and the third\nprint we did was a DTG or a direct to garment print. So what do you want to\nlook for in a shirt when DTG printing? Well the problem with direct to garment\nfor us pretty much all the time is with brightness. And so we had a pretty great\nresult with the heirloom cotton compared to the carded open-end. I think a lot of\nthat has to do with the tightness of the weave and the ink kind of falling into\nthe fabric. So with DTG it's more important than the other types of screen\nprinting to have a super tight knit weave since the ink lays on top of the\nfabric. Yeah and you already have such a high ink cost what DTG that your product\ncan't be sold for very cheap. And since you're not gonna be doing promo with DTG\nI would think that it makes sense to almost exclusively use a nicer ring spun\nor airlume t-shirt. Hope you guys enjoyed this video.

Be Different.", "pT-l_XSqq18": "especially returning these these don't buy the Hutton these t-shirts are hot garments like don't even buy those YouTube what is going on in Detroit GZ in AEG bean Kesey and in today's video we're gonna be trying on all of these t-shirts all these white tees that are either from H&M Zara in your knee glow and we're trying to find out which one is the best white t-shirt for your essential wardrobe rotation going through different fabrics price and also the fitting so let's go ahead and talk about it before watching this video is that in my personal opinion there really is no such thing as a perfect white t-shirt that can last you for decades not really anyway or not not necessarily one brand name that I have gone to because if there was I would have found it by now and a big reason behind making this video is that a lot of people are curious as far as what the differences are between these white shirts compared to another brand just putting that out there so anyways let's go ahead and do this just a zoom out here real quick okay so the way we're gonna format this I'm just gonna go shirt by shirt try them on and we're gonna go through some categories like fit price comfort ability and also things like fabric if I leave out any of those details in a particular t-shirt we could talk about it in the comment section below okay first up we got these through neck dry color t-shirts by you to blow and I bought a large and I bought an extra-large I've never tried them on as full crew I've never even seen this actually this is kind of like in their pajama section seven dollars and ninety cents almost ten bucks per shirt maybe there's two of them in here I don't know what about to find I was going to open this up I'm hoping that these are returnable though got it fabric is not bad it's kind of soft not bad it does look a little bit see-through mind go ahead and try this one on first this is a size large by the way alright for the sake of this video I'm taking my chain off it's a little too thin for me it definitely feels way more of a kind of feels like a pajama like I just kind of mentioned if I'm looking in the mirror biggest drawback to this is that you can actually see my wife beater underneath like look how see-through that it's like I bet you if I didn't have this wife beater on could totally seen it would I absolutely hate what teachers do that like it sucks it looks really stupid I look stupid you look sooo the Libyan rebels you already know what it is let's just try on the extra large for kicks and giggles anyway but we already know that this t-shirt is just not it okay this one's looking a little more promising as I'm trying it on as far as size goes I mean extra large honestly fits like a large I'm a my true to size is a large I bet you through the camera you can see my pants can you see my pants like if you can see your pants through the t-shirt or through the t-shirt no this it's an automatic no like I just like nipples and pants you can see my nipples and you can see my boxers and pants through your t-shirt then you shouldn't even be wearing a t-shirt doesn't even make sense I would say for sure these are more of like a pajama and I don't even know for sure if they are for pajamas or not the only Plus that I would say to this t-shirt that I do like is that this collar is actually kind of tight the neck area actually stays the same size as the size large which I like because if I end up sizing up maybe to a double X which I don't even think they have double exit you know go for this t-shirt and I was looking at the top and there was just only XL ring of the next day is the same size which is good because if you end up getting two sizes up are size up the the ring of the next not gonna get like you know two inches bigger an inch bigger kind of suck sometimes good then you can see your collarbone I mean that's great but that is enough for me to keep this t-shirt where you can see nips wife-beater boxers and pants no go I'm gonna put this one to the side for now okay so this is the super thin Yuna globe t-shirt you see my hand like you can you can see my hand right okay so then now we're gonna put the thicker one on here hold on now can you see my hand it's way harder so like clearly this one is like way thicker so just the thin t-shirts like just stay away from these these suck okay next brand we got up is we're gonna talk about Zara and we bought one t-shirt out of this whole stack of t-shirts that is from Zara and this is actually a shirt that I'm very familiar with so let's go ahead and try it on first still got the tag on I'm already I'm keepin the shirt I already know I am because I own I own a couple of these and reason why I absolutely love these shirts is because they're not seeing through very different than what we just tried on this one you can't see through it and if you can't comment and let me know that you can see this I mean as far as I know you can't see my wife later you probably can't see my pants either also I like the fit too it's not like boxy not like crazy boxy words like too high here this is a size large but it does fit between like large and XL if that if that's not even like really a size but if I were to just like give you a gauge of what it kind of fits like and I love that I love that it comes down to here cuz it covers up my farmers can just keep it in one it doesn't rise that's too high doesn't rise down too low not trying to be like too trendy I love it the fabric is also very soft these do come in at a whopping $20 and also a very quick tip for this t-shirt from Zara is that they make them usually in like three colors black white I think like a beige color and I think that's it but as far as I know right now these are kind of like year-round because when I first started buying these shirts ending 2017 beginning 2018 I started buying these shirts from Zara and these are not like the cheap shirts because they make like three or four different batches of different types of white t-shirts they have ones that are super see-through they suck they have like elongated ones I pass on those samples with zippers I also pass on those but this is just like your regular mundane white t-shirt but it's like a little bit of fabric softening is actually very nice too for some people you might even eat the size down but for me I just go true to size I go with a large it works for me and also best thing about it is if you wash it and dry it it doesn't wrinkle as much especially for being you know it being a cheaper t-shirt $20 t-shirt it is what it is I love it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next shirt we got up is another unit load shirt I literally bought these without without even looking at them and I didn't know it came with a pocket tried my best not to buy t-shirts for this video with pockets but you know we're already here at this point we already have both of the t-shirts in a size large and also an XL let me try on the size large first size large it does look a little oversized already kind of even bigger than the shirt that I have on and also it looks a little bit more boxy but let's go ahead and try it on and see how this goes and wow this is very this is like pretty oversized hold on it's all it's oversized I'm very boxy actually well I'm not bad I'm kind of impressed to be honest it's not a bad shirt this is a little longer than what we just tried on but it's actually not really like technically boxy because it has this little I don't know what you call this it has like a break here and then it comes down lower in the back but which is which is kind of cool if you're looking for a boxy t-shirt and if you're at Uniqlo I would try these out in addition to that I would say the fabric is pretty nice the fabric is a little thinner than these are t-shirt that I just tried on I don't know how these will hold up in the wash way better than the like pajama type t-shirt and I don't know if you can see can you see my wife beater through it if I do this and you can see the wife beater then it's bad if I do that obviously because you know you see the crease there but if you can see right through it I'm assuming you can't because the fabric is like a little bit thicker I guess right not bad I would say the only thing pushing me away from buying this is this whole little trendy thing I've kind of stayed away from buying t-shirts that do this like little breakage here because I'm really just not into it anymore it just kind of reminds me of going to Zara and then paying for those are teas that have like zippers and weird cuts and kind of like dated back like four or five years I just try to stay away from those and just try to get like regular t-shirts also if you like cigarette holder pocket King that's also a cool thing too I also stay away from t-shirts that have these pockets I don't know why I don't I don't use the pocket much I don't smoke cigarettes I don't have anything light enough to put in my pocket if that makes sense okay we can go ahead and try on the extra-large anyway even though the large fits we can go ahead and try on the extra-large just to show you the size difference seeing that this is an extra-large I'm already we already know this is gonna be huge but anyways this is yeah it's just it's a little too boxy for me the large fit extra-large probably pass on it let's go ahead and move on to the next shirt okay next t-shirt up is from H&M not much to say about it other than the fact that I just I literally walked right eighty-thousand where's the white t-shirts found it purchased it and I just kind of held it up against my body the launch looked too small I only grabbed an extra large so I don't have large and extra-large to compare today so let's go ahead and try this on and then see the difference so as we know when it comes to like the tiers of fast fashion you talked about hmm chuckles ara you know globe whatever other fast fashion houses there are out there those are like the top three in tears it's like you know close at the top bars in the middle and sometimes they battle between top and middle and then H&M is pretty much the bottom of the barrel when it comes to that depending on the item of course all of you eyes I would say this is way thinner this fits and feels exactly like you know Glo JAMA t-shirt that is super thin it literally feels like it's from the same exact Factory my guess is that if I end up washing this and drying it it's it's like toast like literally it is probably a t-shirt that you can only wear once and then once you dry it comes out of the dryer it's like all crinkled and then on top of all of that hmm ste shirt is see-through you can totally see through it if I didn't have my wife beater on you would see nibbles and I'm telling you right now nobody on my channel would want to see that it is but if you really are I guess Ram conscious or a brand loyal to H&M and if you really want to get these shirts I would say size up this extra-large definitely feels like a large to me doesn't really feel like an XL this feels like more of like a pajama t-shirt not even for sports more pajamas a shirt that you just don't care about next shirt okay so the next and final shirt that we have up here is again from Uniqlo we're going back to Uniqlo really quick I've really wanted to talk about these because these have kind of been in conversation with a couple other channels and then also some of my friends have been wearing these as well and they've been recommending this t-shirt to me these are a little bit thicker than the previous Uniqlo t-shirts that we're talking about here today but they're a different fabric they are called crewneck short sleeve t-shirt I mean I hate when they can you give it a different name let's let's just try it on entertain myself a little bit here I'm gonna try the XL on before I try the large on even though I've never tried XL on before so the XL is actually not that bad sizing wise can't see through it right well I can't anyway it's a little too thick for you to see through this is definitely gonna be a lot warmer of a t-shirt compared to the others I would definitely not name this as a pajama t-shirt a lot thicker than actually a majority of the t-shirts that we try on here today but the only difference between this and the others are a t-shirt and you know glow like trendy fitting shirt which I will maybe give the name here is that the fabric on this is a little bit rougher on the skin it's definitely not like a soft fabric this kind of feels like like recycled fabric if like against your skin it does anyway and then also it doesn't like when you do this I know this is like a straight really strange example but when the fabric kind of rubs against your pants and also either a wife-beater underneath and stuff it just it feels like a fabric is gripping on to whatever other fabric it's touching I still prefer the Zara t-shirt over this one as far as fabric goes and also fit even though this is an extra large not really too bad of a fit I would say but let's go ahead and try all the large this is the XL let's see what the large fits like okay this is a lot smaller okay the large large works I think I think large is what do you guys think it's hard to maybe harder to tell on camera but I guess if you want the oversize fit then go for the XL or go for the size up these fit pretty true to size like this is a very true to size large I would say it definitely has a different feel since it does feel a little bit smaller than the extra-large the same specs as this this is just a large compared to an XL it kind of works out it's not bad whether or not I'll keep this one hard to say I have to I have to sleep on this one I don't know it's not it's definitely not perfect the fit is nice the collar is nice you definitely get a thicker color on these on these you do glow ones and you kind of get like this human-made looking collar the collar is a little bit tighter than the Zara one that I like so much out of this bunch but as far as like fabric goes I don't really like this fabric that much I do like the Zara one a little better because it's a lot softer than this one in particular [Music] it's my shirt here real quick yeah just have to kind of summarize this whole thing and I've been wanting to make a video like this for a long time and making a video like this just before we talk about the rest of this here is very difficult because there's too many variations when it comes to white t-shirt and also there is a lack of affordable essential t-shirts that are good geordie I would say 90% 99% besides the one percent that I want to talk about here today I actually like and I will actually keep I'm literally only going to keep one of these t-shirts and it's actually originally the t-shirt that I liked to begin with the Uniqlo one's fabric really isn't soft enough compared to the Zara t-shirt and also the Uniqlo t-shirt that had the better fabric ended up having like that really weird cut on the side of the t-shirt I'm not really a big fan of that those those type of teachers to me just feel a little bit too trendy and I'd like my t-shirts to just be regular mundane shirt instead of like some like fad fit if that's like the right words for it out of the bunch the best one is the Zara t-shirt I don't always shop as ara I know I've made a couple videos either about Zara I do talk about Zara some of my flannels suffer from Zara but you know Zara has a good like 3% of their products that I like okay the rest of them are a little bit too trendy for me and usually the quality is checked a little bit too low but as far as the Zara teacher goes compared to the rest of them I would say the thick is true to size and also the fabric is soft enough I know for a fact that these kind of last through the storm of washing them over and over and over and over and them also keeping the same shape and not wrinkling so much because of whatever particular fabric this is I think in total today I spent like how much should I spend I probably spent like over 100 it's like 120 if you're wondering yes I'm returning stuff especially returning these these don't buy these don't buy these you see these crewneck dry dry color teeth don't buy these these are these are these are pretty bad trends trash if you want to show nipples in your t-shirt and you want to show your belt while wearing the t-shirt at the same time then go ahead and buy these but if not then t-shirts are hot garbage like well don't even buy those so with all that was said today make sure you guys are girls keep the lock right here for our latest information from clothing music to culture it is your boy and I'll see you next time peace Stosh it minute yeah wait a minute we don't say whatever happened to coming into Thomas

is about $3 so which\none do you buy if you knew the cheaper one would shrink after one wash would\nthat affect your decision we're about to unravel the truth behind what makes a\nt-shirt last for the long haul in this episode of our series ask first them but\nbefore we get into it hit that subscribe button unfortunately shrinkage is common with\nfabrics containing cotton unless manufacturers like bellick canvas take\npreventive measures against it the reason natural fibers like cotton shrink\nis because the fibers want to return to their natural state during the fabric\nmaking process when fibers are spun into thread there's a lot of tension put on\nthe fibers and they stretch out beyond their natural length then when fibers\nare warmed by warm water or a hot dryer during the drying process they try to\nreturn to their original state and in turn cause your clothes to shrink the\nreason that more expensive preshrunk cotton does not shrink in the dryer is\nbecause of a process that takes place during the fabric finishing process\nwhich basically gets the fabric to return to its natural state before the\ngarment is sewn with us you want maximum shrinkage of 5 percent while the cheaper\nbrands out there can shrink up to 10 that's basically a hole size we've\ninvested in top-of-the-line equipment that sets the industry benchmark for\nminimal shrinkage first we over stretch the fabric width wise to compensate for\nall the length tension it had in the previous processes next it goes through\nshrink drying chambers in which air blowers tumble the fabric and heat\ntriggers the cotton to revert to its natural state as it shrinks and dries\nthe fabric kind of like a super fancy industrial version of your dryer at home\nthese shrink dryers are a million dollars so it's no wonder mini\nmanufactures skip this step or do their own subpar version of it next the fabric\ngoes through compactor which compresses the length of the fabric using steam\nmaking it physically shorter since the length is where most of the shrinkage\ntends to occur this ensures that when a tee comes to you the fabric has been\nshrunk both lengthwise and widthwise we guarantee a shrinkage rate of five by\nfive meaning the absolute most it will shrink is five percent in both the\nlength and the wet it's always good to leave a little room for shrinkage so you\ndon't have the opposite problem which would be the tee stretching out have you\never had a side seam tee where after a wash that side seam isn't quite on the\nside anymore this happens but non croissant fabric returns to its original\nstate pulling the seam along with it through a\nshrink drying process by stretching and shrinking the fabric\nprior to sewing we eliminate any torque or twisting of the fabric after it's\nbeen washed at home I'm sure if you have a belly canvas tee at home\nyou notice how little it shrinks compared to other brands in your drawer\nthat's because we are the only manufacturer that is invested in\ntop-of-the-line preshrunk dryers like we've just shown you with us we want\nwhat you see to be what you get with no surprises when you take our teas home a\ntea like ours that looks just as awesome after multiple washes as it does right\nout of the box it's just one of the things that separates us from them next\nweek is our last episode of this series and we're talking about

look at three different plain white t-shirts from Uniqlo you guys already know how much I love Uniqlo I think they make amazing products amazing clothes prices that are affordable for most people and you guys also know how much I love plain white t-shirts I wear them pretty much every single day and in fact this one that I'm wearing right now is one of the ones that we'll be discussing in this video today the three white t-shirts that I chose for today's video are some of Uniqlo's most basic plain white t-shirts and I chose these because I think that they're the most versatile they don't have any pockets they're pretty basic in their cut and in their silhouette so I think that these are the ones that a lot of you guys will choose if you guys plan on buying some of these plain white t-shirts as well but if you guys want me to review some of uni clothes more Craigie or seasonal white t-shirts I can do those as well because I do own a few of those as well just let me know in the comment box down below and I'll be sure to make that happen also if you guys like this type of video go ahead and hit that thumbs up button because it really does help me out it helps more people find this video it helps the channel grow so I'd really really appreciate it the three shirts that I chose from Uniqlo are the package tri plain tee this is the crewneck version I also chose the FEMA cotton T which is the shirt that Uniqlo is very known for and the last one is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt and before we get started I just want to mention that I am a little over 5 feet 9 inches as of making this video I'm around 165 pounds so that should give you guys an idea of how these shirts fit me and how they might fit you as well and yeah that's about it let's get started so the first shirt is this Uniqlo package dry crewneck shirt this also comes in a v-neck variation which should be similar if not exactly the same except for the collar and this is the cheapest shirt out of the three that I'm going to show you guys today coming in at around five dollars and ninety cents in the US and here in the Philippines where I'm from it comes in at 290 casos making it the most affordable out of the bunch and this is the one that I was actually the most excited about because I haven't tried the shirt the other two I do own so I've you know I have a lot of experience with it but this is my first time actually trying the shirt so yeah I'm really excited about it so I'm gonna start off with the things that I really really like about the shirt and right off the bat I love the fit of the shirt I like the length it falls around mid crotch for me you know this is where my belt is and I like the length of the sleeves as well they also are not too loose not too tight which I do like it's very it's a very regular fit but it fits really nicely and I'm actually very happily surprised about how the shirt feels so yeah I'm really happy about the fit of the shirt the next thing you'll notice is the sort of the quality or the thickness of the material itself and in comparison to the supima tee that I'm used to this is thinner and you could also say it's a little rougher than the supima tee which may not necessarily be a bad thing because if you're not comparing the two side-by-side you won't really notice the difference because it is still very soft now it is also a little thinner so as you can see it's a little see-through that may or may not be a deal-breaker for you for me it's not particularly you know too much of a negative and in fact in the Philippines ran from sometimes these lighter materials even if they're technically not as good as heavier weight materials can be really nice in the heat you know walking around outside so yeah I really really really really dig the shirt overall I'm very very pleased with this I think it's a very first house shirt you can use it for a lot of things yeah that's pretty much it I really like the shirt and at the price I don't think you wrong with with this with a shirt at all the next t-shirt is the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo this is the famous two pima cotton tee it's very very soft it's very very nice and this in particular is my everyday white t-shirt this one comes in at around nine dollars and ninety cents u.s. and here in the philippines it comes at five hundred and ninety pesos making it sort of the middle range between all these three shirt shirts but yeah I really love the shirt again it's my everyday shirt very very comfortable so let's just get straight into the look in the field first off right off the bat you'll see that the length is very similar to the previous tee to the dry package tee it comes down around mid crotch here the sleeves come around mid bicep and again not too tight not too loose the shoulders are just the right size for me this is a large by the way so all of the shirts that I'm fitting today are large because I'm generally a little bit bigger in the chest and in the shoulders yeah very very nice now in comparison to the previous shirt this is very noticeably a lot softer and a lot thicker in terms of material I did buy a brand new one because I do have a bunch of these but you know there are shirts that have been wearing for a long time now so I wanted to make this video with a brand new shirt just to see how one feels right off the bat and there it is super nice you can see it's not really transparent if it is it's very very little and you know it takes a lot to see that so it is a lot of thicker a lot softer and it feels a lot more durable than the first one but again you know it really depends if what you're looking for if you wear your white tee shirts a lot what you're gonna use them for so if you don't wear your white t-shirt often and you just want to have one in the closet you know you can go either of two ways you can just get this one which is a little bit more expensive but since you don't wear too much and you know you're not going to be spending a lot on my t-shirts you might want to spend a little bit more for this so that when you do wear it it is you know a little nicer a little bit more durable or you can go the other way you wear you know since you don't wear too much you don't really care for that slight bit of extra durability and quality you might just go with the cheaper one they're both great options at this point what I can say is that I'm not sure how the packaged dry shirt wear is over time but for me in particular I have a bunch of these supima shirts some of them are some of them are actually maybe two or more years old and I still wear them until today they fit very well still they basically lasted a long time especially you know this year where I'm wearing white t-shirts almost every day they've they've been very very good so that's it that is number two the supima cotton tee from Uniqlo the third and final shirt of the bunch is this one this is the newest shirt of the bunch in terms of when they came out this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve tunic shirt and there are many differences between the shirt and the other two shirts but I think that this is one of the shirts that they might keep in their lineup for a long time so I decided to show you guys this shirt as well now this shirt is also a large and in terms of price it comes in at around fourteen dollars and ninety cents in the US but the strange thing is here in the Philippines this comes in at the same price as a subcommittee at around five hundred and ninety pesos so I think we're pretty lucky here in the Philippines for that to be the case and I don't really know why that is but I'm pretty happy about it so again this is the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt short sleeve crew neck shirt and the big difference between this and the other shirts are I think what Uniqlo is going with the shirt is they were trying to do sort of a more retro feeling plain shirt and they do that through having this thicker material so the other two are sort of a soft more modern material I guess you could call it a more modern blend making it very soft making making it comfortable but this one purposely gives you a rough texture a heavy material giving you that sort of more more retro feel the shape is also not as form-fitting as the previous two it's a little bit more boxy as you guys can see the sleeves are a little tiny bit longer tiny bit looser so was the body area and again this is a large but it's supposed to fit that way it dropped a little lower in the crotch and yeah it's a little heavier a little rougher but I do like the shirt because it gives you that you know it gives you that retro look it's a completely different look it looks very very relaxed and as you guys know I love wearing cargo shorts and sure it fits the aesthetic really well so if you guys are more laid-back and you like this casual retro look the shirt might be the one for you now even though this shirt is heavier is thicker it's not like the thickest thing in the world and there is a certain level of lightness to it so they could have made this a lot thicker but they didn't which I actually do really really appreciate especially again here in the Philippines with all the heat yeah here's here's how it looks super nice super comfortable and this is one of the shirts that are in my er rotation I actually only have one of these in my current rotation so I'm happy to have another one after purchasing this one so this is nice some of you guys might actually like the shirt more than the other two and I think that's you know not a bad thing it's a great option there you go so that's it guys that is my comparison of the three plain white tee shirts from Uniqlo the package dry shirt the supima cotton tee as well as this the Uniqlo u crew neck shirt if you guys found this helpful if you guys enjoyed the video let me know by giving me a thumbs up and if you guys want to see reviews of more seasonal shirts from Uniqlo leave those in the comment box down below I'll be sure to make those happen if you guys want me to and yeah that's it for this video subscribe if you haven't yet I'll leave links down below to everything that I mentioned this video and I'll see you guys super super soon", "7PaZotmqcgE": "how's it going guys welcome to the starving student reviews today we're going to be talking about the t-shirt a [Music] white t-shirt is something that's very important in everybody's wardrobe it's just a staple that's very versatile something that you can pair with jeans or chinos or pretty much anything else that you have in your closet to me it's kind of like a blank canvas that I can pair with whatever I want I know that all over the internet you can find varying reviews of the best white t-shirt and which one is the best for you but today I thought it would be better to kind of narrow it down to two t-shirts that I have found work very well for me in my wardrobe both of the t-shirts behind me come from the brand Yoona glow which as I've already mentioned is a well known brand for making high quality products at a very affordable price the t-shirt behind me to my left is from Uniqlo U which is a collaboration with the high-end designer Christophe Lamar and is known for its aesthetic and it's high-quality fabric and the one behind me to my right is the Uniqlo supima cotton tee which is known for its soft fill and durability I will be grading these based off of my usual criteria one being the quality construction to being the fit and three being the price so let's get right into it so let's start out with the construction on this Uniqlo you t-shirt this is definitely withstood the test of time as I've had it for over a year and it's had hardly any signs of wear the stitching is very even and uniform throughout and I haven't had any loose threads it's made of a very heavy weight cotton which is very durable and nice if you want to get longevity out of your t-shirt but it definitely doesn't come near to the comfort of the supima cotton t-shirt however I would say in terms of construction this t-shirt wins over the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt just because it seems like there was a lot more detail on thought put into the materials and the quality of manufacturing moving on to the construction of the unicloset pima cotton t-shirt i've had this for about six to eight months and it's also held up very well the stitching also seems to be very neat and uniform throughout the garment which makes it drape very nicely and it fits very very well I do think that the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt takes the cake the area of comfort the cotton that they use on this t-shirt is very stretchy and very comfortable and just feels almost like a second skin when you're wearing it so that's it for construction now let's move into the price the Uniqlo you t-shirt is a little bit more expensive at $15 whereas the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt comes in at just $10 so if you're looking at both of these t-shirts in terms of the price they're definitely very comparable and neither one of them I don't think it's going to break your bank now let's move on to the third category which is the fit and which I think will be the most important factor in deciding which one of these two t-shirts best suits your style the Uniqlo you t-shirt has a very oversized feel to it it has a very thick neck band and has kind of drop shoulders which make it look a little more oversized and it has a very straight cut in the body which makes it drape very loosely but also very comfortably it definitely looks oversized but doesn't look so oversized that it looks baggy or like it doesn't fit I would definitely recommend this for somebody who has more of a stocky build or wants something that drapes more loosely and is more on trend with what's fashionable right at the moment the supima cotton t-shirt on the other hand is a very classic t-shirt it hugs the body everywhere and is pretty slim fitting throughout it definitely fits well on the shoulders I really like that the collar is very close to the neck so it looks very flattering and just overall fits very well and this is definitely what you want to go for if you're a slimmer build or want something that's more timeless and is it is trendy so if I had to choose between these two shirts I would personally go with the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt as it is a little bit cheaper and it fits my personal style however I think that they're both a great choice and they're both very affordable and you're getting a lot of value out of your money both of these t-shirts I think are on the top tier of what you can buy in this price range let me know what you think about these t-shirts in the comments and please remember to like and subscribe thanks for watching", "zF8jxGJGCIo": "what is up design family and welcome to another episode of fit design TV so happy to have you here on today's episode we'll be looking at cotton and polyester through the lens of a sportswear designer if you guys are wondering which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sports or collection watch this video you're gonna find out [Music] welcome to fit design TV on this channel we'll explore what it takes to make it as an active wear fashion brand whilst providing tips tricks and actionable steps towards starting your own product line whether an entrepreneur look at the start your own brand or just someone interested in fitness fashion there's something for you here [Applause] [Music] cotton/polyester are often compared to contrasted just because they're so widely available on the market they're pretty much two of the most popular farmer types when making a selection on what fabrics to make there's a good reason for this and we'll go through it in this video the main difference that you need to know about these two fiber types is that cotton is a natural fiber versus polyester is a man-made or a synthetic fiber that we made in labs and those are pretty much the main core reasons as to what drives their differences we're looking at six different categories in terms of determining which of the two fiber types is most suitable for a sportswear application hopefully by the end you'll be able to make an educated decision on what is right for you we'll be looking at the durability of these two fiber types the temperature regulation of these two fiber types we'll also be looking at the comfort and feel of these two fiber types the ease of maintenance or cleaning the cost associated and last but not least the light weight this of these two fiber types we'll start off with number one the durability the durability has a lot to do with that cotton is naturally occurring and polyester is a synthetic fiber cotton will wear out over time a lot more easily than polyester while you'll notice with a new cotton t-shirt is it's good at retaining its shape up until a few washes at which point it begins to break down from a fiber standpoint it gets a lot more loose it starts to hang loosely it gets a lot softer and this is because it's just much more of a delicate fiber versus polyester which is polymer based it's synthetic fiber it's just going to have a lot more strength into your ability over time it's going to be able to withstand a lot more wear and tear which is important when it comes to sportswear design we're always active we're moving around we're putting our garments through a great ordeal of dynamic activity and our garments need to be able to match our need when it comes to stretch or movement or agility and if cotton is going to wear out over time you're going to notice your garment get looser it's not going to fit as well and it's just overall not gonna perform as well as it needs to perform versus polyester it's gonna go through a lot more wear and tear before it exhibits similar levels of deterioration polyester wins here next is temperature regulation if you know anything about the way that our bodies regulate temperature you know that we spell sweat through the surface of our skin and through the process of evaporation we move away heat from our bodies cotton is breathable which is a win for it in that regard however it absorbs moisture it doesn't wake moisture away from its surface puts it on the skin so what that ends up doing is it prevents the body from allowing sweat to evaporate away from the skin thereby allowing you to feel hotter which polyester doesn't do polyester is more thermal constricting up until a certain point so it'll make you feel hotter and a certain range of temperatures but it will allow you to quick sweat away to the surface of your skin which will allow it to evaporate it won't hold on to that moisture and it won't give you that hot look that cotton is going to do because cotton is just gonna want to absorb all this sweat or first is polyester which is going to wick that sweat away so coffin is much more suitable for neutral climates polyester on the other hand is going to be the more suitable for hot climates where you're going to want to sweat or cooler climates where you're going to want to constrain or restrict the movement of heat away from your body so if you want to look at it cotton is in the middle neutral and then plaster on either sides of the climate scale next we'll look at the comfort and feel comfort of your is a major reason why we select certain fabric and it's no different in this case polyester is known to be a bit more let's just say allergenic when it comes to the way it reacts with people's bodies yes it's silky and it's smooth but it does cause some irritation on a decent segment of the population there are many people that may overcome a certain level of irritation or just an overall mild discomfort with polyester based fabrics that they won't with the cotton content being durable sorry cotton being breathable and cotton being natural it just lends itself to being a lot more suitable for a wider range of skin types so cotton is going to get the edge in this regard cotton is just a generally more forgiving fabric when it comes to skin types and how it meshes with our bodies we also want to look at the ease of maintenance or cleaning like I mentioned cotton is just less durable so it's going to withstand less wear and tear that is afforded by washing whether it's a washing machine or your washing by hand you're going to wear out cotton and faster than polyester polyester though is more prone to deterioration from heat from high levels of heat because it's a polymer based compound it's going to be a lot more sensitive to heat which is also why you can't iron it nor should you iron it but the plus here is that you don't need to iron it whereas caught in wrinkles very easily needs constant care and attention to iron it polyester on the other hand doesn't you just have to be careful not to iron it because you will ruin the garment and not the subject the high levels of heat in a washing machine so it's a give and take here but generally polyesters is going to be easier to maintain over time we want to look at the cost cost is a complicated subject because there are a wide range of different qualities of polyester and cotton but if we're going to be very objective and comparing one to one generally cause it is more expensive than polyester because cotton is a naturally occurring fiber it's limited in our supply - what is available in terms of the agricultural landscape what is the local market able to offer us in terms of raw supply of cotton plant in order to create our cotton fiber needs versus polyester which is a polymer based compound we are able to make it a lot more freely and on our own terms so polyester is going to be cheaper in this regard however you can get better quality of polyester and at the same time you can get a better quality of cotton so it depends it is a give-and-take but I want to one buy a service gonna be cheaper the last is the lightweight nature of both garments hello cotton is more breathable on a meter per meter basis where both fabrics have the same thickness you're going to notice that polyester is going to be significant more lightweight again it is because of the fact that this is a synthetic fiber we're able we were able to create it and as lightweight a case as we can polyester generally is much more lightweight than cotton so for sure if you're going for a lightweight fabric and you want to have some thickness to it you want to go with polyester versus cotton that being said both fabric types or fiber types do have their applications in different cases but we generally do recommend polyester when looking at a core fiber type to incorporate your collection coffin is great for a certain level of tops or lightweight garments that you want to have in a situation where you want to have a natural fiber of your collection but for more of your heavy duty core essential garment types you want to look at polyester because it's going to perform in a way that is a lot more analogous with the needs of sportswear design hopefully guys that makes sense we've also done a video on polyester versus nylon because those are both synthetic fibers that often get compared we give you our verdict on that one highly recommend you check it out if you want us to compare and contrast any other fiber types leave it in the comments below we always love making these videos for you guys if we missed on anything again in the comments below thank you so much for tuning in to fit design TV until next time sails", "8LV0Tic6Cuo": "hello guys and welcome back to my channel so the perfect basic t-shirt is something that can be quite hard to find and especially if the perfect basic white t-shirt there are so many different fits qualities and price levels in this area so I hope this video will help you in the search for the perfect basic t-shirt so in this video I am gonna show and compare no less than five different white t-shirts and what all of these t-shirts have in common is that they are all from brands if you guys have recommended to me also they are all either responsibly made so they maybe come from a responsible brand or they are made in organic cutting so this was one of the criterias for me to do this test going for a sustainable basic item is one of the easiest steps towards a more sustainable and intentional way of consuming fashion and I think it's something that everyone can do because the price difference between these t-shirts that I have found today and the ones that are conventionally made are not even that big the way that we consume fashion in general today is very selfish because the cost for you yourself is much more important than the cusp of our environment or the people in the production and that's where I think that the industry desperately needs a change so again going for the most responsible alternative on the market is a great way of starting this journey and to support initiatives like organic cotton or more transparent production and other things like that moving on so I've gathered five of the most important criteria in this area and let's just go through them I'm so sorry about my voice is still a bit scruffy after being ill last week it's just not going away so the first criteria for the perfect basic white t-shirt is that the quality or the break mustn't be too stiff but it mustn't be too slinky either so it kind of has to be in between those two so I can slip the flapper got the t-shirt I definitely prefer cutting above anything else so everything in be scopes or polyester which are both not very sustainable ways of making fabric for a t-shirt it's just a no-go for me I prefer something that is at least 95% cotton and preferably organic cotton so let's move on to the third criteria which is all about the fit personally I like to go for probably what you would call a boyfriend fit so it has to be slightly boxy slightly oversized and it has to have this crew neck like the one that I'm wearing today so no deep scoop Knicks or anything like that the crew neck is definitely the number one type of neck when it comes to basic t-shirts for me so the fourth criteria is that the basic t-shirt should wash well so the seams should stay at the sides at all times they shouldn't move to like the center of your belly after washing them one or two times if the seams tend to move when you wash your t-shirts lettuce happen a sign of poor quality and it's something that I myself have experienced when I buy t-shirts from very cheap high street brands finally one of the most important criterias and also one of the things that you guys are very frustrated about when it comes to especially white t-shirts is that it shouldn't be too see-through and that leads me to the nude bra because a nude bra is an absolute must-have in your underwear collection in general because it's just great to wear underneath like a very see-through button-down shirt but certainly also your white basic t-shirts it is almost impossible to find a basic teacher that's not just a tiny bit see-through and going for a nude bra it's just a great way of dealing with that if you're not into the hole peeking through underwear situation so I actually tried one out from a brat called organic basics which is also one of the brands that I ordered one of the t-shirts from it's a basic triangle problem no wires or anything like that and it's just super comfortable and I'm loving it already also the cutting quality from organic basics are often made in what you would call long fiber cotton which means that this fabric is just a lot more durable than conventional cotton and it will also look like new for a lot longer time okay so with all that in mind let's have a look at the five t-shirts that I'm going to show you and compare to each other today now as always everything that I show you in this video is going to be linked down below for you guys also I haven't tried any other t-shirts on yet because I kind of wanted to give you my full first impressions besides the teacher that I'm wearing today which is about six months old now and I'm going to compare this to the four others as well but that's just because this one comes from a responsible brand so I thought I just wanted to put that in together with the others I am gonna watch that just to see how well they wash and then I'm gonna give you my final verdict and then hopefully be able to pick out a favorites so that you guys can also pick out here on a favorite so yeah let's go so this t-shirt is called the cutting crew and it is from ever Lane so when it comes to the fit of this t-shirt it is just right up my street it has kind of a straight slightly oversized v and it has this crew neck as well when it comes to the quality it is quite thin also I can't seem to find any information on this t-shirt whether it organic cotton or not so I'm guessing it is just in conventional cotton but it is made in supima cotton which is kind of a quality March for Eveline so it is definitely better than the conventional alternatives out there when it comes to good quality but I would have liked it to be an organic cotton as well so that it was being made with fewer chemicals in the production as well also the fabric of this t-shirt is very thin I don't know if you're able to see it here but you can kind of see my jeans through the t-shirt and yeah it's just a bit too thin for my liking other than that the fit and the hand feel it's very soft and it feels great on skin and like I said it washes really well as well and also it comes from a responsible brand where transparency and good conditions in the production is something that's very important so so let's have a look at this one from organic basics this is the same brand as the nude bra that I spoke about earlier in this video there's just so much plastic waste in the fashion industry so it's great to see someone taking a bit more responsibility in that area all the teachers that I'm showing you today is in a size medium just to get that out there I'm also going to put that information down below but just in case I forget to say these are all in a size I mean you and I deliberately always choose a size medium just because I really like that slightly oversized fit so here is the one from organic basics I am not really fond of the finishing here at the neck it kind of looks like the fabric has been stretched a bit too much in the production so it kind of has these small wrinkles down here at the neck I think you'd be able to remove it by ironing at the t-shirt which is gentle something I really enjoy to do especially after washing my t-shirts is just give them a quick iron because it makes them look completely like new again so I hope this is something that you can remove by irony the t-shirt and it was made in a 95% organic cotton and then five percent ill estate and I can definitely tell when I move around in the fabric and I kind of I'm stretching like this that it's a bit more stretchy than the 100% cotton ones probably Everland so overall I really like this t-shirt I really like this very thick quality and the fact that it is hardly see through I bet you could even wear like a normal white bra underneath this t-shirt and you wouldn't be able to see it so that's definitely a plus but yeah it feels like a very proper great t-shirt oh yeah this is what I'm talking about when I say crewneck this is a proper crew neck in my opinion it just goes all the way up to the neck and it looks great with when you layer it your necklaces like this and yeah that is definitely a plus the one from organic basics is definitely a lot bigger than this one no doubt about that but it is definitely thicker than the very thin one from every lane so far this could actually be a favorite of mine I really like the neck I like the sleeves the perfect slightly oversized spit the sleeves are not too big they're not too long or anything so kind of has that boyfriend fit but not too much and yeah like I said it is made in 100% organic cotton so if you are to go for a sustainable basic from a normal high street brands and all the stories is definitely a great way to go so moving on this one is from weekday and kind of has a more corrupt and boxy fit than the others the others kind of went down to here that is definitely an individual matter but I definitely like my t-shirts to be slightly longer especially if I'm wearing boyfriend jeans like today where the jeans kind of sit low on my hip I just don't feel like there's a lot of fabric to kind of do this health tuck because it's so short if you're wearing high-waist jeans on the other hand there's not a lot of excess fabric so if that's what you prefer this length is perfect I guess also there's something odd about this color this one is what they call white on the website on weekdays websites but it is not white it is kind of like an off-white almost like a cream color I don't know if you can see it but I mean compared to this one from and other stories it's just not very white this one is also made in 100% organic cotton so again we're dealing with conventional brand that has kind of made an initiative to go for more sustainable basics the thickness of the fabric is great as well I don't really have anything bad to say about that I can see my bra I almost can't even see my jeans through this fabric as well so it has a great thickness so that is the fourth t-shirt take a good look because I'm gonna switch to the last one so here we have the final t-shirt this is from a brand called armed angels and it's a brand that I only recently discovered I've actually so ordered a pair of skinny jeans from that brand I'm gonna test out yeah this is 100% organic cotton as well and as you can see it is kind of more fitted than the other t-shirts so I guess this is what you would call like a woman's t-shirt so the sleeves are a bit more fitted and the body is a bit more fitted kind of sewn like a woman's body and like I said in the beginning I really prefer this kind of straight oversized fit so when it comes to the fit I am not completely sold on this one however I will say the length is really great at this t-shirt and also I think it's perfect to be wearing underneath Blazers because it is that fitted but to be wearing like this on its own it's not my favorite oh yeah I am gonna return once I have watched all of these t-shirts [Music] so it is now the day after I spoke to you last and I'm out back with a final conclusion to these five different white t-shirts so the conclusion is that all of the five t-shirts did really well in washing after a bit of ironing when they were dry they all have a very smooth surface and there doesn't seem to be a problem with moving seams or anything like that but obviously it takes a bit more than just one wash and also a bit more wear to really tell a difference but it doesn't seem like the surface will be peeling or anything so they're all super smooth still looks great and they did really well in terms of washing so one thing to think about in this process is definitely that cotton isn't just cutting you can really feel a difference in softness and weight if you turn to brands who are concerned about making cotton items in supima or pima cotton or cotton that are made from long fiber cotton so the reason why a long fiber cotton and supima cotton is so great is because you just get a lot thicker cotton a lot more durable and a lot more soft cotton as well they all have some pros and cons but if I have to pick out my own favorites it will have to be the one that I'm wearing right now which is the one from organic basics or the one from and Other Stories which is closely followed by one from every Lane so I really wish that you could feel the hand feel of this t-shirt from organic basics it's just so incredibly soft and I think it has to do with a tiny bit of stretch it just sits so nice and soft on your body and I like this kind of stretchy hand feel and also the thickness and the weight of the fabric and then after washing it and ironing the neckline I managed to smooth out these little wrinkles that have had right here so I think it will look great after countless times of washing and wear as well so if we look at both the t-shirt from and other stories made an organic cotton 100% organic cotton and then this one from organic basics they both kind of fill in the criterias that we made in the beginning of this video for the perfect basic white t-shirt so that was that the fabric shouldn't be to slinky but not too stiff either this one is definitely a lot more soft than this one because this one is after all 100% cotton and this has a tiny bit of stretch so there is definitely a difference in the softness of the t-shirt but the weight is quite similar to both of them then they both have this slightly oversized boxy fit with a classic crewneck that I like so much they wash really well both of them the surface is still super smooth no moving seams or anything like that and then finally none of them are too see-through but like I said in the beginning of this video it all starts with a great nude bra I really like the one from every lane as well like I said in the beginning I've had this for a while I've had it for around six months and it's been worn a lot washed a bunch of times too and it just keeps looking great the surface hasn't start started to peel or anything like that it's still super smooth the seams are where they should be in the sides of the t-shirt so this is really in my top three of all of these t-shirts because it just lasts so well and that is because it is made in soupy McCubbin so that just shows that cotton is not just cuttin you have to pick carefully if you want something that looks nice in the long run and that's really durable as well but the reason why it's not my absolute favorite is because it is just a bit too thin compared to these two this one and this one so my absolute favorites the one from another stories and then this one from our basics [Music] when it comes to caring for especially white t-shirts we all know that through time you can kind of get these yellow stains in the armpits which is just totally unsexy but it happens you can actually easily remove these stains by mixing a bit of baking soda with water so that it kind of creates a paste and then kind of scrub that into the surface or where the stain is and then leave it there for at least one hour you could also leave it overnight if you're dealing with a very rough kind of stain and then wash it normally and then that should take that yellow stain right off your t-shirt another thing you could do to avoid these yellow stains is going for a more and natural deodorant so stay away from antiperspirant a crystal deodorant or maybe make your own I'll make sure to put a link down below for a recipe for making your own deodorant I have experienced that the crystal deodorant is not always very efficient I sweat more through certain periods during the month and also if I'm really busy or stressed out I tend to sweat a bit more and having to worry about the smell of sweat it's just not fun either so I actually have both a crystal deodorant for kind of low-key days or if days at home where I don't need as much protection and then I also have a traditional antiperspirant but just without any nasty chemicals and without perfume so that it's better for very sensitive skin and it's just a bit more healthy than the conventional antiperspirant so that's it for this video guys I really hope you found it helpful and that it kind of made you wiser in terms of cotton in general and choosing great durable qualities also in terms of choosing more sustainable options again like I said in the beginning of this video going for sustainable eco-friendly basics is a great way to start other than lowering your consumption and maybe going for secondhand as well personally I don't even think that it's that much more expensive than the conventional brand so really everyone can do this especially if you lower your consumption you have a bit more money to go for great quality and more sustainable options as well so enough blabbering I think this video is getting a lot longer than I thought in the beginning so I'm gonna wrap up this video if you liked it please don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel I'd love to have you around also make sure to follow me on Instagram because I upload daily outfit inspiration from my capsule wardrobes and thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you all in the next one bye guys [Music]", "2Izuu_WJZSw": "hey guys welcome back to my channel for today's video I'm going to show you all how I wash my white colored clothes in a washing machine so the first thing I do is that I separate all the white clothes from my colored ones so almost this is one week of my laundry where you know I have very few white color clothes and I separate them first so this all the white clothes a half of one full week and then I go ahead and sew this in normal soap powder you can use any kind of stuff so I use like normal self powder so add around 1 and 1/2 to 2 spoon of you know self powder and then I'm going to add this rain ala which is good for white color coats I add approximately one and a half of inner cup whatever the cap is Paige right so add that and then I'll go ahead and add hot water because soaking in hot water helps to you know remove the stain in better so since you all know right now I'm pregnant and I can't you know carry heavy bucket so what I did this is just I went ahead and in a pot in one small bucket two buckets of hot water and added to this in a big bucket because I supposed to you know get hot water from bathrooms because we have a geezer only in bathroom so then I went ahead and soap it and leave it for almost one hour so because in this one of us the helps to remove any kind of thing if you have on your white color clothes after one of us I just went and Dana squeezed all the water from the float and added to the washing machine [Music] you so now I'm going to add self powder I usually use a suffix L for the washing machine and I added approximately and if you take a big spoon around two to three schools so added that three spoons of self powder and then I'm adding almost half will pop off you know discomfort I use this blue color comfort liquid [Music] and then let me go ahead and switch it on so there are variety settings synthetic Xpress 15 and all that I don't use them for white color clothes there is a lightly soiled which is there for 1 hour 16 minutes and also we do have normal soiled and heavy soiled normal soiled is for 1 hour 52 minutes and heavily soiled is around just 1 hour 55 minutes we do have white but I never used it so let me select that and switch on the washing machine after 1 hour 15 minutes I'm just going to take all the clothes in a bucket and I usually put it dry outside my house near to balcony so here I'm going to try all of them make sure to winnow through thoroughly so that no wrinkles will be there in your clothes so let them dry in good sunlight for five to six hours so since it's a one-way clothes I have very few so usually what I do is that I wash two weeks once because only my husband Bunyan and mine few white clothes and few white color towels so we don't you know have so many of them like to wash in a week so I usually wash two weeks once white color clothes now maybe one and a half week so what I do is that I just do not dry them and clip it and yeah holla that's it so I hope you all like this video thank you so much for watching please make sure to click on thumbs button and also subscribe to my channel thank you so much I'm going to see you all very soon in my next video till then love you so much take care guys bye", "BE4Ddg_1_FA": "Today we're talking about the Canvas\n100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now this is one of our favorite ring-spun\ncotton t-shirts. One because of how many colors it's offered in, love it that it\ncomes in so many cool colors. It's also great because it comes in a lady's\nversion too, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton shirt. It has a great fit, love this shirt so much. It actually, I think\nover the course of a lot of washes it maintains that softness which was a big thing for a hundred percent ring-spun. Instead of just telling you though, we do have our model. He's gonna come over show it in action. First thing you're gonna notice is just that tailored fit, partially\nbecause of the side seam here. The side seam makes sure that it just kind of hugs the body. It's not going to be too tight, but it is gonna tailor in a little which is just flattering. Everybody wants now kinda that nicer fabric but also the nicer fit.  The next thing you're going to notice is the neckline. We love this because it's a great dip here not too tight either, has some flexibility. That ring-spun cotton has a little more tug to it than just a regular, 100% cotton. The sleeve length is also awesome, super flattering it's a little higher. It's not going to be baggy, which is great. Now you might be  wondering though, we've talked a lot about a hundred percent ring-spun cotton, how does it, how does it wear over the course of life? Is it gonna shrink, anything that way. With this garment\nyou're not really gonna have to worry about shrinkage over the first few washes. A year or two years down the line, it could potentially if you're gonna nuke this thing in the dryer but it is pre-shrunk and very true to size, so we love this. Again, like I said though it does come in a ladies version, the Bella 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Overall, great shirt, love it, a ton of color options and you look great in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know\nif you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters, and so do our customers.", "6zIz5Om9REU": "hey two worlds are colliding today in our review we're going to be checking out the travis scott mcdonald's merch and the 100 recycled made usa noah t hey hey look it's above me want me to answer all of your questions but it's above me now some of my followers may know mcdonald's is just place i love going to go there all the time mainly because i'm super broke i mean not that bad but i want to save my money for other stuff you know some different things and that mailman salary you know it's not that high you know you don't make a whole lot of money being a usps male delivery person which that's what i'm doing right now i am painting shirts that's why i got the noah shirts those 100 recyclable check those out i want to paint on those like i painted on this one this is my most recent you guys like that graphic got a bunch of detail in there and then with my noah tees i'm going to make them real crisp i've been letting the paint kind of bleed around the edges on these organic tees that i've been using got a couple i've painted over here but anyways uh let's break into these travis shirts because you know there's a bunch of cactus jack fans out there we're gonna check them out one at a time let's see oh this is the cactus mac shirt that one actually sold out pretty quickly or they just took it off the website i don't know and then we have our action figure on the back shirt and then we have our action figure on the front jack smile t-shirt too what is this one action figure series t okay so just comes in this shipping bag with a paper receipt and then all of them are totally sealed in their plastic all of them are size large oh wait this one's a medium this one's a large this one's a large i got one medium and two larges okay well this channel's purpose right now anyways the main focus is to check out some dope street wear some hype street wear brands and things like that some ethical streetwear is what i'm getting been trying to get into more so make sure you subscribe hit that like button for me and we'll check out the stickers on this plastic here there's that medium-sized one and we got the two large t's right there and then on the back there's a bunch of warning information they're all the same but yeah this has been written over and over and over again there and so i'm actually probably most excited for this purplish colored one it's kind of purplish right it's called berry i mean it's kind of a cool tie-dye name for it if you call this tie-dye i guess i will call it tie-dye yeah definitely here is cactus jack size large he does have a bunch of puff print all over here it's kind of a mix so you got this uh elephant print back here that doesn't really have much print to it but the jack on here loads of it and then you can't even read the cactus because his action figure is over top of it but under here it says cactus tell him jack sent you there we go and then we have our giant cactus jack whoa come on and then we have our giant cactus jack logo on the back here all in puff print barely legible because they like did a bunch of effects to it to make it really blotchy or whatever so you can kind of tell that this k is amazing that's a great k i gotta say or what about this s down here look at that s just a mean come on and this u easily you can tell that to you right i can't quit hating on what they did with that logo but it's kind of cool how they just kind of meshed it up there and then what do you think about this bluish turquoise color against this berry purple do you like that color combination there i don't know it's not too bad they seem like inverted colors and then on here you have this lime yellowish green lots of yellow in this lime green but then you can tell it's not quite yellow because the orange in this mcdonald's this yellow in here this orange really makes you see that this other text has a little bit of green tint to it yeah they went for a lot of 90s vibes with this tee you can really tell with that scribbling down there that's really common in the 90s in this elephant print obviously as well and yeah so enough talk let's look at the tag on the back of the neck there it is coming up for you this one here is a size large it's a standard size large american standard size large nothing special i ordered a bunch of these tees and uh just gonna start painting them you guys can order them from me for sure so just reach out to me tell me you want a tea created with my with my current uh expression of art put a couple colors together and get you sent out that team let's check how the travis scott large fits comparatively and yeah i feel like this one fits basically the same basically exactly the same as that last t i was just wearing what do you guys think you guys think they're about the same size i would say this is just a standard size large american maybe a little bit longer but i mean a quarter of an inch or something that could vary from piece to piece and you got the back graphic on there as well being loud and bold colors are all over the place and yeah let's get into these organic or 100 recycled cotton tees repurposed cotton looks like noah is not doing any additional packaging in here to keep the t-shirts free of any dust or debris that might get inside the bag these ones i did buy size extra large for seed and so yeah no plastic on these ones they just come out with their tag on there and yeah this cotton it actually doesn't feel too terrible it does have markings on it just like some little markings here and there because uh they didn't put any plastic they just put it in the shipping bag and i don't know you can't really tell that much but there's definitely some dirt yeah so this tea definitely feels really rough you can see a lot of texture in there there's some variation to how this looks it's super pilly already it's got little black specks all over a few little pilly black specks here and there and you do have the noaa logo down at the bottom corner right down there bottom left and then up at the top i'll zoom in for your tag here you guys can check this tag out there it is just safety pinned on we got this logo here and on the inside left you do have this wash tag yeah so there's a little bit of a message on the bottom of this noah t very sad message but you know sometimes truth hurts it says at least 40 million pounds of plastic has accumulated and is floating in the north pacific ocean so this tea is trying to help reverse that the noaa brand is really trying to help reverse that that's probably the main reason why in here they did not put any plastic casing on anything oh look a sticker here we go we got a sticker and it is a transparent one i think it's a transparent sticker whoa is there two stickers here there's totally two stickers here yeah hey they're almost stuck together got two noah stickers yeah this snow brand is just headed in a great direction a direction i myself i'm really trying to head towards i know i'm still kind of torn i'm still kind of in two different worlds with trying to have ethical street wear and then also you know the hype streetwear that has really drawn me into the whole culture and even educated me on a lot of things and really opened my mind to discover different truths that are basically things that i thought were true but ended up just being false or just being a theory there's a lot of theories out there things that can't be proven a lot of people are taking as a hundred percent truth really what i want to get back to is just caring about every single living thing or when i get to i don't think the world has ever been in a place where it cares about every living thing maybe i mean i tend to think a lot of the indigenous people of the americas were very conscious about the earth and about each other and and respect and things like that then humans had to come in and do what they do best and you know whoever is the dominant figure their way of life wins out so really that's something we can be conscious about all the time just be thinking about our footprint what are we doing how are we leaving this earth what are some practical steps we can individually take to just make this world a better place make it a more joyful place and just make it so that we can flourish as a society without taking advantage of other species of life out here on this planet and so that's basically my positive message for today just really want us to be conscious every single decision matters everything you say even matters you know i'll be debating with my family about different religious things i'm really into theology and philosophy and they're really strict and convinced of the status quo christian but then i'm more questioning all these structured things that christianity has laid out and i'm just not falling for him anymore i just i just think it was set up for governments to be able to rule people and to create complying citizens and i'm complying yes i mean i'm an artist i'm just out there i change things up i want things to be different so anyways let me know what you think about this e-conscious shirt this organic cotton tee that i painted up here with that graphic you know the continents the whole earth matters right and then also if you were into the cactus jack and mcdonald's gear i have more stuff coming i don't know if any of you guys got the email but i definitely did i got the email from travis saying that it's going to be like three and four weeks further out than was originally expected it's just yeah it's going to take forever apparently i guess they're just blaming it on coven that's what you gotta do just blame everything on call of it because it's making everybody slow down and making businesses timelines all messed up i mean i'm currently working on trying to get a trademark and then i'm going to get a utility patent and then the design patent because me and abby i told you guys a few weeks ago if anybody's been following that we've been working on a special project or i've been working on a special project with her and we put a lot of time effort energy into that creating this baby of ours we invented a really cool game that you play at the table not on a computer it's kind of vintage right but uh hopefully once i get the trademark done i can show it to you guys i'll have my patent pending i can start selling it and just have different people be playing this game it's really fun i really enjoy it i brought it over to a ton of different people's houses and i played it a bunch with them they all really love it they want me to market it so i'm going to go after it and we'll see what happens i mean i just want to spread joy and some cheer to people and i feel like playing a game with your family definitely has a possibility or potential of springing up some joyce bringing up some happiness i mean that's why people play games just uh just to get to know the other people that you're playing with and to grow some relationships it's what i'm all about that's why i started this channel we can start some relationships i'm up here in montana nobody around here is a hypebeast nobody nobody's a streetwear enthusiast i mean there's probably a few but i'm not connecting with them and most of them are are playing a lot of video games i'm more of this artist type this industry where so it's i don't know i'm just a weird individual and i think that's okay i think god is okay the creator of this whole carbon-based universe i think he's okay with us being diverse and being different so i encourage everybody out there to go after your dreams go after the things that you're ambitious for cause uh only thing holding you back is probably you i mean just saying so anyways uh i love you all and i hope you stay safe out there until next time peace [Music] [Music] right now", "FtYxUR34whM": "okay folks we are back with another product review from heart mind soul and the HMS nation today we are going to be doing our product review for the trusted Gildan guild ang mm altar a cotton t-shirt 100% cotton this is a great product and the reason why I wanted to choose this product for today's review is because he's holed up so well we've been printing t-shirts for over 20 years believe it or not and some of the very first t-shirts that we ever printed were in fact printed on the the guild an ultra cotton and be still be still hold up we still have we still have we still have teachers from 20 years ago and that's why this is a great value based product now it's not the softest of hand you know it is 100% cotton so it is a little bit coarse it doesn't have what it doesn't have a lot of a lot of other features like the dry like the dry fit or if you want moisture wicking it does absorb it does absorb sweat very well however so a lot of people in the kitchen industry tend to prefer the hundred percent cotton what else is nice about this they come in an awful lot of colors there's a very wide color selection they come in a large variety of sizes up to 5 6 X and a lot of different different colors that aren't available from most companies but the biggest reason why I like this product is that it holds up again so I got so this is a brand-new this is a brand-new t-shirt right here brand new Gildan 2000 shirt and this is one that I've had for at least two maybe three years and I have I have worn the heck out of this I have intentionally tried but you can't even see the you can't even see the label anymore here honest to goodness I have washed this just so many times worn this out in the desert wanted out camping let the dogs sleep on it and they still hold up I mean there is just you know look at this I mean you know four to three year old t-shirt you know the the stitching is still all intact the hems are pretty good here look around the neckline there's a little bit of a little of wear and tear but not too terribly much stretching here this is still a nice t-shirt in fact I'm gonna put this on when I'm done with a review and go do some yard work in it and and people love it they always can still see the design look at how nice that shows up this is this is the black one this is your we didn't print this design all this is just a sample shirt so I took it out and researched and developed it and you can see kind of how well this wood held up well this dark dark Heather anyways it's a nice really nice shirt here the last thing we'll enjoy your attention to is the discharge water-based screen printing that we did on the Gildan t-shirt and this is why I specifically chose this shirt for it is because it holds up so well because again this is a brand new one the only drawback what you have and use white ink is that there is titanium in it which will cause some cracking as you see here very minimal but it is gonna crack eventually versus the discharge ink which will never crack at all so either way you can find all of these designs on our HMS nation website or contact heart mind soul for a custom quote today", "1F60Z4GXTtM": "So today I'll be going through a few black\nshirts to find the best ones for you. So when it comes down to the black shirts,\nI know it gets tough to find a better, yes. Black shirts based on your occasion, based\non a week, the one where for Bob, we'll go through a few different collections that I\ngathered. So I was showing you guys what shirt would\nfit best and based on your occasion, What's going on guys. Welcome back to Arccway new direction of a\nbody, man. My name is mr. Lou (Tolu) so I bought a few\nbasic black t-shirts for you guys. Cause I want to go through the best basic\nblack t-shirt that actually will fit your liking based on your situation. Sometimes people will want a shirt just to\ngo under. The long sleeve. Sometimes they want to have a basic black\nshirt ring looking to fit in real, look into texture room and looking to usability or looking\nto like wrinkle test, just to see what it looks like when it has a little more wrinkles,\neven it gets on done. So the first he should have for you guys is\nfrom Uniclo. This is a medium size. So I'm going to throw this on and tell you\nguys my review. So off the bat, having a shirt from Uniqlo,\nit is tight around the arms for more or less. For me for black shirts is a little more different\nthan my whites. But I do like my blacks a little be more tighter,\na little more slimmer. So for me, this t-shirts, she a little bit\nloose around the arms, which is okay for me around the tourist. It has a little bit of a snip feel to great. So that's good as well. And black also just means she's it looks slim\naltogether. The texture quality of this is quite nice. It's it's a hundred percent organic cotton. It doesn't, you don't feel a starchy feel\nto wait. There's no rough patches. It's just a smooth texture all around the\nbasic t-shirt and where it builds the of this t-shirt. I will basically put it in my category of\nas if I put it under like a shirt. And if I put it under like a long time, Share\nit for going out for dinner, going out for an interview or meeting whatever the case\nis. I need to dress up a little more. This'll be the tee shirt on underneath my\nlong sleeve shirt for this is from this teacher is from unicorn. It goes for $10. So it's a good price point budget for if someone's\nlooking for a quality t-shirt, but they're on a budget limit as well. So pick yourself something up like this. I recommend this to you guys. So this show, how about right now? It's a top man and it is in a large, and this\nactually goes to the $15. So the fit of it, all the fit altogether is\nit feels a little constructed, a little bit it's around the arms a little bit. But altogether, this is too bad around the\nneck, the collarbone right here. You can just feel it. This feels like it's the piece of fabric,\nwhich I don't technically like a lot, but I think over time we'll get used to that fabric\njust over my collarbone. Um, for me, this feels more or less like a\nt-shirt where it's just. Sits on you. It doesn't really construct your body. Um, there's a lot of wind span beyond the\narms here. It's not really designed before or a certain\ntype of cut texture wise of this shirt is actually nice. I don't mind at all, a hundred percent organic\ncotton. It's soft. I can't have any problems with it or it's\norganic, no problems at all. So this is the type of shirt I actually wear\nwith my outerwear. So I'll throw like a bomber on over it. Or I'll fill out a squared off for the summer\ntime. So this is something that is not too thin,\nbut also not too thick. So it's in that happy medium. So I think typically, typically for me, I'll\nprobably wear this in spring more or less, and then maybe it goes in the fall where like\na lighter version of this. Cause it'd just be too hot and I need something\nto have that breathability for. So this is from Simon's, it is $10 and this\nis actually a medium. This actually has a slim fit cut to it. So for me, it is. Tight around the pecs and also around the\narms around the biceps, but it's actually not the bigger, it's not that huge of a difference,\nbut I'll typically probably wear this when I'm going out to events. Maybe going out to a speaking, maybe you're\ngiving a speaking. Um, you just want to look slimming, slimming,\ntrim all around as a full circle. And I think this is something that you can\nbe worn where if you go out to dinner party or so it's actual quality of the shirt is\ncaught in it and it is. Nice on the skin. I don't have any problems with it. It's only time how we problem with stress\nis when you do wash it after an initial purchase, and over time you start feeling and you start\nnoticing that it's not the same, like it, where it used to be. And that's where my concern is with buying\nt-shirts. I want to feel the exact same for the first\ntime I buy it. So the 14 shirt on the rack right here is\nfrom Guruji. And this is the one I'm wearing right now. This right here is the large and I actually\nam. Liking this shirt a lot more than I thought. So for this tee-shirt right here, the fit\nof it is nice. I do enjoy this. It does feel nice around the body fit wise. So this t-shirt, so this teacher right here\nis from boogy. So this one I got in a two pack where it's\n$15 per two. So it was also a good deal on the budget. So this is the lighter version of it, of a\ntypical t-shirt I experienced with a lot of, these are me for me around the arms. Did you have that breathability? You don't have a lot of give to it, but you\ndo have that constructive fit look to it. So I do enjoy that myself. So now going ahead, texture wise, this is\norganic is nice on the skin. I don't have any problems with this. So when it comes down to the wrinkle tests\nor I'm going to incorporate now so much, like the shirts I reviewed before, it doesn't give\nyou a new lot of wrinkles, but at the same time, you do get wrinkles over, over time. When it has more use off the bat, it's not\ntoo bad. It's good. I don't mind it. So where does it live? Spring where it's in the summer time. This'll probably be my go to shirt for you\nguys. I recommend, so this shirt is from banana\nRepublic. Okay. Got it. On sale. It typically is 29. It all is for the premium watch. T-shirt like I have for $10 on sale all around. It just feels good. It fits good. I can't complain. The width span of this is in a medium range\nwhere I do like a little give to it and not too tight to drop off this shirt, ultimately. Yeah, there is quite fine. It has a slim fit. So it doesn't feel too loose. Detection of this is. A hundred percent cotton. I can't complain with this yet again, when\nit comes down to usability, this is something I'll probably wear under my long sleeve shirts\nor a blazer from trying to layer up in the winter time. This will probably be my basic t-shirt. So now when it comes down to the wearability\nof this BR t-shirt, so I'll probably wear this when I do go out under eyes and long\nsleeve shirt, or if I typically want to wear something we're comfortable. So this type of share that I actually have\nfor winter and a fall for anything lighter, I won't tend to go to the BR shirts, but this\nis something that actually would keep you a little thicker on the cotton side. This actually has a lot more thickness on\nthe inside. And I do recommend this if you want to layer\nso gardens wrinkle tests, I really could go up a bit, but not, not too many problems yet. Again, it is a prewash shirt. So you're going to get that faded, look on\nthe black shirt as it is. So you can't go too wrong with having a little\nbit of wrinkles, but also. This looks a little more with the style of\nthe shirt. So this shirt I have on right now is a longevity\nshirt. This actually is from H and M and this is\nsomething I actually do prefer a lot more than most of those collections not only has\na longer fit to it. So it does have that modern vibe to it, but\nalso has that nice scoop at the end of the, at the end of the shirt. So it has a nice, slight new cuts at the end\nof the share that makes it a little bit, look base, look a little bit more modern, but also\nit looks good when you do layer it up. So this shirt is actually for. Very nice. And you can't go wrong with this. I usually get jerseys for it's a lot more\nbigger than usual. Cause sometimes we do throw in a rush. It actually makes shrink a lot more fascinating\nthan you expect. So I got this to the medium, even though when\nI tried it on the stories, usually a little bit bigger, but this is something yeah. I recommend for anyone who wants to start\nLarry up this year. So when it comes down to the fit of this shirt,\nit has a loose fitting all together. So it is a lot more breathable. And does it feel tight on the skin, which\nI do like for different purposes? So all together. This actually has a lot more give than usual. So around my torso is loose around my, around\nmy pet Torres is loose as well, arms and pits loose. Everything is really good with his share regarding\nthat longer looser fitted look there's some, you can go for attachment wise. There is cotton, so you can't go wrong with\nsomething like this in your wardrobe. So invest in something that has good quality,\nbut also have that longterm integrity within the shirt regarding the wrinkle test. I can't complain with this shirt yet again. Like many of the black shirts, especially\nthe washed black shirt. You want me to get a lot more wrinkles? This has a little glare to, it has a little\nmore of a sheet, the both shirts. So when you do wrinkle in itself over time\nis be conscious of it. And actually maybe steam it before you leave\nthe house. This is from H and M is from the conscious\nline. And this is actually seven 99 for this shirt. This is one of my favorite shirts. I don't want to be biased, but by want to\ngive it a genuine review for you guys as well. For me, this is actually a blue all around. He doesn't have a tight fuel, but yeah. It has a little bit of a snug feel to it as\nwell. Me, this type of shirt is my go to get again,\nlike I said before, from the chilling at the house running errands, this is my go to shirt. So I have no problem forming the sun. Um, and just for alcohol problems for as long\nwith a bomber and just going about my day. So textual wise, this is a car. It does come from the conscious line. If you don't know what the Asian unconscious\nline is, basically they will recycle the old products and use the same fabrics and textures\nof garments to reproduce new garments. So you kind of saved the planet at the same\ntime, but you're using all products to make new ones. For me, I really stand behind that type of\nbelief of recycling and making sure it was a better place. So this is something that is that right behind,\nand we're proud of you. So this way here is a premium cotton shirt\nby H and M. It actually goes from 1999. This was actually a lot more tighter than\nanything I've ever experienced. This is actually a small. I wasn't meant to grab this bike in this tell\noff the small that the meeting was not going to be too far from it, but I'll probably go\nfor a large event in this year. So what I can talk about with this shirt is\nthe quality. So ESPN client, like they stated I'll see\nmy difference from this and the other Asian. I'm sure it's by. I actually do fuel different when I wear this\nwith one of the. Simon seizures. I feel the Assamese t-shirts have a better\nselection of fabric. Textures is organic cotton with them. This one is a premium Kylene. So you'll feel a big difference between that\npremium cotton. T-shirts it depends when you're going to be\nusing that. Maybe it can be celebration of your birthday\nor friend's birthday party, or maybe just a celebration of life. So it can just. Maybe this depends on the certain situations\ndrew be wearing a shirt, typically four, but this is probably won't be my GoTo regarding\nshirt wise, but I'll probably have this in a category for maybe special occasions or\nwhen I either bust out something that I just need on the spot and it needs to look good\nand clean it out probably where I feel car insurance yet.

only that at the end of the video you are going to have the opportunity to win good better and best t-shirt flex because feeling is believing video coming up all right guys I was at the Bella canvas headquarters in Los Angeles California and we went over good better and best t-shirt lengths okay and I was with the head of sales and we are going to show you the difference all right and not only that you're gonna have an opportunity to win all three so you can feel them and see which one you're going to use in your t-shirt business alright so wanna hear hear it go hi Gary from t-shirt helpdesk and I'm here was Meghan she's the head of sales at Bella campus and I know a lot of you guys have questions about t-shirts Heather's try blends solids tell us about what's going on with all I'm gonna give you the run now reposition it kind of a good better best style 3001 is our best-selling style friend the bread and butter of our line that's because made out of 100% combed and ring spun cotton and why that's important is we literally comb out the impurities and then it's ring spun to create a really nice strand of yarn so that when we've met our fabrics it's a tight weave it's a smooth consistency it's a nice surface to print on and it's got that super soft hand so what we'd buy for ourselves at retail so this is gonna the gateway into the brand it's a really nice price point at 287 extremely competitively priced so that's kind of the transition into the brand if someone's maybe using a basics brand and they're trying to elevate their their line and get into something a little bit softer and a little bit nicer in terms of printing alright what are some of the qualities that we can look forward to style like this well the hundred percent cotton lends itself really well to DTG direct-to-garment printing is ideal for taking that type of ink it also discharges really well so I would say that's a good go-to for anyone looking to do DGG or discharging so this is the good category this is kind of that better tide worried this is still style 3001 you'll find that we like to mix fabrications within existing silhouettes so style 3001 will have solid kind of percent cotton colors and then poly cotton color so thisis our other CBC it's a fifty to forty eight poly cotton blend and what makes it unique is that it gives it that nice Heather appearance we're seeing a major trend in the market for customers printing on Heather's because not only that nice vintage texture but also that polyester consider and so at 3:05 this is a good kind of lower price point but step up from the hundred percent cotton and we have a wide variety of colors within the three thousand one so no matter what they're looking for whether it's artwork for the graphic or a logo there's something in our color palette to satisfy their needs very minute so if I have to choose any fabric to represent Bella campus it would be our tri-blend I realize that I'm biased but we have the best try one on the market feel that one hmm so it's a 50% polyester 25% combed in ring-spun cotton 25% rayon blend and it's a 40 single the single is kind of like the thread count the highest single the finer the fabric and with the only brand in the industry to do a 40 single try one so it gives it a really silky hand if you have a customer that likes that heathered appearance but they have a tighter budget they can go with the Heather CVC the try one is gonna be able to form a premium and 459 but it feels really good and we have a 36 colors total which is the most try Blanc colors in the industry and I wish you guys could feel this I mean it feels like love really really soft great product so that was it guys good better best t-shirt out that side alright guys so that was it now this

and the stitching so close to the edge that's a mitered cuff okay so and yes on the collar stitching very close to the edge i'm a fan of that i prefer that to quarter edge stitching i know that's quite divisive among some people but that's very much how i like my collars and this is the tyre okay going in for some thai action 100 silk dry clean only and where is it made made in germany thunderbolt it has a nice silk satin strip to support the tie in there nice like that and uh as the other sun spell label attached on the inside so it's got like a is it a square or a sock finish is that what it's called and it's closed so you uh you can't put your digit in there thought i'd give you a close-up of the weave here so you can see different to the grenadine weave i won't go into that

on for you so you can see it nice and roomy you can roll your shoulders around in it and sleeve length good perfect comes up to the wrist on me so i'm about a 36 37 inch chest and it is actually it is perfect around the arms it's not too much stretch not too much pinch you can get some of your chest hair out if you want what are you doing here pedro oh okay fair enough do you want to edit this bit out no keep it in let's see what it looks like tucked in and see how much it bellows out all right that actually looks pretty smart i really like that i like it with the the buttons open like that should i yeah maybe a bit too much chest here but if you are going sean for the sean look oh collar let's have a look at the collar so it is a soft collar yeah it feels really soft but you do have the collar stays in there and these are removable you can get these out if you need to change those around or iron them without which you should be doing nice looks good yeah do a better yeah that's it that's it bae it's not really necessary pedro well look you might be on a fight on top of a train you might need to know if your shirt can pull off these moves here he goes he's off again still got it

mask there's the sea island cotton collection no ian fleming collection as such but that's fine if you do type in in flowering now ping that into the search bar you do get some from the collection interesting interesting so talking to a couple of mates in the community we all we all really love sun spell that's a given we love the sea island cotton i mean the quality is fantastic but an ian fleming collection we would have liked to have seen something that ian fleming actually wore you know i don't know if that shirt with the patch pockets in the belt is probably too much cosplay but you know just having something that's a bit closer to fleming i mean if you would have look at this bad boy i mean a polka dot shirt of him sitting at the typewriter and now if that's in the collection we'll just snap that up anyway going off the grass here thank you sun spell for sending the stuff on uh i actually really like it i do wear this all the time when i'm on zoom calls bloody hell sorry music's just kicked in and anyway thank you sun spell for sending this on i do recommend the sea island cotton if you're looking to get a nice off the peg shirt that you're going to feel comfortable in when you're sitting down for them zoom calls this is the way to go all right until next time [Music] you", "vkCnjUqdlq4": "I'm starting a t-shirt line what's the best shirt to use I can honestly say this is the number one question I get asked to answer that you have to consider what is most important to you about your brand what people starting a t-shirt line usually care about the most is fit feel fashion and how they can be decorated so let's see if I can answer that number one question for you up next [Music] hey guys it's melissa my shirt space when it comes to finding the best t-shirt to start a t-shirt line what you'll first want to consider is your brand's aesthetic if you feel like your brand is more about the design than the shirt I would consider using the g500 okay what I'm referencing here is brands that tend to be about funny slogans or silly images personally I wouldn't consider a brand like this to be a fashion-forward brand so what classic tubular team might be your best bet but I'm guessing that people watching this video are more interested in starting a fashion-forward clothing brand when it comes to a fashion-forward clothing brand that appeals to all genders I can definitely give some more recommendations and again we will want to touch on what matters most fit feel and fashion let's start with fit this is a big one everyone wants to look good and feel good but plains of both genders can be hard this is where manufacturers have stepped up to create the retail unisex team this slim-fitting tee that caters to both genders will be a hit for sure next let's touch on feel a soft comfortable tea will be something that your customers will not forget so this is where fabric comes into play there are three recommendations I would make on fabric the first is cotton the second is CVC and the third is try blend let's talk a hundred percent cotton 100% cotton is a tried-and-true tea it's only downfall is that it will shrink after its first wash but if you provide your customers with the correct wash instructions to follow they will be sure to fall in love next up is CVC cv c stands for chief value cup this refers to the cotton poly ratio within the tea with a heavy percentage of cotton these teas provide the softness of the cotton and the durability and texture of the polyester finally we have our try blends this is a blend of 50% poly twenty-five percent cotton and 25% ring a triflin is very similar to a CVC but with an added feature you have your softness of your cotton your durability and texture of your polyester but then with that round you also get some added features these fabrics all have a very price point depending on where you'd like to be for your customer base okay let's talk fashion a huge trend in the

only be one winner at the end of the video let's go see what we find [Music] alright guys so right now we're noon aglow these t-shirts right here the supima kind crewneck t-shirts you know I don't want to make my decision right now but I've heard really great things about these t-shirts they are kind of pricey though we're looking at 1490 because they offer 100% greater cut oh hold on hold on anything rare you know I'm I'm big on the high prayer cotton but if you guys want something a little bit thicker a little bit more rugged for the same price they also have these right here the you crewneck t-shirts and here is a white one we're also going to get this and check it out as well [Music] alright guys so right now we are in Northland which carries top man these are their white tees right here right off the bat kind of thin collar is pretty thin as well but you know never judge a book by it's cover ten bucks you also got a Romani dollar option gonna get a more premium one little rough heavier but not as heavy it looks like oversize kind of yeah all right so we got a twenty dollar option and a ten dollar option from Topman let's get both alright so I went over to other two tees but I just came across the classic elongated tee if you asked me these are out especially for $30 okay I know they had its run but it's done I don't wanna see these no more any stores all right is this for beheads sorry man sorry I know we're on the search for the best white team but you know I saw this photo right here these gummy bears go for him you got try these this is like it turns up versatile sweet energy good texture on point it's not as hard as only one but I will do good though alright guys so we just ran into our friend Joe Nessie right here can you show us what you're wearing man wow she's in Chicago ones they're gonna love you alright see if it's too messy alright guys so last time we did the hoodie video man we went really hard on H&M you know we step foot back in here they've actually stepped it up in the cleanliness Department I don't know if they got the big boss coming through but everything looking clean it is super clean right now alright so the infamous H&M white see right here $6.99 $5.99 so $6.99 you're okay with that little bump oh cool alright $6.99 we got to get the classic H&M whitey let's see what they're working with alright guys so we just got back from the mall mayor behind us alright we got seven of the best white t-shirts out right now I'm gonna be putting on each one and we are gonna determine what is the best affordable white t-shirt out that money can buy let's get into it alright let's get started alright guys so right now I am rocking a size medium in the supima cotton Uniqlo standard t-shirt all right oh supima very very high quality cotton it's soft alright I'm not gonna like kinda have like sensitive skin a little bit yesterday you always oh you always bring that up when you wear t-shirt I can't do the Forever 21's fan I do that like I would pay that extra few bucks for something soft like this let's go over to fit real quick you know looking outside in a little bit above the elbow yes sir you know it does give it a little bit of a muscle tee by but not too tight not I couldn't have even said it better not too tight but it does hug around you know the bike don'ts a little buzz but as far as the fit of the t-shirt man I would say it does have like a relaxed / loose fit I made this for everyday wear this is actually the t-shirt that I wear pretty consistently they wash really nicely they don't wrinkle up in the neck area and we're not I say these are not bad at all good but I say we move on to you know clothes other thick white underside of the offer all right sorry let's get into that one so next t-shirt that I'm rocking right now is the Uniqlo 14.90 as well crew neck t-shirt so right off the bat this one is thick the hand feel right of the bat gives it more like an aged kind of a rougher hand field and you know most of the rather regular softer ones yeah I like that personally I like that rest of the vintage t-shirt I was gonna say I don't really like how like basically feels like a rough canvas you know what I mean but one thing we also have to bring up is basically like everyday wear this t-shirt right here is something that you're gonna wear on its own this one definitely gives off more of a boxy or vibe which is kind of more of my style when it comes to street wear the other one is you know a little bit too standard you know more for menswear kind of like off a mess you're teaching men's fashion kind of that style so if you're willing to compromise on the comfort a little bit then you roll with this one basically it all comes down to preference all right so right now I am rocking the infamous HCM $6.99 white t-shirt everybody had this shirt or all the other ten colors or twenty close offers they have a lot all right so all right off the bat man I'm not gonna lie these things are hugging nope I feel it's gonna say these are so small this is definitely more muscle surgery you don't need to have muscles and though you'll seem like you have my finger people like so right off the bed as far as the fit goes it is more on the smaller side of more a little bit more fitted for sure I mean I could almost see your whole bicep first it wasn't a little bit about the elbow yeah now it's all mostly a deltoid yeah so that's what you're gonna get as far as the fit goes and then now we got to talk about the quality it is pretty thin a way thinner than the first one yes sir and it kind of just tells you the quality of fabric may not be as good I mean when you're like even looking at the stitching and everything there's loose threads and I mean like the density of the fabric is what I'm looking at right now it is actually kind of thin and one thing you cannot you know determine from an eye test with these H&M t-shirts is after a wash so pretty much after you wash these and dry these it's just that's it yeah you're more you're you're you're caller just turns it to a bacon these turn like basically five times smaller so these are good for one wear basically and we have said this over and over on the channel for $6.99 that might seem like a good deal but if you pay like extra bucks you know for your noona clothes or your top man and t-shirts and whatnot you are gonna get longevity you can actually keep the shirt you're gonna be able to keep the shirt definitely do not recommend getting these for a few extra bucks you can get something much better yes sir alright so next up man I am rocking the top man standard white t-shirt this comes in at $10 from Nordstrom what do you think of this look you said the keyword standard not too loose not too tight okay I gotta compare this one to the to the first Utica one oh very comparable yes I got to ask you that comfort for five dollars less this is worth it I would say you know like you said I'm kind of sure I like this - Peet makan this is exactly the same no standard fit they probably cut it from the exact same template but the fabric he's not gonna offer it it's a little rougher okay and you know I stand by the Uniflow ones they do hold up really well and I can't really speak for the top man when it comes to washing I say we move on to the next top man t-shirt though this one is coming in at $20 alright so right now I am rocking the $20 top man t-shirt so this one is completely different more comparable to the crew neck t-shirt that I was wearing from Uniqlo I was gonna say has a vibe for me when it comes to a white tee I'm gonna rock it more flowy okay I'm gonna rock it we're gonna without anything over it out I got again so that's the look I'm trying to get that's why I like this t-shirt I like a Uniqlo one okay okay what about you for myself if I'm gonna rock a shirt like this you know loose and flowy it's gonna have some logos the logos and we're not so branded white t-shirts I just never seen white t-shirts as like a main piece so for that reason I wouldn't personally buy this white t-shirt but I could see if you do like that drape here flowy vibe this is much better to wrap this one up if you're looking for oversized shirt for $20 it's not bad this is the one you're gonna get my hair for top minute alright so moving right along we got a goody fellow white t-shirt right here from Target sorry the house brand this one is only six dollars the cheapest sand t-shirt on dollar list so far I'm not gonna lie right off the bat this looks not bad at all it doesn't look that out oh oh one thing that I got a really bring up as far as the quality goes is it kind of has this like almost like it was tumbled in like super soft fabric softener or something more soul about it okay yeah so right on the bat comfort you like it a lot really soft but as first the feet goes it's a [ __ ] to muscley for my like yeah I mean it does compared to the again hmm one where it's almost to your bicep yeah and the collar is very thin I can't see from here probably the thinnest one so far so a lot of people associate thinner collars which actually with more of like menswear premium okay so maybe that's what they're trying to go forward I don't think I don't think a Goodfella brand is a in street wear yet for six dollars mm-hmm if you're gonna compare to the H&M one I would just go cross street for them all no Target and get the good fellow yeah this is a shinobi a noir and you're gonna save a dollar you're gonna save a dollar and it's actually better yourself it's wrap this one up I say go with this one let's move on to the next one alright so last but not least right in front of us we got the Hanes what they claim is their premium pack right here we're looking at 70 shirts for $25 which comes out to what $3.57 to be exact oh my gosh they had a nerve to throw in an extra one guy used to be six okay but they're like you know what just one extra one they're seven sorry so this guy put this look at this collar the way it's not even like it's not even stitched correctly it's kind of weird as a cleaning I can't even it's crazy you wear this usually you look sloppy I really wanted to do this review to just basically should we just stamp never get a Hanes product ever well I was gonna say I mean not the move we try to even go for the premium line earlier there's one that's even worse than this I guess and there's nothing premium about it the fit the look I can almost see your nipples and it yeah it's I don't know it's it's pretty bad I'm not gonna lie when I was younger it was three levitates all about their branding man I used to gravitate towards D that's okay cool good deal you have an ice pack but once you open it up this is what you're gonna get right here as far as fit goes to it looks horrendous this is a work that I wanna do like short on the sleeves yeah super long on the bottom we are saying nowadays people make way better t-shirts I mean the Goodfellow one for five bucks $2 50 more going alright guys so we reviewed a bunch of white t-shirts today we didn't when it comes down to the official white t-shirt that we recommend the best white t-shirt out there I would go with the supima cotton Uniqlo standard tees $15 you getting to comfort the look the quality and you could wash it numerous times I've had them for years so let's go when it stands the test of time which i think is super important yes I recommend that one what about you I'm gonna go with look I thought it was gonna be the Uniqlo kunuk one the fit wise they didn't really like it that's why I'm gonna go with the $20 top man one oh okay cuz that one has the same feel Yanik it has like a little rough feel to it definitely has to look down of the vintage vibes and the oversized fit so i'ma go with that one right there okay that's not bad top so it all just to different preferences of what type of look we would like alright guys that's pretty much it for the finding the best white t-shirt video let us know down the comments below what white t-shirts you guys are currently rocking right now and one thing I also got to bring up too when it comes to the Uniqlo t-shirts I actually size up in a lot of them okay so the medium is a little bit tighter but in my closet right now actually wear a large in those supima cotton so just keep that in mind if you guys are curious but that's pretty much it man make sure you guys are sub to the channel make sure you guys like this video and until next time we out please", "DhRa8ZGOZI4": "hey everybody and welcome to another crooked craft tutorial before we get started make sure you subscribe to my channel I put out new videos on Wednesdays and Saturdays with the occasional bonus live video it's completely free to subscribe and all you have to do is hit the big red subscribe button today I'm so excited to show you this I had such a fun time making it I'm going to show you guys how to make this cool bleached shirt and then how you can layer some HTV on top to really make it your own I love the way it came out it's super fun and bleached and you can do kind of any kind of pattern that you want I wanted the nice white square in the center what I love about these is there's really no wrong way to do them even if your square doesn't end up completely square like mine it's still a funnest shirt and there's no perfect shirt and every shirt is gonna be unique and fun and this is something that you can do with the whole family so let's get started I'm gonna show you guys how to bleach your shirt first and then I'll show you guys how to layer your HTV the first super important step is to take some cardboard and put it inside of your shirt all I've done here is taken the flaps of a box cut them off and put some painters tape to hold them together you're gonna want to put this inside of your shirt it's going to help prevent any bleed through of your bleach I highly recommend using cardboard as it is a pretty thick material you can also just buy those t-shirt inserts from the craft store but this is going to prevent any of that bleach from the front of your shirt where the big white square is from bleeding in to the back of your shirt and that way it doesn't look kind of weird on the back with a big white square with nothing in it just get that cardboard all the way in there make sure it is nice and centered sometimes it can be a little bit of a pain as you see I struggled here but once you get that done you are ready to start bleaching on this shirt I am using a 50/50 bleach and water mixture just in a little spray bottle I have it set to the streams spray to fill in that square and I do have this sitting out in the Sun on my driveway if you're gonna do these shirts please be very careful as obviously anything that you get bleach on is going to bleach so be aware of that be very very careful that's why I recommend doing these outside so I let my bleach sit for a minute just to see where I like it and how it's looking and if I wanted to add some more and I just was checking where my cardboard was because I want to make sure that I didn't overspray off that cardboard I do end up with a little spot on the back but it was fine it looked okay no big deal so I just changed it over to mist and now I'm kind of adding some misty bits to the shirt and then what I did is I took the little spray top off and I flicked the nozzle and the bottom hose part all over the shirt to create a really fun like speckled look you'll see me do that here in a minute and then this is just trying to reach out line that Square a little bit more so that it was more rounded off it was a little too small when I did it the first time but you can totally go in and change it up and do it however you want the more bleeds you put on the lighter the color will be but you're also going to get a little bit of thinning on your fabric so be aware of that I like to use a bit of a thicker shirt this is a Hanes 100% cotton shirt so you see I'm flicking the bleach that is one way to do it when I do the back I'm gonna speed that up but when I do the back I actually took the bleach sprayed it on my gloved hand to make sure you do wear gloves when doing this and then I flicked my hand at the shirt to get a different kind of look so you can kind of play with the bleach figure out what works best and what design you like and how you want your shirt to look but I'm gonna go ahead and speed these up so you guys can see it happening I'm letting the front dry a bit before I flip it over to do the back and now on the back I don't want to put that big square so I use some of my mist I use some of the stream and I do some flicking of the bleach on to the shirt I let my shirt sit out in the Sun for a little while and fully dry and then I took it into the house I rinsed it off with some cold water and then I did a quick wash on it once the shirt has been fully washed and dried you can apply your vinyl I am using a mix of Starcraft softflex and Caesar Electric so you're gonna press each layer for just a few seconds now being that the Caesar Electric presses at 305 I just went ahead and pressed the Starcraft at 305 that little bit of temperature difference won't really make a huge issue and all I'm doing is laying each layer down and just pressing it for just a few seconds usually less than five seconds and pulling it up and then removing that transfer sheet you're gonna do each layer like this and then when you do your final layer you will press it for the full 10 to 15 seconds again because I used Caesar Electric I wanted to make sure that I was in fact using the electric settings it was fine with the Starcraft softflex so I had to lay the main bunny down first and then her a really cute red el\u00e9ctrica headband and on top of that I layered some Starcraft softflex white in the stars again just pressing for just a few seconds on each layer that way it doesn't over press go ahead and remove that carrier sheet you do want to remove these ones warm they are warm peel items next comes the little adorable like outline for her headband so you want to make sure that you take your time the reason that you don't do a full press on each layer is because HTV shrinks so if you full press you're gonna end up having a hard time lining them up correctly because they tend to shrink so that's why you do just a really quick press a lot of you ask what he pressed this is this is a Starcraft clamshell 15 by 15 heat press I will link this below it is the best purchase I have ever made for my crafting I use it all the time it's super easy to use and it is a really good quality product so now our last layer is going to be our cute little electric blue glasses that go on our bunny so I just wanted to make sure I got those lined up where I liked them and this time we are going to do the full press because we have all of our layers down and we are ready to go now that we have waited that 10 to 15 seconds here is the finished bunny I'm gonna peel off the last carrier sheet and move it so you can see it here is our finished shirt I love how it came out it was so fun to do and it's so unique the bunny looks awesome she is super cute and the electric really gives it that little extra shine if you guys have any questions please let me know in the comments down below I'm always happy to answer those for you make sure you subscribe to my channel I put up new videos on Wednesdays and Saturdays I hope you guys had a great time and happy crafting [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "CDQJcmIwCmI": "hey guys Melissa Harris shirt space here today I solve the age-old question what is better cotton or polyester so sit back and let's get to it [Music] in short the best answer I can give you is it's what you're using it for so now let's dive into a pro and con list kind of like you did with your ex before you broke up with them cotton first cotton is strong and it's soft and has been used since the dawn of time you think that would make it the best but in fact that's not good but let's dive into some more pros cotton is breathable so if Comfort is your number one choice you've found your best match another thing cotton is cheaper but that's only for now cotton is renewable and biodegradable but here's your first con cotton is a very water intensive crop with that said they also rely heavily on pesticides this would move this into the con list for sure however organic cotton has really started to make a play within the industry in the last few years okay let's next touch on polyester polyester is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber aka it's plastic you think this would be a con however in the last couple of years manufacturers have actually started to use recycled bottles to make polyester tees more pros for polyester include that it's durable meaning it will withstand all of that wear and tear polyester also dries quickly wrinkles less and is stain resistant all major pros now for the ultimate plot twist manufacturers have actually started to combine the two making it the goat of blinkx poly cotton blends don't shrink they hold both their shape and their color for extended periods of time they are affordable and they have the softness you want in your favorite team okay we've made it this far and you think you know what T is gonna work best for you but I'm about to throw you the ultimate curve ball now you have to put decoration on your apparel so let's get into it first we're going to talk about water-based inks water-based inks you have to use 100% cotton this also applies to discharged inks as well next let's touch base on plastisol inks with plastisol inks you can use bulk cotton and polyester however with poly and poly blends you'll want to make sure you touch base with the manufacturer to make sure you're good to go in the ink Department when it comes to embroidery you can use both cotton and polyester however just make sure you have the right thread count to make sure your needle will pass through the thread with ease finally heat transfers for vinyl you can use both cotton and polyester however make sure you have the recommended heat settings from the vinyl manufacturer for sublimation we recommend using a hundred percent polyester after all of that I guess we're gonna have to let the debate continue because as you can see it really depends on what you're using the product for but we want to hear what works best for you guys and what is your tried-and-true so give us some comments below to let us know what works best for you thank you guys so much for stopping by to engage in the debate of what is better cotton or polyester if you're looking for more debates like this click that subscribe button turn on your notifications and have a great rest of your day oh hey there thought you'd get rid of me but here I am talking again don't worry you'll only have about five more seconds to pick another video before time runs out look at that one in the top I think that one looks very interesting", "qpYGhGNPm7A": "two things that I like I like t-shirts and I like style hacks I'm always looking online to find different little tips and tricks that can help getting dressed easier just help your life in regards to fashion a little bit more simple so one of the tips that I always see online is to make your shirt softer using salt so I was like huh this interests me BASC your t-shirt in salt and then it suddenly comes out softer I'm always buying t-shirts and frankly I like to buy semi expensive t-shirts there are certain lower end brands that work for me but you know I'm a t-shirt junkie I want them soft I want them nice so I thought to myself well if these hacks actually work could I take like a five pack of Target Hanes t-shirts and turn them into an expensive shirt so I could essentially take a $2.00 shirt and turn it into a $100 shirt so I got really excited about it and went to Target about my shirt it's about my salt took a little Bowl and I went to town so this is the new version of the t-shirt from Target PS immense medium a little tiny I would get immense large our boys large excuse me so this is a new one out of the package it feels pretty soft but what I discovered is I think what they're doing is they're putting like some sort of coating on top of the shirt so it feels soft in the package but then once you wash it like the softness washes off so feeling it I'm like well this isn't too bad but don't be fooled so this is the new the star control item okay pretty soft you know looks pretty good so then I found a instructions online on how to make your shirt softer with salt and what they said was to take big pot of water put your t-shirt inside cover it with water add one cup of salt and bring it to a boil okay so bring it to a boil once it hits a boil you put it down to a simmer pop a lid on it and let that baby marinate in that salt water for 45 minutes so I did that watch a little scandal while it was boiling away and then you take it out you put it in the wash and wash it like you would your normal clothes so I had a couple of other things in the laundry use my soap did the whole thing dried it was thinking out crunchy okay this did not work the boiling trick it didn't work this thing feels horrible like it is so far from soft that it's like it's ridiculous and on the site they were saying that they tried it and it worked you know maybe they had a more expensive shirt to start with maybe that's what happened but I do not recommend the boiling technique big ole thumbs down moving right along so then you know this is a five pack I could experiment then I found another recipe that said take bowl of water just regular cold water no boiling required half a cup of salt and soak your t-shirt in it for three days and then wash it as normal so for this one I was like let's just add a little more salt 1/2 a cup didn't seem like enough so I think I added a cup of salt you know I wanted to a speed of the process so I put the shirt in the bowl of salt on a Friday and then Sunday night I took it out instead of washing it in the machine because I thought maybe that would be too harsh I hand washed it with some soap from the laundress and I let it air dry for a bit I tumbled it in the dryer just to soften it up and these are the results now this one feels a heck of a lot better than the boiled shirt like way softer does it feel softer than the the new one not really so the salt trick you know sorry if you got all excited you were like oh cool I'm going to like check out how to do this I just don't know that it works that well I think you should just buy a soft shirt to begin with like I said I hate to burst your bubble but I'm in three days and I wasted like a couple cups of salt I could have cooked with that salt I don't think it's worth it but I will tell you if you do want to try it definitely the three day soaking method Trump's the old boiling method so scrap the boiling so I would love to hear your thoughts if you've tried this and maybe it worked for you maybe I just have no clue how to dip a shirt and salt maybe I just suck at it but if you've done it and it worked please let me know if you've done it and it was horrible - I'd like to hear about that as well so that is how you fail at making sure softer with salt", "kMynC2jFrQw": "[Music] so hello tom with the father's workshop screen printing again and look we're back on part two remember part one we were basically dealing with uh the shirts and how much polyester was in the shirts on the 5050 on the bleaching that was going on what kind of shirts you would use because you see them bleaching and they're they're sublimating sublimating to it and as they sublimate to it [Music] is that a regular 100 cotton but well no they're using basically heather shirts that are a 50 50 blend 50 polyester 50 cotton what i said we were going to do in this episode we were are going to use a 100 percent cotton shirt i'll show you the shirt down here this shirt right here this is a 100 cotton this is the i will show you this is a gilded somebody buy me a camera because this thing is terrible but this is a 100 cotton because i bought it i know what it is and as a 100 cotton what we want to do we want to treat the cotton shirt with the poly t plus and no we're not a sponsor for poly t plus i know they get a plug every time we say it and um and it makes them look good so maybe they are to send me some of that stuff free but um what i'm going to do [Music] is we're going to spray the shirt we're going to saturate it roll it all that stuff that they say to do we're going to do that and prep the shirt so the shirt will be prepared and all ready so what we'll do we will print out our sublimation photo and when we do that we'll put it on the shirt now it's a black shirt so you know it's not going to show up very well at all you know to sublimate on a black shirt is a no-no because you don't have white uh in sublimation ink so you basically have to put a white background to sublimate on so they have a sublimation paper that you can sublimate on it's a process but you can submit it on it cuts it out and you'll have the picture on there with the white uh in in it but it's only the white because of the background so that's what brings it out so you can actually see it on on dark colors but here we've got this black one and we're gonna bleach this afterwards we'll bleach it like everybody else does but we'll do it a little different but we're going to bleach it and we'll see what the sublimation looks like now this is 100 cotton so if somebody says if you got a customer says hey look i want 100 cotton shirt can you do that on 100 cotton and they've got that picture that they want that is a lot of color now unless you've got your screen printing and your screens ready and um you know and you're going to you want to you wanna screen print this you can do it but you'll have to do it after you bleach it i don't know how bleach does on [Music] um on regular plastisols but we're going to use sublimation ink but what we're going to do we're going to treat the shirt first we're going to go ahead and get the resin in the five in the threads the poly polyester resin we're going to get it in the thread so when we put the sublimation photo on there it will look good you won't be able to see it looking good until you bleach it so the bleach is going to bring it out so you'll get to see what it looks like once we sublimate it with the picture and we look at it and say then but right now we're going to treat the shirt so what we want to do um let me get to give me just a minute and let me get to my roller and stuff and i'll be right back okay got my roller here it is this is the roller and what we'll do we'll spray it on the shirt and then we'll use the roller and we'll kind of uh make it you know roll it roll the stuff into the shirt i guess that kind of gets it on the fibers on the on the threads really well and soaks it gets that stuff on there so once we heat press it and i'll have to find the paperwork that tells me how long to heat press it i've got it right there i'm looking at it so i have to walk around the table again and go over there to get that so we'll be right back again okay now do you remember i have my handy dandy ruler and i have the instructions remember dads always read the instructions you know how you get the bicycles and stuff in and you think you can put it all together or remember remember when you ordered the wheel barrel and you tried to put it together and by the time you got done either you were short some screws or you did or you had a bunch of extra ones left over because you didn't put them where they were supposed to be so you found that your wheelbarrow fell apart because you didn't put them all in there like you're supposed to anyways let's um let's look at this these are the instructions to our poly so we're we're gonna we're gonna go through this and look at it and um it says we need to have our press set up to 3 30. uh we need to um [Music] okay so one were well okay we're supposed to mix our poly okay we got all that all that done i still got some in the container here i've already got all this stuff mixed up so i've got some in the container i mixed that up before so i don't know what the shelf life is on that but uh we'll find out um two preheat the press all right three um spray the shirt until damp use a foam roller to press poly t into the fibers okay so we're supposed to spray the shirt and then once we do that once it's into the fibers uh cover lower platen with then cotton material avoid moisture blah blah blah blah blah press light pressure 330 degrees for 30 seconds okay so we need to go for 30 seconds and that says do a second coat of poly t-plus the second coat does not need to be as heavy as the first um and then it says cover with parchment paper press 3 30 20 seconds um heat press temperature 385 degrees [Music] okay the heat press temperature and then 30 degrees to be sure the shirt is completely dry okay well let's do that let's go ahead and get this out of the way now we're applying all right now for you for y'all that don't know what i'm using the bottle is over there it's the polity polly it's the poly t plus um it is not the old poly this is the de-sizer in a separate bottle than the actual quality spray that was when they sold it to start out with and now they just have the polyt plus which has everything in it you just do the spray and you're done so what i'm gonna do here we go all right let's get this started [Music] [Music] we're going to work this in real good and this is getting this into the material that's why i'm using the roller this little piece of stuff is on there but we'll take that off [Music] once i get all this rolled into it real good but remember what we're doing we're putting this poly tea into it because this is going to put the poly resin we need on the material okay now we're going to spin remove this computer out of the way we're going to bring this around slide this back in there [Music] we're going to set this up [Music] then we're going to press it to [Music] let's just press it for 30 seconds and um i guess i should have set the timer for a little bit more because i don't have to set for eight seconds so [Music] 22 3 247 30 seconds now it looks like it needs to press a little longer because it still looks a little damp so i'm going to press it just a little bit longer get the moisture out of the shirt so go for [Music] okay all right that was 15 seconds okay [Music] now according to the instructions it says the second coat of poly tea the second coat does not need to be as heavy as the first and um one thing i didn't do i should have done is i should have used my parchment paper this is parchment paper i should have used parchment paper when i when i did that but i didn't but that's okay it didn't hurt nothing so what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and spray this again all right now we did not spray it as heavy as we did first time but we'll go ahead and roll it out [Music] do set the bottle of poly over [Music] now like i said this time it goes for 20 seconds yeah cover with parchment paper almost did it again so we'll put parchment paper on it i know some of y'all are going to carver's favorite parchment paper thank you for reminding me and here we go we will put this on here we'll go for 20 seconds that timer set at 12 seconds i thought it was 15 but it's [Music] 2 12. 17 18 19 20. all right [Music] and we want to make sure that that is [Music] dry sure that it's dry [Music] now i want to put this i also want our picture to be straight [Music] they put the picture on it y'all could quack quarkitated [Music] that looks like it might be straight and if it ain't well it just ain't all right now what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and print up we're going to print the sublimation photo have i got one yet nope but you know how it is on the magic of camera stop pause video editing stuff whatever i'll be right back okay we are printing the image right this very second i'm cleaning the nozzle head on the printer is the thing clogs up the craziest thing i know if you've got one of these um epson's 2750 wf 2750s that thing ain't done nothing but constantly fog that nozzle gets clogged up so if you're not printing on a regular basis uh that's the only thing i hate about it i'm going to get me a sawgrass eventually i'm gonna get me a sawgrass um one of those printers and um so if y'all feel sorry for me you can send me one if you want to i'll advertise it but um anyways that's the print i got out i'm gonna put gone fishing and um it's funny i can show that i'm looking at it in the in the camera i'm looking at it in the camera and it actually says gone fishing but it's a mirror image so i mirrored the image but actually it's backwards i guess when i show the video too it'll be backwards i'm looking in the background and i'm noticing all my shirts are back let me see yep even my face is backwards i'm standing on the left side of myself don't even realize it all right be right back okay we are back no we had to print up something and uh so we printed up gone fishing that's what i wish i could do to take my boat out there and get out there and catch me some fish speckled trout running old man's back of trout i like spaghetti i like collecting i just like fish i don't like sushi okay i don't eat raw fish i eat real fish hey raw is real and um you say well sushi has real fish now i'm talking about going out fillet them up i mean put them in the pan while they're still flopping so i'm talking about fresh anyways we're going to put this on the shirt now if you'll notice this is going to come out really dark on the shirt you're not going to be able to see it i'm going to be able to tell it very much but here's where the here's where all the trick comes in is when you bleach it then the white is going to show up and then the pit the picture of the fish is going to come out right now it don't look like a whole lot on this paper i don't know what it could look like on the shirt but we'll find out so let's uh let's wait and see you know what this looks like you know what the shirt looks like you know what i look like and uh let's go ahead and put it on the shirt and when we get done doing that what we'll do um because we've already treated the shirt we'll bleach it we're going to bleach it here in the building it's dark outside so i ain't got no sunlight everybody talks about you gotta do it in the sunlight you don't do the sunlight you're not going to walk well i guess we'll do it and we'll do it in the um [Music] we'll do it in our you know so let's uh let's press this thing [Music] okay so we're gonna find it i'm gonna put it on here let's find the spot we want to put it [Music] make sure it's right in the middle okay that should be good i don't know well here's what it looks like [Music] see it i don't see nothing so i don't know i don't see nothing i'm gonna put this over to the side i want to cut off [Music] my heat pressy [Music] and [Music] and [Music] see how that works [Music] [Music] okay we're still waiting on the bleach to do something being that it's inside it's not out in the sunlight it's going to take a lot longer to do so it's uh it's gonna take a little while but that's all right let's see what it looks like [Music] so you can see it's coming along and so the picture starts to get brighter as it gets wider so that's what we're waiting on so it'll take a little bit longer um it's also cold a little cool in here i just kept the heat back on that's what that noise is over there you hear that heater running i'm out here in our little studio shop and uh we'll get this going now i have used this this little roller put some bleach on it and went over the spot where this picture is at so it will kind of whiten it a little more but um i don't get these tapes over here but it's it's just cold in here and i don't think we're going to get any better than this and i don't want to keep the bleach on there too long bleach is not good for the material get these off there and if you don't like the little [Music] don't like the little piece of tape on there as far as the little stripes [Music] don't like them you can always blend them in a little bit [Music] put you some little marks across there [Music] blend them in with the shirt [Music] now we'll take this shirt we're going to put it over here and we just dropped it in our bucket of water that's a actually a bin with [Music] oh we got it in the water and [Music] now that we've done that we got it in the water um i guess it's best to do it during the daytime unfortunately i didn't have time this afternoon to be in the sunlight i was too busy out doing other stuff so maybe i going fishing you don't know that anyways i've got uh got him in the water and uh we tried that out um the pitcher did not come out as well as i wanted to i need to pull the printer head off my printer and clean it so we're going to try this again but anyways i think it looks pretty good it looks kind of um well they call it a distressed a distressed shirt a gone fishing distress shirt but it would be good to have that little clear because uh there's something about the black shirts of turn orange uh i guess and the thing that is the bleach that i'm using is old bleach and it looks like it's been separated because of the cold weather so so at least i didn't get all over me so we will do this again tomorrow when the sun's out and hopefully it's not raining but uh we're going to do another black shirt and we're going to i'm going to pull the print head off there tomorrow before we do the video and this will be part three so this is part two we did part one this is part two tomorrow we'll do part three and i won't load i'm gonna load this up tonight i'm gonna edit it and load it up tonight and let you see what we got and uh and then we're gonna do this again and uh let me let you see the shirt one more time i just squeezed the water out of it [Music] anyways [Music] so that's what you got on that i've got a lot of a lot of other ideas so it'll look like it's kind of straight right here like the piece of styrofoam got a piece of styrofoam under there you gotta be careful it doesn't take the shape of your [Music] so [Music] [Music] so and what's good about this i've got all this is basically neutralized and i just went over here and just did this corners kind of make it spread out but now i'm going to unneutralize it because i'm putting more bleach on again oh how about that [Music] till next time part three tomorrow lord bless [Music] you", "hByEF6AaYAY": "\u200bToday we're talking about the Alternative\nApparel 100% ring spun cotton t-shirt. Now, this t-shirt by Alternative Apparel is one\nof our best selling ring spun cottons for a few reasons. One because it's Alternative Apparel offers a really soft fabric. It's a thinner fabric texture also, compared to\nother 100% ring spun cottons. A really fine thread count, the threads are very tight.\nWith that thinner thread also means it's just going to flow better.\n\u200bComes in some great colors. Great fit. It's right now between kind of the Next Level,\nCanvas 100% ring spun cotton pricing and the American Apparel, it's a good middle ground.\nOffers the same great fit, awesome fabric. Instead of telling you all just about it we've\ngot Tyler coming over, going to show it in action.\n\u200bFirst thing you're going to notice a great fit. Has the side seam here, which now a days\nis standard on any shirt that's going to be a nicer brand. Offers that side seam so it's\ngoing to be tailored right to your body. \u200bThe collar here is a great collar. Little\nthinner than other brands. The seam is on the inside also so it's a very flush outer.\nPrint location across the front is awesome. We have right here the sleeve length, great,\nright mid bicep. Not baggy like a lot of the other shirts that we're talking about on these\nvideos. Any time we're going with a nicer fabric and a better fit the sleeve should\nnaturally complement that. We don't want the sleeve to be baggy and the sides tailored.\nIt would be totally uneven. This shirt has great proportions.\n\u200bIn terms of the length we've noticed that this shirt seems a little shorter than the\nAmerican Apparel or even the Next Level comparison. It does seem a little shorter. Not bad, it's\njust something to note. Check out the size charts on our site and again this shirt is\njust great all around shirt. Kind of that middle price point in the 100% ring spun cotton.\n\u200bNow, we've talked a lot about 100% ring spun cotton and kind of the softness, the\nfit. You might be wondering what about shrinkage anything that way. Now, it is 100% ring spun\ncotton so over the course of it's life it could start peeling. It also could start kind\nof distorting in terms of how you dry it. If it's on high heat. We're not talking about\nfirst wash, second wash, the first washes. We're talking about a year down the line.\nIf you nuke the shirt. Longevity wise, anytime you want a shirt for the long hall a blend.\nA 50/50 blend, a 60/40 is going to be better than this for the long hall of the life of\nthe shirt, but this is a great shirt. You're going to love it and overall this is one of\nour best sellers because Alternative Apparel is a hot brand right now.\n\u200bTyler you look awesome in it too. Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate\nthis t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video. Please let us know if you have any\nquestions because here at Coed Monkey soft matters and so do our customers.", "vnRV3p3Deq0": "hey everybody it's rachel with die press today i want to show you how to use poly t plus for supplementing cotton and cotton blends poly t plus is a one step formula that allows you to prep and sub a shirt in only five minutes paula t plus does two things at once it removes the chemical sizing and it also lays down a polyester resin on the cotton threads let's talk briefly about chemical sizing thread is coated in chemical sizing during the manufacturing process to prevent the thread from breaking while they weave the fabric together sizing can cause two problems one is it will burn and scorch when heated and it will also cause your image to fade after the first second wash poly t plus is sold as a concentrate there are three reasons why we sell it as a concentrate number one we sell it as a concentrate to prevent freezing when we ship it to colder regions we also sell it as a concentrate to extend the shelf life of the product and lastly we sell it as a concentrate to save you money because we don't want you to have to pay for us to ship water across the country since i'm pretty sure you have water where you live here are the four smaller sizes that we sell of poly t plus the four ounce bottle poly t plus will make 16 ounces of spray when you add water and it will coat about 30 shirts the 8 ounce bottle of poly t plus concentrate will make 32 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 60 shirts 16 ounce bottle we'll make a half a gallon or 64 ounces of spray and we'll coat about 120 shirts and lastly the 32 ounce bottle of poly t plus will make a gallon of spray and coat about 240 t-shirts all right so before we spray the shirt we do want to get our heat press heated up because this formula needs to be pressed while wet so i need to make sure my heat press is ready so as soon as i'm done spraying i can press it wet in order to remove the sizing and cure the poly t-plus at the same time so i've set the heat press at 330 degrees and that is currently warming up so while that's warming up we're going to go ahead and spray the shirt the first thing i want to do is i already made up my spray i took the four ounces of concentrate poured it into this 16 ounce bottle and then i added 12 ounces of purified water and shake it up and you're ready to go okay so you want to spray the poly t plus about the size of your image this cardboard is just slightly larger than my image so i'm going to use this as a template to mark to have an idea of where to spray and then you're just going to spray you get it good and wet you need to have it wet in order to see steam and to remove the sizing so this step is actually going to be wetter than the second coat that we will apply after all right i think that's looking pretty good next thing you need to do is cover it with parchment paper any other type of paper will stick so it must be parchment paper uh this is parchment paper from costco the thicker it is the better because if it's really thin and flimsy it will tend to get wrinkles which will press into your shirt so we lay that across there and you should see some steam coming out here okay that's 30 seconds open it up that first coat is dry now we're going to apply a second coat this is the second and final coat this one can be a little bit lighter than the first coat and i'm just i kind of remember where my image is going so i'll just spray that area right and roll it in again all right oh and by the way this shirt is actually a 60 cotton 40 polyester and we recommend starting with a minimum of 40 polyester because you're gonna get more vibrant images uh the shirt that i'm wearing is actually 100 cotton um i did this whole technique on this shirt and it's already been washed but in my opinion it's not as vibrant if there's at least a little bit of polyester in there all right now this time this is the second time we're pressing it wet this time we're only going to press it for 20 seconds and this is to cure and dry the poly t plus so we're ready to subtle mate okay all right now the shirt is ready to sublimate so we're going to set it aside before we sublimate we need to pre-press at 385 for five seconds to make sure there's no more moisture left in the shirt okay i'm ready to subtle mate i got this really cute design from debbie does design and i'm going to put this on the shirt center there and what i like to do is i like to cover my sublimation paper in this case it's just multi-purpose paper cover that with regular copy paper so this absorbs any extra ink that might pass through that way when i do my butcher paper i can keep using this butcher paper over and over again and not have to worry not throw it away and not be so wasteful okay so we have the temperature of 385 we're going to press medium pressure for 70 seconds and actually i just did want to show you here we don't i don't have anything on the press except for the thick rubber mat that came with my heat press and that is because all the seams are off this press if you were doing a smaller shirt like a onesie or kid shirt or even a raglan shirt you would need to lift up the image area higher using a silicone mat so you would lift cut it about the size of your image put it underneath the shirt so that your image area is higher than the thick seams on your shirt like i said medium firm pressure 70 seconds all right 70 seconds is up all right looks good nice and vibrant still feels really soft if you happen to get too much coating on there and it feels a little stiff the softness will come back after the first wash thanks for joining me today be sure to subscribe to our youtube channel also join us on facebook look for the group titled dye sublimation that is sponsored by die press for more details about polyt plus check out www.dipress.com", "kPUMT4N8IEo": "what's up guys my name is Dan McCready I'm here at Twin Cities in st. Paul Minnesota and today we're going to talk about the different kinds of cotton when choosing the right t-shirt you can only love you if you've looked at cotton t-shirts you'll probably see that there are a lot of different options you've got standard cotton ring spun combed ring spun heirloom organic lemon shrimp coconut shrimp what do these all mean what are the differences between these types of shirts first of all all cotton no matter if it's ring spun combed organic it all has to go through a process of spinning where the cotton is drawn out into long strands and turned into a yarn the yarns later sewn into fabric which makes your t-shirt so your basic standard cotton t-shirt such as your gilding g500 it's spun into a yarn but a lot of the short strands of cotton and left in there and you get a rougher feel less durability because of that it's the least expensive oh it's a shirt and I saved a buck next you've got your ring spun cotton all that means is there's an additional process of spinning the yarn and in that a lot of those short strands will be taken out this gives you a softer more durable type of cotton not too shabby the next one is your combed ring spun cotton and that's just an additional process of coming out short and mid-sized strands of cotton leaving you with a really long strong durable piece of yarn and then this would be like your next level 3600 your American Apparel these give you a much softer much more durable t-shirt this shirt is really soft and nice I love it if you've looked at Bella canvas shirt so you've noticed they have something called heirloom cotton all this really is is a cone ring spun cotton they've coined their own term heirloom cotton it's their process of towing and spinning the cotton and it's a marketing term they claim it's the best in the industry if it is or not that's up to you to decide but that's all that is is a cone ring spun cotton heirloom cotton huh highlight misty and then lastly we've got organic cotton which has nothing to do if it's ring spun or told and everything to do with the way it was grown and harvested in an eco-friendly way so to recap you start with your standard cotton also known as carded open in cotton that's your cheapest least durable roughest feeling cotton and then you go up to ring-spun which is softer more durable a little more expensive and then you go into your combed ring-spun cotton t-shirt those are much more expensive but they're much softer very durable very nice t-shirts are made out of this and then finally you can go into your organic Cotton's which make the price go up even father if you're looking to have t-shirts made head over to Twin Cities com fill out a quote form and we'll get you set up thank you guys for watching this episode I hope you guys enjoyed this and we'll see you on the next video if you have any questions leave us a comment you", "_Z5kpF7aFEo": "[Music] hi guys it's Krystal welcome back to my channel today I have a really cool technique I'm gonna show you were gonna be sublimating on colored t-shirts you heard that right so we're gonna be sublimating right on these colored t-shirts place them I like to purchase my t-shirts from I'll have it linked down below I'm not affiliated with them at all for one they're super cheap number two I literally have them the next day I'll order them on a Thursday and have them on a Friday they're super fast I ordered these on Friday and had them on Monday this time I purchased the Gildan soft style these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton now you guys know I normally purchased the dry blend and they're 50/50 so I usually get the white ones and we sublimate on those because you can sublimate with at least 50% polyester but today I wanted to try it with a little bit of a higher count but it was sublimate these on the shirt and then we're gonna take them outside and spray em with bleach and you're gonna see a really cool trick happen all right so let's go ahead and get started today I'm gonna be using my 12 by 10 Cricut ez press cause it's going to cover these perfectly I ordered these designs off of Etsy and I'll also have these linked down below so let's go ahead and start with the Fermanagh first but he settings I'm doing for this today I'm doing 350 for 60 second because they are a blended shirt we don't want to scorch the shirt so I'm doing 350 for 60 seconds so we're gonna start with the FIR mama and we're gonna do it on this color here this is gonna be the 65% polyester now remember the higher the polyester count the better it's going to look so that's why I did this to show you because I already knew people are gonna ask about the 50/50 shirts so let's go ahead and get started I've got my heat press mat down the biggest one you can get I've got a piece of butcher paper here also I purchased my butcher paper by the roll from heat press nation I'll also have it linked below we're going to put down our shirt here in the inside of the shirt I'm just putting a piece of white cardstock just in case it bleeds through to the other side I'm just sliding that inside there making sure to go wherever the image is gonna go if you don't want to forget is to to do the lint rolling do not forget this and it's gonna be hard to tell with it being a co-ed shirt so I make sure and do the whole front side of the shirt that's just the way I do it to protect everything because you want to do a bigger area than the press so make sure you get your lint roll going on here you're gonna want to take a ruler and get this where it needs to go the ruler that I've been using recently is this cricket ruler here it's three by eighteen and it perfectly comes three inches down it has these gridlines here hopefully all can see this but it's got these lines here and I could figure out the center so the center of this is nine inches so I could come perfectly in the center of the shirt like this three inches down and now I can figure out where to place that so when I print out my images I try to get them nice and even on my paper here so that's what I've already done so we've got three inches down and now I'm just gonna make sure I get this exactly where I want it to be nice and even like I said I can actually see between these lines here just I'm gonna move our ruler out of the way our parchment paper on top this is going to protect our easy press and now we're ready to go 350 for 60 seconds light pressure keeping it completely steel you well move our butcher paper now if you see this right here that's just moisture and I actually should have pulled the moisture out of this shirt first so don't skip that step so you would actually want to preheat this we'll do it on the next one but this line will go away in a minute it's not gonna matter if in the end but that will go away so you want to go ahead and peel this up just like that so if you separate on a color t-shirt this is what its gonna look like it still looks super cute if you wanted to leave it like that once again this is gonna go away that's just pulling out the moisture this is what it would look like if you sublimate on colors that's gonna stay there it's not gonna wash out but that's what its gonna look like we're gonna take it a step further and we're gonna bleach this thing so let's go and press the next one get my shirt up here I'm gonna go and get my white piece of card stock in here the reason why you want white is that way the in case there's color ink inside the dye or anything it's not going to come out on the t-shirt or lint roller I'm gonna pre-press our area this time for about 15 seconds I'm gonna push that down I'm gonna go ahead and line up our ruler again a super cute image this is for a teacher the Apple is like it the Apple is a cactus how cute is that and then in the inside you could see some of the teacher stuff it's really cute all right so I'm gonna go ahead and get this as even as possible I've already got that on the paper here like I said so I know I can just kind of go on here and I'm actually gonna bring my paper up just a little bit cuz my designs down and get this even do with that cut my parchment paper on top 60 seconds all right so this is what it looks like so far right my sublimation image still looks really good so I can actually use this another round so I'm gonna set that aside see here it's super light it's really hard to see I mean you can see if there but I mean that's not a shirt you would want to sell or wear really I mean it's hard to tell it really seems a little bit better than what it is and it really is not when I bring it in this is what it looks like down here I mean it's not great but now let's go ahead and take them outside and spray some bleach on them and see the magic we're gonna take some regular Clorox it looks just like this just any kind you can use Walmart whatever burns you want to use so you're gonna take some bleach and I've already put it in some spray bottles these came from Walmart these are over in this section we're like your hair stuff and all that is travel stuff I filled up two that way if I run out I've got a backup and I'm gonna label these bleach so that way the kids didn't can't mess with them but you want to take some bleach and putting your spray bottles then you're gonna want to take a trash bag I'm gonna take our t-shirt so hear out my light you can see that our image here alright so we're gonna take our t-shirt here hopefully you guys can see I'm working on a piece of cement out here and I'm gonna take my t-shirt like this before you guys can see that and I'm gonna put my my my plastic bag up inside this is gonna protect the opposite side of the t-shirt so that way the other side don't bleach I'm gonna do the same thing to the next one so you can see here's that image out here at the light you guys can probably hear all the animals and critters out here so there is that image I'm gonna do the same thing put it I'm gonna put the trash bag inside is I take this is the end of the bag I put my two ends together like this take my t-shirt here open it up I put one over here in the on one side you can see out here I'll hold it and then go over to the other side hopefully you guys can tell what I'm doing and then you see in the middle there I'll grab the top shake it out and lay it flat okay so this is what we've got so far you can see the plastic bag coming out there a little bit so like I said there's the fur moment on this oh this is your lighter color and this is the darker this is 65 poly 35 cotton and this is 5050 50 poly 50 cotton you're gonna do take your spray bottle and we're just gonna spray this whole area so I'm going to kind of create like a square and then spritz some little uh I'm gonna spritz have few spots outside to kind of make it a little bit messy and worn down so like I said just taking my spray bottle here and like I said just gonna create me like a box so I'm just really coating that you guys can see that picking up a little bit and I may want to come down a little bit more on the shirt a little bit less to kind of give it like this faded look so now I've kind of got that soak in there all right so now I've got that one kind of soaking so we're gonna go and move on over to the next one I'm gonna do the same thing so I'm gonna create like a square going on here you can see that already starting to bleach through so as you can see I'm really really soak in the sublimation image I'll bring that in so you guys can see so you guys can see I'm really really soak in that sublimation image and then it's kind of working its way on the outside just roll lightly so I'm trying to create like a vintage effect so I'm just gonna kind of throw some spots out around so I'm just kind of getting some here on the end of this and swinging it so you can see if you when you splatter you kind of get like these effects here that's gonna kind of give you that see that already starting to take effect so you just let it stay here as long as you want until you get that effect you want and then throw it into the wash to stop that bleaching process what happens is sublimation does not leach it will not bleach out so the t-shirt is which is now gonna be white and you're gonna see that image really really well so how cool is that it really come through but for hers you can see how cute that is see how much better that image looks looks so good you can see this bottom part super cute but you can come down as low as you want to you can see that hers has like this splatter effect hopefully you can see that it's really neat so many possibilities that you can do with this you can see the sleeves are gonna be a little bit different with lines in them so if you kind of leave some wrinkles so this right here look how cool that is if you leave some wrinkles in the shirt like kind of have it up a little bit like this it's gonna create really cool effects like that see that image right through there now and so this one's gonna keep working as soon as it lightens up I'll bring you guys back over here and show you what it looks like hey okay my dog seriously man does he okay so I decided to go ahead and do one more this is that same image we did on the 50/50 this is the second time I'm using that same image I told you guys it was still bright and vibrant so I'm using it this is on that 6535 so we're gonna try it on this one here this is where we're at so far with the 50/50 my daughter already had to take the other one the other shirt inside because it needs to be washed out she's gonna go put it in the tub with cold water that way she could wait for these to be ready to go to put in the wash but you could see here how it's working as soon as that dries you're gonna see that same effect but I'm gonna let that keep doing its thing and I've already pulled out the trash bag and sprayed the back a little bit as well all right so this one here is gonna be that same image so I'm definitely recommending using at least that 6535 for this because they're coming out really nice so let's go ahead and spray this one but with this one I'm not putting the trash bag I'm making sure it's super flat for these wrinkles and stuff so I made sure it's super flat that way it'll have like the same type of effect on the back so it's Gordon get sorted another thing I've noticed was and I didn't realize if you unscrew this and you're gonna get more of a strain hopefully I can like shoot this here so you guys can see that you're gonna get more of that you know stream where I could go do something like this hopefully you guys can see that you guys can see where I'm getting more of like a blob so you guys can see that so I can kind of go through the shirt a little bit like this getting a few blobs hopefully you guys can see what I'm doing here try not to do spritzes I'm trying to slow down because if not you're gonna end up with streaks like that and really wanting like blobs like that so maybe pay attention and I'll streak it out like that so hopefully that don't look weird okay so now we're gonna do the same thing we're gonna go all the way around and cali the square but this time I'm gonna take it all the way down the front of the shirt like this kind of leaving that sides all right now I'm gonna go ahead and kind of let that do its thing and I think that's pretty good for me these shirts really don't take that much bleach like the 50-50 really took a lot maybe depending on the color too if I would have done something maybe if I'd have done something lighter but you could see how fast this one's coming through I'm not fast-forwarding or anything you could really see how fast this dudes working so it's working pretty quickly all right so see how I kind of came down and I've left the sides and it should go through the back like that and I did like these spotters on the sides there it's like I said I think that should be enough now you see how about images coming through super cool so I might put it in fast-forward motion to let you guys kind of watch this play out you it's kind of taking a peak real quick and seen with the back okay so it didn't go through the back too crazy I don't think it even went through the back because it's more of a light mist I don't even think it went through the back of this one it's really cute so it's got like this dark purple with this light or like pink tone going on here almost like an ombre effect if I want it to look just like this I would stop right here go get it in the washing machine now if I want it to get lighter I'll just let it continue to sit here and it's going to continue to lighten up so it's just however you want to so you leave it as little or as long as you want to depending on whatever effects if I was done with this I would go ahead and if you're not ready like you're making more shirts run it under cold water in your bathtub wring it out really really well and set it aside in the tub and finish getting all your shirts done and then throw them all in the wash at one time be here on the sleeve see where it's starting to get wider and wider here on the side you can see how much it's like they're not got some really cool spots but I'm really liking this well that's gonna look it's kind of like a light you can see where that bleach came through with just a little bit all right so I'm going to shut this down and get these in the wash and we'll meet you back at the craft room this is the one that we had done last so this is the second time I had used this image here and this is gonna be this is on the 65% poly it came out really really good so you can see how that came out look how cool these effects here are if you kind of get that spritz going on really cool so you can see it's just faded around like that this is what the backside looks like so it's still bright but it has like some splash through of the bleach like this has some and bring this up a little bit more so you've got like these spots like this and then you can see what's kind of darker here it's really cool this really cool effect and then this front so it's got this really cool vintage washed-out effect I really really love the way this one came out I'll have some nice pictures over on my Instagram so this is that first one that we had done with that fer mama I'm not too excited about the way that I had done the bleach I feel like I went way too far down and I left this piece right here because she's gonna tie this up a little bit so she's actually gonna do like this whole tied just like this so it's gonna be really really cute but I kind of wished I would have been a little bit more faced did did you look instead of so much right here but you can see if you put some wrinkles and stuff in here you can get some really cool effects so you can see how the arms came out here if you kind of wrinkle the arm zone you don't have them flat so that came out really really cool you can see inside the shirt to where the trash bag kind of got right up in here so you can kind of see how that looks the only thing about this one so we have that trash bag you can see what the trash bag came through here I didn't do anything on the back so this one's like a solid pink it's stay pink and I think I would want to wash out a little bit more so I think I'm gonna go back and add some bleach to this to give it a better effect but that's how that one is with the trash bag I kind of just recommend not even messing with the trash bag it's just more preference if you don't want anything on the back use the trash bag but if you like this washed out look then I recommend going with the trash bag you see how cool the back looks on this one it's got this really cool washed out effect and then on this one it's just really kind of I don't know I'm not too big of a I'm not too big of a fan of that so but this is using trash bag not using charge bag all right now for the 50 now I knew that you guys were gonna ask about the 50 50 so I went ahead and did the test but I do not recommend it so let me see if I can figure it out okay so this is the original color of the shirt there's still some right here and all it did was fade it out so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and bleach it one more time I'm gonna kind of get this area but I'm gonna wait until the morning time where it's really hot and I'm gonna try to really get this area and keep going over and over again but even at that that's way too much work I would not want to do that when these shirts are the exact same price I'm liking a lot I definitely like I'm a lot more they definitely give you that really washed out look they're super soft like I said they're 65 percent poly and you can see how good that image came out so it looks really really good and I could even have this one we didn't even bleach that much could have actually came in here and added more bleach and had more of a white effect like this one did but remember we left it so it's more of a lighter pinkish purple type of effect I really love the way this one came out so to me I don't recommend the 50/50 shirts because it's even if we do end up getting this to bleach down anymore it's just not like this image is gonna come through if we eventually got this to come through it would look like these but I just don't know how much bleach is gonna take and how many times I'm gonna have to do it so I'm gonna to continue testing and just to see if I can eventually get it to but if it's that much working like I said guys I just wouldn't even recommend messing with it that's just too much fuss for me when you could get these and these are like I think two dollars inside my shirt dollar something two dollars a shirt they're super affordable and like I said I have the link below of where I shop for these so I definitely recommend them number one they're super cheap and they come in really fast and they are the Gildan I'll have a link straight to them the Gildan soft style just remember whenever you look at the shirts you want to get the ones that are heathered so even though they'll be under the soft under the soft style you have to make sure they say Heather it's the heathered ones and I keep saying heathered but it has like this more you know look to them like this instead of like a solid so so there it is I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next", "boX_isNul7M": "Today we're talking about the District\nThreads 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt. Now, over the past few years this has\nbecome one of the most popular and most demanded T-shirts we've seen, for a few reasons. One is the price point, two is the color options, and three is just the fit and fabric. It feels great, fits great and again, that price point is amazing. So, so many bands look at this shirt as their standard at merch tables. Instead of just telling you\nabout it though, we do have our model coming over and we're gonna show it off.\nNow, first thing you're gonna notice is it is a great fit but there's no side seam here, which that's, that kind of\nbegs the question, what does that mean? Well, without a side seam we can\nactually do more of a wrap logo, which is very popular. If we had a side seam\ngoing down the side, it could be an uneven print right there, which makes the ink\nkind of bunch up and not be as good. So this is perfect if you want to have a wrap logo. The next thing we're gonna talk about though is just this neckline. It's bound on the\ninside, super clean neckline here. 100 percent cotton has a good stretch to it without being too\nstretchy. The sleeve length is pretty generous here. It's a little longer than, maybe the comparable Next Level or American Apparel, but still hits at a great point here, not baggy at all. It comes in great colors, and like I said before a great price point for this shirt. 100 percent ring-spun cotton, now you might be wondering, does that mean it's gonna shrink? How should I wash it? What size should I order? It fits very true to size, on top of that, it is a hundred percent ring-spun, so you're not gonna have to really worry about shrinking it. A year or two years down the line if this becomes\nyour favorite t-shirt, I'd just say, don't nuke it in the laundry. You know, kinda keep it to that mid to low heat, because cotton, over the course of its life, could shrink. Cotton also can pill, so, if you're looking for\nlongevity of a shirt, I'd recommend maybe looking at the District Threads 60/40 blend or\nmaybe a Canvas, Next Level, American, one of their 50/50's if it has to wear and re-wear every week for volunteers or maybe, if you're ordering for employees that have to wear it. But this is a great price point, 100% ring-spun cotton, same line of thought as the Next Level or Canvas in terms of pricing. Cheaper than American Apparel though and the Alternative Apparel. So, if you're looking for a great price point go with this, which is why we get it demanded so much. Thanks so much, you look awesome in it! On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "jx6u8fXNl94": "what's up guys Rob's you graph here with three storm fitness with anybody t-shirt that I've been wearing a lot for the last few days I just got a six pack of these from my dad went up and a half my wardrobe comes from my dad he's like God if there's like a shirt or a brand he's total brand and if there's something he loves like I'll get a car full of them like when I see him don't wait here here's a stack of t-shirts ER like I haven't had this LL Bean Katahdin hoodie which I've reviewed before yeah I told him I needed a new hoodie exactly when I went for Christmas you got two of those they're great by the way I did another review review all those while back anyways these are Kirkland Signature white t-shirts my dad is a obsessed with Kirkland Costco you know it Silva Costco he loves Kirkland so he loves these shirts he's a chameleon of them and now I have six of them they are they are fantastic he does know his stuff is good taste and value work value fashion first of all thing I love about these is they're long I'm a tall guy this one has not been washed have not washed this one yet so right now you're looking at an extra-large I'm six for about 255 and so extra large you could see I'm for those of you who are you know big big boys and girls out there who know that like I don't necessarily need an X double X L for most of my shirts because of you know my overall volume it's usually because the two other Street I get a double XL because you know a lot of shirts don't come at all I got to get them I gotta get em tall because I'm tall and especially after they wash them a few times so most of my shirts will just you know be wore like halter tops and I guess that's pretty cool but it's not what I've bought these are amazing it really they are I think the six-pack I think he he got him like some sort of special sale they're like 1850 or something I think they're normally a little bit more but they amount to average about 4 bucks a shirt which is a steal really for the quality of because they're also in addition to being tall and they do shrink a little bit they're 100% cotton hun percent Honduran cotton I mean under us so you know they're good beautiful country other than I'd imagined um but they're very thick very very thick like I said I like back to my original point about shrinking like I said my dad has about two of these wore them for a long time they do shrink a little bit but that's it's it's not it's not anything it's a you know I'm sure you have cotton shirts before you know you know what will happen when you wash and drive over over that durability is it's phenomenal in these like they're you know they are very very thick like I would I don't know if that does anything for you there but um trust trust me they're very thick very very soft and they're so thick that I would almost I play I wear them in the summer the reason we've been doing this is because I go through t-shirts like crazy personal trainers home in the gym all the time I'm trying to like wear anything really nice usually grab a shirt off the top of my clean shirts and go so I'll definitely get plenty of use on these but they are so thick that like they've really be great for like cooler weather because they're they're just they're heavy real heavy duty really a whole lot more to say about it I mean it's a t-shirt you know I think they come in other colors I think I think they come at least I know they come in black but for the price they sell them on Amazon we'll put a link I think they're a little more expensive on Amazon there or Costco but if you don't have a Costco around you we don't have a Costco or anywhere near us and even if we did you got to be a member so you know you pay a little bit more if they're on Amazon but they're still super cheap you may be paying like five bucks of shirt so definitely have my endorsement I would say I'm as excited about these as I get to get a Bella white t-shirt you know they're long so again another good benefit of it is if you got a dress up for like some you know formal event you have plenty of of tuckable material and talking to your pants so I'm just a win all around guys Kirkland Signature Honduran white t-shirts check them out let me know what you think if you got something oh yes you like that put a little Spanish in there for Honduras gunas sorry I'm butchering that see you guys", "pPCYhGCQ418": "hey y'all it's Betsy from cuttin corners vinyl in Natal in Texas and today is craft Smith season 2 episode 4 and we are going to go over how to DIY bleach dye a shirt and then put a one color graphic on it now I'm going to give you all the instructions pretty much from start to finish but remember with crafts maasai don't show you all the cutting procedures if you need to know that look back at my Cricut or silhouette tutorials or brother scan and cut I give you all the instructions over there now give me a moment and I'll show you how I bleach my shirts [Music] [Applause] so as you can see I have a piece of coroplast and a mustard Bella in canvas shirt now the first thing I'm going to do to do this bleach shirt is I'm going to take and place my shirt over my coroplast you can use cardboard if you've got it I just like to use plastic for it because it seems to make it a little bit where the bleach doesn't absorb into the paper and kind of keeps the bleach a little bit more where I want it so I'm just taking and putting this on and if you can hear the air conditioner I'm sorry but it's hot so I run my AC there we go okay so as you can see I have it loaded on to the cardboard now the first thing that we want to do is now that we have it all smoothed out it's going to decide on how we're wanting our design are we wanting to just bleach the bottom half of this chart which you can easily do are we wanting to bleach a center circle which is what I'm wanting to do but then we want splatters other places I am using the Clorox cleanup spray with bleach this makes it a little bit simpler instead of worrying about a actual bleach bottle so what I'm going to do is start making my circular pattern now this is not an exact science so each one is unique when you do it like this which is part of the fun of doing it so as you can see I have a pretty equal circular design with a little bit of overspray where we're going to get a few extra bleach spots now I'm going to take and stand a little bit further away with my bleach bottle about two feet from it and just kind of spritz all the other places to kind of give it that unique bleached love [Music] okey-dokey so now that my shirt has all the bleach on it I'm going to let it sit till I reach the desired whiteness that I want so and once that happens then I'll wash the shirt but as of right now we're going to leave it alone just like it is and let it set for a little bit and then we'll come back to it so as you can see this is what the shirt looks like at this point you can see that it is bleached out this color to more of a pale yellow and then on the spots that are completely dry they are white now this is still damp so I'll probably let it set till it's completely dry and then throw it through the washing machine but I wanted you to see at this progress because I won't get to film this again till it's washed and dry now to remember this that if you are applying vinyl over this shirt you are going to want to wash it with regular washing detergent with no fabric softener so if you're using the pods don't use the pots because fabric softener will mess with the adhesion of your vinyl so this is what it looks like at this point and this belt in canvas that I am using is a hundred percent cotton so it may take longer to achieve this shade of lightness if you are using a 50-50 shirt it may take less time I've only worked with 100% cotton doing this bleaching method but as you can see we have a nice spot to be able to put a design on and it has this really unique look to it this is what the t-shirt looks like after it's been washed and dried with the bleach spray used on it now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and line it up just like I would any other shirt on my steady Betty with the collar off and the tag let's make that down just a little bit there we go and the shoulder seams even now one thing I am gonna do that I normally don't because it to me it's not really necessary but because this has been washed and dried I want to iron out the wrinkles so I'm just taking my easy press which is preheated to 332 Gries for 15 seconds but this is such an easy thing to do and we'll take and make you a lot of money now I'm using my 15 inch t-shirt guide lined up with the edges of my study buddy which my study buddy is a 15 by 24 inch and that's why I use the 15 inch now I'm taking my design folding it with the sticky side out and giving myself a crease now I'm going to load that Center crease mark up on my t-shirt guide and use about three fingers to measure down now this file is available on my patron for $10 or more patreon patreon supporters or you can purchase it from my website same thing with the vinyl I am using the brown glitter flecks ultra so we're just going to hold this on this section for 15 seconds and then on the other section for 15 seconds at 330 degrees now this process is mainly to show you the glitter process not the glitter process with the bleaching process but I wanted to show you how cute you could make these and this is something that is so popular right now you could make a whole lot of money selling these okay there we go now I'm going to take and remove my clear backing off of here perfect cover it again with my Teflon sheet 15 seconds on each side because again my ez press is 9 inches by 9 inches if you have a 12 inch you wouldn't need to do this you could do your whole design because this design is cut at 10 and a half inches wide there we go okay turn that off look how good that looks with just one simple color and you can see that that bleach process really did work out well for this shirt now give me a moment we'll go over everything that we've done there are a couple of things to remember about when you are bleaching this shirt I always wash and dry mine you don't have to but remember if you put too much bleach it can't eat holes into your shirt that's why I recommend washing and drying and whenever you wash them you can use soap but do not use anything that has fabric softener in it it will mess with the adhesion of your vinyl but I love how this turned out and I know this week's been a lot of shirts and there will be another one tomorrow because we're doing our crafting for Disney we're throwing those in with our craftsmen to kind of keep things moving along but just remember it's not all about shirts but this is such a cool process and it's so popular right now I wanted to make sure to show it to you now remember if you like this video don't forget to give it a big thumbs up

Facebook snapchat Twitter and Instagram as well as my second channel which is just Betsy Goucher and I do all my makeup and all that fun kind of stuff logs all that over there but I guess that's it so we'll see you on the next one bye", "p6PMvht5z6k": "\u200bToday we're talking about the American\nApparel 2001 100% Ring Spun Cotton Fine Jersey t-shirt. Now this t-shirt is the t-shirt that\nstarted the entire soft t-shirt revolution. I say that because this was the first shirt\nto be soft. Back in the day, it's hard to believe, but we all grew up with shirts that\nwere stiff. It felt like you were wearing cardboard. This was the first shirt to actually\ncome out and offer a soft fabric, and not only a soft fabric, but a great fit, tailored\nfit. \u200bAs we talk about this here today, just\nthink about that. It dates the shirt a little, and it makes it one of our favorite shirts.\nInstead of just telling you though, we do have one of our models coming over and going\nto talk about this on him. \u200bYou can see, right away you're going to\nnote this side here there is no side seam on the side because it's perfect for this\nwrap logo. This is only one of the only unisex t-shirts, besides our 100% cotton t-shirt,\nbottom of the line, standard economical t-shirts that doesn't have a side seam, so perfect\nif you need a wrap. \u200bThe next thing you're going to notice though\nis though it does have a great fit, it's not boxy, because this shirt, although it is one\nbig wind, it's one fabric, it doesn't have that boxy feel. Love that about this shirt.\n\u200bThe neckline is standard crew neck length here, the sleeves, mid to high bicep, awesome\nplacement here, very flattering, great statement shirt. 100% ring spun fine jersey t-shirt\nmaterial. This shirt breathes great, feels great.\n\u200bIn terms of the price point, it's a little more expensive than the Next Level and Canvas\n100% ring spun, and just that top of the line 100% ring spun material. If you're getting\nthis, you know you're getting the top of the line 100% cotton, made in America as all American\nApparel is. We love this shirt, it comes in a ton of colors, also comes in a comparable\nladies style if you're looking for companion style. If you have a big group of people that\nwant to order ladies and unisex, this is your shirt to go with.\n\u200bAlso, if you're thinking about care instructions, we're talking 100% ring spun cotton here.\nOver the course of its life, we're talking a year, two years down the line, it could\nstart pilling. 100% cotton, we always like giving that disclaimer that if you're going\nto dry this thing on high every wash, it could start shrinking, or just distorting. We don't\nrecommend washing it and drying it on high temperatures. Keep it on low to mid, and it's\ngoing to last a lot longer. \u200bIf you are looking to order for a staff\nat your business or restaurant, or volunteer organization that they're going to wear on\nweek after week, definitely bump it up to the 50/50 or 50/25/25 blend, it's going to\nlast a lot longer. \u200bAs you can see, it fits great, it feels\ngreat, we love this shirt for so many reasons, and I guarantee when you try it on, when you\nexperience this, just like I literally think millions of people have done since the early\n2000's, you'll know why this one t-shirt started the entire soft t-shirt revolution. You're\ngoing to love it, Tyler you look amazing in it, thank you. \u200bOn the Coed Monkey soft scale, we rate this t-shirt a 2. Thanks for watching this\nvideo, please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey, soft\nmatters, and so do our customers.", "I0dYWtua97Y": "Welcome back to the gentleman's Gazette! Today's video is all about cotton. We discuss what it is, what it's not, the\ndifferences in qualities, the impact on the environment, what you should look for when\nyou buy it, and what to watch out for. Cotton, you might wonder, isn't all cotton\nthe same? No, it isn't. Even if it's a hundred percent cotton, there\nare huge differences and today, about 75 percent of men's wear garments have some form of cotton\nin them. It's very affordable, versatile, and accessible,\nand it can hold up to 27 times its own weight in water. It is grown on two and a half percent of the\nworld's arable land and overall, it's a fiber you should know about. So what exactly is cotton? It's basically linked from the cotton plant\nwhich is part of the Gossypium family and the fibers were meant to protect the seeds\nand are comprised entirely out of cellulose material you often find in nature, such as\ntrees. Outer fabrics such as viscose, or bamboo fabrics,\nare all based on cellulose as well. Cotton plants are actually shrubs and they\ngrow wildly but today, they're cultivated most of the time. Looking back, cotton was found in garments\nup until 6000 BC and it was mostly found in the Middle East. Today, the commercially for most grown cottons\nare all derived from that ancient cotton plant. Columbus noticed that when he came to the\nBahamas, it had a huge impact on slavery which was perpetuated by the growth of cotton itself\nand to learn more about it, I urge you to check out our in-depth guide on the website\nhere. Today, most of the cotton comes through US,\nChina, India, as well as many countries in Africa, and South America. In the US, commercial level growth of cotton\nis heavily subsidized while developed nations hugely rely on machines to harvest cotton,\nit is still picked by hand in Africa, or in Egypt, in India, and developing countries. Ofcourse, picking by hand is much more labor-intensive\nand the people who do it or not paid very well. At the same time, you get a pure fiber simply\nbecause you don't get any impurifications into the fiber at the picking stage. When cotton is harvested, they usually select\nthe seeds and so after harvesting in the country of origin, as well as the country where the\ncotton is spun and woven, it goes to many gins that make sure to remove all the seeds,\ndirts, and impurification from the cotton. Because the purer the cotton, the better it\nis. Not all cotton fibers are alike, the better\nones are longer and you can get them in five or six centimeter lengths which is like two\nto two and a half inches. Lower and cotton has shorter staples and it's\nharder to spin them into yarns at the same time, it is usually softer but you will see\npilling much more quickly and it will wear out prematurely. For that reason, all quality cotton products\nrely on long staple cotton. Once the fiber is cleaned, it is spun into\na yarn and sometimes you have a 2 ply yarn which means two strands of yarn apply together\nwhich helps to create a more resilient yarn that is at the same time, more consistent\nand long-lasting. Another process to improve cotton is called\ngassing. It's used to brighten the fiber, smoothen\nit which gives it that typical quality Sheen you may know from higher end cotton shirts,\nespecially in the twill weave. Once the cotton is woven, there's a number\nof different finishing steps that are sometimes proprietary to the manufacturers and it will\nhelp to really get the best out of the cotton fabric. Now that you how it's made, let's talk about\nthe environmental impact. Cotton is very resource-intensive in the growing\nstage, as well as in the manufacturing stage, and it uses a lot of water and the chemicals\nused to process it can be ecologically very damaging. As a crop, cotton likes warm\nclimates and as such, it is oftentimes grown in areas where there's not enough rainfall\nso it heavily relies on irrigation such as in Egypt. To keep pests at bay, you need a lot of chemicals\nbecause of that, genetically modified seeds have been developed that keep pests at bay\nso you don't have to use as many chemicals, but you still need a lot comparatively. Because of rising levels in cotton that gets\nto the end producer, the whole movement of organic cotton was started which is ever-growing. By definition, organic cotton neither has\nchemicals or pesticides and it doesn't rely on genetically modified seeds. Apart from cotton using a lot of water, it\nhas to be linked to desertification in parts of the world as well as solidation of the\nground. The absence of cotton art is an organic material\nthat will decompose unlike things like nylon or polyester. In terms of cotton quality, it all starts\nwith a staple length. Short staple is considered three quarters\nof an inch or about one and a half centimetres. Medium staple cotton is considerably about\nthree quarters of an inch to one and a quarter inch; and a long staple cotton is anything\nfrom one and a quarter inch all the way up to two and a half inches. While the majority of cotton in the world\nis a short staple and then some medium staple, you will only see the staple infused in marketing\nfor higher end cottons. Sometimes when you see labels of higher-end\ncotton, you will see the term sea island cotton but what exactly doesn't mean? It is an extra-long staple cotton grown on\nthe sea islands outside the South Carolina and Georgia. In theory, the sunshine and the level of humidity\nprovide the perfect conditions for a high-quality cotton. Even higher form of cotton is a so-called\nWest Indian Sea Island cotton which is legally only allowed to be grown\nin parts of the Caribbean. Even though the output is limited by the size\nof the island, there are a lot more products labeled as sea island cotton western Sea Island\ncotton that is actually made in any given year. Obviously, there's a lot of fraud going on\nin that part, however, if we can get your hands on genuine West Indian Sea Island cotton,\nit's almost like touching cashmere. Sometimes, shirt makers also advertise Egyptian\ncotton and basically what they mean is it's the longest staple cotton from a batch, it's\nnot necessarily cotton that is always from Egypt. You'll also\nfind Egyptian cotton in towels or anything that touches the skin. Usually, it's used to demand a higher price\nfrom the consumer. A subgroup of Egyptian cotton you see so-called\nGiza cotton which is more high-end. Each giza quality comes with a number. With giza 45 con being the most luxurious\nand high-end Egyptian cotton on the market, its extra-long, has superior fineness, and\nis very consistent. To guarantee the highest quality of the longest\nstaple giza 45 cotton, it is hand picked and hand combed so there are no impurifications\nand you get the finest cotton there is. Sometimes you see pima cotton or american\npima which is named after an American Indian tribe, it is also considered to be a extra\nlong staple con and it came about in the 1900s. You may also have seen supima cotton which\nis short for superior pima cotton and while it's not a grade, it's an organization that\ntries to promote pima cotton. Like organic cotton in itself is not a description\nof quality, all it tells you that no chemicals or pesticides were used and it's not genetically\nmodified. It doesn't tell you anything about the staple\nlength, so if you pay more for organic cotton, you do so because of the impact it has and\nthe pesticide freeness, not in the quality. In my experience, West Indian sea cotton is\nreally the cream of the crop and I would even place it above a giza 45 cotton. For dress shirts, Ialways go for a two ply\ncotton and make sure that it's a hundred percent cotton and it's not stretch with polyester\nor nylon. While it makes it more durable and it's may\nbe appropriate for uniforms, work wear, maybe for chefs in the kitchen, it's not something\nyou want to wear on your skin because it's rougher and not as comfortable, also it's\nnot as absorbent. If you're lucky, you can also sometimes find\npolo shirts made at a pima cotton, however, most of the time, it's a lower grade cotton. Interestingly, thread counts or gsm grams\nper square meter are units used usually for linens and towels, not for garments. In my experience, there's a lot of fraud going\non and I wouldn't rely just on a number that's presented to me. So how can you find out if the cotton is luxurious? The problem is that you have a soft cotton,\nit can feel very comfortable on your skin, but it's in fact soft because the staple is\nso short. Higher-end cotton is usually very fine which\nmeans you can have a very fine weave and you get a very nice Sheen. For men's shirts, probably Albini is a largest\nkid on the block and if you want to learn more about that company check out our guide\non the website here. At the same time there are other good cotton\nmanufacturers out there but sometimes the problem with relying on brands is that they\nmay change the quality over time without you noticing it or without them changing your\nlabel. For example, I own Polo Ralph Lauren sweaters\nfor over ten years and the quality has gone downhill by a lot. The sweaters have gotten softer but it's because\nthey used shorter staple cotton that pills much more easily and looks old and the colors\nlook washed out much more quickly than the older sweaters I have. So what are their cotton buying do's and don'ts? Don't believe that all cotton is created equal. Quality cotton is usually softer, it is shinier,\nit is finer, and it has a smaller impact on the environment because you can wear it for\nlonger periods of time. You should always expect more from a higher\nand cotton retailer; they should be able to tell you what specific kind of cotton is used,\nhow many plys they are, how heavy the fabric is, and where it was sourced. At the same time, don't believe all the labels\nthat are not backed up by a trusted industry Authority such as Albini, Thomas Mason, or\nTessitura Monti, or other famous cotton makers which are known to produce a quality product\nmade out of long staple cotton. So how shouldyou care for cotton? Fortunately, it's one of the more easier items\nto take care of. You can machine wash it, you can hand wash\nit, but machine wash is totally fine, the only time I'd stay away from machine washing\nmy cotton is in a suit such as a seersucker suit or another cotton suit but mainly because\nof the canvas and the things on the inside not necessarily because of the fabric itself. Ideally, you should always follow the care\ninstructions on the label because if you wash it too hot, the color may come out and I also\nwould urge you to wash it with light colors, otherwise, the chances of it looking duller\nis much higher. To keep colors vibrant and cotton in a good\nstage, it's best not to wash the pair of jeans after every single time of wear and if you\ndo, you can pull them inside out just like with the sweaters to try to prevent pilling\non the outside which is visible. Also, it helps your cotton if you don't over\ndry it so ideally, air dry it. If you have to use a dryer, maybe partially\nput it in a dryer and then hang it to be air dried, otherwise, if you fully put in a dryer\nyour garment won't last as long. When it comes to dress shirts, should never\nput them into the dryer because of the interlining that may come lose, it's harder on it so always\nair dry those. You can either iron a dress shirt when it's\nwet so it's relatively easy and the wrinkles come out. The problem is it takes a lot longer and so\nyou have to figure out what makes sense for you. Ideally you put it on a hanger and let it\ndry. When in doubt about the temperature you should\nwash your cotton on, go with a lower temperature or wash it on cold because it will make sure\nthat your colors last longer.

In today's video I'm wearing a rather casual\noutfit made of a polo shirt from Uniqlo out of 100% cotton. the collar is made like a shirt collar and\nit's not so flimsy like usual polo shirt collars because of that I really like it because. I'm wearing it untucked it's not longer in\nthe back than it is in the front and the shorts I'm wearing are by Polo Ralph Lauren made\nout of a soft cotton this is an old pair of shorts that is still made out of a higher\nquality cotton in my opinion than the newer shorts you can buy these days my shoes are\ncasual summer shoes called Alpergatas from Spain they are made out of a checked cotton\nfabric on a u2 soul with rubber it's a very summery shoe and it doesn't give you a lot\nof structure yet it's breathable and I find it perfect for outings at the beach or just\nvery summery resort wear outfits that don't really care about formality.", "-MshQ4K83z4": "welcome back to another video so today I'm gonna be showing you guys how about washing and drying my t-shirts so they won't shrink or lose any quality [Music] so I've quite a few shirts here I have one two three four five great t-shirts of course how we're letting gray three black t-shirts one two never mind just two black t-shirts should have a white t-shirt but I think I forgot it I'm gonna be right back and the white t-shirt so for starters one of the most important things to do it's of course sort them by color I've already done that as I showed you I have to graze the blacks and a white all separate the most important thing to do is to check the Kerr attack in most cases you're probably watching cold water when you're watching t-shirts especially colored t-shirts any kind of heat will shrink that t-shirt so we're gonna do a bit of a test I'm gonna use the Machine and also some hand washing methods to see which one works best before we get started we're going to measure the size of a cup of t-shirts a grey one and a black one just to see if they're gonna be the same exact size before and after washing let's do it [Music] tell me baby is a good touch time I managed alright now that we're done with the measuring let's let's get the washing so I have two gray split teeths from keeping New York everywhere so I'm gonna actually machine wash and in hand wash the other one they're both the same measurements both a size large so we're gonna see how do you still hold up so as you can see there's nothing really special about this wash I'm using is by a brand called Hotpoint have no clue what that is this would just actually inside my apartment when I moved in so this is the best we got we're using a small load we're using whites light and we always want to wash code as I mentioned one thing I will say about these low and washing machines even though you chose to wash and code in most cases is still gonna use hop for majority of the washing so that's just something to keep in mind and I can't say that it'd be the case for all washing machines but it definitely is for this one like I mentioned I don't know much about the brand hat point but I'm guessing this pretty low budget so let's look review what I got load size small I have this on whites light but let's actually go to delicates because we don't really want anything bad to happen to these clothes of course and for cold let's use tap cold we've got the shirts in there I'm gonna be using Tide Pods just one of them just one drop that in there they were gonna hit start now for the hand washing I'm going to be using Tide simply clean and fresh I'm gonna pour a little bit into the lid just a little bit make sure we're running cold water [Music] for the shout it's all the way alright and how do we have to save mother's before with cold water we're gonna pour a little bit of this in there mr. Bob Dole the t-shirt against itself I usually mainly focus on the pits [Music] because of course that's what perspiration happens very good and they'll rub it in and I do that for both mine arms now we're just going to let that soak for a little bit let me get little more water in there as I mentioned cold water dry like this so as you can see the water looks a little bit murky because of course is shirt was dirty and I'm going to check on the other shirts as I mentioned this water is hot we're just gonna do the same thing which allows for this to soak it now again I would not recommend using hot water to do these that of course what this all is about we're gonna test and see which method works best and then Jenny all right so a couple hours have passed since this has been soaking these items are completely done they've actually sat in here a little bit longer they should've I had to tend to some other stuff so I'm hoping these didn't drink at all it looks good that one looks good that one looks good so what we're gonna do with these items is hang dry them [Music] so I dressed in all the gray shirts out of the washer and then hung them on this drying rack that I got from Amazon this is a stainless steel drying rack I'm not sure exactly how much I paid for it but what I'll do is go ahead and drop a link down below so if you're wanting something like this you can find it now we have to dry out this so it's kind of hard to get a good angle on it but when I was doing I would grab a piece twist it fold it twist it fold it twist it and that's usually enough to wring out enough of the water I'm just going to put this on the rack as well and then let it dry overnight so now we're done washing all the gray t-shirts we're gonna go ahead and tackle the black t-shirts and I mentioned earlier I'll have two black t-shirts one of them is a keeping New York everywhere split tee another one is my champion logo black team I originally planned to hand wash one and machine wash the other but it actually got really late I got kind of doing something else and it's like almost 11 o'clock and I don't want to be up all night doing this video so I'm gonna go ahead and toss both of these in the washer before I do that I'm gonna do the same exact thing I did with the great tee and I'm gonna measure to keeping New York everywhere black tee as you can see keeping New York everywhere size large turn it inside out and let's take it to be measured before toss it in the washer don't need a one-handed I know two t-shirts and a washer by yourself is just a waste of water but it's kind of what I got to do I'm just like before one pod and we're gonna keep all this settings the same small delicate tap cold so now that we got the black t-shirts inside to watch her I'm going to go ahead and just hand wash this white t-shirt this is the last one has to be washed this is a white t-shirt from Urban Outfitters so let's do it [Music] alright so now we got the washer going and we got this white tee soaked in so now we're gonna wait for this cycle to be done and about that time I'll go ahead and take the shirt out of the sink alright so now we're gonna hang dry these hang drying is the most essential part of this process alright so lastly we're gonna tackle the white t-shirt and the same no I do have a setting that's going to be a drain and spin setting on my washer so for this one I'm going to utilize that if you don't have a drain and spin setting we're gonna utilize the first method I showed you which is the twist and ring [Music] [Music] as you saw I gave it a little bit of a twist in the sink as you can see it's still pretty wet so we're gonna head and drop this into washer so just gonna toss that in there we're gonna go ahead and twist this to the drain and spin and then see what happens here we go so now it's gonna drain and spin itself and then we can hang that up so it's been about maybe five minutes and I just heard to wash your stop which means this should be fully drain now all right so far so good it's pretty drain and nice and damp and ready to be hung drive the rack is pretty full got one two three four starts here the middle bar has another shirt another shirt oh boom there we go utilize this bar right here alright so all of these shirts are washed they're all drying right behind me I'm gonna get back at you guys tomorrow and then we're going to check it see how they turned out the next day it is officially the next day and the t-shirts have been drying for precisely 21 hours something like that I just got off of work and it's about eight o'clock and if you remember I think I put them to dry maybe a like nine or ten yes about almost 24 hours they are officially dry so let's check them out and Dan we're going to measure same exact t-shirts again to see if they lost any size or quality so let's do it so this was the hand wash t-shirt so he make sure he keep this separate just to remember that was hand washed the rest of these gray shirts were machine wash so I'm just going to compare these two in size because I took measurements of these so machine washed and washed and then we're gonna compare size to the black t as well was it this one yep this one hand washed cold water so a measuring from the top like before so see there all the way down and it is at 30 just a tad bit under so hmm I measured these a mouth will last my little notes here but you see the great teacher we've had at length 30 so let's see if the chest still not 23 and a half so we got the chest starting here 23 and a half so I get to save the state I really didn't lose much size with hand washing and again his home was hand washed in cold water and then hung to dry and now we're gonna test the other gray shirt that was machine wash and then hung dry so the second one just measured out for 29 and a half in a chest both these are the same exact size it looks like we might have lost a half an inch in the length and again this was the one I would machine wash so it's safe to say that the hot water that it did in a wash cycle may have shrunk just a little bit but let's check the chest so the chest is still twenty three and a half inches now to be fair I only measured one of these great t-shirts because since they're the same size I assumed that the dimensions would have been the same but that's false they probably weren't exactly the same so I should have measured both so if we were gonna lose size of the t-shirt we would have lost size from both the chest and length so at this point I don't think that the machine washing affected anything but the true testament will be the black shirt because again that went inside the machine and I did get measurements of that before going in so let's check that [Music] twenty-nine and a half like shirt merchants out at 29 they have and it appears that the black shirt didn't lose any size at all and that was in a machine wash on the dry so in conclusion I would say that it doesn't really matter which method used whether it's gonna be hand washing or machine washes make sure you use cold water and use the delicates settings for your washing machines if you have a washing machine that allows for you to control the temperature through the whole wash make sure you use cold but if it doesn't as you see minded and have those settings and for the most part I didn't lose any quality or size of my T's if you enjoyed this video make sure to leave a thumbs up comment down below and if you're new to the channel make sure you hit the subscribe button and click the

my exam me and my homies break tonight [Music]", "23NiZTv24Uk": "- In style in general it\ndoesn't come more simple than your regular T-shirt. This is an easy stylish\nclassic when it's done right. But when it's not, it he can leave you\nlooking pretty average. There are tonnes of different\nT-shirts to choose from, some of which look great and\nothers of which look terrible. And I thought for this video I'll save you the hard work of looking. I've teamed up with Amazon for this video and they've sent me a load\nof different T-shirts. I'll be trying and testing all\nof the different brands out to see which ones are\nactually worth your money. Which ones fit the best, which\nones are the better quality and of course which are\nthe most stylish over all. I'm your test dummy for this video. Either way you're gonna find the best T-shirt out of all these as well as all the rest\nof the ones I've tried listed and linked in the description. Before I judge these shirts\nand test them out for you, we need to define you know\nwhat makes a good T-shirt. What am I going to be looking for that puts one of these\nshirts above the rest? Okay, there are a couple of\nkey factors really for me. The first one being, the neck has got to fit relatively well. I don't want it super tight\nwhere it's choking me out although it's quite rare to\nfind one that's like that. But also I don't want one\nthat's plunging really deep, that's showing off my man boobs. Secondly, the sleeves\nneed to fit really well. This is one of, if not,\nthe most important thing when it comes to choosing\na good looking t-shirt. Take this T-shirt here for instance. Whatever you think of the design, the fit through the torso is pretty good. It's not super tight but\nit's not really loose. But on the sleeves you've\ngot the dreaded triangle, the bit right at the edge of the sleeve where it spears out to the side because the arm opening is too big. And you're gonna find this same problem in about 80% or 90% percent of T-shirts. These have just been made like this just so that as many guys\nas physically possible can fit inside the T-shirt. It doesn't look tailored to your body and it makes it like you're wearing a size that might be too big and obviously it's got to\nfit well through the torso. I'm not really looking for\na super tight muscle fit one because I don't have the body for it. I want one that's may be a\nlittle bit snug through the chest and then a little bit baggier through the rest of the torso below. Because of those last two factors, all the T-shirts that you're\ngonna be seeing in this video features some sort of stretch. So they've got form of elastane or something similar\nwithin the construction. And you'll also see that each of the T-shirts\nin this video are crewneck because for me with my body it just tends to look\nbetter than the V-neck. But I'm sure there's a V-neck version of each of these available\nanyway, so it doesn't matter. also you'll notice for\neach of these T-shirts I've tried to choose\ndifferent colours for each so that you don't get them\nmixed up with each other. But they are available in other colours other than the ones I'm\nwearing in this video. And first we're going to focus on the one that I'm wearing right now. Let's take a look at the\nCalvin Klein T-shirt. Okay, here's the Calvin\nKlein crew neck T-shirt with 95% cotton and 5% elastane. These are sold in packs of two\nand come in a price point of about 31 pounds. So you look in on average just\nunder 16 quid per T-shirt. It is kind of frustrating that this is only available in a two pack. But overall anyway, how does it look? In terms of overall fit,\nI'd say that this is okay. The fit across the chest\nand through the torso is very, very good. Especially compared to some\nother options that you'll see later in this video. You have the stretch there\nso it's contoured to my torso but it's not super spray-on tight. Looking at the sleeves I'd\nsay this the sleeves are okay. In terms of length down the arm I think these aren't bad at all. I actually prefer these that's set almost banging the\nmiddle of the upper arm. Unfortunately, the actual\narmhole opening at the end that seems to be relatively big compared to some of the\nothers in this video. There doesn't seem to be a great deal of stretch in this area\nwhich is frustrating. The neck area however because it's made of a slightly more solid\ntype of material here tends to retain its shape a\nbit better from what I found. It's about the right size,\ndefinitely not too deep, pretty good so far. But unfortunately as you may have noticed from looking at me in this video, you can see the wire of my\nmicrophone underneath the T-shirt and that's because the\nmaterial is too thin. In certain angles especially in sunlight you can just see straight\nthrough to my nipples. With a brand of this name\nand this sort of price I would expect more. This just kind of reminds\nme of the appearance of like a lower quality undershirt. Overall the Calvin Klein one is okay but it's definitely not\nthe best one on this list. Next we move on to this navy\nT-shirt from Jack & Jones. Now you'll notice an immediate\ndifference with this one compared to the last one. You can tell straight away that this is a lot tighter than the Calvin Klein one. This just advertises as their basic tee, yet to me this looks\nlike a muscle fit one. And I'm normally a size medium, that last one was a size medium, this one looks like I'm wearing a small. The shoulders on this are so narrow that they're sitting way\nhigher up than they should be. And through the body it's\nalmost spray-on tight which is evident by the\nhorizontal pull lines you can see going across all the way down. And bearing in mind I'm\nsomewhere between about five foot nine to five foot 10 and weigh nearly bang on\naverage for my height, there's no way that I should\nhave to be considering going up to a size large. Never in my life have I been close to a size larger than anything. But for this brand in particular if you wanted to get one of these I recommend going a size\nabove what you normally have. Also many comes to the neck here you can see it's even\nquite big around the neck, almost as if it's like an\ninch too big around there. This one does come in at a lot cheaper price about eight pounds, so almost half the price\nof the Calvin Klein but I'm not sure if the\nactual fit is worth it. The material itself\nfeels nice and stretchy and high-quality. It's definitely better quality material than the Calvin Klein one. This one however is 8% elastane. I don't know if that's what's\nmade all the difference here but it's certainly not my favourite shirt. Now it's time to get stripy with this one from Scotch & Soda. Coming in at a price of around 31 pounds, this is definitely one of\nthe more expensive ones in this video. So does it deliver when it comes\nto the fit and the quality? Really I'd say that this is essentially a better version\nof the Calvin Klein one. Again this one has the 95%\ncotton to the 5% elastane. But the shirt itself\nisn't quite as see-through and then the rest of the\nfit is almost identical. Around the neck again it's okay. I maybe like if it was a\ntiny bit smaller for me. But compared to a lot of them\nI'd say it's pretty good. The shoulders are sitting right, much better than the Jack & Jones one. And the sleeves as a whole are okay. It fits a lot tighter\nthan your regular shirt, like the one that I showed\nyou at the start of the video. But I can already see\nafter a couple of wears that it is starting to\njust stick out a tiny bit or maybe it's just telling\nme I need to get to the gym. Through the torso this one\nfits pretty much spot-on. For this one in general I honestly don't have too many complaints. However, it does sit at\nthat higher price point. Will it be worth it by\nthe end of the video? We'll see. For the next two coming up, we've got two options from another well known brands Tommy Hilfiger. Now I decided to buy two here because they had two separate listings for something that look very similar so I wanted to see if they\nactually were the same thing. So got this one in blue and\nthen another one in white. And it turns out the two\nare slightly different. The blue one here is made up of 96% cotton and 4% elastane. I'd say that the fit of\nthis one is still very good. Around the neck area in particular I really like the way that this one sits. It's a tiny bit higher good if you've got quite a thin\nneck and collarbone area. Also this one along with the white one are possibly the most comfortable\nones I think on this list in terms of the way\nthat the material feels also doesn't seem to crease\nvery easily which is good. The shoulder area and torso are I'd say pretty much bang on. Only small gripe I had with this blue one, is that the sleeves, for me, I think the sleeves\nare a little bit too short. It's not far off, it's not bad, it still retains the stretch better than some of the other options, but I'd like if it was\njust a centimetre or so further down the arm. With the white one there was\na couple of small differences. The neck area I'd say exactly\nthe same, it fits really well and through the body\nit's nice and well fitted without being super tight. But you'll notice that\nthe balance of materials is slightly different. According to the label this is\nthe 95 to five ratio instead. Both of these options\ncome in at a higher price of around 35 pounds. And I don't know whether\nit's down to just the colour but this one you can see\nthrough it a little bit. It's certainly not as bad\nas the Calvin Klein one where you can just\nstraight up see through. But I don't know if it's due to having a slightly different material. But what I do like with a white one is that the sleeves make up for it. Because the sleeves on this\none for whatever reason are slightly longer than\nthe previous blue one. It definitely sits\nfurther down on the arm. Not super tight. I maybe like if it was a tiny bit tighter but overall I'd say that this is a very good fit as a whole. Next, we move to the\nother end of the spectrum with this green T-shirt\nfrom Urban Classic. From the 30 pound area down to\njust 11 pounds at the moment. And overall I'm really\nimpressed with this one. I get the thing that I don't\nlike out of the way first. I think that the neck area is definitely a bit on the big side. I'd like it if it was an inch\nor so small around the neck. But other than that I think for 11 pounds this is a really good option. Shoulders are spot on. And then down through the torso this one I think fits me really well. I'd say equally as well as a Scotch & Soda or the Hilfiger ones. Both of which like three times the price. And this is one of, if not\nthe best set of sleeves I think of any of the\nones I'm trying today. It's not too short, it comes down to a really\nnice mid bicep level. And around the area it still\nretains a lot of tightness which is great. The length is fine as is\nwith all of them here. Nice high arm holes. I think that this overall 11 quid is really good value for money. And you still get the\nsame sort of materials that you get with some of these\nother more expensive ones, the 95% cotton to 5% elastane. This one seems like a really good choice if you're on a budget. And the final two one here are\ntwo different black T-shirts. The first one being this\none from Only & Sons. And this one is a bit\nlike the Jack & Jones one, in the sense that it looks like someone has just sprayed\nit on with a paint can. This one advertises as a slim fit but unless you're skeletal\nI'd say that this is like just your typical spray on muscle fit. Once more this is another one unless you want the really tight body conforming fit overall, I probably say go up a size. But if you are a fan of\nthat really tight muscle fit then this is definitely better\nthan the Jack & Jones one. It's only a few pence more, I think it's like 30 pence more\nat the time of filming this. It's the same 95% cotton to 5% elastane but in terms of the way\nit fits in certain areas I think it's a bit better. The neck in particular it's a lot more conformed\nto the neck area, it's not super big. The sleeves are arguably perfect in terms of the way that they fit. Now through the torso it's just really tight\nlike for Jack & Jones one but the material feels like maybe a slightly\nbetter quality material. So if this is the type you\nwant, I'd say go for this one. Or maybe if you're a\nguy that's really thin then this might be the brand to choose. They just need to change it\nto advertised as a muscle fit and then they'll be sorted. And we finished this little rundown by looking at this black\nT-shirt from Garage. Again this is another brand\nI'm not really familiar with but this comes in a pretty\ncompetitive 12 pound 50 ish. And would you know? 95% cotton, 5% elastane. This one again it's more\non the tighter side I'd say but it isn't as tight as the\none that we've just looked at and the one earlier from Jack & Jones. Once more I think this is\na slightly better option the Jack & Jones one. It's a bit better around the neck area, also it seems pretty good\naround the sleeves too. For me, it is a little bit tight through the chest and through the torso but the shoulders are decent and the material feels\npretty good quality. So which is my favourite overall? Which one would I pick out of\nall these different options? This one's actually being quite a tricky decision for me to make. Because several of them on this list actually fitted me really nicely and I think that's the benefits of going for one of these ones\nthat's got the elastane in. You're not left with\ntonnes of baggy material or the spearing triangle on the side. If I could only choose one it would be just about the white Tommy Hilfiger one or at least that range. For me this is probably the\nmost comfortable one to wear. It looks quite stylish as a whole in terms of the shape of\nit, not including the logo. If it's well all over, so\nthe sleeves pretty good, the next decent and then through\nthe torso is good as well. The Scotch & Soda one\nactually surprised me with how good that one was as well. I just think that's the cuts of this one looks slightly better on me, not by much. In terms of budget options though I think that the Urban Classics one is an absolute bargain at that sort of price for the type of material\nthat you're getting. Things really good quality and good value. Also for me the Garage one wasn't far off and that's at a lower price. But if you want the you know\nsuper spray on muscle fits, then the Only & Sons is the best option I think out of the ones I tried today.

three holes in it because the kiddies have been climbing on me and if you have an old t-shirt that's been relegated to the back of the closet well go ahead and grab it and use one of these eight methods to repair your t-shirt so you could start wearing it all over again so I'm starting with an old t-shirt here and I have a very sharp pair of scissors so I'm just going to go ahead and poke eight holes into this t-shirt now what this is going to do it's going to allow me to put each one side-by-side and then I'll go ahead and I'll actually launder this when it's done just to see how well that repair held up now I'm using a 100% cotton t-shirt today and six of the repairs that I'm going to make are going to involve some type of polyester or polyamide along with some type of adhesive to make that repair but if you want to keep this 100 percent cotton then you're going to grab 100 percent cotton thread and you're going to make those repairs with a needle and thread now I've taken the t-shirt I've turned it inside out so I'm now working on the backside of the t-shirt I've taken a piece of craft paper and I've slid it underneath the hole and this is going to actually make the hole a little bit more visible for me to work on and it'll protect the ironing board cover from any adhesive that I might get on it so I have three different versions of 100% polyester fusible interfacing my versions come in a lightweight medium weight and heavy weight and that also means that there's a lightweight version with lightweight adhesive medium weight adhesive and heavy weight adhesive so we're going to see which one works best on our 100% cotton t-shirt so here's hole number one now I'm taking a toothpick and I'm just going to kind of coax this together a little bit before I get going here and try to get this hole to look as small as possible once I do that I could take my iron set on the wool setting and with steam at this point so we're going to try to get this hole to come together as much as possible and iron it nice and flat flat I have a square piece of interfacing cut out this one happens to be the lightweight version so the one side that has the adhesive on it I'm going to stick this straight down on top of the backside of that fabric and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a press cloth now my press cloth happens to be flannel it's just a white piece of flannel and it's dampened with water and wrung out I'm gonna take this damp cloth place it over the top of this and try not to move that little piece that I cut out then the iron comes straight down wool setting with steam and it's going to sit there for 10 seconds and I'm going to look at this and see how well this stuck to the fabric now that seems really good now I'm going to press it from the right side and see how well I did in comparison you can kind of see that it's still there so let's see if we could do one better on the next one and this time I'm going to take a little more time with the toothpick making sure that this fabric gets close together before I iron it this time I'm going to go back in and I'm going to make sure that these little pieces of thread are almost touching before I press it one more time now this is my medium weight interfacing I have the adhesive on this side and I decided to trim this in a circle this time just to see if there was a difference so it gets placed straight down on that fabric I have my press cloth again that's nice and damp that gets placed right on top of it and then the iron goes straight down for 10 seconds looking pretty good I'll flip it over and iron it from the front side now this one looks a little better than the first one so let's see if we can get even better with the third [Music] so the next two t-shirt repairs I'll make are with a fabric called poly amide and this poly amide is really a wonderful aquella and the reason why is because it's adhesive on both sides so the first thing you're going to do is you're going to make a patch out of some type of fabric so mine happens to be flannel I don't have a corresponding knit fabric that'll match this so I'm going to use flannel for this then I'm going to take the poly amide and I'm going to put it directly over the top of this patch and I'm going to cut it exactly the same size now here's the patch so I have the flannel underneath and I have the poly imide on top and I'm going to place this directly on top of that hole just like that then I'll take the pressed cloth and I'm just going to lay this down again this is damp and the wool setting is chosen on my iron for ten seconds now hopefully you can see here that this isn't the greatest way to make this patch because it doesn't exactly adhere to all the edges unless you have that cut out perfectly so let me show you a better method to make a patch for the next hole so this next product is also a poly amide but this one happens to be nice and evenly transparent all the way through and it comes with some parchment paper so this parchment paper is going to help us get the best patch possible so this next version of poly imide is really transparent all the way through and you know what you can't stretch it as much as the other versions so it may be --have a little bit differently and I'm also going to be using a smaller patch this time just to see in comparison how all these work out in the wash so I've trimmed it out a little larger than the patch I'm going to set it right on top of that so I've got my craft paper my patch the poly amide and then here's a little piece of the parchment paper that came with the product so this is going straight face down on this I'm taking my wool setting on my iron and setting that in place for ten seconds and I can lift that off and now this has become the perfect patch so what I can do now is I can trim this all the way up to the edges and now I can very carefully peel off that parchment expose the adhesive underneath now I'm ready to go ahead and patch it on to this hole well that looks really nice you know what the entire surface is stuck all the way around let's see what it looks like from the front so the next product I'll demonstrate for you is called mending tape now this is the product that people would probably point you toward if you told them you had a hole in your shirt you needed to mend and the thing about this though is that it's for woven fabric so that means like a dress shirt type of fabric it comes in all different colors depending on whatever type of shirt you have but the thing about this is that the reason why it might work for this is because the adhesive is a heavy adhesive on the back of it so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and cut this out and I'm going to do a small circle again because I think that was the most successful of all the patches so far well this one might be the best yet it's the thinnest but you know what it took about 30 seconds of dry heat to get here along with a little bit of pressure so the last two holes are going to be repaired with some cotton thread you see I have some cotton thread I have a very very thin needle I have a magnifying lamp you don't need this but you know what it makes the job so much easier you can look through the magnifying glass and you can actually see every single thread as you go through so now that the thread is through the head of the needle I'm going to the long end of the thread and I'm just going to make a knot so I have thread between my index finger and my thumb I'm going to wrap it around just like so and then I'm going to take it up and twist it and you can kind of see I'm kind of twisting it there take my third finger pull it nice and tight and now I've got a nice knot right there so your engineers the same exact way so the real trick here is to grab one thread from one side and then one thread from the other and pull it through just like that now don't do it so that it's you know so super tight you just need to grab one little end here and we're not wanting to pucker the fabric so much so you're just going to go ahead and kind of go back and forth until you can't see the hole any longer so just back and forth here grabbing a little loop on either side running that needle through the loop till you get to the end of the hole all to finish it off I'm going to go through this kind of mending area not into the t-shirt fabric itself do one loop and then try to pull that a little bit tight and then come back through go through the loop and pull that nice and tight now I can trim it off the repair is complete but let's see what it looks like from the front side well there you have it let's iron it and see if we can get that to flatten out now I'm on the last hole I'm working on the back side again I'm getting this all set with my toothpick and I'm going to press it in place this last one I'm going to do with fabric glue so your typical fabric glue that you can get at the fabric store I'm just going to dab it on there and let it dry so here's the t-shirt fresh out of the dryer now I have this on a normal wash cycle along with a high heat dry cycle so let's do a side-by-side comparison on the backside of the shirt and see how these repairs held up so here's the 100% polyester lightweight patch here's the 100% polyester medium weight patch here's the 100% polyester heavyweight patch here's the poly amide patch that we made from the loose weave fabric here's the poly amide patch that we made from the transparent fabric and here's the mending tape and here's the hand stitched version and then there's the glued version so you can make your own mind up about what looks best from the back and what you think is going to hold up over time but then let's look at the front and they all look pretty similar these patches are going to actually prevent this t-shirt from unraveling a little further but you can see as you get a little heavier weight in your patches from underneath you're going to notice the outlines so in looking at this t-shirt not only from the front but from the back I really think that there are three successful repairs here the first one being the 100% lightweight polyester patch this one actually blends in seamlessly with the t-shirt fabric you can't even tell it's there the second one I would say would be the glue now the glue there's only one problem with it it dries shiny so if you have a little opening in the front of your shirt you might have a little glisten of glue that you can kind of detect there but otherwise it looks really great and the third one is the hand stitch version now this one is going to definitely be the most secure over time they look identical all of them from the front so you can choose whichever one you want and here your old t-shirt and wear it again and again and even during laundering this will hold us and if none of those options appeal to you well then you can go ahead and you can get a bunch of beads and you can bedazzle your shirt wherever you have a hole well there you have it eight ways to repair a hole in a t-shirt you know what this is such a great life 101 lesson

graphic designs and I'm gonna show you how to do real quick how to do heat transfer on cotton shirts using a easyweed heat transfer material very quick very easy excuse the lighting on in the back room so there's not a very good light in here and it's freezing so that's why I got my head in here oh no that's not why don't get my head in here but I'm gonna show you real quick so we're gonna take a full own full willing to take up 100% cotton shirt I'm gonna take our decal pre-cut pre-cut I cut this before the before I even thought about my video but here it is oh this is easy we easy we gold in black it's not took up next two colors but that's not how it comes why should he cut this one separate and then I just put it there nope okay so what you want to do is pre-heat your garment so you can get all the moisture out from two three seconds and then apply your decals or in this case your he press material make sure it's straight I've been doing this for quite awhile so just make sure you're straight and then you're gonna apply heat or you can apply yeah you apply heat for about 15 seconds and it should be ready now when you open this when you open the clamshell if you see a lot of steam come out its kiss either you didn't get you to remove all the steam don't worry it's okay as long as you he press it for 15 to 18 seconds you're gonna see a lot of steam come out one of the reasons why you're gonna see a lot of the steam come out is because it's freezing here I'm in Waco Texas and right now it's about 27 degrees so that's why you're gonna see a steam come off not you see a lot of it which is good so then you just feel it this is a pure hot um you can either peel it how to peel it cold excuse me doesn't matter if you feel like harder for peel it cold it's okay so what you want to do this is what I like using this material you see weed by sizes on people call it Caesar size or whatever you want to call it this is this is reason why I like using this one second so clamp it down look check it out check that out ready to go so if you if you're doing multiple colors if you're gonna apply another color and talk with this one this materials perfect perfect for that

Now, the Bella ladies 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt is a\ngreat option, great price point, great fit, overall an awesome shirt. I'm going to have\nMaia come over and show it off instead of just talking about it. Right away you're going\nto notice a great fit, tailored side seam means it's naturally going to hug your sides.\nIt's going to offer that more feminine feel to it, 100% ring-spun cotton. It's soft.\n\u200bNow, if we're talking about sizing on this, we do kind of ... Anytime we're talking about\n100% ring-spun, err on the side of ordering one size larger because 100% ring-spun doesn't\nstretch as much as more of a blend does. You'll notice the sleeve length fell a little higher\nthan the unisex version, not baggy at all, naturally complements her body. The other\nthing is the neckline here, a little breathe-ability here. It's not tight up to the neck like some\nt-shirts are. This offers a little breathe-ability here.\n\u200bAll around though, great shirt, a lot of color options and since it's Bella, Bella\nowns Canvas, a unisex t-shirt company so a lot of the colors are interchangeable between\nunisex and ladies. This is great for a ladies group. You can also order the Canvas t-shirt\nfor the larger group of males or just women who maybe want more of a boxy fit, but for\na women's t-shirt, great standard. If we're talking about this versus the American Apparel\nand the Next Level 100% ring-spun cotton, I kind of put this right in the middle. The\nprice point is closer to the Next Level. You save a lot going Bella over American Apparel's\n100%. I believe that you get more out of this shirt too than the American Apparel, which\nis why we probably sell so many of them, although the American Apparel has the name everybody\nreally trusts. Bella is also a name, but anytime you're ordering 100% ring-spun, again, think\nabout ordering one size up in the ladies version because you don't want it to be too small.\n\u200bYou look great in it Maia. Thank you so much. \u200bOn the Co-ed Monkey Soft Scale, we rate this t-shirt a two. Thanks for watching this\nvideo.

technical and basic tees from uniqlo i have a handful of uniqlo tees that i've been wearing for more than a year and they've held up really great this particular shirt it's the alexander wang aries mt collab that they did a while back and it's held up absolutely great so i did notice that uniqlo added some more colors and a couple different cuts of the arizona tea to the website so i thought i would go ahead and pick some up just because there's such a good basics and i also picked up two supima cotton tees from there because i wanted to try those out and then each t-shirt i'm going to show you guys i'm going to give a sizing reference for them because it's a different cut or it might be a different size or anything like the supima cotton teeth i got one in a large one in medium and then i would showcase the different styles of other t-shirts as well i'm gonna go ahead and talk about what makes arizona so special so if you want to skip that skip to this time right here to go ahead and get to the t-shirts and if you want to see how i style it with some very simple fits go ahead and skip to this time right here by the way if you guys are into fashion at all i highly recommend you pick up a tape measure it just makes buying clothes online so much easier it just makes buying clothes online a little bit more worry free because you can measure the clothes based on the size charge to something else you already have in your collection just for a sizing reference i also sell stuff on grailed and this comes in really handy just to give a potential customer an idea of the size of the garment i'll go ahead and link a super cheap version of this down in the description below highly recommend it so four out of the six shirts i'm going to be showing you today are the airism fabric which does have a lot of cool technical features in it such as it's anti-wrinkle especially after washing it's antibacterial just to help stop odors it's cool to the touch and of course it's quick drying and very breathable as well really interesting feature that they have with some of the uniqlo errorism tees are that they are uv protectant so i wanted to look into that a little bit more to see like kind of what that was and i couldn't find anything super concrete on what they do to errorism to make it more uv protectant than a normal piece of clothing but i did find some general information on the internet regarding uv protective clothing and then taking the knowledge from there and then comparing it to what uniqlo does release you can kind of theorize on what they do so basically darker colors protect you a little bit better than lighter colors the denser the weave of the fabric obviously the more protection you're going to get from the sun which is pretty intuitive you know if you have a fabric that's super tight it's not going to let as much sun get through treatment and dyes can be added to a fabric to either reflect or absorb uv rays i suspect this is what uniqlo does with their arrows and tees because aerism is a very breathable fabric so it does let air through so it's not super dense they do say on the tag of some of the errors and tees that uv filtration has been added to the fabric to a rating of upf 40 plus which i looked it up and that rating means it blocks 97.5 or greater of the uv rays shiny polyesters and satin silk type fabrics do a really good job of reflecting uv rays as well which i think this plays into airism because depending on the t-shirt it's either 27 to 47 polyester however these heirism shirts don't really have like any shine to it like with a lot of athletic tees so they're all really subtle and look nice for just everyday wear anyways enough of that i'm gonna go ahead and get into the t-shirts so the first one i got this is the uniqlo u arizum oversized boxy tee and this one is definitely the most unique cut of all of these shirts i was going to get this back when the uniclo u collection initially released but upon the day of release there must have been some logistical error because it wasn't available until like a week or two later so then i just kind of missed out on it but luckily they are still in stock the thing i like most about this tee are the elongated sleeves they come about right up to the elbow and it does have the dropped shoulders and a much tighter collar than a standard t i mean it's not like too tight where it's uncomfortable but it is a little bit more snug up so it does have a very unique silhouette i think this looks really good with like some techier fits maybe some pairs of pants that are a little bit wider or a little bit baggier just to kind of match the oversized proportion of the top this does come in a lot of different colors but i opted just for black just because it is more of a unique cut of tea so i just wanted to play it safe and go with a subtle black instead of a really bright color but again that's just my subjective style opinion because this is oversized i did size down to a size medium now just looking at the size of this tee here the rough measurement shoulder to shoulder which i measured from the hem to the hem it's 52 centimeters or like 21.5 inches and then the total length from top to bottom is about 70 centimeters or like was that like 27.5 inches i think and then the shoulder to the end of the sleeve is 26 centimeters or like that's like 10 and a half inches i think so it's definitely pretty boxy um however the the shoulders are like i said earlier the drop shoulder so they are supposed to go off your shoulder so that's why it's so wide in those measurements but again that's a size medium for wrestling i did pick up one of the basic airism cotton crewneck short sleeve t-shirts and this is just a normal cut t-shirt that i picked up in this really nice dark gray and this dark gray in the arizona fabric kind of gives off a really cool kind of industrial metallic metal like vibe to it that's kind of weird to say but i don't know it has a more athletic cut to it but it's not too slim and they do have normal length sleeves but a lot of times with my t-shirts i do like to cuff it two times just to make my t-shirts fit a little bit better or maybe subconsciously i'm trying to make my noodle arms a little bit more buff looking i don't know i did get this in a size large and the rough measurements of this are shoulder to shoulder it's 47 centimeters or like 18.5 inches total length from top to bottom is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches so again a little bit longer than the boxier cut one and then the sleeve length unrolled of course it's about 22 centimeters which is like nine inches right right now it's just kind of wrinkled because it came packaged up all folded up really close so i'm trying to get that out of here so the next two shirts are of the same cut these are the arizon uv protectant long sleeve and these are an online exclusive so i got one in black just to play it safe can't go wrong with a very basic black tee and i also got this one in dark gray which it almost kind of has like a brown hue to it depending on the lighting in this camera it does look pretty gray um but in some lighting it does kind of give off some brown undertones which i think is really cool and i think this one might be my favorite tee of this whole like mini haul but it has a really nice earthy tone to it it's very classic fit but it's not too boxy being a basic long sleeve there's not too many cool features with this but there are like a small slit on the sides of the waist and then of course you have a nice cuff and collar as well i did get both of these in a size large and the rough measurements from shoulder to shoulder are is 47 centimeters which is like 18.5 inches the total length is 72 inches or 28 inches just like the last tee and then the sleeves are 58 centimeters which is about 23 inches these errors and teeth just have like such a great feel they feel so comfortable and i really really like the texture of it as well it's not too shiny and soft kind of like more typical workout gear but it still remains to be very soft and kind of a soft like cool touch to it but anyways lastly i did pick up two supima cotton basic tees and i am quite impressed with the feel and quality of these t-shirts now just comparing the supima cotton to a standard cotton tee from uniqlo is the supima cotton tee is noticeably more soft and it almost feels like errorism it's so smooth whereas the other one it's a little bit more coarse and granded this one is older but if you're thinking about getting one of the t-shirts i would just go ahead and opt and pay more for the nicer quality tea so anyways i did get these in two different color ways i did get one in a dark green and then the other in a dark brown now the dark green is a size large and the brown is a size medium this season they did design these to be a little bit of a looser fit just so it drapes more on the body both the green and the brown do have undertones of gray in it which makes it very very wearable just for every day and then being 100 con these are much more of a matte color than the arizontes not that the arrows and tees are shiny at all these are just noticeably more of a matte color so the large measurements are roughly 44 centimeters from shoulder to shoulder or that's like 17 and a half inches total length is 71 centimeters or like 28 inches and the sleeves are 22 centimeters long which is like eight and a half inches now comparing that with the size medium tee the shoulder to shoulder width is 47 centimeters or 17 inches so you lose about a half inch in width so the total length is 68 centimeters or 27 inches so it's an inch shorter than the large roughly speaking and then the sleeves are 20 centimeters so it's straight eight inches so not too much more terribly small than the large but it is noticeable and in hindsight i probably would have got both of these any size large just because i like a little bit more of extra room in my teeth just so it drapes a little bit nicer on the body and it's a little bit more comfortable anyways here are some outfits that i put together with these again very simple because all these tees are really great basic building blocks to construct an outfit off of so i kept everything very simple and with the aries mts i put together very basic like techware fits whereas the supima contest put together very basic street road looks but anyways here they are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i will go ahead and link all the t-shirts i got down below in the description i do use an affiliate link it doesn't add anything to the price but if you do choose to buy one of these t-shirts i get a very small cut of it so

these 5.5 ounce teas help create and sustain jobs right here in America", "yHHWooStqT8": "damn that's a good fit man who doesn't have a white t-shirt in their wardrobe it's a classic goes with everything you can wear it all the time as a base layer no matter the season and i don't know about you but when it comes to important staples like these i want to make sure my t-shirt is high quality durable and with a perfect fit the shoulders need to sit right it needs to be the right length the right sleeve length and it just needs to sit nicely on your body but what exactly is that perfect fit you ask today we answer that question [Music] first off let me start by saying that there's not only one type of fit for t-shirts depending on the way you like to style them and your personal preferences i'd say you can place them into two categories number one a standard slim fit which is the one we'll delve deeper into and number two an oversized fit the oversized fit has more flexibility in terms of how it can fit due to its oversized nature obviously it doesn't matter as much or at least it won't be as noticeable if the sleeves are a little longer or the body is a little wider than intended as long as it has a roomier body longer sleeves and drop shoulders it should look pretty good so in today's video i want to focus more on the standard slash slim fit and why do i say slash slim because that's how it fits it's not baggy it's not skin tight it gently hugs your body in the most flattering way and i say standard because this is your basic t-shirt fit if you're not going for the oversized look and you want that perfect tailored fit that you can wear with anything on its own as a base layer underneath other layers this is how you want your t-shirt to fit and in order to showcase the perfect fit i've partnered with son of a tailor if you've not heard of them before son of a taylor is a clothing tech company that makes custom fitted garments as you know no two bodies are the exact same we're all shaped differently and sometimes the standard five or six sizes offered by most brands is just not enough to fit all body shapes and sizes so son of a tailor customizes the fit of your t-shirt to fit your unique body and they even have a perfect fit guarantee so if they don't get it perfect on the first try they'll go back to the drawing board and make the slight adjustments required to get it to perfection so i tried their service made a custom t-shirt based on my height age weight and measurements and after one round of revisions i present to you my perfectly fitting white t-shirt the shoulders are 42 centimeters wide and you can see the shoulder seams sit right at that natural point where your shoulder ends and your arm starts this is exactly where you want it to be to achieve that perfect fit the sleeves come down to hit that key mid bicep area i wouldn't go any shorter or longer than this for a standard fit and with my measurements they're about 20 centimeters long in case you're the same height and that interests you now the torso is where you really want to get that sizing perfect anything overly loose will start falling into oversized territory which is a great look but it is a different type of fit and in that case you kind of want everything to be oversized not just a torso area but you also want to be careful not to go too tight you just want it to gently hug your chest without feeling constraining at any point when you move around the chest width for my custom fitted t-shirt is 49 centimeters as for your waist area you probably also want to have a different width here than your chest because unless you're literally shaped like a stick most often you'll either have a bigger belly in which case you'll need to increase the waist with or you'll have a slimmer waist than your torso and you'll need to have a slight v taper finally let's talk about the length of the t-shirt i get ocd about t-shirt length because the problem is if it's too long it looks like a dress and if it's too short you can't tuck it in without it coming out whenever you raise your arms and that is the worst the ideal length is about mid crotch that way you can wear it both tucked and untucked and it'll look great both ways and for me the perfect length is 64 centimeters when it comes to white t-shirts especially you want to make sure it's a high quality material the two most common problems i always look for are see-through material that is my biggest pet peeve having a see-through white tee and number two distortion or change of shape after washing it the latter is obviously harder to check for because you can't notice it until after you cut the tags and washed it but let me tell you i have this one primart and it did not last long after only a couple of washes it completely lost its original shape however the son of a tailor medium weight cotton t-shirt passed both tests with flying colors it's fully opaque and so far i've washed it three times and it looks brand new but with that said cotton is not the only material you can go for son of a tailor can also make them in wool yes you heard that right 100 merino wool t-shirts it's actually surprising how comfortable a good wool can feel to the skin and it gives off a more luxurious feel and then you have the tensile t-shirt stencil is one of the most sustainable materials out there and it's more breathable than cotton and great at wicking moisture away from the body so it's perfect on those days when you're moving around a fair bit but it doesn't actually feel like sportswear so you can even wear it with the classier looks you also have the peak t-shirts which are made from supima cotton and have a waffle knit texture which is normally used for polo shirts i'd say this is a great choice for the more sportswear inspired looks or just to add some interesting texture to a simple outfit and finally the standard cotton tee which you've been seeing also comes in heavy weight which can be a good choice for the colder months fabric choice plays a huge role in the final result of your t-shirt and you can really play around with different fabrics depending on your style and personal preferences i'm a sucker for the classics so my favorite probably has to be just a standard medium weight cotton t-shirt but whatever your style is you have your pick of the lot hopefully you now have a better understanding of what to look for in a t-shirt in terms of fit and fabric i've been there before where i didn't really know how things were supposed to fit and i would have liked to watch a video like this so i sincerely hope it helped and if like me standard sizes don't always fit you well and you have trouble finding that perfect fit off the rack i could not recommend son of a taylor enough feel free to check them out by going to the link in the description all of their clothing is made in europe and their t-shirts in portugal and of course they don't only make white t-shirts although that is my go-to color and i love white they also have the other go-to neutrals like black navy and different shades of gray and they even make long sleeves henleys polos sweatshirts and more hope you enjoyed the video guys i wish you a beautiful day keep on dressing with intention and i'll see you in the next video peace i just broke the chair this for a standard fit and for ah damn there's not only one type of fit for t-shirts [Music] and i say uh i feel like the light has changed isn't it brighter than before oh man come on the", "nD_A5cl5sRo": "what is going on everybody thank you so much for tuning in my name is john today i have for you a big box good that's right today we're going to be taking a look at the george men's long sleeve cotton crew neck tee and the george men's long sleeve crew neck tee i picked up at walmart for four dollars and ninety four cents a piece out of five stars our long sleeve cotton crew neck tee gets five out of five stars out of three customer reviews this shirt comes in a variety of different colorways here in front of us today we have it in blue quartz and chianti which is a burgundy red without further ado yeah let's go ahead and get into this first impressions it will be getting a little bit chilly here in southwest florida or if you're living up north what better way to you know layer up than to get a long sleeve cotton crew neck t-shirt that you can wear underneath the sweatshirt and underneath the jacket at 494 at 100 cotton and at 5 out of 5 stars i don't see why you can't go wrong with either of these options so without further ado let's go ahead and get into the first impressions and then stick around till the end of the video to see what they look like on me so uh let's start with just the cotton crew neck t-shirt here it's a very soft material not terribly thick but pretty soft i will say i do get some stitching behind the collar here which gives it some character this collar is sort of a stretchy material so if you maybe are wearing a necklace or a chain or something of that nature you won't have a problem it won't make things uncomfortable what you'll probably see behind the neck is that this is a 46 to 48 extra large sort of like a baby blue color i think this is a really nice color i get some nice stitching up on the shoulder pads here which is nice a little stretchy but for the most part i think it's going to run true to size and you're going to want to want to get this shirt in the size that you would normally get what you'll notice is that you might have to just throw this in the wash to get some of the wrinkles out if we flip over the back of the shirt here you can pretty much see that it's exactly the same as the front of the shirt no quality control issues so far i haven't looked at the other shirts yet but from what i can tell this is a really nice quality made t-shirt yeah let's go ahead and take a look at the other t-shirts so yeah before we try on the other shirts i just want to show you uh these other colorways here this one is corsair it is a sort of electric blue but as you can tell it is uh built and designed exactly the same as the other shirts it is 100 cotton even though cotton is not in the title of this particular shirt just like our other t-shirt it is pretty conservative and pretty plain you won't find anything on the back uh this shirt i was also able to find in an extra large 46 to 48 it would be form fitting i am assuming you've got the crew neck tee it also has a sort of expandable collar here you get these stitching up by the shoulder pads let's go ahead and try this shirt on and see how comfortable it is okay so i'm going to start with the chianti red color here uh this shirt fits phenomenally well there is plenty of room in the armpits plenty of space in the shoulder pads but what i actually really like about this shirt that i didn't point out in the overview at the beginning was the sleeves are a sort of spandex material they're also made out of cotton but they're form fitting and they tuck against the wrist really nicely so uh this shirt actually sort of gives off a youthful athletic uh slim fit look if you will i always tend towards an extra large and picking this up in an extra large was a good idea it's it's not thick to the point where it's going to make me overheat and for those of you living up north this would be great as an undershirt underneath a hoodie and a jacket as an extra layer also what i really love about this shirt is there is no branding on it also now that my arms are fully extended you can pretty much see that these sleeves are true to length which is awesome to see so i'm not you know getting by one on you there and the tail of the shirt is also pretty decent length longer than i expected i was expecting the tail to maybe be up here a little bit but what's really nice is uh you can tuck this into a pair of jeans if it's really windy and like snowing out uh everything else is really comfortable about this shirt it is 100 cotton it's soft to the touch like the other two uh giving this shirt a really thin youthful slim athletic look currently i'm just wearing them with a pair of navy blue shorts and actually this is a great look it actually doesn't really get all that cold in florida as you can imagine and sometimes all you really need is a long sleeve shirt i love this crew neck look i think it's a great look let's go ahead and check out our last and final color probably my favorite color here the quartz blue uh what i love about these colors the burgundy the corsair blue and this quartz blue are that all three of them actually look really good uh with these navy blue pair of shorts that i'm wearing i kind of did that on accident i kind of just picked these shirts out but i think that just speaks to how conservative and stylish and just simple these t-shirts are yeah i plan on keeping these shirts i am looking forward to wearing them throughout the rest of november and into december and into january i hope you guys enjoyed this overview and first impressions of the george men's long sleeve crewneck cotton t-shirt even though both shirts can be found under different titles they are the same exact shirt and they are both made out of 100 cotton these are great shirts they get great reviews people are raving about them i don't see why you wouldn't at this price point again if you want to see more content like this please hit that like button and subscribe i thank you so much for tuning in my name is john i will see you in the next one you", "VnJhfy7R2wE": "today we're talking about the next level lady is 100% ring-spun cotton t-shirt now this is our go to lady style t-shirt one because of the price - because of the fabric the fit everything about this shirt is great for large groups instead of just telling you though I do have Maia coming over she's gonna show this off first thing you'll notice is great fit first because this side seam here now that means it's going to naturally hug your curves any lady shirt shouldn't be baggy like a unisex style it should naturally hug and this sure does that the next thing you'll notice is the neckline here it's a little lower than the American Apparel 100% ladies neckline the American Apparel is a little tighter this does offer a little more breathability so if you're looking for a hundred percent ring-spun cotton ladies t-shirt this is our go to it also it's a better price point than the American Apparel ladies hundred percent the other thing you're gonna see is just the sleeve length flattering it hits you right at the right part of the arm not too high not too low fits great feels great hundred percent ring-spun means that basically if you're thinking about sizing we do suggest maybe getting one size up so normally Maia would wear maybe like a small but in this we have her in a medium today just because with that cotton and just doesn't stretch as much so that's one thing to note with this if you order familiar drew sometimes err on the side of bigger because it's never fun to get a shirt good with this though we recommend any type of our eggs vintage or standard vintage being the lighter ink coat standard being a normal print a little thicker ink to make it pop but with this also comes in two 100% ring-spun this is a heathered garment and athletic gray meaning at any time we have a heathered means this could be 90 10 90 cotton poly which just means it's gonna have a little more stretch but still offers kind of that more snug fit great shirt overall one of our best selling ladies shirts and you can see why great price point great fit the neckline is awesome everything about it might look awesome in it I'm a co-ed monkey soft scale we rate this t-shirt a - thanks for watching this video please let us know if you have any questions because here at co-ed monkey soft matters and so do our customers", "RaBffG1zLL8": "today we made it into downtown LA home\nof the fashion district where creative entrepreneurs brands and businesses come\nto shop and sell the latest styles now whether you guys are consumers or\nactually in the fashion industry chances are you've seen rolls of fabric like\nthese which actually go on to become the products that you wear now virtually\nevery brand and business gets their start with a simple t-shirt crew neck\nand hoody and more importantly is a very interesting fact is they don't actually\nmanufacture the products themselves in fact a lot of the times are being\nmanufactured in large facilities so as a consumer you need to know that you have\nthe option and the choice to impact the world at large\nby the businesses that you'll go on to support so in this video I want to peel\nback some layers and actually show you guys how products are created on a mass\nlevel and I thought it'd be really interesting to start with how these\nfabrics are actually made cotton the most popular fabric in the world is\ncreated from the ground up before being made into the fabrics you wear it begins\nin the field where it has grown and picked by industrial equipment and\nshipped to be processed during the processing stage the cotton is cleaned\nup removing impurities and then the soft fluffy cotton you see becomes a strong\nfiber the process here is designed to create combed and ring spun cotton that\nhas a softer feel this type of fabric goes through an innovative spinning\nprocess that's designed to thoroughly soften and straighten each fiber the\nstrands will then tightly knit and woven together to create a raw fabric that is\nnow strong enough to be worn next time you're choosing a shirt take a look at\nthe fine details to see this for yourself\nonce the fabric is completed and then gets transported to a dye house where\nthe fabric is dyed to the color specified by the manufacturer the\nprocess we're showing you here is unique to Bella canvas which is the largest\ncutter and dhyryam apparel in America we take you guys inside of the state of the\nart facility to show you what it takes to make quality apparel for millions of\npeople all over the world as you see once this fabric is dyed it gets\ntransported as these fabric rolls which are then laid out across large\ncutting tables the fabric is stacked up to a hundred and fifty layers before it\nbeing mass cut inside of this factory they cut three million units a week and\nI personally always wanted to see how these machines layout the fabric so\nlet's take it out for a spin what's the worst that can happen so right out of\nthe gate there's this machine here and it has like all of these different\nsettings and I see this little this thing so I could just move this and it\nworks I'm going to reverse though huh let's let's crank this thing up but the whole thing my privado I messed up this fall\nI dig I think I did a bad job that's that's that's bad huh - push the button\nthere that is odd this buddy right here tightens up the rope\nshameless crap okay I'm gonna try it again how much right right\nyou know at first glance these machine seemed to move themselves but what I\nfound out is that it actually requires some skill in order to tighten the\ntension of the fabric as it's being laid out the faster you go the faster that\ntrigger fingers got to be in order to keep up once the fabrics are laid out\nthe cutting machine arrives to cut the fabric in the shape of the required\ndesign this is the cutting machine that essentially takes all the digital\npatterns that are created during the design stage and they input it into the\nsoftware which allows this machine to just automatically cut the panels which\nare then shipped to the facilities where they're going to be sewing right here I\ndon't know if you guys can see the screen but it's literally showing you\nwhere it's going to be cutting next and as it's cutting it's actually vacuuming\nthe entire operation so it vacuums that in order to make sure that the seal and\nthe fabrics lay very flat so there's no differences when it's actually cut these\nrobotic cutting machines ensure every single piece is cut precisely as it\nfollows a designer's blueprint keep in mind not every factory has something\nlike this these machines make it possible to get a consistent fitting\nshirt every single time once the panels are cut they are placed on carts and\nmove to the next part of the process and so just wanted to take you guys behind\nthe scene here as we as we show you guys where this fabric is\ngoing before it's being sewn and it got my boy Brett got the man see\nright over there but guys an interesting thing that we saw here is as you can see\nright here these are actually not moving so it makes you wonder how is that\nmoving right so I wanted to show you guys something really quickly here in\nbetween these lines here there's actually lasers so there's a laser\nguided system that actually brings the fabric as soon as it crosses a path it\nactivates the new beams here so let's check this out\nmoving not moving and moving haha check this out go check this out\nbring the camera a little closer moving not moving and moving yeah this is how\nthe fabrics are transported in masses in order for them to be bundled and finally\ncut so what oh you would have thought these\ntwo crashed right now but they didn't because of the way that everything is\nbeing automated and I feel that automation in the sewing process and in\nthe manufacturing facilities such as this that's based in Los Angeles with\nAmerican workers it's it's the way well it really is the way of the future and\ncompanies like Bella canvas are able to still produce a USA strong while being\nable to sew in different countries and put out a quality product so this is the\nway that things are moving and like this fabric let's get moving over to the\nbundling stage we can show you guys how that works\nso these fabrics back here as you guys can\nis the bundling machine so it's it's making sure that the fabrics are safe as\nthey're being transported to the next facility which actually does the selling\nthem investing into these types of logistics allows them to keep a quality\nproduct from the beginning all the way until it's done the scale of this\noperation is huge guys and as you guys can see from the forklifts to the\ncutters to everybody that's that's a part of this operation it really is\nsomething that requires a huge investment in the production as well as\nthe logistics and the team behind it thousands of people are employed here in\norder to get this to actually work so you could imagine that it's it's easier\nto cut corners than it is to do things right so when a company invests in doing\nthings the right way it really makes a difference in the market and it really\nmakes a difference in the world with rap fabric ready to be transported these\ncontainers play a logistical role in transporting materials needed for\nvarious parts of the production process globally these containers travel and\ncarry mass quantities of gray's goods which come from all over the world\nwhich are then dyed in an eco-friendly way in Los Angeles a fun fact is that\nthe USA China and India produce over 50% of the world's cotton this business\nchooses to die unprocessed fabric in Los Angeles in order to reduce the\nenvironmental impact commonly associated with Daiya fabrics in other parts of the\nworld once they are cut and dyed the majority the production is transported\nto Central America where they are sewn up and shipped back to the US a\nfulfillment center since we know how fabric is being dyed and transported for\nproduction we are wondering how they ensure the sewing factors are taking\ncare of their people and environment we spoke with Xavier to get the details you\nknow Bella canvas is making sure that every factory that is part of our supply\nchain is 100% certified by ara which is a certification that is granted to\ncompanies that are fully in compliance with labor laws and regulations in the\ndifferent countries where we operate the efforts that we made to make sure that\nyou know the workers that are part of our supply chain are being treated\nfairly not only in terms of other compensation also but you know all the\nsocial benefits that they receive recently we were approve also to become\na participating company with the Fair Labor Association which is like at the\ngold standard for our industry we are in the process of certifying the entire\nsupply chain is a it's a lengthy process and it will take some time but\neventually the company will be fully activated with the VFL a North America\nis made up of multiple Latin American countries and although sewing also\noccurs outside of the USA Bella canvas promotes a USA strong initiative which\nemploys thousands of workers in the USA while also producing a line of apparel\nthat is made here in the Los Angeles facility so as you guys to see right\nhere in this sewing factory they have literally over a hundred and fifty\nemployees skilled employees actually sewing the t-shirts in right here as you\nguys can see on this stack these are the cup panels we were showing you guys\nearlier more importantly I just wanted to share with you guys some of my\nthoughts in and some of the things that happen in the factories such as this the\nskill that's required to actually do a job like this so this is my man Felix\nright here and I won't I won't disturb his work that much but as you guys can\nsee it requires very skilled thought so with that being said a lot of workers\nactually only do one part of every garment which then goes on to the next\nperson to complete it and funny enough to show you guys like how difficult it\nmight be my brother actually over here my brother actually knows how to sew and\nwe were discussing like hey are you okay so you're already making excuses do you\nthink you can do it or not alright so Felix get a mpirica ladder\ncomo la so this machine is like it's this is a Pegasus w6\nand it's very beefy so they have two needles so right out of the gate we see\nthat there's there's a reason why workers are actually focusing on one\ntask so there's a lot of little pieces to the garment and if you were to try to\nsew everything yourself you'd probably screw up the entire shirt or a won't be\nas efficient so my brother Caesar here is is skilled in this if I were to try I\nwould have probably lost my finger but look at this guy he's actually doing it what's going on here guys you're holding\nup my line we got it good thank you guys for bringing us behind the scenes here\nand our that my brother slowed down the production line now you have to get can\nyeah but but overall you guys seem to be running a really tight ship how many\nunits do you think about the canvas is producing on on any given day so about a\nweek we're showing about three million units three million t-shirts so the\naverage of about 600,000 teachers per day oh yeah that's crazy\nbut what would you say is like is one of the things that the workers here need to\nhave in order to be successful in this career how many years have they been\nsewing for so some of these people have been working with us from the beginning\nso about you know 10 15 years they've been here it's people that I come here\nevery day they're being they're been here ever since at the beginning you\nknow what type of fulfillment do you think\nthey find in the sewing do you think they need to have a passion to work in a\nfactory like this you definitely have to you definitely have to enjoy it\nbut as you can see everybody comes in here and everybody's pretty happy you\nknow not sad faces yeah yeah it's definitely something that it's part of\nour culture now you know we're a big family\nwhat's the products are sown they undergo a quality control process that\nensures every t-shirt meets their test it's pretty crazy to see that there are\nreal people working on every single t-shirt that you wear so this is one\nthat passed the test right here yeah this is one that can go out to a\ncustomer yeah definitely ready to go and I think that's the beauty of like what a\nlot of people don't get to see is the fact that even though things are being\nmass-produced there's real people are like handling\nyou're populating it and there's real love that goes into it or a real passion\nyou got to have a passion for sewing and you got to have a passion for this\nindustry in order to stay in it with what 15 years yeah so it's a lot of time\nand energy that goes into one garment and it's a lot of people that handle\nthat one garment yeah it's about from the beginning to\nthe end there's about 13 13 people that but you know the teacher goes through\ninto it's completed not counting people into distributions in there yeah\nliterally hundreds of hands are going into the making of your product that you\nget at home and I think a lot of time we do miss the fact that there is a\npersonal touch to every single garment you guys whether it's mass-produced or\nwhether it's this is could be considered handmade I mean it really is because\nsomebody's making it with their hands so with that being said I wanted to leave a\nlittle note here you think I can leave a note in this box yeah there's like made\nwith love regardless of whether the finished garments come from their\nCentral American manufacturing facilities or in LA they ultimately\narrive at the fulfillment center where they are responsible for organizing and\nshipping to distributors and brands all over the world many entrepreneurs and\nsmall businesses rely on Bella canvas and suppliers like them to stock t-shirt\nblanks that can use to sell their designs now this company doesn't stay in\nbusiness by simply selling random designs and a bigger challenge that they\nalso have is the fact that they're selling to customers of all shapes and\nsizes so design wise they have to cater to a very large market so\nwant to go ahead and actually show you guys the behind the scenes of what it\nactually takes to design for a mass markets for millions of customers all\naround the world and we're actually going to see how they choose the colors\nthat are guaranteed to sell through to a large audience let's check that out man\nright out of the gate so this is where you guys do fittings yeah this is our\nfit room we spend a few hours a week in here with models and styles and we just\nmake sure that the styles fit on our base size models the best the best we\ncan interesting what is so like as I walked\nthrough here I felt like my equilibrium was almost off because it obviously\nthere's a sound panel but we'll the purpose for a sound panel enjoy cool\nwell no this is actually the Ellsworth Kelly from 1956 it's a sound barrier\nyeah he's a California abstract painter it's actually the exactly just absorb\nsound like so we're not bouncing around the room and little easier to tolerate\neach other I thought I had like a real like I thought it was a real pain I mean\nI don't think I'd be behind a glass door if that were the case of a real pretty\ncool so this is where you guys fit your models because you guys designed for\nmillions of people different body types all right we did we tried right you try\nwe're trying our very best so so how can you walk us through how how you are able\nto do that we want to fit on multitude of body shapes and sizes we'll start\nwith a base size size medium men's for instance for a unisex t-shirt 3001 we'll\nstart with our men's medium he's our basic block and so we start\nfitting on him when we have it tuned up the way we like the way it fits the\ndrape performance will go on to the next size so we'll fit eventually a full size\nrun so if there's a small all the way to like 4 XL let's say we'll fit every\nsingle size yeah so we're trying to take those silhouettes into consideration so\nyou mentioned earlier that you like to work directly with the manufacturing\nteam so as a design director how does working with the manufacturing arm make\nsure that what you guys are creating is going to be something beneficial for the\nworld at large working on the ground level just getting to the factory we\nhave a communication line that help is build product the delicate design\nprograms that we have we try to make sure that there's no pieces in between\nour sewing and our brains or the to the design vision and the sellers are kind\nof on the same page we develop fabrics and samples we send them back and forth\nuntil we alekhya them exactly the way we see them fit in a production setting and\nthat's important to us so that's part of the reason we have that connectivity\ntissue between sewing and the design vision is that we close the gap on all\nthe pieces that would go wrong by seeing each other in person by working together\nas a team so far as that this is super detailed process they are very\nmeticulous about what they do and the whole team is here to make adjustments\nin case there's anything to be done so this isn't the first sample set that\nthey had to actually fit this is actually a rendition so what they're\ndoing is essentially making sure that it all goes to spec before it hits the mass\nproduction okay so we're just gonna run through the specs again really quick and\nlike for instance the shirt I'm wearing this is actually one of you guys is more\nlater styles so this is something that you and your team came up with yeah so\nwhat what what inspires you for new designs and how do those like how do you\nguys kind of maybe make sure that they stay in the market for a while versus it\njust being a trend yeah this might be a trend you know it's a raw edge\ntranscends like I can't say this will be in the word forever is very scary\nfashion forever don't really jive certainly so what we'll try to do is\nwhat I like to see is like make the very best styrofoam cup that you can see at\nevery single coffee station forever without it leaking it's keeping its heat\nall those other components that the Styrofoam cup would have but ours is a\nbasic t-shirt we can dress it in skin it in different ways that speak to\ndifferent trends like raw edge seam work or pockets out to the side or however we\nwant to address it the core block that you see is our crewneck sweatshirt which\nwe feel very comfortable selling to a large community people can buy them\nprint on them embellish them in that market but in this case they can buy the\nnormal crew of pullover with raw edges everywhere it's\nmay get slightly more trend forward or fashion forward it's not enough to have\na great designer fit today as consumers we need to ensure that our purchasing\ndecisions do not support things that are unethical and oppressing others\nthat's where businesses such as these are raising the standards by not only\ngiving people an amazing product but by being transparent and doing things\ndifferently from how they treat their workers to the green initiatives in\nplace that are minimizing the environmental footprint on the other\nhand there are real problems happening around the world with apparel\nmanufacturing the constant drive to compete on price in order to sell\ngarments for pennies on the dollar as a resulted in producing in unsafe\nenvironments where buildings are failing and chemicals are being spilled into the\nenvironment the way your favorite products are being made today will\ndrastically affect the way our world looks like tomorrow now as we wrap up\nthis video I hope you enjoyed the process that we shared and how to shirts\nare made in America as you guys can see this operation is huge and the brands of\nbusinesses that you support also go through a process like this now the ones\nthat are just getting started the ones in your community that friends and\nfamily are be are actually creating are able to leverage resources such as bela\ncanvases infrastructure to actually make their brands and businesses without\nhaving to spend the millions of dollars that is required to do something like\nthis but more importantly as a consumer you have the power to choose the way\nthat the products are being created you see where you spend your money is what\nultimately is gonna dictate what the market and businesses such as these\ncreate so next time you go shopping or next time you're about to consider a\nbrand keep that in mind and more importantly if you guys enjoyed this\ntype of video I highly encourage that you guys hit that subscribe button

"what's up just Ali and as you know I am starting my own t-shirt company line merch whatever you want to call it caught my visual interpretation let's go ahead and get into what type of shirts of that boss so I am going through what's their name TSE apparel so I'm going through a wholesale company called TSE apparel and today I picked up some sample and I can already tell the difference in qual one of them's like a hashey black that's the Gildan and I don't appreciate that I'm gonna have my customers putting a lotion on their shirts I'm about to show y'all in one second we lay about let me lay them out for ya let me lay them out for ya okay so you can see the variations in the and black pusher turn the soft light off that back light you can definitely see the variations you've got Gildan you've got Bella canvas right here Bella canvas and then I also picked up a home brand Toltecs and as of right now just looking down I like these two better already out the gate because you can just tell the quality from looking at the shirts that you know they took their time they took the time this one this one's actually this is definitely going to be or I shouldn't even say a she is just it's just a different black a black that I can't appreciate right now um and what I'm going for with my brand is you know quality products because I can't be giving out no uh no lame stuff but off the camera this one is definitely darker this it goes darker this one and then this one but let me show you how they feel trying all Gildan first so trying on this shirt first I mean it's okay now I have no complaints as of right now it feels it feels fine I feel like maybe it might be a little bit each year but I mean it's not bad whatsoever it's not bad at all it feels good it's not riding up my arms I can it's good like me I mean that's good you thought you got to see some titties psych next is Bella canvas Bella canvas this one feels a little bit better this guilting was a little bit it's not I can't say it's itchy it's just different it's just a little bit different this one you can definitely tell they took their time with it the dyes I mean it just feels good I liked how the hello how come I have my own how the sleeves are it's not it's not tight it's not hugging too tight and by the way all of these are smalls I'm 5 2 and 1/3 ok I'm 5 to 130 so this is what it looks like I mean this is how it looks on me [Music] so this one as of right now between the two that I've already warned this one is definitely tough like I said the color is different the color you can definitely check tell the color colors apart this was deeper this one is like I said this is like an Ashley black this is Gildan Ashley black and right now I have on the belly canvas it's not getting into focus but this is the Toltec okay again this is a small this is a small not too bad I like the fields I like to feel I kind of I when it comes to the actual sleeves I like how Bella canvas and gilt it kind of wraps around and it's tight with this one this one's kind of loose it's not a bad thing it's definitely preference but I don't like I don't I like it to hug me hug me tell me how you really feel so my number one is Bella tall Tex and then the Gildan Gildan is okay I feel like I just feel like the Gildan it's just it's just it's just just this is just I don't know what I got to do to get that feel it like I said you gotta try these things on because it's one thing for somebody to tell you it's another thing for y'all actually feeling it on your skin this feels good like a bread my titties for tuning in this is the start of my visual interpretation support me I love y'all all the realest just a lead", "Vbfj6TyMwY4": "hi guys it's Krystal welcome back to my channel so this is going to be the design that we're gonna be using today I've already printed it out using my Sawgrass SG 400 that's the sublimation printer I use now I've had people ask me if you could use a regular printer and you cannot I'll insert a picture of it somewhere in here so you guys can see which one I'm using I've got tons of videos on it so I've already printed out my design is ready to go the paper I use as Tex print are I'm going to be using my Cricut ten by twelve quick and easy press today for the design so we're gonna be using that and I'm gonna be using my 14 by 14 polka dot mat as well and then the shirts that I'm using these are the Gildan so when you first get them they look like this I'm gonna be doing the bleach method today and this is how they look when you first purchase them they are Gildan soft style ring-spun so they look just like this okay I'll have a link down below where i order my shirts I'm not affiliated anyway but they are super fast and that's just where I order them these are 65% polyester and 35% cotton as well as they are color you want to stick with like a light color a high polyester count so this is the ones that I'm using today they look like this when you first start out so you can put it on here and it will look super cute if you want to do what's popular right now and do the bleach method this is how they're going to look now I've done a video already showing you how to do this but I've actually changed the way that I'm bleaching these now so I actually don't even do it that way now so what I do and I'll just tell you really quickly and then I'll actually do an updated video very very soon so the way that I do this is I just put a hanger on it like normal I go and hang it outside on a tree like a small tree like a little branch you could be doing this um you can use like those those clothes racks that you get at Walmart that you know those little metal racks you could use those you could get them as cheap as like eight dollars I think 810 dollars so you get one of those clothes racks hang it on there so what I do is I have it on the hanger I hang it on a tree branch where I can reach it obviously and then I take a a bleach bottle like I did before and then I just lightly spray in this area and then I kind of spritz here and there just to get like these little spritz marks here I'll change the dial on my spritzer so it'll have a straight stream and then that's how I kind of get some of these spots like this so this is what the bottom of the t-shirt looks like just like this and then the top part where the design goes that's what a lot of people are doing just like this and then on the backside since it's hanging from the tree I'm not a lot of the bleach comes through there so it's just ro bite and then I took my spritzer and just kind of went like this with the sprays and that's how I came out with this really cool effect so it's super cute on the back love it but it's set out there I let it set out there and kind of dry just a little bit then I brought it inside now if you're doing a ton of these you don't have to do this stuff but this is what I did I brought it inside hung it up and then use my blow dryer to dry them really quick I like the ones with the attachments like this so where you have them on here so it gives it a nice string that's straight in my spot I always talk about that and then I just go you could use like a heat gun and stuff just don't get too too close so you're just gonna use your hairdryer I go over the whole shirt drying it really quickly and what that does is it intensifies the bleach and really helps bleach this out so I found it the best way and then when I'm done I take it over to my sink and I rinse it with cold cold water rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse until I know all the bleach is out I add just a little dot of the Dawn dishwashing detergent just a dot and then I just kind of wash it at my sink it's wet like this really well rinsing and washing and kind of carefully gently going like this until it's completely rinsed out there's no more soap bubbles and then I ring it and ring it ring it gently because I'm not want to get crazy just spots like this and I'm kind of pushing any water out like this as much as I can and then I just throw it the dryer just like that because it's clean I did the Dawn dish soap and everything so then I just throw it in the dryer with some towels or something and it's good to go that's how I'm doing mine like I said I will do an updated video very soon but I wanted to throw that out there just so you guys had that okay so let's get going so I've got my Cricut easy press on 350 for 60 seconds any taking my 14 by 14 mats I'm gonna get that down here you're gonna want to protect that surface with some butcher paper and then I'm gonna go ahead and get down my t-shirt get that up here like so take your lint roller and go over the entire shirt to make sure there's no lint especially if you put it in there with some towels probably bad but that's what I do so definitely go over it with a lint roller make sure you get off any lint and that's gonna avoid those little blue dots that you'll get okay so our t-shirts ready to go I'm gonna go ahead and pre-press it really fast to get out any moisture just like that so just pull down any moisture that was remaining and now we're ready to go so what I like to do is take my design here and I'm gonna fold it in half obviously it's not from the paper to paper it's right here so I'm gonna just I get it like this fold it in half where I can see my design I'm gonna line those up make sure my papers up here at the top make sure those are lined up and I'm gonna get a crease so that way I know where my Center is up go ahead and take my Cricut ruler that I've talked about before today I'm do it using these six by 26 looks good I've got it even up there at the top then I'm gonna go ahead and take my design we're gonna put it upside down I'm gonna line up that crease mark just getting that right up there at the top like so all right I'm gonna go ahead and take some heat transfer tape you can either get it from Amazon and rolls like this you can also get it from Cricut or you can pick it up at Michael's or Cricut calm I'll have it both of these linked down below so just gonna go ahead and give me some heat transfer tape like this and cut that down and I'm gonna get one on each side so I'm just gonna go ahead and get one here and one here all right so we're ready to go now that I've got this down all I'm gonna do is take a piece of butcher paper on top I will have this link below as well I buy the big rolls of this from heat press nation so now we're ready so we're gonna do is 350 for 60 seconds and you want to keep it as still as possible all right so very carefully we don't lift this up we're gonna go ahead and pull off our butcher paper all right so I'm going to go ahead and peel up our design just like that super cute don't worry about this right here so it looks like it burned the shirt so this will actually wash out whenever you go to do it I don't know what it is between this and the bleach I actually have it do this to me earlier and all I did was take it over to the sink just to double-check it would come out and it did so I took it over to the sink washed this out thing between the bleach and the press but like I said once I wash this it did come right out so don't worry about it at all so I'm gonna go ahead and go wash this really fast I'm gonna come back as soon as it's dry and show you guys that this is just gonna come right back out we wouldn't do that really quick and I will be right I am back so it felt seconds for you but it was about an hour or so for me so I washed the t-shirt and it completely came out I don't know why it does that I think it's some sort of chemical reaction with that bleach that it does it but it's not stained it will come out so if you guys do this where you bleach it first and then you put this on make sure you wash the t-shirt bleach it wash the t-shirt and then do it but even when you do that if it does that like I said it's some sort of chemical reaction but when you go wash this it's gonna completely come out what I do is I take it over to the sink again add a little bit of that Dawn dish soap and I brought the t-shirt together very carefully rubbing like this all the way around and then I wash wash wash in the sink wring it out and then I threw it back in the dryer now I probably could have just thrown this into the wash and it would have just done it on its own that way but since I was kind of quick for the video I did it that way so if you need to do it that way as well you can I just put a little bit darkness up like I said just one dog and then I moved it around the shirt and kind of wash while I was already wet and then just rinsed all the way around and like I said I don't know why it does that but it has to be some sort of chemical reaction now it's only gonna do that obviously if you bleach the shirt and then do it so if you do like we did before we use sublimate and then bleach the shirt you're not gonna have these issues at all you don't want to fuss with that I would definitely recommend that you go ahead and sublimate your t-shirt for first and then do the and then do the bleach because it's going to come out the same either way but you're not going to have to fuss with the extra steps of washing it again cute like I said I absolutely love the bleach effect this is what the back side of the t-shirt looks like it's super adorable I love it so I hope you guys enjoy this I hope you guys found it helpful if you did please hit the like button down below and subscribe and I'll see you on the next one", "xjGX1nlMtqM": "in this video I'm going to give you a quick review on the infusible ink markers made by cricut and how they interact with 100% cotton shirts follow the instructions on the cricut website for the infusible ink markers and I actually made this in Adobe Illustrator and then exported it as a PNG uploaded that PNG into my Cricut design space and then had the black marker draw it out and so this is what the original image looked like you can see it's very sharp it was a one-point tip so it's gonna be bolder I colored in these areas because I wanted those filled a little bit but the rest of the outline is from the marker and so I followed instructions and put the card stock underneath the shirt and it actually bled through onto the cardstock so it's important to have that card stock there I would maybe even double up if you have card stock to spare and so that that was the first one I did and it actually bled through some onto the butcher paper too so I'll tell you what I did after that in just a minute but this is how it came out and with this light it looks pretty bold pretty solid but it's actually more of a more of like a faded black at this point although it looks really good on the camera so I also made spots to put on and the reason that this one did not come out so well is because it was on the crease and I did not apply pressure to the heat press that I was using the Cricut ez press I just laid it on there and had a applied the pressure it would be darker right here but um like I said this isn't 100% cotton shirt it's a 3t which I have a toddler and none of cricket's shirts are toddler sizes and so that's why I just went ahead and went with this to see what would happen so ii whenever i was working on the back as you can see it also bled through onto my cloth that i have right here which that's fine but by the time I got to the back I put cardstock on the inside the image down cardstock on top and then I use another piece of clean butcher paper and you can still see where the butcher paper the in fusible ink still faded onto the butcher paper where there was no cardstock and so I did this to kind of preserve the cardstock a little bit longer and you can see that it still gives you that slightly faded look I'm not sure what this will look like after I wash it but I'll definitely wash it by itself inside out but that's when this image got put on here so I would also in the future put cardstock right here if you're using a cricket mat it would definitely come off of this shirt and onto the mat and so I would put cardstock over the mat also maybe a couple of pieces if you have any to spare and that is my review of using crickets and fusible ink markers on 100% cotton so it's definitely a different result than on the polyester shirts but if that's all you've got", "w5OhPcFHbu4": "What\u2019s up everybody! My name is Wes. I\u2019m five-eleven. I\u2019m wearing the Alternative Apparel  a hundred percent ring-spun cotton\nT-shirt size small.

It has the tailored side right here that I love and it has a great\nsleeve length. Overall, it\u2019s a great shirt. Love it.

I need a good t-shirt for an everyday fit\nme before active wear or maybe just for like an undershirt type of purpose, depending on\nwhat I'm wearing. That day is a various collections of shirts\nthat you guys need to know about, so it's going to be a little different than anything\nyou've ever seen. The first thing you wouldn't be talking about\nis. Fit, texture, wear ability, and then we're\ntalking about a wrinkle test. Let's go. What's going on guys? Welcome back to arc away a new direction of\na modern man. My name is mr Lou and today we're looking\nat the best white t-shirts. First thing we'll be talking about is fit,\ntexture, wear ability, and then we've talked about a wrinkle test. I'm going to get into this video for you guys. I'm going to basically wear the shirt. I'm telling you guys how it fuels and when\nyou go down for the list, marking them off the board for sure they have off the rack\nis from Simon's. This is Amelia. It is tight around the arms. I got to say that off the bat. So around my biceps here, it's snugly like\nI barely have room to even breathe. It just feels like Alaska guys just wrapped\naround my arms. That's what it feels like around the chest\nis a little tight around here. The pet Torres. But when they come in down to my torso is\na little looser along the frame here. It's a little constructed around my armpits\nhere, and I don't like that feeling. I like the feeling of it being a little bit\nlooser. I can feel a lot of the material right under\nmy armpits. So for this, the type of work bility I wear\nfor this tee shirt will typically be probably like under a bomber or. Or under like a long sleeve shirt. Like this is type of shirt. I'll probably wear something over top of it\ncause I don't really feel like this is something I would typically wear a loosey goosey, just\nlike rigid pair of jeans. Um, typically for me, if it's a little tighter\naround my body, then I'll typically wear something over it. Most wrinkles on this does stay in the same\nposition, isn't really get away from like being recalled free. Or maybe you come across shirts or say iron\nfree. This one's . Still has numerous refills. Next should I have right here is from top\nman and taught man has a nice quality of shirts. This one ranges for $15 in the white shirt,\nso I'm a fro this on and see what this feels like. The fit of this shirt is very comfortable. It actually has a lot more room to grieve. To me, this is like the best shirts so far. The fit of this actually gives me a lot more\nroom. It's a lot more comfortable. It's a lot more of my style. So this is the type of shirt I'll definitely\nwear it for a pair of jeans or wear some shorts. Maybe we go to the beach even where they swoop\na blazer over top. And this is something I feel a lot more comfortable\nand it's a lot more breathable all around. It didn't state that it was organic or, no,\nit was taught men. It's just, this is called the in, um, the\nfit of it is quite closer to ganache, but fuels. Quite nice on a skin around the arms and shoulders\nis not constraining like before the wearability of this, like it just mentioned where for\nblazer, where, where were some shorts to the beach. This is the good basic white shirt. This is something I'll keep in my Central's\nin a closet in rotation. So this is something you guys should acquire. And now I want to do the wrinkle test with\nthis. So misses, scrunch it up just like before\nand you're going to get some wrinkles, but some of it doesn't carry on until it's like\nundone completely. All around. This is a good shirt. This is a decent shirt, in my opinion. This is a shirt from Totman. So this ranges for $15 so next shirt is from\nGuruji. So this one right here, it was two for 15\nbucks. So that's a good deal on the price Mark. But let's check all the quality of this Moogy\nshirt. This is actually a large, all around the fit\nis very similar to talk men, which I had on before, but all in all, it's not, it doesn't\nsuffocate me on the arms. So that is good. They, I can't see, I can't feel any difference,\nto be honest with you. This is States that it's 20, 20% polyester\nand an 80% cotton. Um, I can honestly feel difference between\nboth of them, but me, if I switch over to Totman or fuels. Slight, but it doesn't bother me at this point\nin time. Um, I completely am fine with this wearability\nof this. This is something I would consider for me\nmore or less an undershirt. So when it comes down to the wrinkle test\nfor this, I noticed when I did put it on it, it did have this weird clump around there. And I noticed maybe it was just, maybe it's\njust based on like licensed stain or something. But let me just see something. Let me just scrunch it up. It's not as bad as I'm sure she seen before. But, and notice he does have this gritty clumping\naround these shirts and you know, it has like these clumps of like these waves of clumps\nin your shirt. That's what it actually is kind of showing\nright now. And it's kind of weird, but, but Hey, and\nso it's all right for what it is. It's from Uniclo. This goes for $9. Let's call it $10 he just goes for $10 and\nit kind of feels like the first shirt ever. I put it on. So it kinda is like this, honestly the same. What did, what was this one? Simon's? Yeah. It's kinda like, it's kinda like that. It's actually tight around the arms again,\nyou got, again, this is typically would be worn as like an undershirt, but the, the. The fit is snug. It's a little looser around the torso. Actually the pet Taurus is a little looser\nhere, but yet again the arms, something about a T shirt tucks around my arm. It really bothers me. I don't know. Sure why, but it just, I just don't like that\nfeeling. I like to have a feeling I'm feeling a little\nbit loose. It States that it's caught in a, I do believe\nthere's little last thing in here cause I can just tell by the pull of it sometimes,\nbut it's not too bad. I like it the textile wise. So rentability of this. So when it comes down to this wrinkle test,\nI'm gonna switch this up a little bit. Boom, us and us, they wrinkles actually fade\nout pretty well with this shirt, which is quite surprising because a lot of these shirts\nI did test before, Ashley's a lot more wrinkles than before. If you're looking for and shared that she\nhas very smooth look to it and then you want to stress about your game wrinkled so much,\nit would go for this type of shirt. It might work for you. And this would keep in mind with any shirts\nthat I do demo here cause different purposes. Super different shirts. So don't assume that this one shirt is best\nfor any type of purpose. Like going to the gym, maybe under shirt,\na tee shirt for a wedding, or you just maybe go, no for lunch. The girlfriend, it doesn't matter. But that's the end of the day. Every shirt has their own purpose. So I won't carry a guy's this as an all around\nbest shirt, but they're all meant for different things. So the next year I had right here is from\nbanana Republic. It is a size medium. Some are photos on. This actually feels more in between where\nit was loose, but at the same time it has a balance of being tight. So it was a good combination where you find\nthis t-shirt right here, banana Republic in a happy medium. Uh, for me around the shoulders, it's a little\nlooser than before. So you guys know before, like I don't like\ntightness on the shirts. And this one actually provides a little bit\nmore loose fuel to it around the torso. It comes off, it's like a slim fit. And look, this is 100% cotton. This is in a medium. So banana Republic, I put this at a high regard\nregarding pie, the second best t-shirt that I like. Oh, does this collection, this type of wear\nBilly for the shirt would be, you'd probably be for any type of occasion, to be honest\nwith you, like this is something that I'll keep as mind Central's nature to have is each\nnumber long fit shirt. So it does have a little bit of . Oop. Here at the bottom. Did she show you guys? She saw you guys. That scoop screw is the Jersey basic shirt\nand it goes for 1299 this year. Right here it has this scoop like I just showed\nyou guys before. So this is type of shirt that actually fits\npretty well. If you're more of an active type, if you're\nmore of a lifestyle outdoors type of person, where you want to kick it in with a little\nbit of style. If you're not on the trendy side of things\nand you just want something that maybe a little different than the rest. Cause it is a scoop and that had a fad. But who knows. It could be coming back within that eight\nyear cycle screw. But for the shirt all around the fit of it\nis quite nice. I don't mind it at all. Actually. A good mixing between slim fit and fitted,\nand this actually is nice. We're on a torso, torso. I can't complain. It's a nice narrow cut. It's kind of a little bit tailor fitted in\na sense, but this is all around a nice lifestyle tab. The tee shirt with a modern twist to it. Scoop. And, um, yeah, I like this. I identity that. If it's not a bad shirt, I like it. Okay. So this year I have, one is from H, and. M. it is the premium car insurance. This actually goes for 1999. The Fisher off the bat is tight. Like it's super tight. Like, I don't know. Like, I shouldn't have got this small, but\nI did get a small, but I can see where it could like go from here. So if I emulated from what I had before, the\nmedium is not going to fit too much in it is the medium is not gonna fit. Not much different than this based on how\nthis fuels already. So the fit of this is quite tight. All around. It's suffocating me. This is something that I probably won't even\nwear, to be honest, cause it's just so uncomfortable around the arms. But if you do like your shirts tight, then\nboom. Get yourself a premium cotton shirt from H\nand M for 1999 and if that's not your budgeting and going into something a little more different\nfrom the selection I provided the guys with. But also when it comes down to texture, texture\nis par. This is probably the best texture I had of\nall the shirts so far. So that's the plus side. So for the price point of this shirt is 19\n1999 so based on quality of the shirt is premium quality. Kai in so. You're going to get the best texture of all\nthese shirts combined. So this wise, it does feel amazing. I can't lie about that. But if this is when it comes down to fit is\nreally tight, but keep in mind, I am wearing a small, so if I emulate that and I go into\nthe other shirts, if this was a medium or. Possibly a larger, what actually worked for\nme. But if there's the medium, it still might\nbe a little too tight for me. So in that regards, I have to dismiss this\nfrom the collection. Even though I do love the texture of this,\nI won't justify this for buying for 1999 but for someone who does like these quality type\nof shirts, all means go for it. So here is the regulatory. Fit shirt from H. and. M. we're going for seven 99 the fit of this\nis amazing. I don't feel constraint around my arms. The Torisel is loose enough, but it same time\nas breathable and go all around, feel it. This does not hurt the pocket price wise and\nit does not hurt my body in a sense of being suffocated. So when it comes down to this shirt, I think\nthis is one of my, probably my fourth best shirt on his list here. Um, I'm not talking just about the price when\nI'm talking about the quality of the shirt altogether based on what I've put on and how\nI feel about it. So, so first thing for us to fit of it is\ngood. Why just cover it? The texture wise, it is. Quite soft. It is 100% cotton. I don't see much difference. I don't see much difference beyond the premium\nquality cotton of the other previous H&M shirt for 1999 that did feel like a crazy difference\nin, so this strain is close, close to the bar. Um, the next thing I'll get into is the word\nyou. This is, this is the everyday shirt off the\nbat. Where anywhere you go. If you need white shirt, this proton, it's\nthere for you. You're going to go test watch. I'm going to do and demonstrate here something\nto wrinkle up a little bit. Uh, the wrinkle test isn't too bad on this\nshirt. I do enjoy what it looks like and how it fuels. Um, it doesn't have a lot of crazy lines into\nit. Like it did happen with a few of these, especially\nwith the wave patterns. So this is the, probably one of the best shirts. Oh, of the bunch eyes. Just to wrap it all up, I must tell you guys\nthe best t-shirts that I feel fit for my liking. The first one I'll go for is a top man isn't\na large, and that goes for $15 the second one I recommend is the banana Republic. I got on sell for $10 retail is about 30 and\nthen the third will be the H and M long shirt. That's. That is going forward. 1299 and then the fourth one would be the\nbasic standard shirt, which I have on right now from H and M go for seven 99 so those\nare actually my top four favorite white teas of the whole collection here. They've got so much for watching this video. I appreciate the love and support. Almost forgot the question today, guys, is\nwhat type of white shirt have you owned in the past and what type of way shirt do you\nguys recommend. I want to know what you guys thought.

of the basic essentials that i guarantee each of you already own i'm talking more basic than bathroom selfies vineyard vines and yes even more basic than all of them becky's out there in the world and of course we're talking about plain tees now everyone knows how essential plain tees are to every man's wardrobe because of their simplicity and versatility with that being said everyone knows that it's nearly impossible to find the perfect tee but your boy is like mj and i took that statement personally that's why in this video i'll be going over six t-shirts all at different price points in the hopes of finding the best tee now keep in mind that my rankings especially when it comes to fit is based off of my preferences and my body type so make sure to make your own judgments as well i will provide the sizes that i bought as well as my upper body measurements throughout the video so that you can easily compare and make those judgments in terms of my ranking system i will give each tea a score of 1 to 10 that will take into account fit quality and overall value but before i begin if at any point throughout the video you like it or find it to be informative i would really appreciate it if you gave the video a thumbs up so without further ado the first tee that i have here is the everlane air crew tea and i got this one in a size small this tea comes in at a price of 24 which is right in the middle of the pack compared to all the other teas now by just holding this tea i can tell that it's extremely lightweight and a bit on the thinner side now when looking at the fit this shirt actually fits pretty well which honestly is not what i expected the shirt has a nice slim fit through the chest and waist without being overly tight and the arm sleeves are nice and tapered with an overall solid sleeve length it could maybe be a half inch shorter if i wanted the perfect fit but this length is more than satisfactory the only thing i will say is that the collar is a tad wide for me but i also just have a smaller neck at 14.5 inches so that may just be a me problem now judging the quality this tee is made of 100 cotton and is purposely woven loosely in an uneven sub texture for extra breathability while the breathability and lightweight features are a plus i can definitely feel like this can shrink up on you if you don't hang dry the tee so you may just want to be extra careful when washing now maybe i'm just not used to extremely lightweight tees but i feel like i have to be extra gentle when taking this shirt off because when i try to take it off the first time normally i felt like i was almost going to rip the shirt again i'm just not the biggest fan of lightweight tees as one of my basic essentials so i have to mark it down a few points for quality with that being said i'll probably rate this t a 7.5 out of 10 because even though the shirt is lightweight and can tear a little bit easier i feel like the fit is actually really great besides just a slightly loose collar now the second tee that i have is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tee and this shirt comes in at 29.50 this tea has a little bit of a rougher texture on the exterior but we'll see if the interior has a different feel but first when it comes to fit this tee fits extremely well the chest width is basically perfect for my body type and the length is great as well i would say that it runs just slightly on the longer end but definitely isn't major the arm sleeve link sticks right around mid bicep which i do like but the only thing i'll say is that i wish the arm width was just a quarter or half inch smaller to fit nice and snug on my arm now when it comes to the quality this tee is made from a cotton polyester blend so it definitely does have a little bit of stretch to it now while i said earlier that the outer layer texture is a bit rough i didn't find any discomfort when actually wearing the shirt i wouldn't consider the shirt to be extremely soft but it definitely is comfortable enough to wear regularly and then lastly i would consider the shirt to be a medium weight and so it definitely will keep its shape and isn't flimsy and with all that being said i'd give this tea for madewell a solid 8 out of 10. the main reason why i had to mark it down a few points is because i feel like this would be better priced at 20 rather than 30 and so the overall value is a little bit lower and now the next tea that i have for you guys is the men's premium tea from talentless and this tea comes in at 39 right off the bat i can tell that this tea has a premium feel to it because it's much softer than the other two teas now when it comes to the fit though this shirt is not what i expected at all the shirt description stated that it has a relaxed fit and so i'm either extremely chunky or this tee is definitely more of a slim tapered fit i actually do like the width at the hips and waist but the chest area and the armholes especially are definitely a bit too tight for my liking i can definitely feel my arms losing blood circulation because of how tight the t is and so i would say to recommend sizing up but the thing is if you're short a guy like me at five feet six inches the size small i have here is a bit long and i can only imagine how much longer a size medium would be now when assessing the quality it truly does feel extremely premium and has a ridiculously soft feel for a garment dyed cotton fabric the collar is nicely ribbed and so there is a bit of stretch to it making it much easier to put on but then the collar quickly compresses again right after and wraps up tightly around your neck honestly if this shirt just fit me better i'd be going crazy over this tee because of the quality you're getting at this price point however because that isn't the case and fit is extremely important when it comes to basic tees i have to rate this tee a 7 out of 10. now the next tee that i have is the t-shirt from ask it and this is priced at 45. now the great thing about ascot is that they actually offer 15 different sizes from extra small to extra large with length options of short regular and long i chose to go with the size small and the short length because i am on the shorter side but as you will see i wish i had gotten the regular length when looking at the fit this shirt for me almost fits to perfection but the only thing that is stopping it from fitting perfectly is the shirt length i'm going to try and return this for the regular length because everything else truly fits great i love both the chest and arm sleeve widths and the sleeve length is at my preferred length as well hopefully when i return this for the regular length version this tee will fit perfectly when it comes to the quality of the shirt it definitely is more of a premium heavyweight cotton fabric which will definitely make this shirt extremely durable now i will say that the shirt isn't as soft or comfortable as the tailless tee that i just tried on but it has a similar or better feel than all the other tees in this video and then this tea similarly to the talentless tee also has a nice ribbed neckline that really conforms to your neck with now overall with this shirt i'll have to give it an 8.5 out of 10 because of the fit and the premium quality but i hope that when i return this for the size small in the regular length i'll be able to grade it up to a 9 or a 9.5 now the fifth tee that i have here is a uniqlo supima cotton tee and this tee comes in at 14.90 now at 15 bucks this tee has a pretty nice overall fit but i'll judge it objectively like i did with all the other tees the chest measurement of this shirt fits perfectly on my body and the shirt length is also perfect sitting right around mid crotch a few shortcomings of this tea though has to be the slightly looser neckline as well as slightly loose armholes when it comes to the quality the shirt is made with 100 supima cotton and has a nice smooth texture finish i would consider this tee to be a medium weight and that is not nearly as lightweight as the everlane tee but it is definitely lighter than the ascit and talentless tees in terms of comfortability i wouldn't say that it's jaw-dropping comfortable but it definitely still is comfortable enough to wear regularly as an essential piece and with this tee only coming in at 15 i would say that this tee has the best value meaning you get the best bang for your buck however with that being said the t isn't perfect and so i have to rate it a 9 out of 10. now the last that i have is a jersey t-shirt from todd snyder and this one is in a size small this tee comes in at a whopping price of 68 and so we'll see if the fit and quality warrant this higher price looking at the fit i'm a bit torn because there are a few things i love about this tee but then there are also some small deal breakers i love the chest width as it's a comfortable slim fit and i also love the width of the arms however it would be a tiny bit better if it was just a quarter inch looser the neckline is just a bit too loose for my liking and the length of the shirt is also a bit on the longer end now when it comes to the quality that's an entirely different story while i can argue that the ascit or tailless tee has the most premium feel this tee is a very close second but it's by far the softest tee out of all of them they use 100 garment dyed cotton jersey fabric which is the reason why this tee not only has an extremely premium feel but is also super soft and stretchy because of the jersey fabric if this tee had a perfect fit then i would maybe consider it as one of the top tees in this list but because the fit isn't that great and the price is astronomical the overall value of the shirt decreases and i would have to rate it a 6 out of 10. alright so now that we got through all the teas let's see how each tee ranked up against each other now remember that my rankings take into account fit quality and overall value but also keep in mind that something that may not have fit me well may actually fit you great so hopefully you can make that comparison so coming in last place with a score of 6 out of 10 or 60 we have the todd snyder t now if we were using the asian grading scale with these scores then this would be a d and if you're asian you would know that this stands for don't come home if you don't get the joke this basically means that you gotta score so low that your parents don't even think that you deserve to come home but luckily i'm not that ruthless when it comes to grading and i actually think that this can find itself in people's homes because of how soft and high quality the tea is but because the tea just didn't fit my body type well and it's also priced at 68 dollars i had to rank it last on my list now in fifth place we have the men's premium tea from talentless which got a score of 7 out of 10. now i will preface this by saying that if the t did fit me better it would definitely be in the top three but because the t was a bit long and a little too tight for me as well as being the second most expensive option at 39 i had to ring it fifth on my list moving on to fourth place with the score of 7.5 out of 10 we have the everlane air crew tee now the fit of this tee was nearly perfect but because this tee just didn't feel as durable because of the lighter weight this tea isn't one that i would keep now finishing it in the top three is the madewell tri-blend all-day crewneck tea which received a score of 8 out of 10. this tea had a very similar feel and fit to the uniqlo tee but was just double the price which is why i had to rank it third now finishing as a runner up we have the asget t-shirt which received a score of 8.5 out of 10. now while this technically finished second i would consider it more of a 1b because it really depends on whether you prefer quality or affordability the t is quite expensive at 45 but the quality is seriously amazing and the fit is great too again the only issue that i had was the length and that was my fault because i chose to go with the shorter length rather than the regular length but i'm going to exchange it for the regular size small and i'm expecting the fit to be perfect but lastly coming in first place in terms of the best bang for your buck it has to be the uniqlo pima cotton tea the tea is priced at 14.90 but it often goes on sale for 9.90 and the fit and quality are great you really can't find a better fitting tee at this price point and so if you want an affordable yet still very high quality tea then i would definitely recommend to go with the uniqlo supima cotton tea now again those are just my rankings and so i'd love to hear your thoughts and your own rankings based off what you saw in this video let me know down in the comments if you agree or just think that i'm crazy and now that's all that i have for you

want to see more content similar to this in the future feel free to subscribe to my channel as i post videos every week as always thanks for watching and i'll see you next time", "XbRr64GkEYQ": "hey guys so i want to do a quick video because i'm going to do some wash tests and uh so i want to do a video of what these shirts look like before the wash test now the three here these three are all sublimation this is sublimation on a black shirt using the 3g opaque paper this is a sublimation on a 99 cotton t-shirt so we might as well consider that 100 cotton t-shirt uh just nothing added to it just straight direct sublimation and the third shirt we have here this one is oh on a jersey dry blend which is a 50 50 shirt so this one we're expecting to get a vintage look this one we're looking for it to come out just about with the print gone and this one we're just looking to see how the opaque transfer holds up if the print washes off or not i'm also going to do a couple of other wash tests since i'm doing that might as well go ahead and throw this in from another video these are the transfers from f m expressions go ahead and throw in these these are screen printed transfers i don't think i put anything on the back of that one this one is um the screen print with the the uh just the foil and we've got a screen print transfer over on this side from them so go in get some close-ups of how they look beforehand it's really really close up some see okay the 50 50 would help if i wasn't in the way of the light there is that one the hundred percent which is more vintage and that would okay let's head to the washer okay guys so here are all three t-shirts side by side the first one here being the uh 99 cotton t-shirt which gave us a very vintage look i'm gonna give you guys my honest opinions on them i'm gonna show you first that one gave us a really really vintage looks looks really really light on the shirt it actually doesn't look bad uh if that was the look i was going for but to be honest with you i've done a lot of 100 cotton t-shirts without any type of poly spray or anything like that and they all really just fade out to the point of where you really can't see the design so i don't know if that one percent poly is saving this or if this is but i know that this is going to fade out some more or at least i feel so so i'll do some more wash tests on it just to see uh what happens but it it'll it may get a little bit lighter than that what happens with polyester with the printing on 100 cotton or 99 cotton is that the inks don't stick to anything because it only sticks to the poly and so since we don't have poly what's happening here is that we're just getting a stain okay and so that stain may stay or it may not it's inconsistent next we have the jersey 5050t and this is pretty much the same result that i get on the gildan 5050 or any other 50 50 blend shirt so that's our look there um and you'll notice you notice this on vintage t it's nice and smooth guys nice and smooth great thing about direct uh with those with with this one i definitely sell this to my customers um and i let them know go back and look at the beginning of the video so that you can see the difference in the color i let them know that you will get a little bit of what a little bit of fading most people are okay with that because they want that softness and vintages in right now so if your customer can get that softness they'll go with something like this most of the time over something like this it's all about a little give and take okay and then we have the last one that we have here is the um jersey tea and this is a black 50 50. again you're actually supposed to do this on 100 cotton and if we had done that we wouldn't see the black coming through of the shirt that's uh what you call dye migration guys so my opinion on this one is that the printing actually stayed pretty good it does look like it faded maybe just a little bit but i'm really surprised to see it stay in because most well i'm not surprised to see it stay in i was surprised when i supplement actually sublimated on it and the ink stayed because i've sublimated on different ones and the ink didn't stay but um to have sublimated on this and for the sublimation ink to stay this turned out pretty good um the only issue that i have with this one is that it does feel patchy and it you can hear it see so versus that so that's the only issue that i have with that one but if your customer really wants a black t-shirt this would be a way to go uh let's also remember that this is a full you know kind of a big patch um all in all they turned out pretty good considering that none of these shirts are a hundred percent polyester and like i said we would i wouldn't do this i'd do that for myself these two right here i'd sell this one is wash tested up to 50 washes but i have a feeling that it's going to end up fading and not fading but cracking i would sell that to a customer who was doing a birthday shirt or something like that and they know it's not you know not for your brand you wouldn't want something like this for your brand you could use something like this for rest in peace shirt something that somebody's going to wear one or two times a few times other than that the one in the middle would be the way to go if you guys want to see how the f and m transfers turned out after washing them then stay tuned", "Qzvu05_flhY": "What's up everybody?

how to make the poly tea a spray and i am back with another episode on how to actually use this poly tea spray that we made in the very first video that i made if you've missed it you can go back and watch it still have just a little bit left i'm going to show you guys how to put this on first after before not after but before we do that i'm going to show you this shirt that i made for my son and i went ahead and i washed it three times in the washer to show you how well this poly tea spray that i make holds up there as you can see there's no fading or anything on this shirt it looks just how it looks just like how i had um printed it or he pressed it or whatever you want to say so this poly tea spray i believe is like the magic to sublimating on cotton besides having to go out and buy um all polyester and a lot of people like the cotton fill better than they do the polyester fill all right so i'm going to show you guys how to put this on this shirt if i don't break my tripod because all right so here's the shirt which is a little kids shirt that i'm gonna do tripod keeps breaking okay so the trick is not to put too much on this shirt because if you put too much on this shirt it will turn yellow all right so what you want to do is you want to lay the shirt flat and you want to spray just a little bit over where you're going to put it you want to spray until it is completely wet you don't want to over saturate it so if you over saturate it it will turn yellow on you so like three or four sprays with this mister now if you have something that's not a mister you might have to do it like seven times but as long as the whole part is wet the image will stay on there now i have already went ahead and did another shirt that i've already sprayed down that i have underneath my heat press over here that i'm going to show you what it looks like after it is heat pressed on let's see my cute little design it says no more chicken nuggets or chicken nuggies i'm just going to lay that down there on my shirt that already has the poly tea spray on it because it has to dry you have to let it fully dry before you put your sublimation on it because if you do not then it will smear and it will it just look really bad the image will look real bad so i'm gonna go ahead and heat press this and show you what image looks like after it and when i put my heat press on is 350 and i put it down for 40 seconds on this particular shirt well actually i do it on all my shirts and i believe that that is the best setting for my heat press because everything seems to come out more vibrant and better if i put it on too much then i usually end up having yellowing of my shirt and the shirt just doesn't it's hard to get that yellowing out even if you use peroxide for me it is so let's see all right lift it up move that and we move our image and voila no more cheeky nuggets yeah let's get some stuff on it anyway move this back just a little bit all right i think you just got included all right so this is what the shirt looks like after it's been pressed still as vibrant as the one that i showed you after it had already been washed three times and this shirt was already brown like that i was practicing with my bleaching um so if you all if you all like videos like this or if you need any more visual effects on t-shirts because i love doing t-shirts um please like and subscribe my video and leave a comment down below and i for for ideas that she would like to see done or anything that you all would like to see done and i will do it and i'll show you how it's done thank you

you an update on this transfer paper we used in my last video of the dieter cotton sub lis power the emember net powder and the special transfer paper we've watched it a few times so let's have a little look to see how it's turned out right okay well here's the garment here and it's probably been through to watch four to five times so it's been worn quite a bit now and I'll just show you closely so that you can actually see the the finish on it and it degraded at all I'll show you I've got a new camera by the way so I should be adding some really close images of this so let's have a look at it now well though whether you can actually see that the the color seems to be okay it seems to have held up there and the feel of it as you can probably see is nice and soft and if I stretch it as you can see look we're stretching it there and as you can see it doesn't actually crack or split when you stretch it so I personally think that it's actually it's down a pretty good job so yeah let me try get near the actual ink looks like it's gone into the actual fibers itself look at that look that's pretty close detailed at any now I want to try and let me out because I'm very zoomed in oh not bare with me let's zoom back out there there we go and that's what we were actually looking at so that in my eyes is pretty impressive but I want you to take it one step further now don't forget we use sublimation ink with this so what I'm going to try now just thought about this and I'm going to give it a go I don't know if it's going to work or not because I believe that it might be the polymer powder which is holding the image into a takes it off if it takes the sublimation off of this special paper they give you the sublimation paper and it allows it to bind into there now when we use transfer papers the transfer paper is basically very similar I supposed to this polymer powder and I use dye based inks as you know so what I'm going to actually do is I'm going to print an image out on this transfer paper in dye based ink and then I'm going to put the powder over the top and see if we can transfer a dye based ink image as opposed to a sublimation ink image which is a lot dear a sublimation ink so we'll see how that goes so I'm just going to print an image out now and then we'll put the powder on so bear with me for a second right okay din well I've had to use some standard sublimation paper because this thicker stuff didn't want to go through my printer for some reason so I'm just going to put this now in there this is still a little bit wet there we go and I'm just going to get this sublimation powder just pour it over the top there like that and then just sprinkle it down the ink all over the ink as you can probably see and don't forget this is just standard ink this isn't sublimation ink in here so I don't know whether this is going to work or not couldn't tell you doesn't like it's really stuck to me to be honest with you okay din so we'll just lift out the standard paper which I don't think is going to work but we'll give it a go anyway and just place that facedown there put a little cover sheet on it I don't think this is going to work and give a 30-second blast we're on a kite night not transferred at all here we go so you must use sublimation ink with this as you can see standard ink doesn't work whatsoever so that is definitely an owner that is sublimation paper but that is normal dye based inks so you need to have the sublimation ink with this product to be able to do a peel away on a standard t-shirt so what I'll do I'll quickly just transfer this image now onto the sublimation printer and we'll actually do this image on a standard sublimation paper this time and see what it does with that no I don't think it's stuck to that paper either this is standard transfer paper and it's not actually stuck to that so we're now going to have to try the standard sub b2 cotton transfer paper and give that a go so again we'll put in our reco printer face down like that and print it again alright well I've actually run out of ink I've got a changing table motioning but you can see they're mostly this half of the picture is still looking look mottled and wet so let's put this in there sit this on there that okay here we go I get the image here alright so this is the image now to go onto our t-shirt right okay so place it face down all right here we go and we'll remove the transfer paper don't forget this is out of cotton t-shirt nice and then you go there's another one freshly printed there as you can probably see let's let down on the workshop so yeah there you go there's another one we print it out on the back of this so it appears that you have to have the right paper this with standard sublimation paper now this transfer officers right although I've printed out on this transfer paper which is sublimation paper this will actually transfer onto a polyester garment they're all mouse mat or anything even though it's dry to the touch because this is transfer paper and it's sublimation ink so there you go that appears to be holding up pretty well after about five washes and again we just printed a new one there we've tried it with a few different variations we try doing it with diabase things for that special powder that didn't work and then we went over to the sublimation ink and obviously that worked as well so it needs to be done on the paper that comes with this kit which is the sub litre cotton paper and this time why did I actually raise the temperature to 190 degrees C for 30 seconds that one I did 180 degrees C and it really hasn't really made any difference to be honest with you so hundred and ninety is probably a better one to go because you're going to get more penetration with the the material into the actual garment so anyway I hope that was of some used here that was me follow-up of our subleader cotton product which we tried in our last video ok then thanks very much hope you enjoyed this video and we'll see you again in the next video bye for now you", "BiSYoeqb_VY": "Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy\ntwo billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common\ngarments in the world. But how and where is the average\nt-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life\non a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and\ngrown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest\nthese puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically\nseparates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed \ninto 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity\nof water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce\nthe average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides\nand pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton\ngrown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons \nof cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them\nto a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into\nsnowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets \nof rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals\nuntil they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into\ncommercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring\nin about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain\ncancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals\ncan cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water\nin rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced\nin some countries that the entire process of growing\nand producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth \ntravels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,\nor Turkey, human labor is still required \nto stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that \nmachines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's\nbiggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people\nin the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions\nand low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts\ntravel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton \nan enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce \ntheir own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts\nfor 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's\nwillingness to buy boosted global production \nfrom 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most\nresource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly\n400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers \nboth use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times\nmore than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing \nconsumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations\nand the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable \nhuman labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second\nlargest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from\nrecycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry\nto save resources. Instead of throwing them away\nat the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them\nas cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing\nwill you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined \nimpact on the world?", "OGDhx9fpP88": "hey guys it's becky with design bundles and today i'm going to talk to you about bleached t-shirts now this is not necessarily a new craze but these always flare up around the fall and you know why that is because they make nice distressed designs okay distressed fall they really go hand in hand so now is the time if you have not done so already grab your bleach grab your t-shirt and let's go ahead and get started okay so here i am on designbundles.net and i scored myself this really awesome leopard or cheetah print uh pumpkin okay and of course i i'm really loving let me show you guys this up close i'm really loving this um cheetah leopard print and the hearts so of course i had to grab it too so i have my pattern and i have my pumpkin and i'm going to go ahead and purchase these so that we can get started okay now once i'm in silhouette studio now you can do this in any designing software it's completely up to you but i'm going to set these up to be sublimation prints so i'm going to go to file and merge because i already have a window open so i can merge instead of i'm going to open like normal and i've already unzipped these you guys saw me do that so i'm going to i like to use the png formats and i want to use is that the pink one i'm going to use this orange one here now they usually import pretty large so if it takes a minute don't be alarmed all right so this one is not bad at all i am going to shrink it down just a little bit and i also want to merge in my pumpkin let's see jpeg and png i do like to use the png those usually have a transparent background it doesn't matter for this in particular but it could matter in the future now i know probably what you're thinking the pattern and the pumpkin don't match up very well that's okay because it's not going to be that big of a deal once we get to the actual project so what i like to do is this is going on an adult large shirt so i'm going to size it and i also need to change my page setup because i will be printing on a large format as a matter of fact let me set the custom okay can i go 13 inches wide i'm going to change my machine to none there we go 13 by 19. okay this is the size that i'm going to print and i want my pumpkin to be let's say let's do 9 inches now i do want to say this is going to be a little bit smaller than 9 inches because it's measuring the outside borders here so what i can do if that concerns me is i can draw a box that is nine inches line that up with my pumpkin and then i can size my pumpkin manually so that it's closer to the nine inch mark so my clipboard is actually nine point eight four seven that's okay that's not a big deal just something to know when you're using clip art and i am going to go ahead and flip it horizontally okay so with that in place what i'm going to do is i am going to make this pattern a little bit larger and i'm also going to duplicate it now the only reason i'm doing that is because i do want to have longer pieces and i want to use up the rest of my space down here now silhouette studio will only print what is on the page so just something to keep in mind make sure everything is on there and i'm literally going to fill up the rest of the area with this awesome cheetah pattern i keep saying cheetah is it cheetah or is it leopard all right so i'm going to print now i do have to select my sublimation printer see there we go i'm going to go to preferences and every time that i print after restarting my software i need to re-choose my super b 13 by 9 and 13 by 19 i mean and then premium presentation paper matte i'm going to choose okay hit apply and then i can hit print that's going to send over to my printer and of course we will reconvene and i'm going to show you not only pressing this on the shirt but then applying the bleaching process okay so what i have here is my sublimation print now this is the shirt that i'm going to use this is a style that i really like especially this orange it is a gildan soft style and it is 65 polyester and that leaves 35 cotton now there are reasons why you want to use a blended shirt like this first of all you need the cotton or to be able to bleach it second of all you need the polyester in order to be able to sublimate it but do remember that because you're not subbing on 100 polyester your print is not going to be as bright now for a bleach shirt that's fine and that's why we're doing the bleach so that you can see the design a little bit better but just be prepared for that now i'm going to trim all the way around all right now that is because sometimes and i find this a lot with sublimation printers you can get a little bit of ink around the outside of your paper and i would rather not have that happen so i just trimmed around each side and we will sublimate this part first and of course i have some butcher paper over here so what you're seeing down here on the bottom is just a heat safe mat that i have i'm going to grab my cricut easy press it is already heated up to 400 degrees for 60 seconds i'm going to fold my shirt in half it's kind of my thing i mean not my thing it's a thing okay that way i can get a crease before i sublimate my design on there so here we go i'm just going to pre-press that section and it doesn't have to be for the full time you just want to press it get some of the moisture out of there and give yourself that nice pressing line and just works out really good it's a good habit to have okay with that taken care of i will smooth this out and i'm going to go ahead and sublimate first yes you heard that correctly i'm going to sublimate my design first now i'm going to take my design now this is a design that i printed sometimes you can get them pre-printed from certain areas okay if you want you can use an adhesive to keep it here i'm not moving this shirt so this will be fine for me i'm going to cover it with butcher paper and then heat press my design now sublimation does not take a lot of pressure but you do need consistent pressure another good thing about these bleach shirts is that if this is one of your first time sublimating then it doesn't have to come out perfect because bleach shirts are supposed to look distressed so it just works out really good as a beginner project okay now be careful when opening your heat press or removing your ez press because since we did not use any type of adhesive or heat safe tape we do not want this design to shift okay so on this part we are a done deal now you cannot reuse this butcher paper you see you have the ink on there that transferred and that's okay just know that that's a thing all right there is our beautiful pumpkin now what we want to do and i'm going to start small just to show you guys i'm actually going to tear around this design okay because i do not want it to look like um just a rectangle obviously i actually prefer these to look like stripes all right so there's one we can use this one for another one and it just gives it a rough edge instead of just a bland okay and of course i have this entire sheet over here that i can do the same thing to i can make these a little larger and i probably don't even need all of these i tear them into little triangles and i'm not going to use the ones with the blunt edges like that okay so i can use as many of these or as few of these as i want to i'm just going to go around the shirt and press these on now let me also say if i was using a different shirt especially a white shirt or a light gray shirt you do want to use butcher paper or a different type of blowout paper in between your shirt layers i don't have to do that with this one i've worked with this one before and it is not going to bleed through to the back but just something to keep in mind and i like to do that kind of test anytime [Music] i'm working with a new shirt you do want to make sure you get some along the bottom now my shirt just my shirts seem to bunch so i'm just going to put some off to the side over here now our sublimating is done all right this is our our final effect we got a couple stripes up here and a couple stripes down here all right now don't worry if they look a little staged after the bleaching process they will blend in a little bit more and i promise this shirt is going to turn out great so i'm going to go ahead and prep the bleaching area and then i'll show you guys the setup that i use okay so the basics are you need it to be sunny outside obviously you don't want to be raining you need good weather conditions you also need a bleach safe environment now on top of just this piece of hardboard that i have you'll notice that i'm inserting a piece of cardboard into my shirt that's just going to act as a barrier so that whenever i spray especially the main middle pumpkin there it's not going to saturate through my shirt all the way to the back in addition to that make sure you're wearing bleach safe clothes in my video there was a little bit of wind blowing and i didn't have any blow back but that is a real possibility that you could blow the bleach that you spray back on the clothes you're wearing i also try to give my shirt a little bit of character so you'll notice i have done the pinch and twist on three of the areas and that's just going to give some areas where the bleach cannot reach and it just gives it a little bit of texture now i'm using straight bleach this is also cheap bleach i have heard that the high-powered bleach is more potent so definitely keep that in mind and i'm spraying all the areas that i have sublimated on including i'm trying to carefully go around my pumpkin and make sure i get that area really really well but you're going to notice that i give it a pretty good overall spray down i don't really well it's not that i don't like them i personally am not a fan of creating the shirts that just have the block of bleach right there in the middle and nothing else so i just really think that adding more bleach gives it some character you see i do a little bit of misting here now if you want some true misting you'll want to make sure to choose a spray bottle that has a really fine mist i'm going to come back and do that in just a minute i like to do my bleaching in stages so i'm doing one overall bleach right now and then i will actually come back and add a little bit more bleach in just a minute wow did you notice the change there so i had set it up on a time lapse but the gradual change wasn't quite as impactful so um it did occur now that probably took about five minutes what i'm doing is i'm going back and i'm re-saturating the areas where i've sublimated and this is with a a smaller bottle so i have more control over where i'm spraying and i'm going to let this sit for just a minute but another important thing to remember is when you take this inside you do want to at a minimum rinse it with cold water and then some people talk about also adding peroxide to neutralize the bleach i haven't had to do that but it's just something to keep in mind if you are in the mood to experiment but also as you're carrying it inside make sure that you do not dislodge the cardboard piece inside because your shirt will still be wet and also make sure that you don't brush the shirt up against your clothing because obviously it's covered in bleach so overall just try to keep an eye on your shirt and after you see a little bit of the transformation you can also straighten it out flatten it out and you know take a look i like to do that because it gives me a better idea of how the bleach process is going because i can compare my bleached area against the unexposed areas and see how much change there really was now here we are on the inside i have already rinsed this with cold water i feel like i got pretty good results on my bleach shirt you can see i got a pretty good bleach around the design okay and i don't like it when it's just a plain circle right in the middle of your t-shirt i do like these lighter colors i think they bleach really well and it's not a stark contrast so i'm very happy with how this turned out and i'm going to throw it through the washer and dryer and then we will take another look so uh do you like it i mean i i'm not gonna lie not everybody is with the bleach shirt craze all right that's okay there's no judgment in this zone this is the safe zone okay now if you like it you kind of get addicted to it pretty fast and if you live in florida like me then you know having all the sunshiny days to sweat your ear off bleaching shirts i mean it just depends on how you feel about that so all right well i really appreciate you watching today if you have any questions or comments make sure you leave them below and i will come back in and check with you guys but also make sure you subscribe to the channel because we have a lot of really fun tutorials for you right around the corner thanks again we'll see you next time you",

underscore finr and follow me on Facebook I've got to I got a page which is not just another southern gal and my personal page is I'm Jenny dot a dot finis thanks for stopping by", "ixY1Af77Bjs": "[Music] okay guys so today i'm bringing you how to do sublimation on cotton this is very easy as you can see i'm printing my design this is the design we're gonna do today don't forget to mirror it as you can see this is the paper that i'm using for sublimation it's pretty good so the ink is gonna be a little wet because we're gonna put some polyamide polyamide is a powder that we're gonna put on top of our design uh don't forget to follow us on etsy uh so as you can see i'm gonna start like putting all the polyamide on top uh on top of the design it has to cover the whole design but like i said it's gotta be the designs had to be a little a little wet so you know sometimes you had to like print it less slowly so you had to cover uh the whole design so in that way you know it's gonna be working perfectly so the polyamide what it does it it's like a like a sort of glue this the way it has to look you can you can see like over here it's everything cover the letters the blue color the red and once you have it [Music] covered with the polyamide powder what we're gonna do we're gonna cook it so i have a heat gun that i used to use for soldering so now i'm using it to cook my design so you're gonna start like like putting some heat on on top you gotta move it because otherwise you're gonna burn the the sheet so you have to melt a little bit the powder with the ink as you can see it's turning a little different instead of getting a little brighter over here let me do this right here okay so you have to do this for your design otherwise it's not gonna work uh so like i said the polyamide is what it's doing it's acting as a glue uh some people were telling me that the polyamide for some people could be people could be allergic to polyamide i don't think that would be a problem you know uh and i have used this for like so many times even for my kids and none of them they have a problem with it so just try to cover the whole design like i said i don't think polymer it's something that is going to burn you you know like cause you some irritation and over here we have the design and in my case i always like to do it double so in that way it's gonna look perfect i i mean how much polyamide you're gonna use just like a little bit you can reuse it you can reuse this polymer like so many times um i have a bag that is i have been using like so many times okay so you just like shake it a little bit so in that way there's not gonna be like an extra polyamide on on the design over here i can show you that it's like the first time when we put the polymer on top so once again once you powder the the polyamide on on the design we're gonna cook it again i always try to like you know put it flat so because with the heat the design is going to curve a little bit so again we had to shake it and you know like cook it a little bit i found another way to if you don't have a heat gone you can press it for like five seconds but you have to put um you have to put like a um a sheet on top of the design like facing up and i just like press it for like five seconds but it's gonna be like the paper is gonna be like a special paper like some sort of uh like um i don't know how you could how you call it i'll find out and i'll put a comment on the on the bottom like to show you like what type of paper you have to use okay so over here you have your design you have to cook it like i said got to make sure that all the design is covered and the letters too you know because we wanted to make it look pretty nice we're gonna make it look professional and once you're done what we're gonna do we're gonna just cut around so because you can see the the square we are gonna use that okay so all right so we have it ready to press on our garment this is a shirt for my kit and this is the design as you can see i cut around so to get rid of the square now you have to place it wherever you wanna press it and you know like you're gonna press like like some other uh sublimation design that you do in my case i do it for 400 degrees uh i used 35 seconds and because 400 degrees is a lot you know and then after that just you have to let it cool off you have to let it cool off for a few or a couple minutes once it's cooled off we're gonna use some water cold water once it's cooled off we're gonna start like pressing a little bit on the design on the paper especially make sure that it's cold it's not hot and we're gonna start like putting some water like this okay we're gonna get the paper wet because in that way it's gonna be like more easy for us to remove it you're not gonna you know like peel the the paper and the letters are gonna come off so that's why it's very important that you uh take your time get it wet get it done right so put a little bit wider it doesn't matter if you get like some water on the shirt i mean it's gonna dry so don't worry about that so put a little water like on every single corner um this paper has a little as you can see look kind of blue so one time i was just like scrubbing it and the blue it was like coming off touch it make sure that it's feeling wet you know it's not hard this one is still hard so we're gonna put more water and like i said the blue i don't know as part of the paper it was like getting on the on the shirt so that's why i tried to be careful you just like put a little pressure um once it's all wet try to peel from one corner and if you feel like it's not coming off try to put a little bit more water don't rush the design because otherwise you're going to ruin and we don't want to do that so just like take your time put a little bit more water just like go easy with the design once it's all wet it's gonna be like so easy to peel it off and you're gonna see the paper there's not um ink on the paper all the ink is gonna be transferred to the to the shirt okay so it feels much better it's coming off uh little by little don't try to rush it okay coming up perfectly in this corner right here okay um okay okay this right here and don't try to rush it like i said just go easy one corner and another okay the letters you gotta be careful and there you go as you can see i got a little water on the shirt but that's nothing to worry about take a look at the design it looks good and the all the ink was transferred i'll show you that this is a 100 cotton let me show you right here i'll make sure that okay here we go 100 cotton oh let me get the light okay there you go 100 cotton sublimation with polyamide i mean it looks good pretty good it feels good it's not gonna wash away like some people were saying that if you do sublimation on cotton it's gonna wash away the only thing you have to find you can find the polyamide on etsy or ebay take a look at the design it looks pretty good pretty legit letters are perfect design is perfect and like i said i mean the poi i made you can find it on etsy or you can find it on ebay either way and it comes from powder all right guys thank you for watching hope you like this video subscribe if you have any comments we can help you thank you for watching", "C42BmGVCeHw": "hey I'm durian joined by my wife in celebrity menswear stylist Ashley P Weston hi so today ash and fellas we are talking about what are the best budget-friendly teachers so where you are doing the budget-friendly ones and I wanted specifically to do like the mall versions of it you know like of the / H & M's and all that that's available both in a mall and online and the kind of the fash fat fast fashion stuff and so but we also wanted to start off with just doing white t-shirts because it is so effing hard to find a good white t-shirt so we decided to just test out all the different brands white t-shirts and see which is the best because then from there the colored ones are super easy [Music] and ash before we really get into it first of all let's talk about inline dimensions so guys you can kind of gauge it and see what's what I'm six-three about 180 185 pounds these days I typically wear a medium across the board and as far as waist size on about a 32 by about 32 to 34 lengths and so guys take that for what it is that's my sizing and then you can kind of gauge where maybe it will be a little different and also these are unwashed we haven't washed them so they will shrink up a little bit in the length maybe how much would you say on the sleeves would it shrink up not too much quarter of an inch so if you got more than that on the sleeves it's never going to be tight but it definitely goes up an inch to about an inch and a half when you want each one the length I would say an inch inch and a half so ash real quick what do you look for in like a good t-shirt like what constitutes a good t-shirt so there's a couple different aspects that you want to make sure are present with whatever t-shirt you end up going with so first is just the thickness of the fabric especially with white there's a lot of thin thin thin white t-shirts and just bend t-shirts in general out there which you want to avoid because it starts to clean to your body it looks really cheap but it could be very unflattering so you actually want a slightly thicker cotton and then I'm in terms of just the fit the neck you want it to not be too loose around your neck you don't want to have a super thick border around the neck either and then the sleeves you want it to like lightly hug your biceps it could be like a little you know loose around your bicep but not too much second to last feature is just the body of the t-shirt you want to make sure that you can pinch no more than I would say like an inch or two a fabric on either side 1/2 inches of fabric on one side of your bellybutton yeah basically length one side of your stomach kind of here-ish yeah and then the last feature is to just make sure that the length your t-shirt hits like just past your belt buckle into like me mid mid fly zone no shorter and no longer than that because then it just throws off the whole proportions of your body and then you start to look like you have either a really long or really short torso compared to your legs so those are the main features you want to look for and we've got a whole article on video dedicated to how your t-shirt should fit and how to style them and up and down as far as dressy versus casual linked in the description below so definitely check it out all right now let's really get into the best budget-friendly t-shirt crew neck t-shirt crew neck t-shirt alright so first up we've got the Uniqlo supima cotton t-shirt and they retail for about 990 about 10 bucks each or if you get to I think you like a beat bucks each I'm a huge fan of their t-shirts actually buy them in bulk but for my clients because the price points great and I love the fit of their t-shirts it's not super billowy it's like the perfect fit and the torso it lightly hugs the bicep and it's actually a good amount of thickness for the material so the white isn't super sheer it's gonna be very difficult to ever find a white t-shirt that is not not sure because white in general in and of itself unless you are literally the color of white will always show a little bit of your skin color it's inevitable I think the best way to tell the difference between a quality or thicker material of a white t-shirt is you look at the caller versus the rest of the shirt what is the contrast between it if it is ridiculously like dark the second the colors like you know that the stitching right past that point here that's gonna be way too thin agreed next up is the j.crew mercantile broken and crew neck t-shirt and it retails for $14.99 okay so this it's really interesting because I actually do like j-cruise t-shirts but I think there are they are definitely made for man who is not on the thin side so who has a regular build or maybe more of a stomach because the cut of their t-shirt is very they're very roomy in the body even in the sleeves the t-shirt sleeves it's it's definitely not hugging your bicep whatsoever so it's actually making you look even thinner than you are so ash who would be what what type what body type would be best for this shirt so if you are a gentleman that has a little bit more weight in the midsection then definitely this t-shirt is for you but if you're a thinner gentleman I would say avoid or if you're a little more muscular I think because it's very roomy I noticed a very roomy in the belly section and if you obviously have a trim waist that's just gonna swim around you and you're gonna have to get it tailored at that point for a $15.00 teacher he's like okay we just you gotta try different brand agreed okay moving on okay ash and up next is the top man when they call an white classic t-shirt retails for 10 bucks or aching it to for 16 so by $8 each so what did we think about this one ash it is way to roomy in the body as well as in the sleeves and it's quite thin and material it's definitely way too large and the crazy thing is is that this is a medium but it's fitting you as if it's a size large so you look so so thin in this t-shirt um so I would not recommend anyone wear these t-shirts on their own and next up is the H&M regular fit cotton t-shirt retails for $6.99 ash what do you think so their t-shirts are definitely on the thinner side which is why I'm not a fan but it's really tight in your armpits except the sleeves are still billowing out quite significant which makes your arms look really thin and then there's again a lot of room in the torso and the t-shirt itself is super long so not a fan at all don't know it's crazy long I think it's just a little bit longer and if you washed it it would shrink up at least an inch or two so it might be okay but that still doesn't get the fact that it is a very thin material and you can see where my pants are versus Wizkid that is a big no-no you absolutely don't want to be able to tell that with any white t-shirt next up is the zara basic slim fit t-shirt and it retails for about 18 bucks ash what do we think number one that is quite an expensive I'm a true believer that you should not spend more than I would say like ten dollars or so somewhere around there on a t-shirt because even even a two to $300 t-shirt is still gonna wear just as quickly as a five to ten dollar t-shirt so definitely t-shirts are not something you should invest in that is my belief I think you should actually just get more budget-friendly t-shirts and just constantly replenish them as they're wearing out now with this t-shirt it is as you can see way too tight on Dorian and it actually so it tapers down where it gets tighter on the midsection so if you have a little bit of stomach and you don't have like a perfect V for me like Formation going down to wide shoulders trim off then this t-shirt is going to be very unflattering and it's really tight in the armpits when I was wearing it - I'm pretty broad in the shoulders and for a medium this was like pretty painted on it was a little ridiculous and then it's that very it's a very weird material it's got like a white grinning or something and I hate to say it but I feel a little like 90s douchebag muscle shirt I think it was just a big fat no across where I put it on I was like oh God alright I'm doing this for you guys but this would not be anything I would ever wear just touching it I was like no I you like how the sleeves are lightly hugging your biceps that's great but that's the only redeeming feature for this t-shirt next up is the Banana Republic supima cotton crewneck and it retails for about 18 bucks an - what do we think so I actually like the way it fits your torso it's not a ton of material billowing around your stomach area but the sleeves are definitely on the long side generous and wide and long yeah so it's it's just fitting funky there I mean it's something that could easily be tailored but why when there are other again other options that will fit you better so I would say if you are a slim to regular build even if you have a little bit of stomach but but you have more muscular arms this t-shirt could be great for you so you're more of an athletic guy but not crazy trim in the stomach area then this would probably be a good option for you and last but not least - is the in all read in office it's quite long Express slim stretch cotton crewneck tee and it retails for about 23 bucks what do you think so the fit isn't terrible I mean I'm Dorian because he carries a little bit of weight in his midsection as men do when they're older so it's definitely hugging that area which is a no-no that's not what you want but if you don't have that problem where you're pretty slim in the stomach area then this t-shirt actually fits really great I like how it's the sleeves are lightly hugging Dorian's biceps the armpits are not digging into his armpits and then the torso itself it's it's not bad at all now I will say this 20 how much is it 23 bucks 23 dollars is quite expensive for a t-shirt that I would never pay 23 dollars for a t-shirt ever for my clients at all so you'd rather get a $10 shirt and spend five dollars on tailoring then spend 23 dollars on a shirt that fits mostly good yes really 1000% okay so unless you want to do what ash is proposing then maybe 22 hours not the worst taste scenario ever if you just don't want to have to deal with anything ash so out of all of the options that you saw what would you say is the best overall all-around winner today hands-down Uniqlo's t-shirts the fit is fantastic doesn't matter what your height is if you're an extra small small medium large extra large I just think that the fit is fantastic now obviously we went through each of these t-shirts and and we went over like the type of man that and depending on your build this t-shirt could be right for you but overall I would definitely go with easy class start with Uniqlo Uniqlo whatever and then try that out if that doesn't work then obviously come back to the video and see what options would fit you a little bit better based on how it how it fits you originally but I agree wearing it now then we're gonna for a little since I got it a couple weeks and I picked up quite a few of them I have to say it is definitely one of the better options for budget-friendly guys links to everything in the description below leave us your comments below if you've got experience with other fast fashion II type of brands we haven't done any online brands yet

Now this is our standard 100% cotton\nlong sleeve t-shirt kind of our big group order t-shirt. There's nothing\nI'd say super special about the cotton on this. It is gonna be the standard\nhundred-percent cotton. It is a great price point however. There are softer\nshirts but, they're a lot more expensive. The sleeve length and\neverything is pretty standard. The sleeve kind of, how wide it is, is also pretty standard. But instead of just telling you about it we do have our model here and he's gonna come over and you'll see it in action. The first thing you'll notice is it's a pretty generous cut both in the width here and the sleeves. They're both gonna be more generous. I don't wanna say baggy but\nthey're not gonna be tailored or tapered. So, as you can see here, there's no side\nseam. A lot of the softer shirts actually have a side seam because they're gonna be more tailored, and that tailored side seam on the softer shirts just makes it cut in. This is going to be more of a straight down, kinda more of a generous cut, so great for wide range of body types, I'd say. So, big events this is your go to long sleeve. The sleeve length also everything pretty standard here. We have a great cuff, it does, it's gonna basically hold very good over the course of the shirt. The neckline here, very standard hundred percent nothing special about the neckline to note, it's just a standard neckline. It's not going to stretch very far down and it's always gonna come back, which is key to 100% cotton. It doesn't have a lot of stretch to the fabric either. Now, you might be wondering about care instructions, will it shrink? Things like that. With this garment, don't really worry about shrinkage, but you might want to think about over the course of the lifetime of the shirt, being a year, or two\nyears, if you're washing and drying on high, it could shrink. That's one thing to note about a hundred percent but it is pre-shrunk you get it Very true to size when ordering. So, looks great and a great price point too, so if you're looking for a big group this is the shirt to go with. You look awesome Tyler, Thank you. On the Coed Monkey Soft Scale we rate this t-shirt a one. Thanks for watching this video Please let us know if you have any questions because here at Coed Monkey Soft Matters and so do our customers.", "_LunBmg4is0": "[Music] i have been on the hunt for the perfect white t-shirt and it's so long and if that's you too probably why you clicked on this video i'm going to be investigating eight different t-shirts and we're going to be putting them to the test for a few different things fit price feel sustainability so let's get to it my name is amanda weldon be sure to subscribe would love to have you part of the fam but let's get to this video the first one that we are going to investigate is a canadian brand if you've heard of a lego shop before you probably have your frequenting style youtube here she is the founder of uncle studios and this was my first impression of the t-shirt okay so these are my initial reactions nice and thin not see-through i am wearing a beige bra though so i will do test later honestly the length is really nice it's not too long but it's long enough that you can tuck it in and it will stay tucked in that's always so annoying when you have a t-shirt you want to tuck in and then you move and it just kind of comes untucked i think as well it honestly has this really nice kind of a bit more cap sleeved but not too cap sleeved but not like down your arm i know there's different styles that people like but uh the threading very minimal and it's super soft nothing about this t-shirt is itchy so that is my first impression i like this one the soft feel of this t-shirt comes from the components that make it micro model and super cotton i hope i'm pronouncing that right a 50 50 blend and as well this t-shirt is made in canada something that i was definitely impressed with on their website was reading more about their eco-conscious materials and their ethical labor you can definitely see more about their sustainability practices there if you go into their education sector which i have linked down below you can read a little bit more especially about the specifics of those two fabrics so moving forward this is a lightweight t-shirt so my worry was it was going to be a little bit see-through and it proved to pass the test the thing i loved about it so much was the feel and as well where it hit me on my body and it being lightweight is nice it won't pill it won't lose its shape and as well this will be so perfect during the warmer months it hit the bank account though 48 u.s they also talk about why it is that way on the website and i ended up ranking this one one of the highest at 23 out of 25. next up we have madewell so this madewell t-shirt when i tried this one after the uncle studios one i thought hey it's actually pretty similar but here is how it is different okay so first impressions of this t-shirt again very light doesn't feel thick at all easy to move it's a little bit off-white it's not that perfect perfect white so i like the way with the color is a little bit thicker and yeah this one's pretty pretty simple this t-shirt is 100 cotton made in guatemala and i found it different from the uncle studios one because i didn't find it as soft and when i started doing a little bit more investigation on a website called good on you which i definitely recommend you guys check out i'll link that down below as well i looked up every single company we're going to investigate but some weren't found on it however for madewell unfortunately their ranking was not so good they scored 11 to 20 percent on the fashion transparency index and that's when they look into information like the source of their materials where they're made the people the planet the animals all things that are incorporated in that but though that they ranked pretty low on that one they actually do have a ton of sustainability practices when it comes to their denim so maybe you've heard of madewell because of their denim now madewell is a branch of j crew and to be honest this t-shirt was pretty basic if you were just looking for a standard white t-shirt it was pretty good the size range as well was pretty inclusive and that was ranging from a double extra small to a double extra large and their pricing was pretty inclusive as well around 21 canadian sadly the shipping was half the cost of the t-shirt as well so it actually ended up coming to 31 overall i don't know why i just wasn't as impressed with this one and i took off some points just because i wasn't sure how sustainable this branch of the company was just because of that transparency index and then as well the durability next up this is this is one i'm so excited to tell you about and this is one a lot of you voted on instagram for me to check out oh this is such a nice t-shirt damn okay first impressions of this one oh my god this is a thick t-shirt but it is beautiful this is the kind of t-shirt that i picture like with dress pants and a really nice layered jewelry moment it is so nice i actually love where this sleeve hits my arm and the thick layer as well it's kind of got that like thick stitch i feel like you could do if you're someone who likes to spice it up a little bit you could do the one two roll so you hide that seam oh i love this one i could see myself getting this in another color i think that's how you know you want to get multiples 100 cotton and made in vietnam this t-shirt when i put it on i just kind of knew you know that feeling i'm actually wearing it right now because i was so impressed and it was definitely one of my favorites the way that it hits me on my body as well as the length of the sleeves i definitely definitely liked and just the thickness it made it feel a little bit more upscale like i could match this with a really nice pair of trousers and then stack some jewelry and i would be all set to go and feeling really chic when it comes to sustainability on good on you they still ranked it's a start so that's still kind of mid-range when you go to their website though they do have so much more information about their sustainability practices and it really seems like they are trying to continue to push this forward it was designed in paris and basically called the ultimate basic t-shirt and i could totally get behind that whether it comes to the design or kind of the thickness and durability and versatility of this t-shirt i'm all for it double x or small to double extra large as their size range and this one will come in costing you around 30 plus tax it got to my door pretty quickly and i was impressed with everything about it i ended up ranking this one 24 out of 25 4 out of 5 for sustainability because there's still some work to be done province of canada made in canada canadian canadian-born but clearly this isn't the one guys this is a beautiful t-shirt it's super well made it's made in canada it's 100 cotton it's really nice and i think the reason why i ordered all these t-shirts in small and this is a unisex t-shirt so it's uh just on the larger side and these sleeves come down so much lower i think that this one's going to scotty but if you guys like the um the longer sleeves this might be the one for you okay so this is such a tough one made in canada 100 cotton this was honestly a beautiful t-shirt but because it was unisex they were saying on the website if you are a woman you probably want a size down i ordered all of these t-shirts all eight in a small so that you could see the range of them there's definitely some work to be done when it comes to their transparency about sustainability specifically but on their website they do say there's a reason you feel reassured when you find a t-shirt that reads made in canada on the label too many local manufacturing is synonymous with quality and equality which is why made in canada is the main pillar of our company now because the size wasn't for me i had to bring in scotty we are pretty similar in size and i thought that this would be way better suited for him and this is what he had to say yeah it fits you really well it's the providence of canada tea the province of ontario province of canada yeah it's nice it fits well i think um all in all because this is a unisex t-shirt i honestly think it fits you better than if it's me yeah yeah did they have an extra smell i think so yeah it's a really nice t-shirt though yeah the material is amazing it feels really really soft when he asked me if there was an extra small i wasn't 100 sure so looking into the size range there's actually extra extra small to extra extra large which means a very inclusive size range and then when it comes to their pricing as well this was a little bit pricier of a t-shirt 38 dollars but i did end up getting 10 off because of a welcome deal overall i rank this one 19 out of 25 but i think if i had gotten the right size it would have been up a little bit higher so this is the only one that i say take it with a grain salt have you ever heard of the brand cotton this is a really cool brand guys and i'm excited to tell you about it this was their packaging and then they as well sent along this little tote it was the only company to do this in the full gamut of things this one's really thick you can tell it's really well made the stitching is beautiful but it's a bit off-white so if you're looking for like a crisp crisp white this one is a little bit off-weight and it has a very different color than the other ones it kind of has like a ribbed collar but it's nice and thick and i think the shoulders might be just too wide for me but this is a really beautiful one and the sleeves come down a little bit longer no cap sleeve here so after my first impressions this had a different kind of stiffness to it 100 cotton egyptian cotton and made in egypt and this t-shirt i thought was really cool it's really hard to tell on camera but it is a bit of an off-white and the sustainability practices of this company are very impressive and they also have a lot on their website when it comes to education about their farms and sourcing of their products so definitely check that out for their t-shirt though the fit is actually a little bit boxier it's a vintage inspired t-shirt and it's a band tee and around the neck it had a really cool ribbing detail that was so different than any of the other t-shirts it's going to run you around 38 and the size range as well was inclusive with that double extra small to double extra large this one actually ranked quite high 22 out of 25. it just wasn't the fit that i specifically was looking for okay so let's do erisia as a whole because there's three t-shirts that i sourced from maurizia their sustainability practices still have work to be done on good on you they definitely talk about that and on their website i actually never knew this i've been on the uricio website so many times but i've never reached out to their sustainability side of things and it was really cool learning more so i put that link down below so you can check it out too the first brand we're going to look into is daviton so this is the only one of the white t-shirts that i've actually had for a while and it's the babiton everyday shirt you can tell it's a lot shorter than the other ones and it's a bit like slinkier in feel versus that stiff 100 cotton i really enjoyed having it i lay it flat to dry and it's kind of that perfect layering underneath a sweater or something like that but if you are someone who likes a longer t-shirt because you want to tuck it in and when you raise your hands you don't want it to come up this might not be the one for you but all in all it's super soft and it's a pretty basic go-to teeth this t-shirt is 94 round and 6 elastane and made in china funny enough about this t-shirt specifically this is the only one that i actually already owned before this video and this ended up being one of my least favorite t-shirts i don't know why i think i'm just when it comes to a white t-shirt i really want that structure because i think that a white t-shirt when it's crisp and a little bit more structured it can look so sleek however because of this more like elastaney feel there was a bit more of a see-through quality to it the one thing i did love that i could use this as is a workout t-shirt because it is nice and stretchy or for hiking i think it would be great it'll run you thirty dollars not too bad middle of the road and the size range is from double extra small to extra large i ended up ranking this one 17 out of 25 taking points off for some sustainability fabric opacity and fit as a whole for me personally next up is wilfred and these were my first impressions this is the only fully ripped t-shirt and you can tell it's a lot tighter than the other ones a totally different style has more of a cap sleeve and finishes right at the top of a high-waisted jean this is definitely just like for a totally different situation and i would consider this more a casual white t-shirt versus some of the other maybe even more oversized ones that you could dress up with some jewelry so i like this one but it really all depends on what you're looking for 91 model and 9 elastane i think my first impressions were pretty we're pretty accurate with this one this t-shirt just looks so casual and it is much tighter again i think i would consider this one more as a workout t-shirt it has a shrunken fit a crew neck it's ribbed it reminds me of a high school girls t-shirt it just kind of i don't know what it is about it it just comes off a lot more casual than the other ones did and a little bit more young looking but that totally makes sense for eritsia and the range of people that shop there i still really loved this t-shirt i think there's just a time and a place for it and what i was looking for was my everyday t-shirt that i would pick out for zoom calls and just running around whereas this one wouldn't be the one that i would grab for it was honestly so soft though and i would definitely take this one on a vacation double extra small to double xl was the range and surprisingly this seemed like the tiniest t-shirt but it ended up being the most expensive one from auritzia it came in at 40. total was 45 20 canadian taking some points off for fabric opacity as well as the fit and maybe a bit of sustainability i ranked this one 16 out of 25. last but not least we have sunday best again from auritzia as for the sunday best t-shirt this is a lot thicker than the other two from auritzia i would say this kind of also rivals the earlier t-shirts that were just that thick opaque you're not going to see your bra through it at all i think that if you're wearing a white bra as well you won't see it and it's obviously as well a lot tighter and finishes at the top of your high-waisted jeans i think that's more of the style of orizia kind of the clientele that they're looking for as well and this is a beautiful t-shirt it's very soft it feels just like good it just feels like i don't know it would be a really nice go-to and it also all depends on whether you want that tighter feel so i do really really like this one the only thing that i wish that i could do is i wish it was a little bit longer so that i could get that tucked in effect but other than that just i can see this is a really great like travel tee the total makeup of this one 57 cotton 38 polyester 5 elastane and made in china if we're talking about t-shirts that surprised me the most out of this whole test it was this one i actually love this t-shirt the only thing that makes it different from the uniqlo one because it definitely was thicker was it was much more slim fit and it also hit me much higher on my hip so it matched the top of my jeans kind of like i said earlier it definitely passed the opacity test and the size range was double extra small to xl i would recommend this t-shirt to you if you are going to find one in auritia i think that this one might be the one and surprisingly as well it was the cheapest one out of the three 25 dollars and the total price was 28.25 for the total score i ended up giving it 5 out of 5 for fit i really liked it 22 out of 25 total and i think that it really all depends on what you're looking for but personally for my style and what i'm looking for my top picks were uniqlo uncle studios cotton and sunday best tied for third specifically what kind of stood out to me about the uniqlo one and the uncle studios one that kind of ranks them equal in a way but i put the uniqlo one a little bit higher because of the thickness and i just love the way that it looks i think that pairing that with a nice pair of trousers and as well some stacked necklaces like i said earlier in the video would come off so beautifully and i definitely want to invest in the black t-shirt from them as well the uncle studios one i loved so much too and it was really hard to choose which one i would put first the only thing i found a little bit different about that t-shirt was that it definitely was thinner i think that if i was doing this investigation in the summer i would have maybe ranked that one first because of that thinner maybe more lightweight feel it would be a bit more comfortable in those hot months so all depending on where you live and where you plan on wearing your white t-shirts those are the two that i would highly recommend that you investigate further for yourself let me know in the comments below if you like this style of video it allowed me to flex my journalism muscle which was so fun also just kind of diving into the sustainability practices of all these t-shirts was so fun and i hope that you guys enjoyed that as well of course i'm not perfect i'm just going off of their websites as well as what i could find hopefully on good on you which is another thing i would suggest that you check out if you are looking into new brands subscribe become part of the fam thanks so much for watching and i hope you guys found your perfect white t-shirt i know i did bye [Music]", "lLILkojt_z4": "if you were curious about the Gildan soft style geez 64,000 like this one right here then this video is for you there are a ton of blank t-shirt options out there to choose from so many that stand has this permanent look on his face but not to fear because today we're just gonna look at one in specific the Gildan soft style G 64,000 there are a few important things to consider when trying to choose which t-shirt is right for you comfort style color options and price and also since we are a screen print shop we're actually going to talk about the print ability using discharge and water-based inks which is what we specialize in here at Twin Cities first let's start with comfort this shirt is a hundred percent ring-spun cotton and it weighs 4.5 ounces what this means is that through the ring spun process they've left it with longer stronger strands of yarn what it means for you and I is that this shirt is soft and it's durable shirt was made for wear it's a softer shirt than your Gildan G 5000 your standard heavy cotton t-shirt but not quite as soft as like your next level 3600 your Bella canvas 3000 won American Apparel 2001 those shirts are combed ring spun cotton so they're gonna be a little bit softer but this shirt is a nice middle-of-the-road comfortable shirt next let's talk about styling it's not a Corvette but it's also not your grandma's beige Buick LeSabre out here this shirt is a semi fitted with a tape neck and shoulders it has a rolled forward shoulder so it fits most body types really comfortably it has a nice seamless double collar a durable sleeve and him double needle stitch it is a little longer than your standard t-shirt but not as long as something like the next level 3600 and this shirt comes in sizes extra small through Forex as for shirt colors Gildan always has a lot of color options and this shirt is no different it has a ton of different options to choose from if you look at these charts you'll see that they mix the heather colors and things with it as for price once again nice mill the road shirt as Goldilocks would say it's not too cheap it's not too expensive it's just right and to give you an idea here is a price list this price is 450 shirts with a1 color print and as you can see it fits right in between like the cheaper Gildan 5 thousands and the more expensive fitted shirts like next level labelled the canvas american apparel things like that so this price is really just to give you an idea where this shirt fits among a bunch of our other popular t-shirt options and remember that these prices are subject to change since the time you've seen this video so next let's talk a little bit about actually printing on the Gildan soft style t-shirt since we use discharge inks the dye lot of the shirt actually is very important and what a dialogue is is where they actually take a blank material and they diet to give it its color so in some places like here's an example of a bad dialogue where we print discharge ink on it and we get varying results luckily Gildan has been very consistent with their dialogues we've seen a little bit of problems lately but not too much the important thing is as a customer it's not really that important to you guys because it's up to us to printers to figure out the dialogue problems and it just makes a little extra work for us but for you just so you know the Gildan soft style t-shirt has always been a good option their colors always come out really nice and really consistent one more thing to add the Gildan soft shirt also comes in a ladies version that's the G 64,000 L let me just throw that on for you real quick so you can see what it looks like so once again the Gildan soft style is a very middle-of-the-road shirt it's not fitted so it's not going to make you feel insecure

you're dyeing the shirt the transfer doesn't feel like it's there at all also making it very light to wear lastly sublimation is a permanent solution and has fantastic wash ability if you're new to sublimation are doing your research on it here's a quick look at what you'll need to sublimate a t-shirt first is a sublimation printing system which is a specialized printer ink and paper made specially for sublimation if you want more details on these systems check out our category page at heat dot press / sublimation for this video shirt a print out my transfer with a sawgrass printer with sublogic HD ink you'll also need a heat press I'll be working with our 15 by 15 inch craft pro and of course we will need a t-shirt I'll be transferring onto a hundred percent polyester t-shirt because of the nature of the sublimation process you can't use organic materials like cotton the dye simply will not stick to it for the best most clear and vibrant results go with a hundred percent polyester I'm going to print up my design on the Sawgrass printer using the Sawgrass print manager this program optimizes my printers output so my colors will be true once sublimated it also mirrors the image by default and has a lot of other helpful functions as well notice how my printout looks a little dull and washed out this is totally normal since sublimation inks don't reach their full brilliance until heated up so once we sublimate this transfer onto our t-shirt the colors are really gonna pop we recommend using a pressing pillow for sublimation as I'll help prevent press marks from being left on polyester shirts for the sake of demonstration I'll go ahead and press my shirt without one for now we're first going to Center our shirt on the lower platen and pre press for about three seconds pre pressing the shirt helps eliminate any moisture in the shirt and also gives us a smooth flat surface to work with we're going to place our printed sublimation transfer ink side down on our shirt I'm going to eyeball the center for this demo but you can use an alignment tool like a t-square to get more professional results when placing your transfers before pressing be sure to cover your transfer with the piece of parchment paper to protect our heating element from any out gas dye or bleed through if you're using a thinner t-shirt you may need to slip a piece of parchment paper inside the shirt to block any bleed through to the back or onto your pressing pillow next I'll slide the lower platen back in and press my team for 50 seconds at 385 degrees Fahrenheit the sweet spot for sublimating garments is between 385 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 45 to 60 seconds for this particular graphic on this shirt I found that 385 degrees for 50 seconds works perfectly depending on your heat press t-shirt ink system our local climate you may find the need to use more or less heat and our time we always recommend performing several test presses with different settings to see what works best for you all right so our shirt is done since I didn't fix the transfer in place with any heat tape or adhesive spray I want to avoid shifting the hot transfer on the surface of the shirt if the ink on the transfer paper is still hot it may still release onto my shirt so if it shifts it may leave us the imprint on the shirt this would result in a blurred look that's commonly referred to as ghosting so I'm going to remove the parchment paper carefully and I'll usually give the transfer a few seconds to air cool before I pill it off and again we want to avoid the transfer from shifting so I'll just pull it off quickly like a band-aid pulling up and away from the tee and there you go we have a gorgeous sublimated t-shirt I wish you could reach into your screen and touch this shirt because it's super soft you literally cannot feel a thing this transfer is soft vibrant high-resolution permanent everything you want in a t-shirt transfer thank you so much for checking

this may be the shirt for you the pros are it has a wide range of colors it comes in ranges and sizes kids small to adult 5x its tubular constructed meaning that there are no side seams which means that it's a little bit more forgiving and this makes it perfect for promotional items or ordering for large groups where you don't know the different shapes and sizes that are going to be fitting into your shirts the cons are it's not as soft as some of the garments that we offered it has a little bit of a boxy cut to it and it's a hundred percent cotton so when washed and dried on high temperatures it may shrink on our firing soft scale this garment gets a rating of zero", "zhj-rK1Mjxw": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to walt and sarah's channel today we are going to be bleaching sublimation designs on our right here we have 65 polyester on the left we have 60 percent this one is a woman's cut and the one on the left is a man's cut not that that matters we have a pumpkin and we also have our cool little design of the truck and it says farm fresh pumpkins so if my audio doesn't match up my movements it is because i actually lost the audio to the first half of this video so i am doing a voiceover now the way we started was we filled up a spray bottle with leech and this was just a cheap spray bottle from amazon nothing fancy it's actually a four pack the one i used last night actually did not work however this one as you will see produced pretty darn good results um the spray nozzle worked perfectly all right so we got our shirts laid out i haven't washed them because they're already you know pre shrunk pre-shrunken however you want to say it so they're laying down flat i have nothing in between the shirts just lay down flat on the concrete those are my toes and i'm trying not to spray my toes so i am spraying the shirts and we're going to get around that sublimation there we're going to spray that so that way that area turns white and that's really going to make our image pop now once you adjust the nozzle you'll see i'm going to do what i call the zaro streaks zoom zoom you can actually see it showing up on camera and that's going to give us like a really crisp design and we're going to let that one go first because i've always heard that 65 polyester works the best but you're gonna see whether or not you know that is true in my opinion you'll just wait you'll just have to see it okay so you're gonna see these darker colors produce this orange but if you wait long enough that orange will turn almost into like a light pink and then keep waiting it will turn into a white this does take time look how fast the 60 polyester is working this is crazy i've done a few of these t-shirts now this is the fastest one i've ever seen turn and it is so stinking cool i mean right there i think like that is perfect and i would just rinse it out let's see what are we doing next this is so weird having to do a voiceover all right so i'm just going to spray it a little bit more we really want to get that bleach design and as you see around the pumpkin with the sunflowers there you can just see how it's starting to soak in and that's that bleach around it is really gonna make that image pop so we're just gonna wait and then we will check back on these designs after i rinse them out throw them in the washer throw them in the dryer then i'm going to show you the final project instead of making you wait through all of that okay look at the one on the left that is so pretty and one on the right just wait just wait all right guys as promised here is the final project so we have our 60 polyester here excuse my shadow all right so unfortunately i didn't rinse this out good enough before i threw it in the washer so while it was sitting there and i was working on other shirts it was still bleaching away so i'm going to show you like this as you can see this is kind of like our original color and it bleached pretty strong so you got that but i mean it doesn't look terrible i would rock it i'm sure walt's gonna love it so we got that and then over here was our 65 polyester and this one turned out so stinking cool like with the streaks and then the spritz super super cool oh this one's also a haines i don't usually work with hanes when i'm doing my custom shirts and this one is that one all right so they turned out pretty freaking cool if i do say so myself very simple and that's it if you are interested in me doing a video from start to finish with making the t-shirts actually putting the shirts together with the sublimation let me know and i will be totally down for that catch all next time bye [Music] you", "zNqMyIIdACs": "I got long our pit here's me oh you're gonna go there and you're gonna go too what's going on everybody today we're gonna be going over various white tees and a bunch of different brands in pursuit of the perfect white tee if that's even possible to him I mean I've gone through so many different types of white tees from different stores different fits different prices alright so hopefully this video eliminates any future guessing games when it comes to the white tees you ready to talk about these men let's go [Music] all right team first whitey that we're gonna review is a classic white tea from pains man from what I remember when are these hain tea is growing up once you get them a little bit dirty you throw them in the washing a dryer they're done the color pretty much turns into like shrivel the bacon real ugly that's why the price is 5 for $20 like you cannot beat that price right there deals and after trying it on I'm gonna have to go and say the cotton is not that soft okay okay well what about the supreme one though okay that's another slavery the supreme one is for hypebeast aesthetics only wear Hanes I feel like they have a lot of brand recognition you know Payne's class or in Jordan it's a beautiful thing I put them up there with fruit of the Loom and whatnot but as far as the product itself I'm gonna have to go rate it at 5 how to change whatever you man the fit was a little bit off I'm gonna have to go and say solid because you do get five t-shirts for 20 if you just want to cover yourself up these are the ones that go ain't ease are definitely the ones that you wear to go to sleep in yeah generally not something robbed with a nice pair of denim definitely there's a go to safe bet go to sleep don't on your girlfriend type team your girlfriend okay alright so that wraps it up for the hangs white tee I think we could find something better I agree alright alright so next white team we got one from the rail department in North Sean I would say off the bat supersoft we already tell it is a lot better than the Hanes one you can tell right that with the price point to 430 that's not cheap at all that's kind of steep when it comes to a white tee but I'm thinking this is the one when you could wear not just to sleep so right off the bat looking at this white tee right here you could tell the fit is a little bit different the caller is a little bit more structured than the Hanes white to you that's definitely one thing when it comes to quality the white tee then I look at is the collar and you can't really see through the fabric like the Hays white so you can see I think you can foresee the problem if the nipples are Perkin the hanky is gonna show so after trying on this t-shirt I'm gonna have to go and say the fit is pretty good maybe like an 8 out of 10 okay it does feel pretty trendy the mid section is not too baggy it's not flowing all over the place overall when it comes to the rail white teeth I'm gonna compare to the Hanes you're gonna see this white seat hung up in my closet more I see what you mean cuz it hangs ones you're gonna play ball at the park with and then the rail t-shirts you're gonna you're clark's with alright so there we have it the rail department white team I would say worth checking out if you guys want a very soft nice fitting white team mover right along we got a pretty popular one that a lot of people get cuz it's so damn cheap we got forever 21 White T's for 4 bucks just feeling the Chi right now I wouldn't even call this con it has like slight like cardboard tight it leaves a little bit Scratchy let me tell you one thing just observing it before even touching it it does have a trendy look it does it almost reminds me of the real one that we just covered but it has the quality and the feel of the Hanes one well I mean that's what you're gonna get from a lot of forever21 products you're gonna get to look down but you're not gonna get the quality oh I've got these over the Hanes one the $4 so their dollar cheaper they look more expensive than they are I see what you mean I see what you mean but you know what am I I don't even put them in the same category the haze or whooping in the park tight white seat though on your girl like you said earlier this is more for like you want to hit the club and look trendy you know right but I don't put them in the same category so there we have it the forever 21 white tee you're gonna get that trendy look but you're not gonna get the quality down but for four dollars you don't really have a seat so next t-shirts we have up or from H&M and for a longest time I'd walk in there and be like why is there two white tees and two different prices one is a premium version it has like a slim fit you know a little bit thicker and kind and the one is just your regular plain $6.99 and white seat I'm not gonna lie I would get the ones out of 69 cuz they're cheaper and I really did not know the difference so for the ten dollar one this is called a crew neck t-shirt and then it also has a slim fit label on them I put this kind of in the category of like maybe that's all Bay white t-shirts you know what I mean like this fits a little bit tighter around the body and everything that leaves are super super short kind of like a euro fee okay I don't know you personally like it I can see what you're saying because the sleeves are kind of small the armpit of late is pretty short I got a long armpit hairs me you're gonna go down and stay away from this one man so I've always gravitated towards the $6.99 one I don't know why I decide the price point I just felt like wallet II was there for the price okay okay so everything on is not Dashie yes that's half the price of a regular screen print very true I do like these because I've always taught about a white tea could only be worn you know underneath the flan oh yeah well underneath a dress shirt but for some reason man I could wear this with a nice denim and they also have another section in H&M called the divided section they have really good white tees as well so also check those out they have a blue tag on them but as far as these white tees one thing I really never liked about the $6.99 ATGM White T's is the color is very wide do you like that I like it the blue chain shop I see fresh clear then ballers man they a not even a baby that's a newborn chain no it really is though this is how I categorize it man I think the big dudes you know the Johnny Simms and I in a weird way consider myself that big dude okay like I've been called a nugget before he's not sure people come in a nugget like a little stumpy so I'm gonna put myself in the category of your big news we like white tees with nice solid color collars I mean so for myself the hnny tees I never really liked them because of that reason I would definitely rate this one part of one of my favorites top three white tees I'd rate it solid nine out of ten I would put this over the rail or this one I just wanted to get this across that just cuz it's more expensive does not make it better from H&M it's not even gonna be the same thing as a cheaper one so you definitely got to try it on see what works for you so the slim fit white tees $9.99 I'm gonna have to say no go from H&M so last but not least we got the Stafford white tee right here you get four for 20 from JC Penney's if you would like and this is the type of color that I was saying that I like man meaning Johnny you know what I mean I really like this I don't like him at all I feel like this is oral Tim we need to rock the fitted over the ears yeah they arise with too much of the champs in footlocker for 420s men I already know off the bat quality is really good the quality is on point very thick you get a really husky collar right here best fit a little bit oversized when you do get them out the pack but these shrink really well after you shrink them okay pretty nice Stepford overall in general they have a lot of variations of their white keys this one is just their standard bit but they also got like the slim fit they also got some like cooling that one so definitely try out all the variations they have they don't all fit the same so overall wrapping up the Stafford white team I'm gonna have to go and say for myself okay as a small little nugget I like the Stafford white to nihilism right would you rate it are we gonna have to break this a nine out of ten there's no perfect white see out there idea no truth if you guys know what Earthlings signature is it's a brand from Costco and may have white team's very similar to this alright so there we have it the Stanford white tee not really for everybody but if you do want that feel of a street wear tight t-shirt go with the Stafford ones wrapping this one up tan what was your favorite white tee that we went over man I'm gonna have to go with the hmm for $6.99 for myself I like the Stafford white tees we get for 4/20 if you want that more like premium cotton feel but if you want more of like a trendy flow wear t-shirt I actually really like the ones from the rail department even though they were 15 bucks you definitely get that soft cotton feel alright so there we have it please leave down in the comments below what your favorite white tee is to wear right now some other brands that you guys recommend shoutout to tan tan for being in video and until next time we yeah boosts our guys save with checking out that video make sure you guys check out this video also check out this video take that like button let's try to get this video to maybe 5,000 likes and if it

peace", "zyGQ8mpTXlM": "hey guys okay so I'm back in the back of the shop and I've got the heat fresh heated up and we're ready to print so forth the sublimation transfers of sublimation final as I should call it the sublimation file this one you need to pre-heat your press to three-fifty and my purse my camp is a little high I met 369 one state between and I know that sounds long but it's not so we're going to do 350 for 60 seconds when you print your final sublimation transfers your promo vinyl it's going to look like this okay so it's gonna give a dull look but once you press it this is what it's going to look like now this one is faster so once you press it gonna line up and these are the colors that you're done please so you see it's a big big difference okay and here's one that we actually be it on a t-shirt so we're going to go ahead and we're going to get started with this particular type of printable vinyl you do it comes with a clear backing and you see those sublimation inks they go all the way to the back so you do have to take this apart and remove it now because this is a pretty easy design it's all in one piece I can just remove it with my hands if maybe I was doing another video where I'm doing some tag sorts of things that are separated and I'll show you how to print how to pull those up early in the morning my mouth is very dry so that's just how you do it and you're gonna lay it face down and you always want to have some type of paper and you can use just regular regular old coffee paper this is my subs I'm sorry my screen credit transfer but I'm going to use this today while I'm waiting on my feet French to PETA is I just take my t-shirt and I fooled my t-shirt in half like this and I lay it on the fridge and I'm gonna move this camera over here some so I lay it on the crest I can lay multiple [Music] we are pressing under the stairs so all I'm doing is I'm giving a 17 and I can do five or six of these at one time if I need to [Music] so this give me a knife I already know whatever Spencer thirty and I know exactly what I'm told so that's fine everybody so I'm just going to take my transfer and because I've gotten to a point here I'm gonna [Music] without one and can't touch them done so you can't really go from scene from well I'll just pull that turnout sorry folks I'm gonna pop that down now because I'm doing sublimation vinyl transfers i'm not going to pre-press and I just had quit Princeton anyway so close this down and count off about 30 seconds go right to that [Music] and I'm going to lift my transfer straight up I don't want to leave it there and move it around okay because they'll get the wrong thing on it so I've got one down [Music] [Music] and normally don't use a ruler but [Music] now sublimation transfer they start to roll I'm gonna put something over that collar right there because it looks like a scientist I don't want that so just gonna do another one [Music] now let's remember that I am paying myself for the time that I print so always remember to calculate in your crisis the time that it takes you to print those garments [Music] good thing I didn't put that there [Music] [Music] the colors of nice and vibrant I'm continued with these [Music] [Music] but I'm always using just a regular heat transfer paper uses a regular not heat transfer for regular copy paper you'll save a lot my heat breath was not flattering [Music] probably [Music] [Music] I noticed that I've got just a little bit of that white outline showing someone go back over this with my favorite friend and that's the ability continue to go on - sure you [Music] it's a good idea to invest in a lint roller and lint roll that area I don't have a lot of [Music] so I'm just going to continue to do this and show you guys the picture to kind of give you guys an idea as you get to get to going on this fresh thing you know once I pretty much know where the print goes and I don't really use the metric package well one thing you have to realize is you see how that curling up is that when you're pressing you gotta watch out for that that makes sure that you don't get curls now I'm going to reuse this paper but the reason that I'm reusing if I am doing a black shirt I've gotta make sure that it doesn't you are my sublimation I've got to make sure that my paper does so that's one of the things that you need to watch out for when you're pressing shirt another thing is if you start to get press lines on your on your charts these are polyester shirts if you start to get press lines then you want to rip your paper that's on top of it so like for example here I don't know if you can see but there is a little press line pretty much come out [Music] a really high temperature but if you were hundreds of we'll do those press live let me get a fresh taste of fresh so they're going to do is just rip the edges of it and should they ever do that in the smooth the edges I exam you will avoid those principles so this is the last shirt I'm going to a manual inspection of each and every last one of these shirts now and since idea to this cut by hand I'm going to go in with a fabric marker and make sure that I don't have any white spots it's all about so just when it's hot put this on my pray grab a marker I just gotta [Music] [Music] fabric [Music] that [Music] like [Music] so [Music] here we have it in Canton and scale [Music] and I'm doing this very I'm just looking for I want my [Music] it's about right about 9 o'clock and I'm here all alone this morning my Bulldog to the bit [Music] my birthday lunch is my birthday month close it up stop one thing that I love about the business [Music] right time to start holiday things like that stuff like that [Music] working [Music] walk back looking at my sale [Music] updating website all of that type of stuff so in your downtime the last one we saw [Music] you know what for long term now for and [Music] 1987 was when I graduated oh I love this song [Music] my all of that stuff is so really what we're gonna do is we're about to start doing the home invasion start [Music] I'm gonna go back over and do a final pricks but again [Music] one day Oh only done one press and I didn't do this one free because I want to show people that it be explored out of the white shirt and I didn't press the back so guys that [Music] that one here that's almost [Music] now to really take your time even with with your conscience [Music] my shirt yeah Oh [Music] [Music] and the follow this order get it ready box up for the customer and get on to the next thing that I have to do state custom the appeared to be the day I make sure you got let you guys see me set up a child on the automatic", "D7FqwkG8I10": "what's up guys Lucia Lumina here and in today's video I am going to be sublimating on three different types of shirts so today I have the Cricut and fusible ink t-shirts that they sell at Michaels and you probably can find these Michaels certain Walmart's Hobby Lobby Joanne's all those type of hobby or craft shops and these guys are 95% polyester and 5% I believe nylon or something like diet or spandex 5% spandex and cricket markets this as its infusible inc brand I'll see the camera can kind of focus on that right there but really they sell like their own patterns and be able to cut it with the Cricut and kind of you know print similar to what this guy has well lucky for us we have an actual sublimation printer that will print whatever we want on this guy so the other two type of shirts I was trying to find a 50/50 poly cotton but I couldn't find one anymore like locally so I ended up grabbing a to Walmart shirts but their one was is for women and one for men and one of them is a time and true brand you can see think that sir the woman brand that they have and this guy is and I'll show you guys here it is a 60% cotton and 40% recycled polyester and you guys can see the tag there so you see it so we're gonna be using this guy we're gonna see how a subliminal print comes out on this and then I also got a George brand I say and and this is actually shirts that I use very often with HCV and and heat transfers I actually like the George Brown how the shirts kind of feel and they're very easy to access at least during the summer and spring times and even fall a winter you kind of see this long-sleeve version of these t-shirts but for the most part they're pretty easy to find and this guy is 65% polyester and 35% cotton you can kind of see so we have three different levels of polyester in the shirt and while I kind of know you know I think the minimum should be 50/50 poly cotton this one probably would work this is just kind of my I guess assumptions or or my theory I don't think this one's gonna do too well but this one for sure should sublimate very very good and I actually found these for sale at Michaels 50% off so if you guys actually follow me on my Instagram at Lumina creative I typically post about cells like this so these guys like I said were 50% off so $10 typically at Michaels they were 5 bucks guys is this cheaper than what I can get them like on some t-shirt websites I can be trying to get a hundred percent polyester so it was a really good deal I picked up a bunch of these because I have a huge order and then like I said follow my Instagram and I always pull stuff like this so yeah guys I am gonna get my designer here real quick I'm not really gonna show that if you want to see the process of doing that you can watch my previous video up here that kind of shows you the introduction of sublimation how I set up a image of that nature but I'm gonna go ahead and set up the image and then I'm gonna go ahead and print it and I'm gonna get the heat press ready I guess for so far the settings on the heat press you're gonna do 400 degrees Fahrenheit so if your machine is in Celsius like mine that's gonna be 200 and 204 degrees I definitely recommend having a little legs are going to kind of check the temperature of your heat press at all times because mine is a little off sometimes and you're gonna set your timer at 45 to 60 seconds try to play with the timer typically black ink if your image has a lot of black ink that takes a little bit longer to sublimate as simply the last color that kind of transfers over and again guys if you guys are only a little more about sublimation of the process check out that video I did a few weeks ago but anyways let me go ahead and get to it I'm gonna print and then we'll switch over to the camera over here on the heat press alright guys so I just ran my test print I always suggest you guys to run with your sublimation printer in case you don't use it on the daily like I do like I said I'm more of a few chunks of plaster so heat transfer user and HCV and so I just kind of ran one real quick it's kinda what the delenn's gonna be similar to the one I do with the Neenah 3G opaque when I did a print and cut except I added my domain at the bottom so we're gonna sublimate this guy this is just a regular eight and a half by eleven sheet guys so I'm gonna go ahead and start running the actual one and let's see how it comes out guys I cannot stress this enough I printed these guys wrong so what sublimation always always always always remember mirror your image I just wasted a bunch of ink on three prints that were supposed to be reversed learn from my mistakes guys I got a reprint them let's go alright guys so we are back so I already kind of pre-press this one right here now you're supposed to put something in here and I don't know where 1/2 will happen to my little board I like a little plastic thing that I put underneath so I'm gonna slide our old of use quick and Matt underneath here and just because I don't have my actual thing that I use but I guess this works too right and what this is guys is with sublimation sometimes the the transfer will go a little bit too far or like the it'll go through so you can do this so that that doesn't happen to you this shirts a v-neck so I'm gonna put it up a little higher so this first shirt is the time ensure I'm so sorry the lighting sucks I'm not this is not I intended to do Hey oh cool so one of the transfers now it is a mirrored rookie mistakes guys I'm not gonna measure I'm not gonna try to get this perfect this is literally just to see if it'll sublimate on to the shirt just want to see if it'll work these are just test prints so we're gonna go ahead and press those guys let's see how this goes I guess we're gonna take this one off I'm not gonna show you how everything looks till the end so ye alrighty guys we're gonna go ahead and put the next shirt in which is the George brand and this one is 6535 so we're gonna go ahead and put this guy on [Music] that we transfer same thing guys same process and you'll put it on here slap this narek there you know we're gonna go to town I think that's pretty close to being Center so yeah sorry guys so same thing lift up don't breathe in remember you're supposed to be doing this in a regulated area alrighty guys so last shirt gonna throw on the and this is the cricket one notice every shirt gets bigger and bigger I start from small medium and now extra-large these old cricket Matt's work just fine for this but they do kind of melt so you got to wait a little bit before you take them out and it'll harden up again and take shape so anyways you're gonna impress these get the wrinkles out and the moisture I'm gonna go ahead and do the last print guys Center that like so [Music] again I'm not doing this 100% accurate I'm just kind of eyeballing to see the quality of these prints not necessarily use these shirts for anything [Music] same think I'm breathe alright guys so I know it looks like anyone from day to night I kind of started this little delayed afternoon where there's a little bit of sunlight it's kind of gone down her those prints took a little while to do especially because I could do it twice because my dumb self decided to do them not mirrored again guys learn from my mistakes and I am not ashamed to show you that I to make these type of mistakes three perfectly good sublimation sheets gone to waste including ink don't be like me just see you see these are the ones I used they are mirrored so to you look straight to me here on the camera whether they have been all used and let's see the final results guys I just don't want you guys to see that not because something shouldn't be done doesn't mean just because some people say it shouldn't be done doesn't mean you can't do it there's a bunch of different ways to do things and and you know what guys every customer is different you might get a customer that wants the least expensive route that wants to just as long as the image is somewhat visible they don't care and you know for those type of customers one of these options are going to be great for the customers I want the higher end stuff one of these options is gonna be good too and so like I tell people that comment on my videos because I do get some people are like I bet you if you watch that nina 3g up a paper is gonna fall right off or I bit because it's not pigment in ink it's gonna fall right off after water too and you know what guys I get it it's hard to believe it when you don't do it yourself but if you follow some of these instructions that I'm giving you step-by-step you're gonna get the same results I do and you know the this is stuff that people say shouldn't work on and so I'm gonna show you guys the three results from three sharps and you tell me what you think and which route would you go through would you go for would you offer all these three to your customers we're joining off for one comment in the section below and tell me what are your thoughts so anyways let me grab these shirts so you can kind of take a look already so we're gonna start with the shirt that I thought just wasn't gonna sublimate and that's the time and true brand from Walmart and the reason why I use these specifically showed you guys is because you can go purchase these at your local stores this is not something you have to order from someone these shirts are not something that you have to go find in the internet it's literally available to anybody and at ridiculous prices so this time and shoe came in and think I had four dollars for a shirt and guys honestly if you don't have an account somewhere or like a wholesale account that's a pretty good fish good price for a shirt especially something you can sublimate on so this is the type of shoe brand guys and I'll see if I can ladies all out at the end and you know comparison like I actually do like a panning of them but this is what that shirt looks like and again this was if I am correct 65% cotton about 60% pima cotton and a forty percent recycled polyester so I mean here I know the camera is a little difficult to see but it's definitely a little a little faded type of look it's not it's not a super super sharp image but it works guys some people might have customers that don't mind this you know and this is why you have a few samples laying around will show your your customers and you know for somebody's gonna get these dirty and they're just you know for advanced or for something that's like a one-off use why not why am i go with the least expensive option so anyways let's switch over to the George brand and I try to do a female and a male brand so that's like yeah yeah you know I can't find it for one the other Bailey's this is the George Brown guys right here and this is 65% polyester 35% cotton a little more vibrant you can definitely see a little more details in the print looks good like I said Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart Walmart I like most of my shirts that I saw the people at one work I use Gildan Walmart and then I want to go to step up like a little bit better quality I go to next level or Bella canvas which Bella canvas is actually now available at michaels if you don't have a whole slit account alright so last shirt okay and this is the cricut brand and fusible ink and I got these guys on sale I got that for style Michaels and they do go I'm sorry once in a blue moon and these these are typically $10 a piece which is a little more expensive than the order from a website or something typically the polyester 100% of like seven dollars or maybe a little less I know you guys probably some of you guys probably have a better host account than I do but for me it's seven dollars for polyester shirt and I found these guys for five bucks guys so I actually bought almost a whole inventory because I had a very large order fulfill but this is how the Cricut this is 95% polyester and 5% spandex guys it is so vibrant like it is sharp it is clean check that out it is a very nice quality image very little bleeding you can specifically tell in the text very little bleeding very clean image and this might be for those customers that don't mind spending a little bit extra you go with the 95% cotton again you can probably find this stuff cheaper online guys but I'm trying to give you a solution to be able to do this stuff from home and if you get like a random customer that pops up and you need a quote quick and they need something turnaround for next day either way you're gonna charge them a premium this is the cost you gotta pay they gotta pay in store prices if not they can wait like everybody else and you can order and get your discounted rates okay so this is what it looks like after a wash and this is the more cotton one the yeah the tiny children and so she watched this one time already so I'm kind of trying to get a little close a little bit looks a little bit like that worn effect but guys like I said it looks good and I printed well the heat didn't fall off you know obviously I don't know we might give it a few more wash tests and see what they come out like the cricket one looks awesome we washed all three of them together and this is the cricket one pretty much the same nice and vibrant looks great so tell ten guys thank you

t-shirts from five popular conscious brands and this is a very in-depth and thorough test we're going to be looking at the quality of the fabrics the sewing how they fit the comfort and also comparing the sustainability and ethics of each brand as you can see this is a long video i go into a lot of the different details and aspects of these brands so if you're only interested in certain parts i will include time codes down below so you can skip around to the parts you're interested in or if you want to just jump to my final thoughts you can do that as well so let's get right into it first at the lowest price point we have this t-shirt from everlane and be sure to stick around to later to hear my thoughts on everlane's ethics then there is this t-shirt from pact and they actually don't carry this exact style anymore but they have a lot of different basics i have this t-shirt from cotton and i hope it doesn't get too confusing with a brand named cotton because we're also going to talk about cotton the material a bit then there's this tea from armed angels because i wanted to have some europe-based brands as well and finally our highest priced t-shirt is this one from organic basics i tried to get the most basic style of t-shirt each brand had and ordered them all in a size medium the first thing i did when they arrived is measure each one to see how they compare to each other and also how they compare to the brand's size guide this chart shows the measurements of each one and the largest and smallest tea in each area i also should note that pack shrunk the most after washing quite a lot in length and everlane and organic basics didn't really shrink at all okay so i have the t-shirts here and they have all been washed once with cold water and air dry but i wanted to wait to do first impressions until after they were washed because quite often things can shrink or shift i have definitely had that experience where a fabric feels super soft in the store and then when you take it home and wash it it feels completely different so the first really obvious difference is the thickness and weight of the fabric the everlane t-shirt which is also the cheapest one is definitely the thinnest fabric it's extremely lightweight very kind of gauzy the armed angels one is also very lightweight but the knit is a little denser then we have the pack t-shirt in the middle and then the organic basics and the cotton t-shirt are quite a bit denser while they are about the same thickness the organic basics one is softer while the cotton one is a stiffer knit the everlane packed and organic basics are softer than the armed angels and the cotton but they might soften up over time they only have been washed once it's not like an uncomfortable stiffness just when you compare them so i've just laid them out from cheapest to most expensive because it is important to keep price in mind because this one is half of the cost of this one so you know there are going to be quality differences just based on that but the next thing i want to compare is construction and what i have noticed is they all have this piece of fabric along the back of the neck which is really good but then if we go into the t-shirts and inspect the shoulder seams the brands have done different things so the everlane shirt is just surged there's nothing else added to the shoulder seam and that's a common place that tends to stretch out at least when i was studying clothing construction we were told to always do something to kind of reinforce the shoulder seam the pack shirt has a piece of elastic sewn in this type of elastic is used a lot in clothing construction and it's added as they're serging the seam to provide some extra support and help with retention the cotton shirt also doesn't have anything added but because this is a much more dense knit i'm not actually sure that this necessarily needs some extra support the lighter and looser it is i would say the more likely it is to actually need some support so the everlane shirt i would be much more concerned about it stretching out versus this one now what armed angels has done is a clever finishing trick where they've actually put a strip of the same fabric and this is great because you're not using extra plastic which this kind of elastic is so this is still totally cotton but it is a slightly higher cost way of finishing it because you do have to cut that strip and line it all up versus just using the elastic and then the organic basics t also doesn't have anything in that seam but again i'm not necessarily sure that this one needs it because it is a denser knit and because this one actually has spandex in it it probably is a lot better at retaining that seam so even though at the higher price point i do think it would be good to maybe see a bit of extra reinforcement i'm not sure if it's actually necessary other than that all these t-shirts are basically sewn and finished the same way something to point out on this packed shirt is the hem is sort of twisting basically it wasn't a even fold it was somehow offset slightly when they sewed it when we compare the stitching the armed angels shirts and the organic basics shirt definitely have a much tighter stitch which is generally a sign of higher quality just because the looser the stitches the faster you can sew something and it's a lot less thread less cost that kind of thing so especially with fast fashion you'll see a really wide stitches often just because it makes it cheaper and faster to sew none of these stitching i would say is bad or too loose but you definitely do notice that the packed and the cotton shirt in particular have wider stitching than the armed angels and the organic basics okay so now i'm going to lay each one out flat just look at how it's cut how it sits and what we want to see is a good shape we want it to look pretty even we don't want anything looking off or crooked okay so the first thing i notice after lying the everlane shirt out flat kind of blocking it out is that we are seeing a little bit of twisting in the side seam so the seams should run perfectly straight this seam in particular starts off at the side and then as we get to the bottom it's sort of curving in a little bit so when you look at a knit fabric there are tiny tiny little lines called whales that run up and down the shirt and that needs to be cut straight or you get this kind of twisting and what also has resulted from that is that one of the shoulders is more forward and one of the shoulder seams is more back so basically we end up with a bit of a battle where if i try to get the shoulders perfectly straight and flat then my side seams are off and if i line my side seams up nice and flat then the shoulders are off so there's definitely something that's cut a little bit crooked with the pattern but what i want to point out though is that that is not really uncommon with knits especially something like a t-shirt and because this is the lowest price point shirt i mean i'm not that surprised i wouldn't say this is something that you would return it honestly most people probably wouldn't even notice unless you really kind of laid it out and blocked it out this isn't something that you would notice when it was on the hem looks pretty good it's about an inch shorter in the front than the back which is fairly common some brands do that with their t-shirts and yeah it's a pretty typical straight t-shirt construction okay so then we're gonna move on to the pack t-shirt this one is a v-neck unlike the others so it is going to be slightly different in terms of its construction okay now right away i'm noticing quite a bit of that twisting that i was talking about with the everlane this one actually has it even more it's actually twisting about an inch on each side which depending on the brand that could be within quality control tolerance and that would of course explain what i mentioned that it looked like the hem was slightly twisted i think it's just because the whole piece has been cut slightly off and this shirt i believe will try to straighten out the side seams is cut with a bit of a curve to it so it's a more fitted cut i find the armhole interesting on this packed shirt it comes in at kind of a i think sort of a unique curve for an armhole so you end up with some extra fabric under the arm here which might be good for certain fit elements and again we'll have to try it on and see how it fits if there is some extra bulkiness under the arm but it's just something i definitely noticed this one is hemmed slightly shorter than i believe all these other ones usually higher quality stuff will have a bit larger seam allowances yeah i'm just curious to see what this one's going to look like on to see if we're going to notice any of those things or not but then we have the cotton shirt and like i said earlier this is a stiffer a bit more dense shirt so we should be seeing a pretty clean even because this kind of fabric is going to be easier to cut it's going to be less likely to twist and stretch out if you want a really light drapey loose knit it does come with maybe some more quality issues maybe some more pattern issues where something is pretty dense and structured will often give you a better shape and it usually is more durable however you don't get that really soft loose drapey look okay so with this shirt we're getting really nice flat even side seams which is good to see this pattern has been cut straight the neckline also looks pretty good it's lying nice and flat there is a tiny bit of puckering or bunching along the back here especially where the tag is i'm probably being too nitpicky because this is a casual piece it's not supposed to look pristine and perfect you know it's not like we're comparing something that is very tailored or very structured like a button-up shirt and let me know if you would like to see a video like this about a different piece so these kinds of things like having a little bit of bunching along the back doesn't really make a difference you're not going to notice it so this one also does have a slightly curved side seam and this one is cut perfectly straight along the bottom there's nothing else really of a note for this shirt so we're gonna move on to the armed angels one this one like the packed one also has that same higher cut armhole with a bit of extra fabric this is the only one that isn't top stitched along the neckline and so what's happening is the serging at the front here is flipping up a bit we're gonna have to try it on to see how that exactly sits we've got that extra fabric in the shoulder which i really like okay so let's move on to our final one so this is the organic basics tee so this one and the everlane one are both cut straight so this is interesting so this one is actually cut with slightly more fabric in the front than the back so when you lay out the side seams the front rolls over ever so slightly because there's a bit more fabric and that is good design because with women's bodies you have more body in the front than you do in the back so the neckline and this one is slightly lower than the other crewnecks but it is lying beautifully flat and something that's interesting with this one in particular is the shoulder seam is actually set back slightly and that is a good thing because again when we're talking about you know how the body is distributed you have more up front than you do in the back so if you set the seam actually slightly back it tends to sit right at the top of the shoulder versus it being slightly more forward with clothing you don't want to actually see the shoulder seam on the front of the shoulder so it's better to set it back slightly and then it's sitting at the top or slightly hidden over the back of the shoulder it's not something that you would typically do with a t-shirt that's more for tailored garments but i like the fact that they have set back the seam slightly overall fabric and construction my first impression is that the organic basics tee is better quality but it also is the higher price point one so i would expect and hope that it is better quality so for the fabric and construction quality here is how i would rank them i think pact and everlane are both tied for the bottom place because while everlane had better construction pact had better quality fabric i do want to note though that pact seems to be kind of hit or miss with their sewing because when i ordered this t-shirt i also ordered a couple other pieces just to show you here's the sewing on one of my pack tank tops and there is a noticeable difference and i've heard this from others as well where some of their packed pieces are great while others have issues so i don't know if it's just the factory where this t-shirt's sewn and maybe their other pieces are sewn somewhere else or what's going on but if you are interested in packed i would encourage you to read reviews because some of their pieces are definitely sewn better than others okay so now i'm gonna compare the fit of them on first up is the everlane tee and i don't know if you guys can tell but you can definitely see where my pants are just color wise so that is indicative of the fabric not being very thick i do have a nude bra on i probably should have worn like a black bra but based on the fact that you can see my pants through it i would definitely say that you could probably see a bra through it so the fabric is not very thick it is really nice and soft though now i do have pretty broad shoulders so with all of these they're probably gonna sit a little bit high but it doesn't feel tight across here which is the biggest thing that i would look for these are all a size medium and with most brands i am between a size small and medium depending on the waist and the bust so these are a slightly looser fit i would say typically than if i went with a small but that's what i like with t-shirts another thing that we're going to try to look for is that the arm sits nice so it should sit nice and straight not really wing out at all we also want to check that the neckline looks pretty good and straight which it does and also that the hips aren't too tight and i think that that is pretty comfortable so yeah i don't have any fit complaints with this i think it fits pretty well my biggest issue with it is just the sheerness and the thinness of the fabric okay so now i have the pack t-shirt on so this is the one where the fabric was twisting the most if you look at the side seam it looks pretty straight you wouldn't notice it what you do notice on this shirt though is that the hem is slightly twisted you can just see that it's sort of lumpy and twisted now one thing that i wanted to look at is what was happening under the arm and i definitely do feel like there is some extra fabric here almost it's like striping down right here now packed in particular does fit larger than the other brands so it is a bit looser and that could also be why we're getting a bit of extra fabric under the armpit here the shoulders on this one actually are sitting on my shoulder point which is pretty uncommon for me so if you do have broader shoulders this could be a good brand for you but if you have narrow shoulders they might be too wide now twice so far i've had to flip down the seam on the sleeve and that has to do with the fact that it is such a narrow fold okay so then we have the cotton one and there is a noticeable fit difference between this one and the one before this one is definitely a lot more fitted i feel it pretty snugly across my body and because this is a much thicker and more dense knit it doesn't have that same looseness and stretch as those lighter knits do so to me this is a very different t-shirt this is a much more structured almost more like formal t-shirt if that makes any sense the shoulders are a little narrow for me i would not want to size down in this one and actually if i wanted a looser t-shirt i might even size up the shaping on the side seam is really nice it is fairly snug in the hips but because it's a denser fabric i mean it's more snug all over so this is definitely if you wanted a more structured and fitted shirt so now we have the armed angels tee and we're back to a lighter knit but this is a more fitted t-shirt than the first two that we tried on something very interesting to note is that when i felt these different t-shirts with my hand this one felt a bit stiffer but on it actually feels really soft so the other ones i think are spun with a bit fluffier yarn so at first hand it does feel like fluffier and softer whereas this one seems to have a tighter sponge fiber so even though it initially feels a bit stiffer it actually is quite like silky feeling almost on so i quite like the feeling of this and i'm pleasantly surprised by how soft it feels and that just goes to show that you can't necessarily judge things just by touching them with your hands you do have to try it on unlike some of the other ones where the shoulders were quite a ways in this to me is at a good point and when i was working as a fit model because my shoulders were a bit more broad this is where they would fit the shoulder points to so this is where the shoulders sit from most narrow to widest and so this one also looked like it had a bit of extra fabric under the arm but the packed one was larger so i think that's why we got that kind of draping and pulling this one actually fits really nicely i think along the armpits under the arm i don't at all feel like there's too much fabric there and the sleeves feel really comfortable the thing that i wanted to check is whether this was uncomfortable at all or looking weird or anything because it wasn't top stitched down that's something that i'm going to make note of as i wear it a few times and as i wear it longer but right now i don't think it's a problem at all so i really like this one as a t-shirt i think it feels really nice it fits well i don't really have any complaints about it okay so now we have the organic basics shirt and this one is unfortunately harder to see because it is black so you can't see the details as well this one is the longest one it hits me right here i'm petite i'm only 5'3 so for me that's a little bit longer than i would want my t-shirt but it's also pretty easy to hem this is the only one that has spandex in it so that is gonna affect the fit and comfort and i definitely noticed just in terms of being able to move around like there is absolutely nothing restricting my movement in any way i know people have different preferences for straight or fitted t-shirts i think the fitted shirts look a bit nicer if you're tucking them in really tight but i also run into the issue which will see if that happens as we're wearing it that the fitted shirts tend to kind of like bunch up around the waist whereas straight shirts don't have that issue and i also prefer the way they look if you tuck them in loosely so yeah just a personal preference but i do tend to like a straighter cut shirt again i don't really have any fit issues or complaints the fabric is really nice and soft and i think everything looks really good here are the shirts side by side to see the fit differences so then i wore and washed each t-shirt at least three times the cotton and packed shirts i enjoyed wearing the least the packed shirt because the hems really bothered me and just don't look very good and the cotton shirt because i prefer looser and drapier shirts so this kind of style just felt a bit heavy and restrictive and they do actually have lighter shirts which i probably should have gotten but at the time i ordered these it was going into winter so i think they were featuring their heavier shirts so i am interested to try some of their other shirts but if you are a person who likes thicker denser and more fitted tees then i do think this is a great t-shirt it's just not the style that i usually like while the everlane shirt was soft and comfortable to wear i didn't like the fabric and that it was so thin and sheer and i had to be careful of what color undergarments i had underneath the armed angel shirt was also really comfortable to wear but the little bit of neckline surging did flip up which i was worried about and it bothered me a bit i don't know why that isn't just stitched down it's just a small thing but compared to the other ones it was noticeable and finally the organic basics tee i liked the best there was really nothing to complain about it was soft and comfortable and really stretchy and easy to move in so now let's compare their environmental and ethical practices and this is all based on what they say publicly so things that we as customers could easily find on their websites for the material packed organic basics and armed angels all use got certified organic cotton which is a great certification cotton and everlane do not use organic cotton however cotton has direct trade practices and they work with cotton farmers in egypt so they have a lot of traceability and transparency around their cotton and they also say that they are working directly with the farmers to improve their systems and get organic certification everlane says that they are moving to organic cotton by 2023 so still a few years from now however i have noticed that they are incorporating some organic cotton into their collection they didn't have it when i ordered this t-shirt but it looks like they do have an organic cotton t-shirt now it's also important to note that the organic basics tee has some spandex in it which is a negative for sustainability in that it's synthetic however spandex also greatly improves the retention so it won't stretch out and lose its shape as fast which is a positive for longevity and sustainability and i have a video that goes way more into spandex and sustainable fashion and why it's often a necessary evil so i will link that if you haven't watched it yet it digs all into that in terms of other areas of sustainability organic basics and armed angels in particular have lots of great information about different things they're doing to reduce their impact like addressing water and chemical use and lowering waste and energy cotton has some good info about what they're doing with water and dyeing and organic basics and packed both carbon offset their shipping pact and everlane really don't have much information about other sustainability initiatives and the ones that everlane does share all have to do with their office or their stores and not really the manufacturing of the garments so overall for sustainability organic basics and armed angels definitely seem to be doing the most now let's look at the brand's ethics so the god certification which i already mentioned does include some social aspects armed angels has fair trade certification and pact is fair trade certification for some but not all their products and they say this is because the products which aren't certified are manufactured in countries where there already is strict wage and labor laws while the fair trade certification is great i do wish that pact provided a bit more specific information about their factories organic basics manufacturers in europe and they are really transparent about their factories they even have information like how many hours a week the employees work and how many vacation days they get and the factories have a variety of sustainability and ethical certifications cotton also has really good transparency around their factories and supply chain but not many certifications everlane also has good transparency about their factories but no certifications that i could find and they also don't seem to really include information about wages or social programs both organic basics and cotton are certified b corps and if you want to learn more about what that means i have a video about that and organic basics and armed angels also both have pita vegan approved products it's also worth noting that cotton does a lot of work building schools and improving literacy in egypt in the communities where they farm and manufacture in so overall for ethics obviously fair trade certification is great because it's a third party that comes in and audits but i also think organic basics has some really good transparency around their manufacturing and i think cotton is doing some really interesting things with their kind of farm to closet approach it's not a business model that we see a lot again everlane is on the bottom for me because even though they disclose information about their factories they really don't say much about the ethical treatment of workers they say that they aim for a 90 score on their internal audit but we really have no idea if factories actually get that score or how close to that score they are and this is probably a good time to chat a bit more about everlane because it's been a bit of a roller coaster i've never recommended everlane initially it was because they weren't really doing anything in terms of sustainability and their radical transparency just was never very transparent however over the last few years they've been doing a lot more with sustainable materials and some people who i really admire and respect in the ethical fashion space seem to love them so i thought maybe i was being too harsh and that i should give them a shot and when i decided to make this video i thought that would be a perfect opportunity now i ordered these t-shirts last year in the fall it's taken me a long time to get this video out but when i ordered them i was approaching everlane with an open mind and then shortly after i got the shirt information came out that everlane had been union busting which is incredibly unethical and then later on more allegations came out about them just having a very toxic and racist work environment so just when i was trying to give everlane a shot it turns out that they're actually not a very ethical company and in short i would not recommend everlane i don't think they're a good brand their radical transparency is ridiculous and just seems like a marketing gimmick and it's not just their ethics and transparency their sustainability and quality is also lacking so now let's get into my final thoughts and if these brands are worth their prices i think it's pretty obvious that everlane is at the bottom while the price point is the most accessible the quality isn't particularly good they don't have a lot of information available and they're just doing some shady stuff based on just this t-shirt i also wouldn't recommend packed the construction quality really isn't very good and they don't have a lot of information available but they do have the gots and fair trade certifications to back them up however like i said i have had some really good quality packed stuff so i guess if you are interested just know that it might be a bit of a gamble try your best to research the quality of the garment and know that you might have to return things for a lower price point option i would definitely recommend cotton this shirt is only five dollars more than the everlane shirt the sewing and fabric is really nice quality and even though it's not organic i do really like what they're doing in terms of being fully involved in their supply chain and manufacturing if you really care about sustainability then organic basics and armed angels are both great organic options they're soft and comfortable the fit is good the quality is good and both these brands are doing a lot of things to reduce their impact armed angels is very expensive to ship to north america though so keep that in mind if you are looking at price however it's a great option for those of you in europe organic basics is also based in europe however they do have distributors in the us and canada which i can link as well so i guess now a big question is is the organic basics tea actually worth almost 40 us dollars and almost twice the everlane tea honestly if you're able to spend that you will get a really soft comfortable good quality t-shirt it's really wearable and i think is going to be a staple in my wardrobe plus as a brand they have a really great mission and practices which i think are worth supporting one of my only issues with this t-shirt is just the lack of colors because it only comes in white and black but i also get that not everyone can drop forty dollars on a t-shirt and actually in canadian dollars i ended up spending fifty dollars on this t-shirt but after comparing it with the other shirts i do feel better about the price however if it's too much for you then i think cotton is at a great price point for what you get and if all these prices are inaccessible for you then definitely check out my videos on building a sustainable and ethical wardrobe on a budget i will link those down below because slow fashion is expensive but there are lots of different ways that you can have a more conscious closet for all different budgets so after all of this organic basics armed angels and cotton would be my top picks depending on what kind of t-shirt you're looking for so this was definitely the longest and most work i've ever put into a video so please please give this a thumbs up if you liked this and found it helpful also i would love to hear your feedback in the comments so would you like to see more of this kind of video with different products and brands and also what aspects of the review were most helpful for you and any other feedback you have like was this too long i know i personally really like lots of details and information but maybe it's too much for most people so let me know this is my first time making this style of video so i just really love to hear what you think of it thank you for watching and an extra special thank you to those of you supporting me on patreon i would not be able to do videos like this without that extra support it's definitely expensive ordering a bunch of sustainable t-shirts and putting this much work into a video so i really really appreciate it and i will see you guys in the next one [Music]", "Nbx7Qf2iNiM": "Hi, I\u2019m Taryn.

this one from ever lane that I bought for 30 and this one that I bought from Walmart for a whopping $6 in this video we're gonna figure out whether or not they're worth the money that I bought them for hey team welcome back to another Levi's save the world Hildebrand episode the channel where we prove that you don't need to be a hero to save the planet today I'm going to be comparing a Patagonia ever lain and Jorge t-shirt to see if the price that you pay for a t-shirt actually impacts the quality of the product itself this video is a part of a series where I do challenges and experiments to test out sustainability practices in real life I boycotted Black Friday and Cyber Monday I only ate uber eats for two entire weeks and most recently I documented my experience living without a car in North America for an entire year this video like all of those other videos is brought to you by my patreon supporters on patreon I post exclusive behind-the-scenes updates on these challenge videos and everything else that I'm working on in addition to that you get to see a secret podcast that I release every single month where I talk about sustainability stories in the news and my own personal journey here on this channel trying to reduce my environmental impact so if you're interested in any of that or you just want to support this channel head down to the description to check it out for yourself but here in this video we are going to be breaking down my experience only wearing three shirts for 90 days every single day for 90 days straight so right off the top I have to acknowledge that this is not a mathematical experiment in any sort of way but I did take some measures to try and keep this as fair as possible all of the shirts that I'm comparing are made of a hundred percent cotton they were all made outside of North America and all of these shirts were worn and washed the exact same number of times see I even kept this tally my phone I wore them all in pretty similar conditions from riding my bike around town working out to working all day sitting at a computer I watched them in full loads of laundry and dried them in an open-air drying rack upstairs but one quick note about washing probably a whole bunch of you just thought to yourselves wait 30 wears and 5 washes that means Levi's Wars shirt like 9 times without washing it and I would say that you're wrong because 30 divided by 5 is 6 but the point is yeah I don't wash my clothes very often because you really don't have to in fact I bought that pair of jeans right there 4 months ago and I still haven't watched them yet [Laughter] Leah you love this stuff way too much the reality is washing your clothes is one of the fastest ways to wear them out these three t-shirts would have been in way worse condition if I was washing them with warm water and drying them in a drying machine rant summary you probably don't need to be washing your clothes as often as you are save the planet your wallet and your clothes by just washing with cold water and air drying but anyways let's go s see what happened for the final evaluation of these shirts I based it off of three very random criteria that I invented for the purpose of this video number one is fit does this shirt actually fit me the way that I wanted it to when I bought it in the first place and does it look bad generally number two is wear and tear does the fabric itself seem to have broken down at all as appealing as it stretched out etc and number three is cost does it seem to be worth the money that I spent on the shirt after 30 days of using it well let's start with the most expensive so full disclosure for the sake of this video I love Patagonia I think that they're an incredible company I made a whole video about them and what they do in a video a couple years back when I look like I actually worked for them I'm probably not going to grow my hair it again if that's a word for some people so don't unsubscribe just based on that alone the fit of this shirt has honestly been one of my favorites of the three begin with I know that this is very different and very subjective because every shirt fits every person differently but this cut just seems to really work for my body type wear and tear this shirt has held up extremely well once you get a really nice close-up on the fabric itself you can see that it has been used but the material has retained its shape and retained its fabric integrity really really well for the most part this shirt looks pretty well the same as when I got it 30 warez ago now in terms of cost for me the Patagonia was a very expensive shirt fifty dollars for a t-shirt that's just cotton in today's world seems crazy because that's often ten times the price of what you can get a similar looking gray t-shirt for but this has held up extremely well for that dollar value part of the reason why this shirt is so expensive is because Patagonia is a leader in socially an environmentally responsible fashion but we're gonna get into that later in the video let's move on to ever lane now full disclosure I made a video debunking ever lanes claims to be radically transparent but they are a higher-end brand and therefore they should in theory have a higher quality product fit and feel honestly I love the fit of this shirt as well it's been always quite nice and tight and slimming the only thing that's slightly different from the Patagonia is the fact that it feels like a lighter shirt the material seems to be I don't know how else to put it a lighter it feels like there's less shirt on me right now and that's not necessarily a bad thing but it does feel slightly cheaper wear and tear because it does feel like a slightly lighter material it does have a bit more wear and tear to it you can see some of the fabric coming away at some of the seams but really not that much considering that I've worn it thirty different times number three cost now for 30 bucks I would say that this is a good value shirt it looks good after 30 different wares and it costs less than the Patagonia it doesn't feel like quite the same quality of a shirt but overall I think it's a good value now speaking of value let's see what we get out of a six dollar shirt how is it even possible to design produce manufacture and distribute a shirt for six dollars it honestly baffles me but the outcome is pretty predictable fit and feel this shirt never fit me as well as the first two shirts did but you can obviously see that it's just a bag your shirt maybe this is to appeal to more people but it's clear that over time the shirt has just lost some of its shape now this shirt isn't ripped or destroyed in any way or dirty but I am not very excited to wear this shirt because of the condition that it's in after only 30 wears and honestly this shirt was starting to look used after about 20 wares or so wear and tear even without looking too closely you can tell that this shirt is old it's been worn and you can obviously see that all over the shirt even without looking too closely you can see that there's peeling happening throughout the shirt not just on high rubbing areas there also seems to be some weird discoloration going on around the collar number three cost now for six dollars it's hard to say whether or not it's worth it because it costs less than a burger at McDonalds I mean I guess with that in consideration the fact that it lasted even half as long as the others is impressive but like I said at the beginning how does a shirt like this even exist for $6 farmers had to grow crops materials had to be processed designs had to be created final products shipped delivered marketed and then sold to you for $6 now this is really where price starts to come into play because these shirts not only reflect the quality of the products themselves but the values that the companies that made them try to uphold except for like dolce gabbana and supreme and all that other crap you're literally just paying for the brand name in those cases so I realized while I was editing this video that you can really tell the differences between these shirts super well so I thought I would add in another test to illustrate the differences between these shirts that no one could possibly deny a blindfold taste test well no not at eight like a feel a field test you're gonna get blindfolded now okay go upstairs good there's the stairs wow you're really good at walking blindfolded holy smokes god I wish there was a cooler surprise then here's the first one okay second one okay okay yes here's the stretch test some give the bottom doesn't feel very nice though this feels kind of Pilli it doesn't have as much give still stretchy this one has more stretch than the last one but I don't know if it has as much stretch this one's the most stretchy this is the gorge one this is ever lame this is Patagonia no how did you do that they feel different this one feels kind of chilly in a bit rough okay this one feels this one almost feels a bit like creamier butter people know what I mean and this one's like an in-between I got a right though yeah that's really good those awesome I found that super interesting because without being able to see what she was touching Leah somehow managed to pick them all right I mean I'm not staging this I definitely could have but it didn't somehow she picked exactly the right ones based on yeah can I wear it yeah sure if you want alrights mine now so what's the difference between a 50 a 30 and a $6 t-shirt the companies that created them I chose these three companies very specifically for this challenge because they represent the spread of fashion options available to most consumers we have Patagonia which is a known social and environmental advocate ever Lane which has marketed themselves as an environmentally responsible company but they're not and Gorge that basically couldn't give a about the state of the earth now I've got to be really honest I was super nervous about this challenge because I was mortified that my fifty dollar Patagonia t-shirt was going to be basically the same as a six dollar equivalent unfortunately that's not the case now as you know I'm probably biased I think the Patagonia is an outstanding company because there are very few companies of its size in the fashion industry that have done as much as they have for the sake of people and the planet but right now we're going to talk about this shirt specifically it is the only one out of the three that uses fair trade sewing practices that means that the people who made this shirt likely made a fair wage for the country that they live in they're also the only one that makes all of their t-shirts out of organic cotton a material that is far better for the planet but this shirt is also a Patagonia t-shirt and I bought it three years ago and it's still in pretty awesome condition ever lain actually makes a pretty good t-shirt which I was resentfully happy to see unfortunately their claims of radical transparency greatly mislead a lot of people into thinking that they're more sustainable than they are instead of third party certification through Fairtrade sewing they simply link you to the place where your garment was made but unfortunately none of this can be confirmed because unlike Patagonia they are not a register B corporation but this is not a takedown video about ever Lane I already made that video but all in all I would say that you're paying in part for a slightly higher quality product but also for the idea that you're supporting an ethical clothing company I really wanted to like ever Lane and finally George the crown jewel of the fast fashion industry imagine all of the horror stories that you've heard about fast fashion and that's this puppy right here unfortunately this has become normal unfortunately we kind of proved that you get what you pay for a $6 shirt doesn't last very long so obviously I would love for us all to just buy those really expensive Patagonia shirts because they are the ones that are making a fashion model that works for us and the planet but I understand that not everybody can spring for a $50 t-shirt personally I own a number of Patagonia shirts but I bought them over a period of time I purchased them when I had the means to and when I could find them on sale the beauty of Patagonia and higher quality brands is that if you can find them used they're probably still going to be in very good condition for exactly the reasons that we just outlined here today but the best option is always to find secondhand clothing if you can and support the environmentally focused companies that are out there if that isn't available but I want to thank you for watching this video I don't want to hear your feedback I'm going to be making more videos where I do experiments and challenges to test different environmental practices and so if you have any suggestions please leave them down in the comments below and of course if you want to support this channel please consider joining us over on patreon these videos take

back welcome back so today we are going to be going over how to sublimate on white glitter vinyl so i'm really really excited today i have two projects i'm going to be doing i'm going to be printing this out on a square image and i'm going to be printing this image out on a circle so i'm going to show you two different ways to do it um the circle my best friend wants me to make this for her so i literally made this design myself for her and i'm using a circle template i'm going to use white vinyls white glitter vinyl and what i'm going to do is i'm going to print this out in silhouette because i'm in silhouette studio so i'm going to print this out in silhouette at 9.336 inches around and then i'm going to print the circle and glitter out a little bit above it now typically you put the image larger than the glitter but i'm going to do this one is going to be smaller because it doesn't really matter now i'ma show you how it matters when i do the other image i'm going to do so i printed this out in silhouette studio and then in cricut i'm going to show you how i printed this we are in cricut design space and i'm printing this circle at 9.5 and that's what it is all the way around now honestly it didn't matter because the background is white and the blue and the glitter is white so i could have made it the exact same size larger smaller etc but i i put it on top of each other i put the image here now you know you can't print out actual print and cut designs out larger in cricut so what i did was i put it inside of here so i could see how the image would be when i printed it out and i wanted it smaller versus larger with the circle because i'm gonna have to cut the circle around because i do have a cameo but i haven't set it up yet so i don't um know how to use it so i don't want to make it larger and then my outside circle is off i made it smaller so i'm going to hand cut around my circle and if it's off it's not going to matter because it's going to be inside of the glitter i hope that makes sense so that's why i made it different so this is going to be my first design i'm going to do when you do this you want to make sure that you heat your shirts up a little bit it gets any type of moisture out so i heat my shirt up as well as i use a lint brush so i want to make sure everything is going to be nice and smooth on there okay so that's what i do so i'm going to show you typically we use the lint roller to get any type of lint or dust or anything off of the shirt and then we typically you can use a teflon or butcher paper if you want but i know nothing's on my pad so i'm just heating up my shirt and what this does is it one gets the wrinkles out and then two it takes out any absorption any moisture anything like that some people do some people don't i typically do depending on the shirt how i want the images and things to stick so there's a good lint roller and then we have go ahead and get that out so that's how we do that once we do that i'm going to go ahead and um put the vine the glitter the white glitter vinyl on top of the shirts so i have two black shirts i'm going to be using i'm going to use white glitter vinyl on both one is going to be a circle one is going to be a square okay now for the second image i got this image off of google i'm not going to be selling this this is just for tutorial purposes but this is good old nipsy hustle if anyone knows me they know i love nipsey i'm so devastated about his passing i just continue to grieve which is so weird but i'm just like hurt anywho so this is um an artwork that is done outside of the marathon clothing nipsey hustle as you can see victory that it is so dope so i'm so excited to do this image now for this image this is how you typically do all of your cover up vinyl i'm sorry all of your layer glitter white vinyl with an image you want to make sure that the image is a little bit bigger than the vinyl and the reason you want to do that is because i'm using white vinyl this picture is not white like my other image so i wanted to cover up as much of the white vinyl as possible so it can look smooth and clear and crisp okay so for this image the um inches are 9.435 and height and 9.59 inches in width okay so that's what i'm doing for the image and i'm going to show you once again we're in silhouette studio because this is the only one that can print this large and then for um for the actual white glitter vinyl we can print out of cricut so i'm going to show you what that looks like okay so i'm inputting the image inside of cricket i'm saving it as a print and cut image and then i'm going to go ahead and upload the image and it's going to take a minute okay so i'm going to unlock the image when you unlock the image it lets you change it to the size that you want so if you remember in silhouette it is 9.435 in height or we can just type it at the top 9.435 and then with it is 9.594 so i'm going to press enter and then it's going to change the image so now we can actually put the image on top of each other to see exactly how much space is going to be so i technically could make my um image either a little bit bigger or i could make my vinyl a little bit smaller so you can do this so you can know for sure i'm not sorry i'm not showing you you can do this so you can know for sure so i think i'm going to make my glitter behind the image a little bit smaller because i want to make sure it covers it up a hundred percent completely okay so the picture can be a little bit larger we're gonna lock and load it and then that's we're gonna do so i'm gonna just cut a little bit of my vinyl off the glitter vinyl off so that it can be a little bit smaller than the actual photo okay so that's how you could always check it but as you know in cricut it will not print because it's too um because it's too large okay but we will print it out in silhouette alright so i'm gonna go ahead and start putting the glitter on the shirts and then i'm going to go ahead and then sublimate on top of the white glitter vinyl now i've used several different brands so it doesn't matter scissor is a great brand i always use that one a lot um i've tried other brands that i needed i tried cricut when i was like in a jam um i've tried other brands and they all seem to work for me but i believe scissor is the best brand um there is another brand i really like and i i have to find what the name of that is but yep so i'm going to go ahead press the glitter down and then i'm going to sublimate on top of that if you have any questions comments any easier tips anything please let me know okay so i have this it's like i create ruler by tam sweet life so if you wanted you could go to tamsuitelife.com um or follow her on ig by tam's sweet life that's i'll put it in the comments says b y t a m s s w e e t l i f e anywho so i use that to make sure it's perfect and because i'm a little bit ocd i also use this t ruler just to make sure that each side is exactly where it needs to be now each image will be a little bit different um and each size of the shirts may be a little bit different so this is a circle so it's a little bit different anywho i'm going to go ahead and press this on um yeah so i told you i have uh yet learned how to use my cameo so i'm literally oh the vinyls on the shirt it's nice and pretty so i'm learning how to um i haven't learned how to use my cameo so i'm going to just cut around the circle and that's why i gave it some wiggle room because i'm like i don't want to mess this up for my best friend but i don't know how to cut it out of pricking it so i'm just cutting it around and then i'm going to lay it on top and she's going to have her shirt that she wanted the other shirt is going to be a little bit different because it's square so squares i have a paper cutter that i could use to do that i mean or i could use it by hand as well but that's that thank you no i don't like it so i'm going to make it bigger so i'm printing out of my workforce epson workforce epson 72 i'm sorry printed out of my work for 7720 series popping colors cassette 2 that's my preset and i'm printing it out you should hear it in the background if you want to know what my presets are you can watch my how to sublime beginners video you can watch that again if you guys want me to i can make another one but i've already made it so it's kind of like i don't want to be redundant keep repeating myself so go ahead and watch that but i'm printing it out because i needed it to be a little bit larger so i printed it out this one is a little bit better but honestly i could have used more space i'm also noticing if you haven't noticed your um designs and cricut and this silhouette don't match up so my inches i've noticed they don't match up i know someone previously told me in my comments to make sure that um i think she said something like tapering off the image or something something like that but i have to look that up a little bit more to figure out what it is i have to do to make sure that the designs line up but this will work because it's literally just going to be glitter all around it so it's not going to matter but for my other image i'm going to have to make sure that it's perfect like i need it to be perfect like i needed to be but this one is perfectly fine for right now because it's just going to be white glitter around it and i already told her how the image would be and she agreed so that's not a problem at all so yeah so we're going to go ahead and take this down and i'm going to put it on 400 for 60 seconds that's what i'm going to sew now here i'm just measuring everything from the top making sure that everything is going to be the correct amount of inches from the top and the bottom that i want it to be so you could play around with it i'm like i said a perfectionist so when i do things i want to be as close as perfect as possible even though i am hand making it and human error you know but i try to make things okay so i use a sub paper as you can see and i use cosmos oh yeah okay so there we go i have it on 400 degrees for 60 seconds and this is the image that i created for my best friend well my boss friend that's what we call each other all right so that's how it looks now i'm going to do my second image on the square inch but it looks good i hope she like so i'm literally just cutting a little bit of it off so that i can have a little bit more of this overlapping the vinyl so i want to have the picture a little bit bigger than the vinyl so i'm taking just a little bit off so that it can overlap it a little bit so i'm taking it off on both sides the width and the height just a little bit okay so i've always been a person who i can eyeball things and look at things and know exactly how much to take off i don't know how i don't know if it's the photographer in me but i can look at things and see if they're like crooked or fix things just visually so i don't know how much i took off i just eyeballed it okay so now before i even put it on a shirt i see that it's a little bit overlapping and that's what i need because i don't want to see any of the white vinyl and excuse my niece in the background baby sitting in my knee so my daughter and is playing with my niece so that's what you hear in the background so anywho this is going to be perfect so now i'm going to press this on the shirt and then i'm going to press sub this one you see i got my ring light i got my ring light i have my [Music] tammysuitelife.com create ruler and i have my t ruler so i'm making sure that this is correctly in the middle so that it won't have any issues or problems and now i can go ahead press it and then i'll sub on top and yes i do use heat tape this tape is from amazon it came in a two pack um and this yellow is never transferred on anything of mine i've heard people say that it's transferred so until it does i'm gonna keep using it i may try a clear one they have blue ones they have all types but this is the one that i use and i've never had any issues from amazon so gonna go ahead and press it down now for real okay so here's something that i noticed depending on the brand of um white glitter that you'll be using it may have like this has little like lines in it it's not a bad thing it's not going to mess my images up but i did notice that so if you can see you see that it's like lines so that's going to come up in the image so that's okay so that's what i said you may want to play around this is not scissor brand i honestly have to look and see my friends tell me to try this brand out so i'm trying to get out my home girl hey girl tell me to try it out so i'm trying it out and um so it's not scissor i have to see what the name of it is but it has a little line so the image is gonna have those little lines but like i said that's perfectly okay i'm trying to think of other things i may have missed previously things i'm trying so if you can't see the entire image what i'm doing is i apologize but i'm just going the sides and making sure that it's overlapping on all four corners so that there won't be any white hopefully around the sides you don't want to see any of the white glitter because it's a color image so i'm just making sure that it's overlapping and the ink will get on the black but it's okay because it's blue and then hopefully it won't hopefully it may come out because that's not polyester so it shouldn't be an issue okay so i'm going to take this down sup i'm doing the glitt white glitter at the 3 30 for 15 seconds i'm on the heat press and then this i'm summing at 400 for 60 seconds okay so as i always say it's always more than one way to skin a cat this is how i tape it down i want to make sure all of my corners are taped down so that it can make sure that it absorbs and all of the white glitter i literally lifted each side up made sure that it was a little bit over the edge of each of the sides so i'm feeling really confident about it and i'm going to go ahead and sub it now like i said at 400 degrees for 60 seconds if you guys have any other tips or tricks please share thank y'all for sharing some of y'all are hitting me up on facebook instagram some of you guys are um commenting under my videos let me go check these babies out yeah so i got this nifty little thing from amazon it's by bryco goods and what this is is it holds my um butcher paper and then i can tear it off it would normally press this for 60 seconds at 400. right i have to loosen the tape up a little bit it's hot but i cannot wait to see this finished product i loosened up some of this tape and i'm gonna look and see oh yeah it's literally perfect and i don't say things that perfect [Music] i did so good guys i'm so happy because i'm like i'm doing the tutorial and i hope it'll come out right [Music] and then oh you got all that ink off here baby yes it's acer paper 125 grams cosmo ink on top of white glitter vinyl so yeah so here's the finished product i told you i used asa paper cosmo ink white glitter vinyl i hope you guys enjoyed it i hope it made sense if you guys have any questions comments concerns please go ahead and let me know if you want me to go over anything else let me know that as well but um if you know any other tips or tricks please share for everybody in the comments as well as for myself i love hearing all the things you guys have been sharing with me thank you so much bye thank you for your time please like share and subscribe

key considerations\nto keep in mind so that you can make the right choice for your business although i know there are a lot more\napparel decoration methods that involve printing out there i wanted to\nspecifically cover these two types of printing methods\nbecause both of these methods can be done on the ricoma r550\nwhite toner transfer printer okay so before we jump right in if you're here\nfor the first time or you're new to this channel\nmake sure to smash that subscribe button to keep up to date with the latest\nvideos that come out we post every single week\nalso make sure to give a quick thumbs up to this video if you like content just\nlike this so as i said before i'm going to break\ndown the key differences and considerations for these two types of\nprinting methods but before we get into that i want to\nfirst give a quick intro on what heat transfer printing actually\nis now when we talk about heat transfer printing\nwe're talking specifically about a two-step method so what do those two\nsteps actually involve so step number one in this two-step heat transfer\nprinting method is actually printing a design onto a\ntransparent sheet of transfer paper then in step two\nyou actually transfer that design that was printed on\nthat transfer paper onto an adhesive paper using a heat\npress finally you peel away the adhesive sheet from the transfer\nsheet and then you press the design onto the substrate such as a piece of\ngarment using a heat press after pressing the garment you then peel\naway the actual paper and you're left with a design that's\ntransferred onto the garment itself the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer\nuses this very two-step heat transfer method\nto apply designs onto various light and dark color garments even onto\nhard surfaces such as wood aluminum or even metal if\nyou're interested to learn more about white toner transfer printing and\nspecifically about the ricoma r550 white toner transfer printer packages\ngo ahead and click the link in the description below and check them out\nthere so now that we cover what is a two-step\nheat transfer printing system let's cover what is sublimation printing\nso sublimation printing involves a similar process where you're\nprinting the design onto regular copy paper or specialty\nsublimation paper and then using heat via a heat press to\ntransfer that printed design onto a substrate such as a piece of\ngarment the key difference lies in how sublimation works and the science behind\nit during sublimation when the actual\nprinted design is heated via a heat press\nthe toner on the transfer paper itself actually turns from\na solid state into a gas state and then it embeds itself\ninto the fabric when it cools it actually goes back to being installed\nand then becomes a permanent part of the fabric that means\nunlike a two-step heat transfer printing method sublimation actually adds no\nadditional layer of paper on top of the fabric and you\ncan't feel the difference of the printed image and the rest of the\nfabric okay now that we've covered what these two methods actually are\nlet's go into some key differences and considerations between these two methods\nthe first topic that we're going to cover between these two methods is\ndurability and feel as i briefly mentioned before sublimation does not\nadd an extra layer on top of your fabric versus a two-step heat transfer printing\nmethod actually leaves a thin layer on top of your fabric\nso the feel is going to be much different so right off the bat you will\nfeel a difference between the printed design using these two\nmethods now in terms of durability with a heat transfer printed design\nit can last about 30 to 40 washes depending on how large your design is\nand how it's actually being washed now on the other hand with sublimation\nbecause the ink or the toner is actually infused inside the fabric and becomes a\npart of the fabric it is a much more permanent design onto\nthe fabric and it can withstand a lot more washes\nin fact most sublimated designs will last just as\nlong as the actual fabric itself because\nyou're not leaving an extra layer of transfer on top of the fabric\nyou're not going to see any cracking after washes and the image is much\nless likely to fade with sublimation so in this category of durability and feel\nit is pretty clear that sublimation wins out in this category because\nit can last a lot longer and you don't feel the actual transfer\nimage on top of the garment alright the second item to consider\nbetween sublimation printing and heat transfer printing\nis the variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto\nwith sublimation printing you are much more limited in\nthe variety of substrates that you can transfer images onto this is because\nsublimation can only adhere to polyester coated materials\neven if you use something that is 60 polyester\nand 40 cotton which is really about the minimum amount of polyester\nthat you need in order to make sublimation work in that 60 40\npoly cotton blend you're not going to get as much vibrancy\nin your transfer design versus 100 polyester\nwith sublimation you also have to use only\nwhite colored substrates or very light colored substrates that means you can't\nuse sublimation on a black t-shirt or a dark mug\nbecause the actual design won't show on the other hand\nwith white toner heat transfer printing you can actually print on light\nand dark colored garments and you're not limited to anything with polyester only\nin fact with heat transfer printing you can heat transfer onto\ncotton onto polyester even ceramic and other hard surfaces like wood and\nmetal and therefore in this category of variety of substrates you can\ntransfer onto heat transfer definitely wins out in\nthis one because of the variety of things that you can do finally let's\ngo into the category of the quality of the colors you can print\nusing these two methods first off sublimation allows you to print full\ncolors and this can be super helpful when\ntrying to sublimate a photo for example or doing a particular job for a customer\nthat requires a very specific color such as one for a company logo you can\nalso achieve sharp vibrant designs using heat\ntransfer paper if you're printing your design\nusing a white toner transfer system such as the ricoma r550 so it really is a\nvirtual tie in this category between sublimation and\nheat transfer printing because you can achieve\nfull color vibrant designs with either method the real difference lies\nin the durability and the feel of either method\nalso the variety of substrates that you can transfer onto but fortunately you\ncan achieve the best of both worlds using a white toner transfer printing\nsystem such as the one that we have here at ricoma the ricoma r550\ni kind of alluded to this briefly in the beginning of the episode\nin that you can achieve sublimation and heat transfer using heat transfer paper\nwith the ricoma r550 and that's because you can actually swap out\none of the toner cartridges in the r550 with a specialty sublimation\ntoner cartridge so in conclusion guys both printing methods\ninvolve a similar process but yield very different results\nhowever in sublimation printing the ink or toner actually permeates\nthroughout the fabric and becomes part of the fabric itself in\ntwo-step heat transfer printing on the other hand the image simply becomes\nanother layer on top of the substrate thankfully the\nricoma r550 white toner transfer printing system\ncan achieve either method simply by swapping out\nthe toner cartridge so make sure you keep these considerations in mind\nwhen deciding which method to use to fulfill the needs of your customers\nat the end of the day it really depends on what your customer is looking for the\ntype of material they're looking to get printed on and that will drive your\ndecision on what is best for your customers\nlike i mentioned before if you're looking to get started in the heat\ntransfer printing business or you're looking to add on to your existing\napparel decoration

guys we're going to switch gears a bit and we're going to talk about actually sublimation transfers i've been wanting to do a video on how to actually apply the sublimation transfers to a shirt and so i figured this is as good a time as any right okay so few things to know about sublimation okay sublimation is uh dye sublimation is basically just that you're dying fabric um with these uh sublimation transfers okay so one thing to be aware is sublimation does not print white so if you like you see this white right here that's going to be whatever color your shirt is okay so the other thing is you can't dye dark objects lighter you can only dye things darker so that's why it's important for sublimation to use a white or a very light colored shirt because if you put black on a black shirt you're not going to see it if you have pink on a black shirt you're not going to see it so you have to use light or or white as best but white or very light colored shirts as far as um a little bit darker colored shirts if you wanted to do like maybe a like a blue jean color or something like that you can do that but it's best to do that with an all black sublimation transfer black's one of the only colors that you can kind of still see on a darker shirt as long as it's not darker than the black so hopefully that answers some questions about that that's one of the biggest questions we get is why can't you do sublimation on dark shirts it's just because you can't see it so even if the the dye is transferring to it you won't see it on a dark shirt but you will see it on a white or a very light colored shirt the other thing to be aware of for sublimation is sublimation dyes only adhere to polyester fibers so what happens is when the dyes get heated up heat it up it actually infuses into the polyester so the more polyester content that you have in your shirt or um whatever you're pressing the brighter and bolder the colors are so if you have like a 50 polyester shirt with 50 cotton it's not gonna stick to the cotton but it will stick to the polyester so it'll be like a faded look so that's another thing to keep in mind the higher the polyester count in your fabric the brighter and bolder the colors will be another thing about sublimation is before you press it the colors are going to look really muted especially like blues and mints turquoise those colors will look completely different after you press it's weird so don't freak out whenever you print out your sublimation if you're doing it at home or even if you order one and it looks completely different it changes once it's heated it gets a lot more bolder brighter vivid and the blues and greens those change a lot so hopefully that answers a few questions okay oh another thing for sublimation you want to use a heat press or you can use the easy press 2 because you need 400 degrees fahrenheit and iron will not work unless you're doing like a little bitty tiny thing because you don't want to move it around at all when you press it you want to keep it like and not move it like it's got to stay still so easy press 2 will work because it does get hot enough or heat press is definitely definitely recommended iron and sublimation just do not mix okay so here are some other tips and tricks okay sublimation will go through your shirt okay so you always want to put something in between your shirt or you want to actually thread your shirt onto your press rather than just putting this on here like this pressing it because you're going to see this mama bear transfer all the way through to the back especially for thin shirts so anytime you're using sublimation you always want to protect your press with protective paper and then you always want to protect the inside of your shirt if you're not threading it through so for this one when i say threading it through i just mean opening the shirt and putting it on your press where only one layer of the shirt is on there that's always the ideal way to press if you can because then you don't have any seams messing you up or anything like that so this would be considered a threaded shirt all right so we're going to go ahead and put our shirt on here i'm going to move it to where the collar is not actually on the press anytime you're pressing it's always good to not have the collars or the seams on the press because anything like that can make it where your shirt isn't getting full pressure okay this is a bella canvas let me see this is a bella canvas shirt and it is i want to say 50 polyester 65 actually 65 polyester you want to have at least 50 but like i said the higher the polyester count the bolder and brighter these colors will be all right so we got our shirt on there we have our protective paper right now i'm just going to use this teflon sheet just to do a quick pre-press to get any moisture out of it all right remove that now here's another thing to be aware of for sublimation you'll notice that it's on this square okay now lighter colored shirts usually won't happen but if you're using like a more colored shirt a lot of times if you just put this down and you press it like that you're going to see that square so a good habit to always be in is anytime you're pressing sublimation just loosely cut around your image it just will soften that edge and just make it look a lot nicer another thing is if you're printing your own sublimations or ordering them sometimes whenever it's going through the printer you'll get little bitty dots of ink on the edge if you don't cut those edges off there's a chance that you won't see it and you'll miss it and you'll have like these weird little black lines okay and this does not have to be perfect this is just loosely cutting around so that you can really see where your image is and that you won't have that box around your sublimation okay um let me get one more thing one second okay okay another thing you always want to do before you're pressing a sublimation is use a lint roller and just get any loose fibers or anything like that off your shirt because sometimes if you have some loose fibers or anything like that you'll see these weird little blue and red marks after you press it because we're pressing for a for a full minute for sublimation so any of those little things getting pressed at 400 degrees for a minute can actually change colors and permanently affect your shirt and your outcome okay so we have our shirt ready we have it pre-pressed we have it lint rolled we have our transfer cut out our shirt is at least 50 polyester is 65 so we're gonna put the transfer face down okay so the ink side will be on the shirt now from here you don't want to put a teflon sheet straight on your transfer because what happens is once the ink um gets heated up and turns into a gas and any extra will kind of dissipate so if you use a teflon sheet that extra ink will just kind of sit on your teflon sheet and you'll need to clean your teflon sheet if not you won't notice it until you go to press something else and that ink will actually transfer onto something else so always use some protective paper you can even use um regular like copy paper is totally fine to just put on top okay so we're just gonna put a couple sheets of copy paper on there we're gonna take our teflon sheet and we're gonna cover it all with that okay and we're going to be pressing for 60 seconds at 400 degrees okay and y'all just be careful once this is done it will be hot so just be prepared for that okay once this is done you just want to remove your transfer immediately not let it move and then sit somewhere else or you get like a ghosting all right remove that and that is it so here is our sublimated shirt mama bear this particular design is available on the website as a digital download and it also is available as a ready to press transfer so that is sublimation is super easy it's not just for fabrics you can use it for any polyester coated item so there's tons like there's tumbler cups there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um sublimation for as far as washing this is permanent you can wash it and dry it like normal no issues and it will last a long time the other question i get a lot of times too is can you reuse the transfers they're not really made to be reused but sometimes like a darker transfer like this if you're okay with a much lighter version you can put it on there and press it again it won't be as bold and vibrant as the first one but you will still get some ink transfer but just be aware you know if you don't like it you can't take it off so definitely sublimation is permanent the amazing thing is sublimation it has no feel to it so all it does is it actually changes the color of the fabric so i hope this was helpful you guys we get so many questions about sublimation on the website you can order custom sublimations if you have an image that you want printed or if you have questions on how to print your own you're welcome to message us we can give you some recommendations of some good printers and good machines if you all have any questions please comment down below i will try to answer them as as best as i can to as best of my ability as i can but i hope this video was helpful i appreciate you guys watching don't forget to like and subscribe and i will see you all next time bye", "VSC4aidXSpg": "hi today I'm going to show you how to make a mask without sewing it President Trump said that we could use scarves or other objects for mask like a bandana but today I'm going to show you how to use a hundred percent cotton t-shirt to make a mask without sewing it of course you're gonna want a long-sleeve shirt you'll take and cut the shirt right about the armpit again this doesn't take any sewing go along the side make sure you keep the seam in your cut area I'm gonna lay this flat so it's a little better to work with and you'll have a theme on one side this is an old t-shirt so it's an Allegro flat I've washed it many times I'm not when I wear anymore you want to cut down about six inches on each side just enough to make it tie and then you're gonna cut up from the wrist up again about six inches maybe a little less the spine it depends on how long your t-shirt is but you want to leave here about I'd say six to eight inches in the middle then the next thing you're gonna do is take your shirt your sleeve and tuck in these extra pieces this is going to give you a four actually a six layer cotton cotton shirt that you can turn into a mask so you'll have six layers of a hundred percent cotton now when I'm sewing masks I put two layers on the outside and a hundred percent cotton batting the inside so this will kind of simulate that inside cotton batting so once you tuck all those in just want to lay them flat make sure they're comfortable then you're going to end up with a mess like this you can tie the sides and then this goes around the ears you can cut these extra pieces off let's make sure you fit it to your face then you have a very simple cotton mask that you can put over that's four or six panels thick of 100% cotton", "V7P3WfO8MLU": "okay 100 cotton guilden extra-large okay and i'm gonna print on the back i'm gonna put this cardboard in the shirt so i can spray it first okay so i'm gonna here's my spray my good old milky poly spray and i am going to spray it down oh i forgot my rubber um roller this is a regular cheap cheap um paint roller you want it to you want it to bond to the fiber okay so it's all nice and saturated in normally um we would let this sit overnight but i am not going to do that for the purpose of this video so you see a little yellow and it it will come out okay so we got we got sublimation [Applause] you", "bRLH928lwNg": "[Music] well guys welcome back to another video right so today what we've got is the perfect or white t-shirt trying to find the perfect white t-shirt we've got loads of different brands to go through I've got nine t-shirts in total we've got brands like Ralph Lauren Tommy Hilfiger Thailand's God and then like low-rent brands like bershka a sauce jammie so I'm gonna link all the t-shirts in the description but I thought it'd be interesting to see what the comparison is like from like a six quid t-shirt to a forty five quid t-shirt so we're gonna go in price order this is the lowest going all the way up to the highest and the roll on a size large as well but if you do enjoy the video guys that don't forget to drop it a like subscribe to the channel if you've not already impressed a little bail notification just to keep up to date on all the videos but yeah I start trying them on to see what they're actually like alright so the first teacher we've got is the cheapest one it's from ASOS it's an organic regular fit t-shirt size large like I said so my measurements for reference are six foot two and about 190 pounds which is about 87 kilos alright guys so six pounds estas design organic tea the only problem I have with ASUS t-shirt is you see this shoulder bit hurt on literally every t-shirt it has this wrinkly Creasy bit it's just every kind of t-shirt no matter if it's like slim fit muscle for normal regular fit they always have it it's very strange you need to sort out the designs but apart from that it's actually a very good teacher by the length is good alright the quality the quality is quite nice it's quite nice and thick done for six quid can't really go wrong this the whole of it is quite high as well so it's quite thick it's a bit like a roll neck but I do quite like it it's pretty nice but alright let's move on to the neck Tron all right I second t-shirts from Bershka this is $7.99 and as you can see it's a lot more of a tighter fit so this is definitely kind of like a muscle foot it's got more of a scoop neck so a lot bigger than that a lot wider you can see like collarbones and upper chest and stuff if you go to the gym and you like tighter t-shirts this one could be for you but I don't want teachers this tight anymore this is I think it's like trying too hard you're not I mean like you don't need to wear t-shirts this tight even if you do go to the gym like you just need one that is a nice fit that it's not too tight because like I said it's just like you're trying too hard not about teacher the quality feels nice nice and stretchy which is good just a bit too tight third t-shirts from sulphate clothing at my own brand this one is 12 pounds size large again this for me is basically the perfect fit so it's a nice heavy cotton it's just cotton there's no stretch in it which I do kind of like it's going to shrink a tiny bit in the wash ball not too much I think it's really nice on the arms and the sleeves good length on not too tight but it is fitted it's quite slim fitted minimal Brandon as well I've designed this one so it is a really nice tissues only 12 quid as well but yeah this is my favorite definitely so far this is why I designed it because I've already tried all these on over the years no I mean I'm trying to perfect the t-shirt so if you do not check anything out from sulfa it's gonna be linked in the description make sure you and have a look like really comfy clothes nice fitting get involved fourth t-shirts from Jack and Jones this is actually like a bit of a different material it's like a piec cotton which is what you'd usually get on like a polo shirt it's like a really nice fit you know like the length is good it's nice on the arms it's not too tight it's got a bit of a roll in the sleeves as well I could maybe size up to an XL and it probably like the perfect to fit definitely in somebody that need to size up to an excel because some sizes do definitely run small which is you only really find out from trying stuff on doing you so I hope this video helps you in that sensible yeah it probably size up it's a nice t-shirt fits well in this one is 15 quit what I'll put it on the screen for you anyway so this one says the perfect tea we'll see about that alright so in the color this one says it's the perfect tea and in my opinion is far from it so it's from selected time I think this one is 18 pounds I'll put on the screen anyway it's just way too Thai guys like you see no it's high in this fit it's not ideal at all the cotton feels nice quality book it's too sure when the body as well as really sure and it's just tie everywhere and there's no unlike the birch the one which just stretching it this one doesn't have any stretch either so it's definitely not the perfect see that's why I've made this video I you can get some that let's think of the perfect tea but they're honestly not so I won't go for this at all guys alright so we get n into more for designer brands now this one is Tommy Hilfiger a little minimal logo this one is 22 pounds size large again like I said I think I'd have to size up for this one because the t-shirts run really small and it's really short on my body don't you can't really properly see but if you over six four it's gonna be short on your body and just a bit tied like around the chest shoulders and arm so if I got an XL it would be fine the quality feels okay Ike doesn't feel the best quality and 20 secret Tommy Hilfiger I do really like the minimal brand in the tiny logo I think it does look pretty sick to be honest guys so quite a nice to see it's just a bit as usual alright so as a seventh t-shirt is from a brand called the Lyle and Scott it's got this really nice gold logo on it here v this one is absolutely banded it's really really nice although that's all for clothing one this probably the best fitting one in here I think the quality is really nice as well tell it's like a really nice high quality blend of cotton feels really nice in length spot-on on the body for me it's nice on the arms nicer on the shoulders and chest this is spot on really nice fit it's not too tiny either alright guys the second-to-last t-shirt is from a brand called original penguin it's got a little penguin logo here this one is 25 pounds again it's very similar to the Lions got one book just a bit of a tighter fit so the quality of the cotton feels very similar nice and have the really good quality but it's definitely a bit tighter like around the arms the chest a little bit shorter as well in the body so the Lions got one is just basically a better version of this one so I'd definitely go for the violence got both 25 quid very similar all right guys last but not least we have got one from Ralph Lauren the most expensive one hair thing is one is 45 quid and to be honest it's probably the worst fit here out of all these is the most expensive in it's the worst fear like look how short it is in the body so short at least after un XL is really spike tight and small around the chest and upper body as well the Asians one is about a foot in it's six quid yeah the quality feels nice the logo is really nice the Brandon's good but just make sure you size up if you're going to get one from Ralph Lauren because the size is run really small alright let's do a recap I'll give you my top three of this bunch so guys to recap on all the t-shirts if I was having to pick three out of the whole bunch I'd probably go for a while and Scott sulfa clothing and Jack and Jones than my top three like if you want one that is a little bit more expensive really high quality really nice heavy cotton with a decent fit go for the island spot one really nice pure white color really good quality it's probably last you quite a while to a five quid so she's not even that bad really if you want one that's a little bit cheaper I'll definitely go for sulphate clothing or Jack and Joe just depends on what sort of material you like this is more of like a polo shirt material and then this is like a normal t-shirt material but again 12 quid 15 quid both really nice t-shirts or just size up in this one but this one is true to size so guys that's gonna wrap up the video I hope you found it a little bit helpful if you're in the market to get a whitey - I'm sure this has helped you out a little bit but it's just mad how like it's been for if I put on a t-shirt like from Ralph Lauren and it'd just be such about fit there's no ideal are towards it so definitely size up if you are going to get from Ralph Lauren especially I think that's a custom slim fit but yeah if you don't see more videos like this guys don't forget to drop it a like subscribe to this channel if you've not already and I'm gonna link all the t-shirts in the description thanks for watching I'll catch you on the next one see you later [Music] you", "9Ra1fswSqJE": "hey there in today's video I'm gonna show you how I use my Sawgrass creative studio software I'm going to grab an old file that I do need to press print and press on 100% cotton shirt and most of you already know that sublimation you cannot print on 100% cotton shirts but there are several ways to accomplish that my favorite one is a powder process which I'm going to show you today so I'm gonna go ahead and log on to my Sawgrass software and it's called okay I'm gonna launch it and right now it's gonna it's gonna ask me what blank design I want and I'm just gonna click Next and I'm looking for I'm gonna do a letter size US letter ate nap by 11 next it's always gonna be white sublimation there is no white so you can start with just a blank canvas and I'm gonna be printing a vertical I mean there's that on the vertical image map 11 so I'm going to start my designer I'm gonna go to my designs and I'm gonna pull an old image there's a lot of stuff I've done since I've had this sucker software for three years I guess anyway so it's perfect if I would have added too much white that would have literally see that cut into that so you don't ever want to save an image with too much white up here you know it's not gonna print but still if you covered that that's exactly what's gonna print it's gonna cut that ringside off so I'm not so I don't want it don't know what the gloves too big because it's gonna this is gonna be a crossing chest so I want it maybe maybe five inches right here it tells you it's five by I'm sorry seven by seven right now I want it maybe five inches so that it doesn't look too too big there's a shrink this too much so let's just say about five inches okay so it's five inches squared actually this is gonna be on an excel shirt let's say for next so this is an eight nap I live in print maybe we can be seven inches just go back to other seven inches let's do six and a half up here on the left corner to telling me like what the image size is okay so here's where you see the white those are called bleed lines you don't want to go over or put you don't want your image in there and it's gonna cut off you're literally gonna cut off your image it's kind of a guideline not to go over so let's do that but this is close to the top as possible do you see the bleed lines right here you don't want your image or wording in there and I want to make this as white as possible I'm staying away from the big line if you look up here hopefully you can see it so this is gonna go on an excel shirt just solid white I kind of want to make this bigger but I want this to be across the chest I thought about doing I thought about doing this making this um heat transfer vinyl so that I can make it bigger which I probably should but it's two different processes and for a freebie you don't want to spend too much time on on this process I can make it wider to make it more pronounced again I'm trying to get avoid the bleed lines if you want please comment down below your thoughts I'm just playing around with the I think that would look okay I already have one printed it was my very first one I think I don't remember what happened but somewhere along the line the I mean I didn't place the the image correctly and when you're using powder for your pressing your print on your press you have to be really careful once you place it because once you put it down because it's powder that it's soaking up the ink once you put it down that's it you have to leave it down or it's gonna mess up your humor process I think I want to leave it like that I think that looks looks okay maybe shrink it just a little bit maybe let's make it six inches I'm just trying to imagine what it will look like on an XL shirt normally I would put it that close but again we're working with a freebie right now just for the guys just gonna be using it for boxing boxing shirt okay so let's say we want to Center it I'm gonna highlight both click on object and align Center right so it's a line now so okay now so now what I'm going to do is I've been imprinted on sublimation I'm sorry the powder comes with its own toilet tone paper from SEPs and I'm gonna show you that process now I'm getting ready to print that first I want to show you I put my process my powder in this in this container it's uh it's a one and a half gallon Rubbermaid container and we're gonna have it this big is because I want to be able to fit my paper like at 1111 an 11 inch by 17 inch is the longest either way I want to I want enough room to put the paper in there and I'll show you what I'm going to do they look they did their paper just so that people know which side to print on this one had a little wine on it probably cut that out I'm gonna go ahead and use this I'll just cut that out if I don't need it and I'll show you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and stick this in mind this is my soccer X it's 200 try to face down let me stick them on print the image you do have to select which paper and because it does not give you an option for four steps in a virtuosic creative studio I've been choosing the option of I still select you know sub products and for the paper I just pick a key plot no idea what that is to be honest but it works and I keep it on high quality waiting for it to print I don't need that much powder this is gonna be plenty usually there comes a little baggie like that I don't put it back I just close the seal the literally tightly and I just leave it there until the next time I use it because ink is what if you touch it you're ruined the print so do not touch the ink just be careful and just hang on to it just just grab the edges and avoid touch them to eat I learned the hard way okay so what I'm gonna do you can still wet now grab to eat the paper and just slowly just move the the powder in there grab the ends and I'm just gonna kind of sway back and forth so there's one one time and then I did one last time and that's it I just tap it just like that I also have this little comb brush that I bought just to get any excess powder because you will have to put it under the your heat press for about 30 seconds to secure it so I'm gonna do that process now okay for the temperature settings they have to be 375 Fahrenheit 30 seconds since it's fresh off the press and still wet when you use a piece of parchment paper because there is gonna be powder in the back and that's what the brush silicone brush was for but I went ahead and use my hands just to get any excess out and I'm just gonna set it down I'm waiting for the temperature to get to three seventy-five once that's once I've reached that temperature I mean just let it hover over the image and just let it cure for 30 seconds and then from there I'm going to show you the the pressing process I didn't mention you have to use moderate pressure and it is for 30 seconds once you've done that you have to it's a cold pill so you have to wait about 40 seconds before you remove the transfer so I wanted to add that really quick before I forget this shirt appears a medium-sized shirt this was the very first shirt I print a while back I mean it's then it has been a good maybe a couple years and I can't see it and I want to take this shirt off but I have this as my sample for evening for showing people the sublimation to cutting process which is this powder process I somehow didn't place it correctly and it's it's kind of off in some areas but here didn't pick up the ink and that's why I decided to just keep this I used a sharpie pick just for so looking for display I don't know if you can see about you'll be able to see once I show you now use a sharpie see the black mark I just did that because I wanted to keep it for Show and Tell for sublimation to patent that's why I still have this plus it looks good I mean it's good to have shirts for your process for show-and-tell not what people can see the different processes that you know I would turn the camera but I don't want to have to I'm using the octopus one and I won't have to readjust it but eventually I'll show you all the shirts that I have them hanging on the walls that I use a show and tell the pressure is already at 6:56 362 which that's hot enough so for now I'm just gonna go ahead and cure my in so again it has to hover for about 30 seconds to let it cure and all it's doing is just keeping the moisture it's removing moisture and it's also curing the ink with the powder and you can feel it you can't feel it it really just feels like heat transfer vinyl okay that's about 30 seconds I didn't really count maybe about five more seconds okay so it's out don't touch it I wish I had a handle to do this I'll bring it in close I don't know if you can see it but it's kind of got a like a velvety kind of look to it I would say feel but you can't feel it but he's got a velvety look to it and if you remember a little while ago I mentioned that it had a little smudge or something on I'm gonna go to cut that out I don't want that to end up on my shirt so I'm just gonna cut it out and I'm fixing to I'm fixing to go ahead and take the moisture out of my t-shirt these are white of course this I'm gonna go into these my lint roller you still have to be careful not to touch touch the the image same thing [Music] try not to be camera I'm using a Hanes t-shirt turn it to the camera too much it's gonna move the moisture out of the t-shirt my my my tripod broke my big one my 50 inch tripod it broke got the pressure too hard I'm gonna go ahead and find my center line I'm gonna fold it in half vertically just suck and create my center line my image and I do have this and one of my videos how to find your center line has a kink in there and trying to get out I don't want that I want to get him as far as possible like I did something wrong sorry I know I'm off-camera just trying to find my centerline doesn't let me take this long and also when I look at when I'm you trying to find my centerline the caller when we slowed it in half you can feel the caller I always put the collar off of the edge of the heat press only because I don't want the I don't want the collar imprinted on the on the [Music] on the other side of the shirt if that makes any sense okay that's good for now just going to apply the pressure line to close it just to avoid the camera being so shaky okay now on you can't you can't find the you can't bend it like you normally would he transfer vinyl there you know you pinch the top and the bottom but you can't do it on these because you know you don't want to ruin the the image because it's powdered so what I've been doing there's my centerline look you can see it there you go there's my centerline and again this is an XL shirt I'm gonna do four inches I'm just gonna put a little indention with my nail and I'm gonna get the color off the press or the Putney so what I do because this is I know this is eight at eight and a half by eleven I just find the four and a half inch mark with my ruler or my tape measure normally what I do and I do this way before time I just get it like an exact don't know if you can't use a pen or marker of course you don't want that on his shirt I just he's a either an exacto knife or I'll just mark it with the scissors I know it seems like a lot of different steps but for me it's worth it I'm just gonna make a little make a little mark with my scissors again the wrong reason I'm doing that is because I don't want to touch it and I'm just gonna make little Mark's and just to show you my markers right there my scissor mark so four and a half inches plus another one of inches actually I'm more fiction is I don't wanna to off okay so right there right there right doesn't have to be perfect but that's just me okay and the reason you want to do this is because it's powder once you put it down that's it there's no turning back but regardless I still love this process because I'm able to print on one or any cotton-blend shirt okay so I've got my mark I'm gonna line these up with the center line that I created okay so once they're fine cinnamon I just drop it very carefully and I do use um parchment paper for this for sublimation you do not want to use Teflon sheets because it will pick up any of the ink and I will you will transfer that to your next substrate so I always use parchment paper when I'm working with sublimation okay so we're gonna do 30 seconds and then we have to wait 40 seconds before we can remove the transfer to the transfer paper so we have about seven seconds left if you want to share what process you use for sublimation please drop that below so we can share information maybe I can give you some tips that you have any questions please feel free to drop your questions down below you have to wait 40 seconds I'm not gonna need this because that's the cup steps instructions I'm gonna wait about 40 seconds turn it's been 40 seconds and it is Coquille I hope you can see this I want to call the image when I press it one more time just so I can remove these lines this is a civil mission - cotton okay I hope this video was helpful feel free to ask questions and I look forward to

supplement on a hundred percent white cotton shirt so i got this polyester from lowe's and it was 17 so right now i'm pouring in one cup of warm water and i'm going to add in uh some of this poly acrylic stuff i have these cups that i got from dollar tree and they are two ounces i had already shake it shook it and mixed it up and right now i'm just mixing it up again and you know just doing what i got so i poured it in the bottle i pulled a little over two ounces in there and i'm going to put the top on it when i can find it and shake it up [Music] [Music] so right here i'm showing you that it is a 100 cotton shirt and it is white and this right here is just a piece of board a piece of um it was a shipping box from united states post service which are free and i just hold it up and put it in there so that's the spray and i'm just spraying it on there just to get it you know a little damp not too damp and i'm showing you the time it is 1203 and when i put it on there and when i came back to put it on there it was 12 i think like 12 26 i forgot to record the time i thought i was recording but i wasn't so right now i'm just preheating the shirt and to get all the moisture out [Music] [Music] right now i'm just waiting for the picture to finish printing off the machine up there it goes and i'm gonna cut around it at first i wasn't but then i changed my mind and started cutting um [Music] and so now i'm just putting it on the press for 60 seconds and we are gonna see what's gonna happen and i'm also tripping on my kids because you know they're my babies all right now here is the big reveal we're gonna swing the arm back and see what happens as you can see i only put two sheets of paper and it's just regular white coffee paper i should have put more but i didn't and as you can see it went through both of the sheets of paper so next time i will probably use butcher paper instead of just plain white cotton paper and let's pull it off and voila this is what you get you guys i'm like super super duper excited and i am in love with the colors and how they popped on this shirt it it just amazes me how it looks and so i'm also going to show you another shirt that i did same process but without that spray that i made same paper same everything same heat press same uh box in this shirt and everything and you'll see how those colors are dull on that shirt but it did work on it but just not as much as the one that popped thank you all so much for watching make sure you subscribe to my channel for more videos i will be doing more crafts and i'm also

really can turn my day upside down but why does this happen let's get into it [Music] hey guys it's Melissa a shirt space so the shrinkage in the tee can be caused by a couple of things first it could be the way you wash it but the second can be if a shirt is preshrunk or not so let's get into that what does preshrunk actually mean the term preshrunk mostly speaks for itself but there are a few factors to be aware of so I took notes to make sure I get this right preshrunk doesn't necessarily mean that the t-shirt manufacturer washes every single garment instead it refers to the garment being put through a machine that pushes or compacts the fibers tightly together this process condenses the fabric by removing the spaces in between the stitches as a way of replicating the shrinking process in doing this the garment has been pre shrunk and will shrink less when being put through the traditional washing and drying process now let's be real I couldn't have memorized all of that point number two having a pre shrunk shirt doesn't always mean the shirt won't shrink further most fabric will shrink on average three to seven percent so you won't typically notice but there will always be some additional minimal shrinkage to be where bottom line is preshrunk implies that the shirt will no longer string but what is actually the case is it will just reduce the amount of shrinkage thank you guys so much for stopping by to learn more about preshrunk if you want more industry knowledge or helpful tips click that subscribe button turn on those notifications and have a great day do you

no idea because you're not following us", "Kw5NZnJeOBM": "[Music] do [Music] hello guys welcome back to my channel this is my sugary lovecraft and today i'm going to be doing a test uh with dye sublimation ink i'm also um going to be testing it on not 100 polyester but 65 cotton 40 polyester and then what i'm also going to be doing is i'm going to be testing it out on three different types of paper i'm going to be testing it out on 20 pound paper and of course you know like i said i printed it with the dye sublimation ink i'm going to be print i printed out also on the sublimation paper as well as you can see tell the difference and i've also printed it out on 28 pound laser paper now this should not be working according to um you know what they say about sublimation ink um they should not be able to transfer to cotton shirts without adding or removing the coating with a certain type of um formula but let's try it out let's see what's going to happen um i've already heated up my um piece of material like i said it's only 65 cotton 40 polyester i'm gonna put a sheet of paper underneath just because like i said i'm just doing a test and i don't want it to bleed through because i'm not sure what it's going to happen so this is live i'm going to put this sublimation shout out to my jamaican family now it's mirrored so that's why i can't tell what it really says um so i'm gonna put the sublimation paper at the top then we have the 20 pound below 28 pound below and then followed by the 20 pound all right um i've already heated up my shirt but you know what let me heat it up again just to make sure to take that moist just out double check and i'm just gonna heat it up for a little bit all right um let me go ahead and place these back on there exactly in the same order that i talked about and what i'm going to do is i'm going to tape it down just so that it won't shift or move of course i didn't line it up you know real neat because that's not the purpose the purpose is to see if it's true that only the sublimation ink is going to i mean the sublimation paper is going to transfer to the material and also to test to see if it does work on not 100 polyester all right i don't know i just don't like polyester shirts they just look shiny to me but let's see why not let's try it out all right and i'm also going to take some black sheets of paper um and put it on the top as you can see i've already have my teflon sheet on the top here so i'm gonna still use just in case it's gonna bleach okay all right here we go i'm gonna be putting it down for 60 seconds now according to um like i said um it's stated that you cannot use um the dye sublimation on cut on cotton it should only be on polyester and that it has a special coating that releases the ink into the shirt um of course the other two paper that i have which is a 28 pound and the 20 pound copy paper um they don't have any special coding so let's see first of all it should be blank when we lift this up because apparently it shouldn't be working on cotton right or not blank but it should be totally faded um on all three so let's see what happens so as you can see the ink so i'm glad that i did put something over it the date the ink did come through on the 20 pound paper it didn't come through that much just a little bit on the 28 pound paper and of course nothing on the sublimation so let's go ahead and kind of take it off wow looky here [Music] wow so i honestly i'm not buying any more from sublimation paper i could buy a pack of 20 pound paper 20 pound paper and make a brighter color i'm like look at it it is i mean awesome i mean even on the the 28 pound itches it is much brighter than the sublimation paper that i paid 17 for wow and like i said it's not 100 cotton it's um 65 it's not 100 polyester 65 cotton 40 polyester um i cut it from this shirt and i'm just going to show you exactly what it says 60 60 cotton 40 polyester and guys as you can see so for those of you guys who are out there doing um dye sublimation just make sure you test it out because this is awesome i love it once again thank you for watching my channel this is miss sugee lovecraft

Today we're talking about the American Apparel\n2001 ring spun cotton t-shirt. Now, it's super soft, fitted -- this is basically\nthe t-shirt that started the whole soft t-shirt revolution. So instead of just telling you about it though,\nwe have a model here who is going to come over and show it off. Now, this is the unisex 2001. Awesome fitting -- it has a seam on the side\nhere, so basically it's more tailored. 100% ring spun cotton means that it's going\nto be very soft. What do you think of this shirt? I love it! It's great shirt, it's really comfortable,\nit's form-fitting but it's not too tight. He said it better than I did. And in a lot less time. So if you're looking to order this t-shirt\nask your coedmonkey order rep about vintage ink. It's a thinner coat of ink and basically it\nmeans that your shirt is not going to be weighed down bt a lot of ink. But here's the thing: when you order the American\nApparel 100 cotton ring spun t-shirt, you're going to instantly feel the difference and\nyou're never going to go back to a regular 100% cotton t-shirt. So check it out today: coedmonkey.com.", "UlpTQ5PtVWg": "what's that Mary buddy boy big Brando and I wanted to answer a question from the homegirl Mary today and she said every time she tries the heat press some vinyl onto a t-shirt when she lifts the press up she notices that it's all gunky and gluey and sticky and the designs not smashed into the t-shirt it's pretty much sliding around and it's just a big mess from the pictures that she's shown me I asked her what kind of vinyl was she using and she replied with she was just using the vinyl that came with her vinyl cutter I think she has a cricket or cameo not exactly sure but I think she bought one of those like budget bundle deals where she buys the cutter and it comes with like a few you know twelve by twelve pieces of vinyl to practice on and test out so I think she had one of those but she thought she had heat transfer vinyl but the vinyl that was supplied was regular decal vinyl now you're asking yourself what's the difference between heat transfer vinyl and decal vinyl basically heat transfer vinyl is made to be heat transfer it onto a garment onto a t-shirt onto a hat onto whatever type of material you bought the vinyl for now let me stop right there and just say that when you're buying heat transfer vinyl you have to buy the vinyl made for the material that you're gonna be pressing on meaning if you're gonna be pressing on polyester make sure that the vinyl you buy can adhere to polyester a lot of times we'll buy some vinyl because it'll be on sale or we might not be looking at the label and it might be made for like nylon and then we go and try to press it onto a cotton t-shirt and it doesn't adhere right the settings are all backwards and messed up and we don't understand what's going on the problem is each vinyl is made for certain materials so you might get some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton for polyester and cotton poly blends so that's just saying that heat transfer vinyl will work on 100% cotton 100% polyester and a blend in between the two now why is this important because it's not going to adhere correctly to whatever material you're using if have a heat transfer vinyl that's made for like I said nylon and you're trying to put it onto cotton or vice versa so you have some heat transfer vinyl that's made for cotton now you're trying to put it onto some nylon bags and nylon jackets and you're melting your bags and jackets and you don't understand what's going on you have to buy the vinyl made for the materi you're gonna press on with that being said decal vinyl is the vinyl that you make stickers and car decals and like that for hydro flash car windows I mean you can stick them on anywhere but that's the regular basic decal vinyl that's not made to be heat press and it's not made for t-shirts now if you are buying vinyl by the rule on the shelf this might look normal and like oh yeah let me just get that put that on t-shirt but no this is actually decal I know it's a little bit more glossy you'll notice that there's some holes right there let's see if we get this in focus so there's holes on the side usually that tells you that this is decal vinyl you could tell by the feel it's pretty glossy most of the time heat transfer vinyls a little bit more matted and dull in color this is usually on a really big role when I go to mclogan right here in LA this is on a really big roll and I tell them let me get you know 5 yards of this 3 yards of this and they pull it out cut it and give it to me this is a 15 inch roll this is probably maybe two yards of orange this right here looks the same it's rolled up vinyl but this is actually heat transfer mine on the shelf it probably doesn't look just like this it comes in a C it'll come in like a bag similar to this there'll be some heating instructions a piece of paper in here it'll say you know what material it's made for the brand name how to apply it the instructions all of that will be on a piece of paper inside this plastic tube this is your standard 5 yard if 10 inch roll and this is heat transfer vine this right here made to put on two garments so these are made for cotton and poly blends there's no holes on the side like the other one that I just showed you color is a little bit more magic because this is the side that's gonna get stuck on to the t-shirt they look very similar like if you're buying them on Amazon you wouldn't know the difference most of the time heat transfer vinyl comes with application instructions the regular decal vinyl sometimes does sometimes doesn't but yeah that's pretty much it so hopefully if you were having that same issue and you watch my video and you see me cut some vinyl out and press it on a t-shirt you notice that the decal vinyl is not sticking on the shirt and it's kind of gumming the shirt up and you see the glue getting everywhere and like that it's a big mess that's because you're using the wrong final possibly you might be using decal vinyl when you should be using heat transfer vinyl HT v heat transfer vinyl it's usually referred to both of these on - when you see it if you wanted to buy some make sure you check the links below in my description box about a help you guys out it'll help out my channel and it's just all-around good to work with heat press nation alright catch you guys on the next

and today um i want to try out this trend that i keep seeing on tiktok where they are taking poly acrylic and mixing it with water and spraying on their 100 cotton and poly cotton blend t-shirt and making sublimation stick to it um i really do want to try this i'm a little bit skeptical because i have bought like dye sub sprays before and they didn't work uh again it might not have been the product it could have been me and user error i don't even have it anymore to even try it again but i thought we could try this and see what happens so i have a couple different shirts here i have just a 100 um heavy cotton t-shirt then i have a 50 50 color and then i have another 100 cotton shirt but this is a soft style not sure if there's going to be a difference with that but i did want to try and then i have another 50 50 that is already bleached that i'm gonna put an image on and let's see if it makes my image any brighter so what i did was is i put 16 since i'm doing so many shirts and i'm trying on so many i did 16 ounces of water in here and then i added four four tablespoons of the poly acrylic into here and just kind of mixed it up um i already had this um i'm not sure if the semi-gloss or any of that really matters but i already had this so i wasn't gonna go out and buy anything just to try something and then it not work but anyway let's i'm going to go print out my images for these shirts real quick and then we'll be back at the heat press all right so now i'm just going to give my little mix a or my little mixture a little shape just make sure nothing's settled at the bottom make sure and all i'm going to do is just spray this all over the shirt that's on the pad i'm gonna take another piece of parchment paper i'm gonna lay on top and just kind of rub it and i'm gonna press it at 350 for 30 seconds all right so now you're going to go back in with a second coat um but it doesn't have to be as heavy of a coat i put my parchment paper on here again and i'm using this because i don't want to burn my garment and i don't want anything to bleed onto my heat press either i'm gonna do for another 30 seconds so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to pre-press all my shirts like this that i have or i don't know i'm gonna go set this one to the side and do my other two shirts all right so now that we have this one set and ready to go i'm gonna up my heat press to 400 degrees and once that gets there we'll be back all right this is the image that we're going to put on this to center forty another piece of parchment paper and i'm going to heat press it at 400 for um 50 seconds okay so this is the heavy cotton my paper is sticking to my shirt i don't know if it's supposed to be what is and this is the heavy cotton this is what it turned out i'm gonna throw it in the wash and see if it fades all right so now we're going to do the 5050 seconds sorry all right so this is on the 50 50 um i think it did better on this one than it did on the cottons but we're about to see i'm about to put them both in the wash or all three of them on the wash and see how they turn out all right so i'm back with the update on these shirts so i ended up not doing all the colors like i initially thought i didn't want to waste any shirts and i had like a bunch i was gonna do and i'm like let's not do that let's not waste anything if this doesn't work um so i only did the 4t which was the heavy cotton i did the 100 cotton soft style and then i did the 50 50 bleach um i don't have the 50 50 bleach on hand because that was actually an order and i had to get it i had to get it out um but i'll tell you it didn't change um there wasn't much of a difference on it once it was washed it faded out like it normally would with the 5050s um maybe it was a little bit darker but not much i didn't i didn't see that much of a difference in that one um now i did find a difference in the cottons so this is the heavy cotton here this is one wash um i'm gonna move this in so maybe you can see the she is anything that was black is now brown uh darker brown so it did fade a little bit after one wash on that one this one i did two washes and this is the soft style on here it looks a little bit darker but on the blue line you can kind of see where it's faded it's not um it's not that not that dark as it would be on a 100 cotton um does this work yes it does work but the there's no quality in this it's still going to fade over time it works initially um but this is just going to keep fading the more you wash it the more it's going to fade it gives you a little bit longer durability on the cotton if you was just to do a cotton one time it would just fade right out um but i i wouldn't sell these personally i would not sell these to my customers because within a corner how many times they wear the shirt within four washes it's just gonna wash right out or be like super faint so i don't i don't recommend this i don't recommend selling this now if you have like an event that you're doing yourself or something that you have shirts it's just gonna be like a one or two time wear i would probably do it it would save you money instead of doing polyester shirts um but that's it i wouldn't sell these other than that they're just gonna keep washing out um like i said it does work it does work it's not a myth i couldn't find any videos on youtube about it which i thought was like kind of weird um i think i found one but i didn't get any information off of that video so there was the only information i could get from this was through tick tock and those are like literally one minute videos so there wasn't much information there um i seen one girl on tick tock that she said it didn't work for her either and she wouldn't sell them as well so then i seen other people that it some way shape or form worked for them i don't know what i did wrong i went by everything that i seen and all that and it just didn't didn't really work for me um but if you guys have done it please leave a comment down below and let me know what what you did if it worked for you if it didn't work for you how many washes you got out of it so you notice the difference i would really like to know if there's something that i did wrong um but yeah if you guys have any questions or comment again leave them down below i try to answer and respond to everyone that i can and as well as please don't forget to give this video a like and a subscribe i would greatly appreciate it you guys have a wonderful rest of your day", "fOG6BzdGUvo": "Hi.

Yes these things are everywhere, but with all of the imprint options you can make this shirt your own. It's the Hanes Tagless 100% Cotton T-Shirt, available at PinnaclePromotions.com", "BOWgTT3aD8s": "okay folks we are back doing another product review for heart mind soul on the HMS nation today we're going to be talking about a few of my favorite white t-shirts now it's summertime and a lot of people been buying white t-shirts you know there's benefits and drawbacks to this benefit is that it's a lot lighter weight product it's not going to get as hot drawback as I'm sure you're well aware of is that white t-shirts are extremely difficult to keep cleaned so here's a few different options that again these are some of my personal favorites I'll go through some of the benefits and drawbacks of each of them so you're probably aware of everybody's got one of these in their closet the Gildan ultra cotton this is a extremely nice product what's nice about it's very heavy it'll hold up even though it is white it's gonna get dirty you're gonna be able to wash this for five six seven hundred times easily and it's gonna the garment itself is still gonna hold up you've got a nice custom screen print on here like the folks at heart mind soul have done then this is gonna last you quite a while drawback is that it is a hundred percent cotton so it's very heavy the ultra cotton the gilda an ultra cotton is kinda it is gonna make you sweat I guess I will mention that because it is a hundred percent cotton product though it is very absorbent so even though it will make you sweat you will it will absorb a lot of the sweat so that moves on to our dry fit product which again I'm sure he's been buying heart heart mind soul products you probably have something similar to this in your closet this is your sport tech dry fit now this is a hundred percent polyester blend nice thing about this is that it breathes really nicely it's extremely lightweight moisture wicking a really great product if you're planning on being somewhere hot on the farm visit in Chicago or Florida or somewhere Phoenix that there's no way on earth you're gonna be able to wear this hundred percent cotton t-shirt you're just going to hear die before you step off the airplane this is a great alternative to that what's the drawback about this this is a lot thinner product so it's not going to last as long whereas the this Gildan is going to last like I said six seven eight hundred washes depending on how well you take care of it you're probably looking at somewhere between a hundred two hundred maybe depending on how abusive you are on your on your product what else is nice about this I guess that's it really it dries really quickly so if you if you're if you wash it if it gets wet if you're down at the river or something this this product will dry very very quickly as opposed to the Gildan which is gonna take a while the cotton t-shirt so this is something new on the market and they are substantially more expensive but they're really nice product it's kind of gives you the best of both worlds friends so if you put this nice true white bright brilliant white t-shirt next to it there's the dry fit and there's the there's the Gildan top and it was in cotton you can see that this is a little bit it already looks a little bit dingy a little bit a little bit faded and that's because it's not a true white this is they actually call it fairly white and this is a believe a try blend composite and if you look at this here you've got these little little flakes of different color that are kind of woven in here so it's kind of a really kind of neat and what I like about this is that if you do happen to get something on your shirt like you do happen you will happen to have on a white t-shirt then this kind of kind helps to not stand out so much another nice thing about this is that they're made from 25% organic cotton 50% recycled polyester so that's a six different plastic bottles that have been recycled into the composite of this t-shirt and modal which is very very soft so you get the the lightweight breathability you also get the durability so I think that this is the in my opinion probably the best white t-shirt that you're gonna find on the market right now now again this is fairly expensive for a white t-shirt so if you're just handing these out in an event or something there probably gonna want to go with the Gildan that's a probably the least expensive t-shirt you're gonna hand these out at an event you want somebody to actually wear it you might want to go with the sport tech the dry fit here it's a little bit more but not too terribly much these on the other hand are one of the most expensive garments but boy they're nice and you're doing your part to help save the save the oceans and make the world a better place let me take this time to remind you that you can pick up any of these designs from heart mind soul on the HMS nation website or contact today us today for a custom quote with your design", "55sBAIKk9m4": "oh so soft so supple oh i i just want to caress you it wait a minute this is a t-shirt let's get into this video the quintessential and definitive guide to choosing a t-shirt plane t-shirt help desk what's up guys gary is in a make sure you go down and click on that subscribe button and click that notification bell and if you're watching on instagram or facebook follow us so you'll be notified of all this fantastic information we have on the t-shirt industry now i know a lot of you guys are dead set you know exactly what t-shirt company you're gonna use to get your blanks from and some of you guys are undecided and this is why this video is being made and for some of you guys who are dead set you might see something that may uh change your mind now in this video we're going to be focusing on three main key points when it comes to a t-shirt blank fit feel and price now we're going to be covering quite a few t-shirts in this video so it may be a little lengthy so i took some time and created time stamps for each brand and that's going to be down in the description box okay so something piques your interest you can go right directly to that brand but i strongly suggest that you watch this video in its entirety so enough with all this talking without any further ado roll that beautiful bean footage here we go okay guys this is the ideal by next level you can see all the style number information down in the left corner this is what it fits like on the model we're just gonna lay it out and we're gonna give it the old uh feel test and it feels nice uh it's mediocre it's not the softest and it's not the scratches so it's like kind of right in the middle and it has that uh rip away label which is always good and it says ideal and not next level i don't know why and this is what it looks like uh from the back now the price is 366. and please note you probably can get these cheaper if you go direct to the manufacturer so here we are anvil and as you can see the fit is nice it's a standard fits a little bit more athletic but just slightly boxy but nice the feel is very nice i would say um out of five i would give it like a four uh uh three and a half three point five out of five you know somewhat soft you know and slightly above average all right it has that rip away tag so you can do your branding okay very nice um and here is the back this is the back uh how it looks okay really nice and the price is 326 okay of course you might get it a little bit cheaper now price in general something you want to take into consideration if it's a bottom of the barrel t-shirt um then you want to get a t-shirt that's less expensive so you can even in that lower price you can have some room to make a profit and if you're selling a more premium t-shirt then you want to get a better quality blank to justify selling your t-shirt at a higher price and of course that blank is going to be a little bit more expensive but hey higher price more profit which means you can afford the more expensive blank let's go to the next one okay so this is jerseys okay we all know jerseys all right and it's a slightly thicker slightly thicker shirt so we're gonna spread this bad boy out and you're gonna see that it's nice you just saw the fit it's a nice fit it's um not too boxy not too athletic you know not too fitted nice shirt and a feel it's good it's it's a good middle of the road shirt you understand what i'm saying no complaints and you can see right here that there's no um side seam which is usually um the more athletic um shirts will have a side seam and right here you see that that is that rip away tag which is always a good sign for a blank all right now the field is the middle of the road it's middle of the road about a three out of a five and the price is 431 which is a little a little high and this is how it looks from the back that's jerseys fit all right guys fit this is so very important because depending on your demographic meaning your core target audience meaning the people who you are pushing your t-shirt company to they may want a different fit you may have a young hip demographic they may want a smaller tighter fit you may have a older demographic all right they may want a little bit of a boxier fit you may have an athletic demographic or you may be one of these people that's out here doing a line for people who are bodybuilders or crossfit or something like that then in that case you may want a more fitted tighter uh smaller waist v taper type fit for your t-shirts everything has to do with your core target audience and not all t-shirts are the same alright so fit is so very important all right and this is the hanes tagless shirt um and this one is the epitome to me in my opinion it's a dad's shirt it's a shirt that you just kinda it's just a shirt that you just kind of wear it's really not for screen printing you can see um it's really big and boxy all right and it's very thick a lot of you guys think that thick is a higher quality and not necessarily all right the feel is it's okay it's it's a mediocre and there's no um there's no side seam all right it's very hand feel it's very mediocre not too soft not rough though not rough and this is really important right here the the back neck tag is already heat pressed so you can't brand it so not a good look and um this is how it looks from the back you can see it's very big and boxy so um not for me my opinion not the best for starting a t-shirt business for obvious reason but it does have a pretty good price 279 and you probably could get it cheaper guys the tag the tag is so very important there was a time when hey whatever the brand of the t-shirt was they left their tag in and there was a time when you literally had to pay screen printers to cut the tag out so you could put your branding in it that's not the case anymore they make these t-shirts with mostly rip away tags so you can rip that tag out and put your own branding in there so i always want to call out what type of tag hopefully a rip away is in your blank tee also guys when you doing all the branding and you have your neck label and your hang tags and your boxes and everything matches guys that stuff looks so professional such a what's called perceived value you take your t-shirt line to a whole nother level baby all right guys alternative apparel very nice shirt first thing you're gonna see you're gonna notice that it is a little bit more fitted okay so a very nice fitting shirt all right let's lay it out and let's give it an initial just a field test and it it's very soft guys very soft very nice shirt okay uh you can get in there touch on that feels really good all right and also you're gonna see that it is a you can see that side seam right there which helps with the fit so we're already having some uh some premium things going on you can see that fit you know a little bit a little bit more tapered and fit it to the body and it has that rip away tag so this one is definitely a little bit more on the primo side all right and the price is about 385 okay um and of course you may be able to get a little bit cheaper at the actual website but alternative apparel really nice shirt all right guys this is the hanes nano tee this one totally came out of left field for me uh different than the haines tagless tee all right really nice fit and the fabric is really soft uh dynamite tee all right the fit is not quite um the super fitted but it fit really nice and you're gonna see right here that it has a really nice feel okay now right here you're gonna see that it does not have the side seam okay but it still managed to have a great fit and i think that has to do with the fabric it's a really light soft fabric so this nano t uh surprised me and uh you can see that it also has that rip away tag all right so um really nice and once again the feel was a really nice you almost can see how soft it is right surprise me right because i never heard of the nano t this is it from the back and the price is three dollars and eleven cent once again you might can get it cheaper from haynes uh themselves so that is the haines nano t okay so here we are fruit of the loom now this one kind of surprised me a little bit i thought it was going to be really bad and it wasn't the fabric is actually a nice feel not the best not the worst it's a light it's a light t-shirt guys it's a nice light t-shirt and it gets the job done if you want to just put something out there throw a screen print on it uh for the loom and of course it has the rip away tag all right which any good t-shirt should have and it was nice it felt good has a decent fit and i was presently surprised this is it from the back and the price was 3.49 i thought it could have been a little cheaper but hey you know i got it from a reseller so if you buy directly from fruit of the loom you may can get it cheaper all right on to the next one gildan or gildan all right this one is popular this is usually the shirt that you see that's the lowest price when you're choosing t-shirts on print on demand and there's a reason for that that's because the fabric is not very soft all right it's not nice it's not that nice feeling at all i mean it's okay after a couple of washes but initially um not the best feeling and that's why it's uh the least expensive um but it's a cool tee no side seam and the fit is it's okay um it's not boxy and it's it's not tapered or or like really fitted um fabric [Music] not the best feeling man not the best best feeling but it does have a rip away tag which is always good uh let's take a look at it from the back um cool t-shirt but um i would say low on lower on the quality scale and the price 279 so you can see it's a little bit less and you know hey you get what you pay for guys all right gildan next level check this one out now great thing about next level is look at the fit really great fit nice fitted to the body great i mean you can see it on the mannequin here so let's lay it out and um first you know we're going to give it a nice little feel and um it feels great it's really soft really nice all right it's um definitely a higher quality shirt and also you're gonna see right here that it too has a side seam okay which is a um telltale sign of a higher quality shirt and the rip away tag here it is from the back the price of 439 so uh it's a little bit it's it's up there all right it's up there but it is a higher quality more premium t-shirt next level bella canvas good old bella canvas you've heard about them several times here at t-shirt help desk great t-shirt really light airy soft fantastic t-shirt with a great fit alright and let's take a look as you guys should know bella canvas also has the side seam okay which gives it a really nice fit it's light it's not a heavy fabric and it's really really soft and of course it has the rip away tag and as stated previously bella is one of the softest on the market all right right up there with next level and in alternative apparel here it is from the back and the price 439 but that's from a middleman you can get it from bella canvas as most of these for about a dollar to 80 90 cents cheaper bella canvas next american apparel yes they are still around okay um they are really soft t-shirts really nice all right and just to let you know this t-shirt all the other ones were largest this one is a medium so if it seems extra snug that's because it is one size down okay but it does have a really good fit all right and it has that side seam okay so it is a more premium shirt with a nice fit okay this is it from the side you can see that it is a good slim fit all right and it yes has the rip away tag so great to brand with this is it from the back all right the price 392 all right so it's more on the premium side but a little bit less and like all the other ones if you go straight to the manufacturer you can get it for less all right guys as you can see all of the t-shirts are 100 cotton i didn't want to get into anything crazy i didn't want to get into the tri-blends or anything fancy schmancy like that that's gonna be for another video i wanted to keep it basic 100 cotton t-shirts but there is one exception i am going to show you guys one 100 polyester tee this is a great t-shirt for any of you guys who are doing active who are doing sports people who are working out golf anything where people may be working out and get sweaty because 100 polyester is a natural wicking fabric meaning that if you're sweating it naturally will kind of wick that sweat away and another thing about 100 polyester tees is that they are great for sublimation in fact really it's the only thing you really can use for sublimation all right so if you want to sublimate small and if you want to do those big all over sublimation tees you need a 100 or at least a very high polyester content but one little thing if you're doing sublimation this shirt has to be a light color preferably white all right so let me show you this is the jerseys dry power sport t-shirt great shirt and it feels like a regular t-shirt that's what's so great about it alright so this is it and it feels very similar to a standard jersey t-shirt if you didn't know the difference you probably couldn't tell and it is soft not the softest but it is a soft t-shirt in the back it doesn't have the rip away tag okay so um branding is gonna be a little bit tricky but um the price is also a little bit uh more 563 this is it from the back but if you want to do that athletic stuff this is the way to go that was a lot of t-shirts guys they were in no particular order i really wasn't trying to critique like that i just wanted to present them to you so you can make your decision on what's going to be in your t-shirt line now when it comes to actually purchasing these t-shirts you can go to each brand's respective website but please note a lot of these companies are going to require you to have a wholesale or a retail license they may want to see your website all right so you know you may have to do that but you're gonna get the absolute best prices now if you don't have that no worries you can go to places like jiffyshirts.com which is where i got all of these shirts okay they have you covered you don't need any of that stuff you can just go you can buy as little or as many as you like so anyway guys that's all i got for you today i'm gonna put some butt on my shoes and slide on out the dope cheers to your t-shirts start a t-shirt business or die trying and do something good for somebody and if you don't have anyone to do something good for do something good for yourself god bless and peace shirt man shirt man yeah that's me that's when you take your t-shirt line to a hoe damn that's taking it to another level baby", "s56ckRKlCK8": "things are about to get hot in here because we're talking about heat transfer vinyl and what shirts work best for it up next hey guys it's Melissa with shirt space and today I'm bringing up the hot talk okay enough of the cheesiness so let's jump right in to pick the best shirt for heat transfer vinyl the shirt has to meet a certain criteria it will not only need to be a great T to wear but it will also need to be a tea that works well with your heat transfers heat transfer vinyl works well with many fabrics but we think these two type of fabrics stand out above the rest the first is a hundred percent polyester polyester is less likely to shrink than any other fabrics but what does this have to do with heat transfer vinyl once your design has been added to the tea it's crucial that it does not shrink this could wrinkle pull or even ruin the vinyl with 100% polyester you know your shrinkage will be minimal and we like minimal shrinkage especially when it comes to HTV but I'm not just gonna stop there what if we could take it to another level well there's no what-ifs about it we can with three simple words cotton poly blend cotton poly blends are the best of both worlds you have the durability and minimal shrinkage from the polyester and the softness and wearability of the cotton the blending of these two fabrics will create an overall makeup that you will love since this is our number one candidate what's the top tea we recommend in this category drumroll please it's the bell of canvas 3001 CVC made up a 52% heirloom combed and ring spun cotton which is the best cotton out there and 48 percent polyester weighing in at 4.2 ounces this is a lightweight tea that you will love to wear being a retail fit and fashion-forward your customers can rock your great design it has unisex sizing side seams tearaway label and it's pre Shrunk the list

good day dressing well and of course getting stuff done alright guys so it's gonna be a nice and quick one today I'm gonna be going through my top ten favorite go-to t-shirts that I personally find myself wearing all the time a lot of you guys always comment in each video what t-shirt I'm wearing so I'm going to be going through all of these showing you guys which are my favorite where I got them from in the price that I paid for them alright guys we are standing straight into it this is a very nice fitted white t-shirt from cause and I paid 25 pounds for this there's two kind of unique features through this t-shirt one is the high neckline which is the main reason I really mess with that I do just love a nice tight high neckline the second is that it's a very light almost see-through material I don't know if you look close enough but you can probably see my mic so it's a very nice breathable one perfect for coming into spring and summer alright guys so staying on the white trend this is my most expensive teacher that I do have this is the acne studio one again similar to the COS high neckline has that printed acne studio a very nice fitting t-shirt absolutely love this this is a lot more of a heavyweight material but it is also quite stretchy so the size every time I wash it it always just comes back to its natural size and I absolutely love it coming on to the third one guys and this is kind of like my most oversized t-shirt that I do have it is very oversized but this is definitely a lot more of a summer vibe t-shirt now the material of this one the reason I like it so much is it is that towel material I got this from All Saints it was on sale when I got it absolutely love it and yet for me this is my kind of more out there t-shirt because I do really like my t-shirts to be simple and played down but with the stripes going across and their texture to this t-shirt it just adds that little bit of detail that I absolutely love so guys coming on down we are entering a round of Col bloody Buxton this dude is just breaking the bank on me because they keep putting out good pieces I have three t-shirts from them the next this one and the next two are all called Buxton but let's get into this one first I paid forty pounds for this is the Col Buxton week a t-shirt is a lot more of a softer material really just sits on the body great for kind of like every day absolutely love this season my favorite black t-shirt completely it is that oversize fit you guys would be the common theme in pretty much the rest of this is just oversized it's just what I like love tucking it in I love having a little bit of that bagginess it's kind of just my style and personality that I really mess with but yeah very simple cannot go wrong with a nice black shirt especially when you tuck this in to some black smack-heads add some Doc Martens perfect you're good to go again guys called Buxton this is their warm-up t-shirt you guys know I did a full review on this there's the first stop I bought from them 60 pounds still love it to this day I love this is the slate colorway it is a great fit is and like kind of a boxy fit the material is a lot more of that heavy weight and license duty I love how simple this one is yet but because of the way they designed their t-shirt gives it that nice kind of vintage feel so it's a great way to add a little bit of texture to a very simple outfit and yeah it's a good colorway the last of the call back someone same warm up t-shirt this isn't happening the colorway but I call it the concrete one if that's how eyes up do it exact same use the other t-shirt nice heavy weight and yeah just honestly guys the Cole bucks and stuff like I'm not just like saying it for the sake of it like I messed with their stuff and anytime they drop a new t-shirt I'm most likely gonna cop it because this is the type of stuff that's always gonna be in my wardrobe as long as my style stays this way I'll always mess with their stuff so this next one is by Val Christopher I think that was a hundred pounds that is quite pricey but it is so unique and there's a lot that goes into it obviously it's quite a bit more tout oversized bit to it man I've actually been thinking about just doing a full video based on this t-shirt because in this little snippet that I've got it's not enough time but what I do really love about this t-shirt is it's the type of one that I will wear when I want to just make a bit more of a statement when I want a little bit more of a unique standout t-shirt but the reason why this is my top ten is because it's still a very subtle t-shirt yet it has its own amazing uniqueness to it obviously there's the so much going on I kinda just want to do a whole video on this but yeah I love it so for a lot of you oh geez you will remember this t-shirt it is definitely one of my go-to yet because we've been in winter I just don't go out for brighter colors but coming into spring and summer you're gonna see this one a lot more this is my small supreme box logo t-shirt this is what I want to just you know what I want is just be a little bit of a height beast for today I want to just be a supreme head you know I just want to be in that game very subtle very still minimal definitely my style definitely great balance between minimal and you're still in that kind of like Street way scene all right guys on to the second to last one and this is my burnt orange t-shirt again oversized boxy and you may have seen some expensive t-shirts my first t-shirt was 10 pounds from Zara I absolutely love it love the fit of it look the colorway of it perfect when you come into order and perfect when you're in spring summer winter whenever I love it guy size large fits really nicely colors great it's just a really nice way to add color to your outfit but without being too bold all right guys last but certainly not least we started with a fitting t-shirt so we're gonna end with a fitting t-shirt as well it's not always about the oversize fits this is the day's march one you guys would have seen this recently again when I add color to my outfits I like it to be in a more desaturated way love the fit of it I love the cotton love the heavyweight material of this and it's just a really good vibe for about three pounds and there we have it guys those are my top 10 favorite go-to t-shirts that I just always find myself going to let me know in the comment section down below guys what is your favorite go-to t-shirt and where is it from other than that guys I will try link all of

you fellas next time peace [Applause] [Music]", "zwQbjZrJcLo": "[Music] setting everybody boy big brando and today let's talk about one of the mistakes i made when i was trying to pick out blank t-shirts now let me start this video off by saying if you've watched my videos about blank t-shirts or if you watch any of my videos or ask any questions in my live streams and you ask what's the best blank t-shirt to use i always say it's a personal preference when it comes to the best now the reason i say this is because i learned this the hard way now about 10 12 years ago something like that i was launching a brand that brand i wanted to offer the best quality t-shirt money could buy i wanted my brand to be top quality i wanted everybody to be like hey check it out man this is top-notch highest quality you're gonna find that's why you gotta shop with me the issue i had was my idea of quality wasn't what everybody else thought was quality i just thought a soft feeling t-shirt was top quality at some high quality if the cotton is that soft you know what i mean i was thinking all right this t-shirt right here super soft this is high quality four dollars a blank this is the real deal this is what i'm getting so i order in bulk you know what i mean i'm ordering i think 18 dozen t-shirts or something like that for this first run like let's get this going have these really soft hand feeling t-shirts ready to go i'm screen printing all these t-shirts these aren't transfers this ain't nothing else this is regular screen print now that i think about it this is probably like 15 16 years ago because we're in 2021 right now it's about maybe 15 16 years ago so i get these t-shirts in i'm screen printing i'm getting them going man everything is going good i feel good i feel confident in my printing i feel confident in the t-shirts i feel very confident in the designs i got on here and i'm ready to go but this is where i messed up the people i was selling to they don't give a about that soft feeling t-shirt they wanted a thick heavy feeling t-shirt the designs i had were home runs to this audience the t-shirts i were printing on wasn't even a strikeout we weren't even playing the same sport at that time you know what i mean the t-shirts were so far off from what the customer actually wanted so i sold a decent amount of t-shirts on that first run right i sold a good amount of t-shirts and i'm feeling good and then i noticed nobody else is buying all the sales stopped nobody's buying and i can't figure out why i have high quality t-shirt i have really good prints and i have damn good designs on these things what's the hold up and the holdup was me thinking that this soft t-shirt was high quality and i'm advertising it as high quality but the people that were buying the shirts didn't think that was high quality because we had two different ideas of what quality was to me at that time quality was soft hand feel cotton to my consumer quality was a heavy weight t-shirt that was cut a little longer and a little more baggier so now i was stuck with i think like 10 to 11 dozen t-shirts of these super high quality soft cotton t-shirts that i could not sell because i was selling to the wrong people the people i was selling to had a different idea of what quality was and i didn't understand that at the time because i'm thinking this is high quality man the t-shirt you want those things are crap because that's only a two dollar blank these are like four or four fifty a blank this is high quality cotton the other stuff you want is just some cheap swap meet style cotton but to the consumer those swap meet style t-shirts was high quality because that's what they wanted heavyweight t-shirt boxier cut a little more baggier longer sleeves i didn't pay attention to all that because this shirt was a little bit more fitted it was shorter but it was soft as and i just thought soft as meant the highest quality money can buy so i lost on all of those t-shirts i lost this is where things get up so now on my next run what i do is now i'm buying the heavyweight t-shirts that those customers wanted but i'm selling to a totally different group so now my thing is all right high quality means heavyweight t-shirts this is what everybody wants this is what everybody needs but now i'm selling a t-shirt that's geared towards like the people that are into wearing like ed hardy and stuff like that this is how far along this is is the people that were used to wearing those types of t-shirts were into the softer thinner feeling t-shirts but i was offering these heavyweight t-shirts because my research that i did was saying soft isn't in baggy heavier feeling cotton is what's in and that's high quality so now i'm buying these heavier t-shirts selling them to the wrong crowd because now i have these really cool designs that are on these heavier t-shirts and i'm promoting them telling them it's high quality they buy it and they're like this t-shirt sucks it feels like a swap meet t-shirt i don't want this t-shirt and then when i look at what they're used to wearing it's more of a softer fitted cut it's a little bit more thinner it's a little bit lightweight and not necessarily these big heavy t-shirts so once again i lose out and i lose out big because i'm offering the wrong t-shirt to the wrong customer so when people hit me up and say what's the best t-shirt to buy it's personal preference because everybody has a different idea of what the best is what quality is everybody has a different opinion on it so some people out here in la might think pro club is high quality that's something that they're used to wearing that's something that they like but if i tried to offer this heavyweight pro club t-shirt to let's say i'm running a fitness brand and now i want to offer pro club t-shirts to people that are into fitness and wearing these shirts to the gym hell no they want shirts that are tight hugging the sleeves they want lightweight soft feeling t-shirts those are two totally separate t-shirts but both high quality in their own respected space see what i mean so there's no one blank that's the best above all that's made for everybody everybody has a different preference on what t-shirts they like so when people hit me up and say hey man what's the best shirt to buy what's the best blank t-shirts to use and i tell them it's all personal preference they get mad because i'm not giving them an actual brand to buy their shirts from because if i think pro club heavyweight t-shirts is quality and that's the best t-shirt to use and then you buy pro club heavyweight t-shirts because you're going off my recommendation but your audience is into fitted t-shirts or they're into lightweight t-shirts or ring-spun cotton t-shirts you didn't say all that and i recommended pro club to you because you asked me what i think the best quality shirt is who is in the wrong me because i gave you my recommendation or you because you went off on my recommendation and didn't understand what type of t-shirt you were buying so you would waste a shitload of money going off of my recommendation instead of going based off of what your customers want and need because my idea of quality is really really not going to be your idea of quality i base my idea of buying t-shirts off of convenience how fast can i get these t-shirts where can i easily get these t-shirts because think about this say if you wanted to offer bella canvas t-shirts right a certain model number from bella canvas is your idea of the best quality t-shirt so you order these you're using these for your brand you're going everything is moving let's say it is friday night and you're pressing up some orders and you up two of those shirts you're all out of that color you're all out of that size where can you go on saturday to buy that same exact t-shirt if that same exact t-shirt isn't offered around to you locally then you're in a bind because now you have to place an order wait till monday or tuesday to get that order so for myself i buy based off of convenience i use all style and pro club because all style and pro club are easy for me to get my hands on around los angeles i could go to my liquor store i could go to the swap meet i could go to the t-shirt warehouse i could go straight to the distro warehouse for pro club or all style and pick stuff up on my own i personally can buy these t-shirts one by one or in bulk anywhere around me that's why i use these certain brands is it because they're the best is it because of it's the best highest quality no all it is is my idea of convenience is a big part of how i buy t-shirts because i'm thinking of if i these shirts up i need somewhere to go to buy these t-shirts and re-up so i can still get that order out on time because i don't want to have to be like oh you know what i'm running behind i'm waiting for these t-shirts to come in so now the customer has to wait on me now if i mess up a t-shirt the customer does not have to know that i messed up on a t-shirt so if i mess up on a friday night i know saturday morning i could go to my indoor swap meet i could go to the t-shirt warehouse i could go to the liquor store on the corner and buy another pro club or another all-style t-shirt bang it out i'll pay retail for it but i'll still bang it out to get that order out so that's why when people ask me what's the best t-shirt to use i usually say it's personal preference and then when they want to know what brands i use and i say pro club and all style i always tell people order some samples first see if you like the shirt before you even place that order because these t-shirts work for me and my customers i got a customer base that only loves pro club i also have a customer base that only likes all style if i tried to switch the two i would lose customers on both ends because the all-style customers hate pro club pro club customers hate all style so i have to know who i'm selling to and what i'm offering this is exactly what you need to do for your brands and your businesses is knowing what the customer is used to knowing what the customer is used to wearing knowing what the customer likes and doesn't like so that way you don't buy the that they don't like and you can make money because the goal is to waste less money to make more money do not waste a ton of money buying blank t-shirts thinking that's what your customers need or that's what you like or that's what you want to offer then your customers like man these t-shirts suck now you're stuck with a bunch of t-shirts that you can't sell don't do that this video helped you out make sure you leave it in my comments if you got any questions make sure you leave them in the comments because i get a lot of dms and emails all the time and it's hard for me to filter through all those things so it's easier to get a response from me in my comments or you could go on instagram big brando tv and leave it in the comments on any of those videos you'll get a better response that way alright catch you guys on next one man yep [Music]", "IGuraSPahVU": "hi I'm Rachel you too sis and I'm gonna show you how to shrink a shirt for whatever reason you want to shrink a shirt the temperature of the water is gonna determine how small your shirt gets I've had a shirt come out of the dryer looking like a Barbie shirt before and I never got to wear it again it also depends on the material of the shirt if it's something that's a really like you know like a sweater material it's gonna shrink a lot faster if you just have cotton it's gonna take a little more to shrink it so boil some water on your stove after it's been boiling you want to bring it over and dump it into a bowl or a pan whichever shirt you want to shrink drop it in that hot water let it sit in there until the water goes cold really let it sit in that hot water after you do that if you wash the shirt on the hottest possible setting in your washing machine it'll shrink it even more and if you dry it for a long time in the dryer on a hot setting you should come out with the shirts it's about two three sizes smaller at least I'm Rachel you choose this and that is how you should make a shirt", "KYJfLETGIj8": "Hey its Tory with BELLA+CANVAS there's a\ntime and place for a nice new t-shirt but we also know it's sometimes hard to\nbeat the feeling of a good old worn in team but what if you could create that\nlook right away without spending all those years wearing it in well today\nwe're a deluxe screen printing to map out the basic steps you need for\ncreating vintage tees so there are a few different types of\nt-shirts and fabrics that work well when going for a vintage vibe poly cotton\nblends and tri blends in particular are great because the yarns take the ink\ndifferently giving it that worn in look today we're going to use our vintage\nslub a fabric with a great tonal texture thanks to the uneven knit to showcase\nthis another great option is to go for a shirt that is pre distressed like our\n3009 from the fast fashion collection this tee is made up of super soft 100%\nairlume combed and ring-spun fabric but features holes throughout for that worn\nin look so the next step is to pair that tee with the right design we've\nconsulted an expert designer Charley Pangus Pangus to showcase how to do just that\nwhat's up guys so for this artwork we wanted to apply a nice vintage look and\nin order to achieve that I needed to find some really heavy textures online\nfor the first texture we use rust and when you apply that above the artwork on\ntop we use the white ink so It blended it right into the artwork it gives it a\nnice broken feel which we love with the vintage look for the second texture\nI like to use an oil splatter and I put that below the artwork which gives it a\neven more broken up look it's also important to note that I applied these\ntextures very very heavy on purpose so when we actually print it and you don't\nlose a lot of detail and then when you actually print it you get this nice\nvintage design that we were looking for and last but not least you're going to\nneed to choose a printing technique that complements both the shirt and the\ndesign so there are two different types of inks that you can use for a vintage\nprint there's either plastisol without a base or water base with plastisol\nwithout a base you typically would like to print on a dark fabric that way your\nbright colors are going to get less bright and they're gonna darken up and\nit's gonna lay right on top of that fabric and you're gonna have a little\nbit of a natural distressed look the other way would be to use water base\nwhich is gonna lay into the fabric and it's gonna have a really soft feel to it\nas if you wash that tee a million times there are two different types of\nwater-based inks there's water base that you're gonna print on white or pastel\ncolors when you're printing on darker colors like blacks reds blues you want\nto go to what's called discharge printing that has a discharge base to it\nwhich actually bleaches out the dye in the fabric with that one it's great for\na distressed looked as well depending on the fabric you're using if you're using\na poly blend it's going to discharge the cotton part of it so that's gonna help\nwith that a little bit of that vintage look\nthank you for going bright it's gonna darken up so be aware with that you\nmight want to do some pre-testing on that because your colors will change now\non 100% cotton that color should be true again you'll want to do some testing on\nthat the two tees that we printed today the distressed tee and the slub tee\nare great options when printing that vintage look let us know what you\nthought of the vintage teens we created in this video in the comment section be\nsure to check out how Charlie completed his design in his video linked below you\ncan also check out the products we featured below as well don't forget to\nsubscribe to our channel for more content like this we'll see you next\ntime Be Different.", "Zr8UeHIW5Is": "hey guys today we're looking at the anvil 8080 this particular shirt is made by anvil and it's in the color orange it's a four and a half ounce t-shirt so it's a lighter weight and it's a little bit softer filled being that it's a ring spun cotton it's contoured for a ladies fit so you can see that it's a little bit slimmer in the sides it does have a side seam the anvil 880 features a tearaway label it comes in all 14 of our warehouses and it goes in sizes small all the way through double XL you could use this shirt for screen printing you can use it for casual wear it would be good for schools or even a clothing line if you're looking for a hundred percent cotton ladies t-shirt that's super affordable that 880 might be what you're looking for also note that although this is 100% cotton t-shirt some of the colors that are heathered come with a blended fabric thank you for watching and please subscribe", "EOpkP-R2CuU": "what's going on guys in this video we're gonna talk about how you can start a t-shirt business from home with as little as five hundred dollars let's not waste any time and get right into it check us out guys we're going by calm type in Jordan shirt and here you'll see a bunch of t-shirts so these shows will cost us around $2 to make you will need around five hundred dollars to buy all the equipment and you'll be able to make these at home these are gonna be professional quality store ready t-shirts so let's take a look at this t-shirt right here let's click on it so this seller didn't do a good job with the listing the image is horrible and the shirt is all wrinkled but still he sold 115 of these t-shirts for $20 and so he's making over $10 per shirt let's click right here and this is how many he sold so just today he sold two three four he sold for these t-shirts so off of one t-shirt he made $40 you guys can make a ton of different t-shirts from athletes and musicians to movies to much more so let's talk about how to make these shirts the first thing we're gonna do is go on a website called jittery shirts calm this is the website where we're gonna buy our blank t-shirts we're gonna buy the Gildan g500 t-shirt this is one of the most common t-shirts and it's good because it has a tare weight label so it's very convenient the show will cost around a dollar sixty cents the second thing you guys will need a special inkjet principle heat transfer paper you can get these in different sizes such as eight-and-a-half by 11 and 11 by 17 the small one is called a four and the large one is called a three you will need light transfer paper for white t-shirts and black transfer paper for dark t-shirts when you're first starting out you guys should buy these on Amazon and then you can buy the wholesale and Alibaba for around thirty cents a sheet for the large ones the next thing you guys will need is a Epson WUF 7710 printer and the fourth thing is a large heat press machine so the first thing we have to do is mirror the image let's click tools flip horizontal and now ready to print alright so when you put it on the white t-shirts we're gonna insert an 11 by 17 white paper into the printer an image I just want you guys to understand one thing even though I'm printing with a inkjet printer the ink will never smudge it will be impossible to make the income off the t-shirt the shirt will have to be destroyed this is gonna be a professional quality t-shirt the ink is gonna melt with a thin piece of vinyl onto the t-shirt so when the paper is printed it's not gonna look too bright but when it's on the shirt isn't look much better the next step is to cut out all the white parts the image you can do this with scissors or if you want better results you could do this with a paper cutter don't worry if you don't cut it perfectly because the white areas are barely seen my friend the image is now ready to be printed on the shirt all right guys the next step we're gonna take a blank shirt we're gonna preheat it to get the moisture out we're gonna put the part of the t-shirt which will print on onto the heat plate wait for the silicone paper and press it for about 10 seconds you guys see steam coming out that's fine don't worry and now we'll do the same thing for some bottom the next step is gonna take the image I'm gonna align it on the t-shirt Airport and then we're gonna use paper tape or you guys can use special heat transfer tape to take the image on shirt and now we're gonna transfer an image onto the t-shirt and now I'm going to press it at 300 let's say 50 degrees for around 15 seconds so right now is a very important part if you guys peel while the shirt is hot you're gonna get a matte finish if you guys have the shirt cool off and peel when it's cold the finish will be glossy for this shirt we're peeling it hot to have a matte finish make sure you take the tape off very carefully and as you guys can see we have a professional finished t-shirt if you guys look on the bottom right there's a very small white scratch this happened because the paper was scratched before printing so always make sure to inspect the paper prior to printing otherwise the prints come out perfectly every single time it's almost impossible to mess with the printer we're almost finished we just have to do one more thing and that's to stretch out the shirt and repress it one more time for about 10 seconds to make sure the shirt lasts a long time now we're gonna stretch a shirt out to make sure it lasts a long time when I press one more time put the silicone paper on and do a very quick five-second press the show zone alright guys now we're gonna do a black t-shirt it's nice on paper for this example we're gonna put the small image on the a4 paper so when you're printing on black t-shirts the image does not need to be mirrored we're gonna use our cutter to cut out all the white areas and that we're ready to eat president image so now I'm gonna press the black shirt quick ten-second press so the next step is to carefully peel the top layer [Music] and now we're going to carefully line the image onto the t-shirt now I'm gonna put it into the heat press and press the image press it for around ten seconds at 320 degrees Fahrenheit now with no move the silicone paper do a quick stretch and our shirt is done alright guys the next step is to make our shirt labels the best way to do this is by making plaster salt heat transfer labels you can get these for around 10 cents if you order in large quantities just make sure the image is mirrored before sending it to the seller we're gonna go into google and type in shirt label template right here you'll get a template for the labels you guys can Photoshop your own if you want we will download one of the sample labels and heat transfer it to the shirt I strongly recommend you guys get the classes on cue transfers if you want flawless results every time but if you guys want to do it yourself and get a special Oki laser printer and special heat transfer paper and try it out there is a learning curve to this and the results are not going to be as good as the plastisol labels let's carefully tear away the gilding tag alright guys so we're gonna place our label onto the shirt place the silicone paper over it and heat presses and now let me slowly peel the label when the shirt is finished you will package it in a plastic bag which will cost you around five to ten cents you will then take photos of the t-shirt let's talk about two very important parts of this business the first one is reinvesting money back into the business so for example if you start with $100 you can make 50 t-shirts and $2.00 each shirt if you sell those 50 t-shirts at $10 you will have $500 if you take the $500 you can make 250 t-shirts if you sell the 250 t-shirts at $10 you will have 2,500 and so on the second thing is you guys have to make t-shirts which don't have trademarks and copyrights this is very important if you want to have a long stable business get creative and make really cool t-shirts I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please leave a like to subscribe and if you have any
