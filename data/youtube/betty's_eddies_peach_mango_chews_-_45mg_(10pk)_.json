{"yTANu5Hcl1A": "hey everybody welcome back as you can see just some natural lighting today and that is because I feel like I'm often talking about my cycle but it is because I have endometriosis so the pain excuse me for my voice but the pain can be just really bad so I didn't even feel like setting up my lighting today so I just set it up like this so welcome back but I am currently in a lot of pain so I'm gonna talk a little bit about edibles the first thing you should know is that if you've never done adipose before you need to find something that's very low dose okay your liver transforms TCA into 11 hydroxy THC which is a much more potent format of THC and it is very intoxicating so that's why oftentimes people will have like really bad trips on edibles because they think that they're taking like these small doses that dosages they think like Oh 10 milligrams whatever and then it hits like 30 so you have to be very careful if you've never done edibles before if your tolerance for edibles is really low outside of that apples are incredible for pain and that's why I'm choosing to go with them today because like I said I'm in a lot of pain and I like to be really honest with you guys so that's what I'm working with today I have some babies Eddie these are medicated shoes there are five choose each one of one flavor and each Jew has 20 milligrams of THC I'm not going to lie that's pretty strong even for me like I don't have a very high tolerance for edibles but I chose Betty studies because as you saw on the package it's vegan it's gluten-free it's dairy feet free and it's made with real fruits and veggies so like I thought that that was pretty cool that they were still taking in so many people's like dietary restrictions I do like that it's childproof I think that's important to do you have children in the home I know of course you want your stash to be somewhere secluded but it's also nice to know that it has that childproof lock on it as well so looks like I did get one of each flavor okay oh my god this smells so good I believe that this is the flavor very good thing very good things that's right cute so the papers kind of stick into it you know that's okay had a lot of practice with now and laters so it don't bother you too much I think that they need to get better paper because it's sort of like stuff to it you know I think that they could do a little bit of treatment to the paper or more treatment to the paper get just like a higher quality wax paper that is really delicious oh my god okay y'all need to sell that in popsicle form that one's really good it's a little hard to chew it definitely does have a tacky texture to it it's kind of getting stuck to my teeth for me that's a little inconvenient it's just only a little bit it's not yeah I'll only dog like half a point lemon tastes like any other lemon candy you know sourness and her bitterness which doesn't really bother me that much it is not as good as the berry very good team River so this one's called my little lemon heaven that's cute what's next next up is orange beautiful aren't you beautiful maybe a little bit a little bit the orange one does not mask the taste of the teach the at all I definitely taste cannabis it's not nasty it just has that like earthiness that you don't really expect when when you have a really well-made edible so the last one that I'll be testing is lime a good person I'm a good person are you that's disgusting okay it's this good it is disgusting and it's really sour I don't know II love lime flavor like I like limes ooh that's nasty who does next I'm not gonna spit it out because I need my medication but oh that's nasty it tastes like expired spray was consumed by a STONER pissed out and then repackaged as some new health to drink I don't like it at all it's nasty would s gross I thought the women was gonna be the worst flavor the line is hate it hate it so what I'm gonna do is take about just half more of the very good things because it was very very delicious I really really liked the flavor on this one like I said only thing that I don't really care for is the texture I do think that yes it's taffy I think it's supposed to be a little bit more fun cute recreational but it's really hard to get off the roof or your mother or your teeth Cheers oh right now my pain level is right now my pain level is actually not that bad it's maybe had a 5 out of 10 a 5 out of 10 so it's manageable earlier it was much higher like around 7 or 8 and that's why I decided let me just go ahead and try and get dress into this video but right now it's kind of cool down I think because I was moving around I keeping my mind off of it I think this will be really really helpful so yeah I'm gonna watch some Doctor Who and report that then maybe like our so that [ __ ] hey if they're dead late I still feel my cramps but there may be like like a 2 or a 3 they're still manageable the high for me it's a little bit more heady it's also like kind of sitting in my chest I noticed like the first sign that it was starting to hit with that my heartbeat started going a little bit faster for whatever reason it's odd it didn't cause anxiety or anything but that's just the first effect that I noticed and oh and then after that I just started to feel like scattered I went from not wanting to do anything today at all to feeling like ok I can manage the pain I might do a little bit of yoga so I mean I think that's dope like I could see a change already especially also a change in mood it's not necessarily that I feel productive it's just that I am in a place where it's like oh I can finally kind of take care of myself because yoga does help it wasn't heavy yoga or anything nothing fast or sweaty just kind of moving my body in a way that felt natural and in a way it I guess it was intuitive type of movement so so far I'm really appreciating it like I said I think my pain level is more like at a 3 now I think it's only about like 3540 minutes later my metabolism is really fast so edibles to hit me pretty fast I am gonna eat some food real quick as well I have the munchies so bad like edibles always do that to me like I get crazy munchies with edibles so I have the munchies really really bad so I'm gonna eat some food and watch more TV and if there's an update I'll check in later I'll see you guys soon continues to lesson because I can't function I'm trying I'm Jack I'm here present okay so I just forced myself to get up so I could check in with y'all I'm very smacked I'm very much enjoying it probably still gonna do with some more because it does feel really really good I don't want to go over the edge I am still gonna wait a little bit longer it's been about 20 minutes since my last check-in so I think that's almost an hour and almost up there it feels really good I feel like I'm gonna take a nap and I really I need to eat and I'm probably gonna go to sleep but I'm gonna say that my final score for Betty's daddy's is gonna be um I think a 4 out of 5 4 out of 5 and I am really happy with the end result again and result being I'm pain-free which was the main reason why I was using today you know so anyways thanks guys for tuning in I appreciate you supporting me if you want to support support oh if you would like to support me further you can follow me on instagram

this is your boy benji i'm out peace", "yW0GEEAbhn8": "I already did my intro I did like five intros for this I have forgot to hit record the intro is bit [ __ ] intro this is the intro we're eating edibles three edibles this is the intro always remember to hit record edible day edible day to edible day second try what we have we're just gonna do it again for a like foreplay this is edible gum it's a soft - that's what I was going for gum is soft these are soft it's a soft - peach mango flavored and you can see it's open because I opened it on take one before I realized I wasn't recording so that's why that's open but I never ate it yet that's number one you can see here - soft chews five milligrams per - and then we have a package date of February 10th 2020 that's good that's cool their gummies not a big deal what's in them ingredients sugar water but they're gummies - all the gummy ingredients we have Edison bites this is a chocolate truffle check it out down here chocolate truffle dark chocolate 112 gram unit 12 gram unit my unit is a much bigger 10 milligrams in the unit the unit goes in your mouth you can just let it sit and melt and then swallow the unit to the unit and spit it out we're talking about recreational cannabis let's have some fun next up or or drift this is spearmint chocolate ah spirit chocolate mental check out down here read for yourself I can't speak spearmint chillers 5 units total of 10 milligrams two ten milligrams so five minutes two milligrams each all right so I'm opening this one again I actually did just open this like two minutes ago but I forgot to hit record Oh price we always forget that right I don't have impressionist this he's given to me from a friend who said [ __ ] try this out do a review let's get them oh let's see they are two little candies and a silica gel so I'm gonna try gummy mmm really soft tastes like a peach mango juice more peachy than mango there's a little bit of sugar on the outside a little gritty but there's a slight cannabis taste in there too I'm gonna save a gummy for a little later because I'm gonna try this Edison chocolate truffle dark chocolate drop a couple topic I'm interested let's crack this little sealy here Celie cracked there it is this is a ball of chocolate that's what it is that's what it is oh there's a little design there's a little weed leaf sciency design on there for Edison as you can see that's their design their logo Edison like smart people like smart stuff doing doing science see smart stuff and now our logo is science C and we D that's what's going on there cool I don't care about the logo I care about the chocolate okay it's just it's splitting in half so I'm just gonna open it in half for you to show you oh look at that I'm just gonna eat half so you can actually split that in half and take a 5 milligram dose if you like [ __ ] yeah that is a delicious dark chocolate truffle Oh price everybody wants to know the price the dark truffle for $7.99 ten milligram dark chocolate or $7.99 dark chocolate is delicious that's a good soft chocolate that just melts in your mouth it's creamy and it's not too rich you know that Rick stuff where you're like oh I only need one glows well it's not this I need all of that and then some that was fantastic the benefit to the chocolate is it just melts in your mouth and fills your mouth and then your whole entire mouth is just absorbing the THC and when it does that it you get high faster your body's like yeah all right third item third item Aurora drift spearmint chillers Aurora drift spearmint chillers these are mint I presume they're mints there is five units there is two milligrams in each unit marks twelve package date no expiry date that's its MCT oil so this is all the ingredients that make up the candy but it does not say what type of cannabis extract is in it I'm going to presume it's distillates that's it that's all we can do is presume at this point because they don't give us the information we want somebody should change that write a letter that's sealed and there's also this plastic seal this sticker is harder to get off than anything I'm worse than the childproof tabs here's the childproof tabs we'll squeeze these in and if there's two of you if there's two kids both of you grab onto one of these is push in and then you get to pull this out like that's not childproof all right we're all I can smell them smelling spearmint there they are they're ease cool this should be hard to [ __ ] up so if this tastes bad don't make candies anymore Aurora now it's experiment hard candy you got to really love spearmint candies too want to be able to take in your tea see this way the benefit to this though is this candy sits in your mouth for a longer period of time I don't really want to chew it but if you suck on this the THC gets absorbed in the blood vessels in your mouth quicker so you're hi come come on a little quicker you know so it just tastes like candy there's no cannabis taste in there gonna taste spearmint it's not even candy it's a [ __ ] Mick it tastes like experiment hard little sucky thing hard little sucky I'm just gonna eat all three of these then I need to I'm gonna eat all four I'm a big loss for moe this one's kind of a myth in terms of recreational fun Ness this one's a rat all right Aurora drift spearmint mint hard candies not too sure those are probably for old people in my experience hard candies never were a big seller when I came to edibles I don't know I I'm not gonna recommend these Aurora has a couple different products that are better the spearmint Aurora drift mints are gonna come in at a four point eight next up the for a candy gummy I have one left each is five milligrams it's immediately soft I like it five milligram candies you know this will be a flat seven you know yay triumphs and then the Edison byte truffle [ __ ] a that's a good chunk up as a delicious that's gonna come in in 8.3 because it's so delicious I would continue to eat those chocolates if they are lined up non-stop something I would want after I'm high that's how good it tastes Edison Bates the best ones eight point two or three eight point three eight point two not sure what I'd said earlier by them us thirty milligrams ain't gonna work do much dope [Music]", "ofx4nYq-uFQ": "[Music] hi this is Craig from so Tata Grove I'm here with Valerie and today we are going to be taste testing the juicy peach mango I have had this one before many years ago the one that I had a long time ago I remember it being very watery so I'd never really had a good one so hopefully this one is going to be better this is a very dull knife not my good those mango e oh yeah it's like a really strong thing this much it's a little overripe bite looks like but a butter knife probably put this better when you cut through the skin [Music] so I don't know too much about this one it's a Zales variety it doesn't come up that often I don't have one in the ground so let's give it a try it's very overwrite um that's pretty watering but then there is two like the manga classic one it definitely it tastes it tastes like a peachy mango and to me the the closest flavor to just a regular mango flavor is peach a lot of them have kind of a peachy tone to it this one tastes kind of like a watery peach hmm like a super water down and maybe this one's always like that juicy peach is not you know juicy peach sounds better than watery peach but that kind of seems to me it's not bad it's it is it's got a great texture it's got some sweetness it's got a little bit of flavor but not a whole lot it wouldn't be bad in like a fruit salad or something but it's but it means that super watery it's not as watery as like a mango that's gotten too much water in the fruit split kind of thing but it's just a little bit weak it's uh feels like 80% of a mango and yeah it's okay this was a little getting it so this little overripe so it's a little bit mushy and maybe they're not always this watery but it's just got it's got a this could be one of those peach pieces out of fruit cocktail and probably couldn't tell the difference you know and that's not bad but it's just you know it's a mango it ought to be it ought to be a few notches higher than that so this one again maybe that's why this one's not terribly popular is that it it's just not that great but texture wise this good sweetness is good and there's nothing bad about it it's just kind of dull so yeah I'd give it a solid 6 yeah anyway not terrible just there's a lot of better ones out there and zil's in particular has a lot of way better ones than this one so that may be why they're not building it up that much just because they've got some other ones like coconut cream and and fruit punch and cotton candy and other ones that are so much better anyway it's okay just not great oh well thanks for watching and we'll see you next time [Music] pick the mango from the tree and the mango down to me", "P-J1zyiYkGI": "hi everybody so today we're gonna be doing another teatime eliquid review and this is gonna be on peach mango this is the newest flavor that they have out they've now got four flavors it was the cherry vanilla the blueberry candy cane which is actually one of my all-time favorites and then they had the citrus mint which was my next all-time favorite and now they've got the peach mango so we're gonna go ahead and taste this these do come in zero three six and twelve milligrams of nicotine this one does not have any nicotine included it does show zero nicotine but I'm gonna put the label anyways right about there for the warning for nicotine and we're gonna go ahead and try this I do have it in 60 mils that's how they come they are $24.99 and 60 mils oh wow it smells good but it's not like one it's a it smells like the both of them oh my goodness okay now remember that these actually are unsweetened eliquids there

gonna go ahead and I've got a fresh wick so we're gonna try it on my tiny mod which I almost totally forgot about but I love this little kit and this RDA works just like a big pro RDA so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna try this oh my god that smells so good and I love this tiny kit if you haven't seen my review on it you've got to see it it's like the tiniest kit ever and it's an RDA you've built in your wicket it's so freakin cute so let's go ahead and try this it blends it perfectly you don't get just mango you don't get just peach it blends it equally I do have on the aftertaste a little bit more peach than I do the mango oh yeah that's if you like peach and you like mango you're gonna like this and in the end it's got like a tea it's got that tea flavor that that signature black tea flavor in the end if you're looking for something that's a tea flavor and you like mangoes and peaches you'll like this one if you use Wendy vapes you'll get 25% off I'll leave the code down

osterberg founder of baking betty's here at the mall of america in bloomington minnesota and we use premier's new edible ink printer eddie for printing all our logo cookies baking buddies i started it in california i love to bake growing up and i just i would bring cookies to work and i thought hey what a great idea i should start a business doing cookies even though i've never worked in food before so i started doing wholesale and stuff like that and i started out with one cookie flavor now we have 26 different flavors and i moved back to minnesota a year ago and opened at the mall of america where we are today so we were getting a ton of requests to do custom logo cookies custom images on cookies prior to using the eddie we used these edible frosting sheets where you had to print individually and you had to peel them off one by one i was trying to you know research different products and try different products to you know find the the best solution for us with the eddie it just is a better quality product it saves us a ton of time because you're actually printing right to the cookie the turnaround time to package is just it's huge for us it definitely helps that it's nsf certified because we're supposed to only use nsf certified products with food it's very important that it's a stainless steel a food grade printer just it's very easy to use so you can just pop the cookies right onto the eddy take them off it's easy to clean it's just a very seamless process it just prints i mean it looks like literally it just printed off of a printer you would never be able to tell that this is you know printed on an edible you know with edible ink on a cookie like it just the quality of it is just so amazing recently we did a project for 800 of the logo cookies and we used eddie for the first time with that large of a project and it went super smooth such an amazing process every single cookie all 800 looked exactly the same the images were crisp and perfect the eddie has been amazing for us with these large orders i feel like anybody could learn how to use the eddie printer in a matter of like a day so it was very very easy seamless process i think the biggest thing was just adjusting like the cookie size and making sure you have the icing right and once you got that down i think it's pretty quick and easy so it just creates an all-around better product for the customer and saves us a lot of time", "lTUsjFbHHto": "today Kevin and I are going to be trying three bang potent brain and a body fuel these are energy drinks aren't they this is the Purple Haze this is the blue rise and peach mango these were a dollar ninety eight each at a Walmart and we actually bought six of these so I'm gonna try three of them now and then we'll try three of them in a different video but you look to love and you said there are 18 there's 18 different flavors on their way yeah that's a lot of clerks I did not know that when we bought them a Walmart had I'm sitting right when you walked in the door and they only had these three flavors a we I've never heard of these before and I don't even think I've ever tried an energy energy drink before anyway center Red Bull or in them no I've really never had a Red Bull err what is one called monster yeah I've never had any of them so this will be a new experience for me but when I show them in that grocery haul a lot of you had seen them try them heard of them had had had different flavors that I didn't even know existed Walmart had the six up front and I thought that was all there was and apparently there's all kinds of abundance so this is the Purple Haze it is zero calories per hand it just contains no fruit juice okay so and it says warning too much caffeine might cause nervousness irritability sleeplessness and occasionally rapid heartbeat not recommended for use by individuals under 18 years of age one serving of Bank provides 300 milligrams of caffeine which is more than 2 cups of coffee and says so Kevin you did some looking on their web website that talks with all the different caffeine and stuff from different drinks and this this one was one of the higher almost clear um this was one of the higher ones as far as the energy drinks go up so your new drinks are not this hot they're like 100 or so but like just to for comparison I wrote a man a can of coke classic is thirty four milligrams Mountain Dew which we always be totally misses three hundred yeah this is 300 so when we were kids we always heard Mountain Dews got almost caffeine in Phillips 54 milligrams I mean it is twice as many for 300 M in LA which is a local drink which we were also telling that time the caffeine am only 37 and if Pepsi has 38 if you buy 16 out Starbucks Grande coffee its 330 so if you drink one of those a day if you got more than one of these anyways yeah I thought that was interesting we don't drink Starbucks either no but six no coffees not very much I don't think oh that's very good good looking breaker yes I really like that that is not at all what I was expecting I could drink that all the time yeah I don't know if I want 300 milligrams of caffeine that's very hard it's like are you gonna have to peel me off the ceiling yeah you know it really makes it the twitching but I really like that before you're a really nice grape flavor it's not harsh it's not like I didn't know what to expect you know cuz like look Roy things like that are very very harsh and there is no harshness to this this reminds me of drinking like one of the clear American waters from from Walmart it's very sweet and it was great Dre how about I was having a prequel I know yeah and I didn't even know that when I bought it that it was no at the thought oh hey here's a new drink we'll try decas most energy drinks have some calories and this is the key on the other here's your blue trying to stick to the mountain to the gamer of fuel and then we try the gamer fuel I don't know do not drive or deny don't know something mean anger he and a new bride ride I just don't remember that this is blue rice I mean I know I bought it but I don't remember I don't remember trying I remember giving her a sip because we we talked about the can't Liz that's right now took a sip and it was good I don't like that - it tastes like raspberry like I don't like it would be like a candy raspberry it's very very strong I could do I like the great one better just because I like the flavor of great though but I really like that oh yeah it's good ah personally raspberry when I drink it instead of eating candy it's like drinking game yeah yeah this is the one that scares me because we love mango and peace make you - mango can taste the same but they're all clear yeah which is good that means there's no dyes and coloring in something yeah so this is the this is the one that I'm thinking if we're gonna pop her then that raspberry hit me breathe hard pleasantly surprised to speech it's just peach I really don't get a mango course peach a mango are very similar they are but mango is usually a funky gone off peach that's not that is actually not someone I would drink all the time but remind you the peach rings the gummy Pete rings that's what kinda remind you of Walmart the clear American they have a peach and it's really good and for a little while I was buying it but then I was a cream person they have a peaches and cream but then I just have P Oh golden peach apples or something but I tried both and I just I got sick of it very very quickly it's just even though it was good there was nothing wrong with it it was very sweet peachy it's not something I want all the time so I feel the same way about this one I really like it they did a terrific job with it it's very sweet very very good if you like peach you will like that a lot but it's for me I wouldn't buy it all the time because I know that I would get tired of that very well then out of the three grape is done any good yes I love that the grape I drink all the time the peach would be my second the oh really because I write spurious you just don't like it no just goes all through me but right I mean yeah I really like these I'm very impressed there's they're just very very sweet like drinking candy and you said on the website you said something about them promoting fat loss it's it was fat enhancement and fat loss enhancement and energy for your workouts or something like that that's their marketing material right and in reality it's got tons of caffeine that's gonna make your body vibrate and you're gonna burn yeah that's what it is it's just for Cathy yeah I mean I don't believe the fat loss thing at all yeah it might help promote a little bit better fat loss there studies out there that don't they say caffeine we doing workouts help weight loss I don't think about that we don't like that but I think if you if you already drink energy drinks or drink hot caffeinated drinks you can try to get traffic yeah but if you don't drink a lot of caffeine already I don't think I would touch these because they are so hot on caffeine yeah if you disagree glar like I took water all day long so I mean if I were to drink coffee I drink some called like three or four cups of coffee a day right if I'm saying it each one these is two cups of coffee and I'm gonna sit there drink this I'm thinkin like 12 cups of coffee good if I was if I was going to drink one of these then I would make sure that I didn't drink two cups of coffee so normally yes so normally in a day I will I've been very recently drinking three cups of coffee a day that's just what I do three caps so I drink two in the morning basically so if I was going to drink one of these I just wouldn't drink those two cups at all and it would be the same thing so you just have to decide which one you want you know the flavor of the candy or the copper so but I think I think good good they're definitely good for what they are for sure even for I wish they would almost sell them as regular just sparkling drinks and take all the caffeine out and they could think price off more on they would so I would bomb all the time if they did that would be a replacement for the Walmart ones they're going why yes yes because they're Walmart they clear American I can't find any of the ones even the bring that up you know I can't even find nothing but the the other would be an excellent reflection floods if they would take something I wish they were watching because yes if they took some of that caffeine out I would this would be my replacement even though they are more expensive I would pay more for that flavor because it's so good I really like that so I hope you all enjoyed getting hear about them and like I said we're gonna be doing another review with three more of these so thanks for watching [Music]", "Rw223hTdWs8": "hey guys thanks for cooking my Tammy today I'm gonna show you how to make my delicious quick and easy

peach and mango puree and adding it to a large pot adding water and what seems to be a ton of sugar but because we're making syrup we're gonna make the exception giving everything a quick stir to combine all of the ingredients before moving on to squeezing our fresh lemons at this point we'll be straining the peach and mango puree don't worry guys I don't have three hands during work makes the teamwork taking my peach mango juice I'm going to add it to a pitcher filled with ice along with our fresh lemon juice and water stirring once more and tasting for sweetness the great thing about this

use frozen if need be oh i dropped one he's trying to get away i got him so like i was saying these are fresh strawberries but if you want to use frozen strawberries that's going to be fine as well no problem so the strawberries themselves this also goes for the mangoes that's enough sweetness in it by itself so if you're not medicating this you don't have to put any extra sugar in it or honey or anything like that if you're doing just straight up popsicles you're going to use just the strawberries and just the mangoes you guys know we're doing hours goodies 420 style so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take our special honey our medicated honey and we're going to add some in here let's go ahead and do that [Music] here we go very nice medicated honey if you don't know how to make

we want to go ahead and just pour this into something set it to the side we're going to wash this out and then we're going to get ready to do the mango okay [Music] all right guys so we have our strawberries in another container right now we have this cleaned and we're ready to go so let's go ahead and do the same exact thing i have the mango right here and that is two mangoes that we washed peeled pitted and cut up that's two mangoes all right so we did that then we're going to do the same thing as before and put our special medicated honey in there all right so we got our honey in there i got the top on the next step is let's make this a puree let's do it [Applause] all right that's going to do it all right guys so what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take our mango and our strawberry mixtures that we have here and we're going to put mango then strawberry then mango we're going to fill it up a third so that we can have uh both in there so let's go ahead and

water from the dry pipe let's do it so here's some of the edibles that we actually got it's mostly like a hundred milligrams for the whole bar or bag of gummies or pack of cookies so they end up being about 10 milligrams per piece i think all of them except these nano gummies here those are like five milligrams per piece but i had 20 gummies in it and then you can see i've got some capsules here these are 50 milligrams so one of these equals five of any of the other pieces essentially that's why capsules are my favorite edible i'd rather just take a bunch of thc and then eat whatever i want later how do you think gordon ramsay would rate my plating do we kill it so like i said the capsules are my favorite because most of the edibles i got are like 100 milligrams for the whole candy bar the whole pack of gummies but two of these is 100 milligrams so this is most edibles right here so capsules are my preferred way to take it i'd rather get high and then eat cookies and brownies and not try to get high from eating the cookies and brownies i don't know high enough from edibles is usually i'm going to sleep i don't love edibles they don't hate everybody the same way like i mentioned 100 milligrams isn't gonna do the same to everybody a thousand isn't gonna do the same to everybody i've eaten as much as two thousand milligrams i have an edible mukbang video on my channel it's a pretty good brownie it's like little brownie bites little cookie bites that's pretty good it's kind of crispy i think i'm going to get a bunch of these and fill them up and eat them like like the cookie crisp cereal i'll be dope so nothing too it's just a lot of eating i mean i like eating but but damn this is expensive food they have a few of the better brands that are in other other states i got some wanna here i've had these in colorado like some of the better gummies in colorado the chocolate's really good see i'd rather eat this still only 100 milligrams for a whole candy bar sometimes i can eat a couple hundred milligrams of edibles and not really feel it so so being a couple pieces of chocolate a piece of brownie a piece of cookie that's only 40 milligrams and these are 50 each so let's do another 100 right here oh yeah see that's a good one i think i want to continue this outside so let's go over there all right let's see these wanna gummies are as good as i remember they have a good flavor but they're like they're kind of spongy i don't know how to explain it i said the consistency is a little different than a typical gummy but i like it i'll show you some nano gummies i think these ones are sugar-free okay not bad some people prefer to be able to taste the edibles when they're eating some people do not want to taste the edibles what do you guys think drop a comment let me know do you prefer to be able to taste a little bit of wheat in there do you not like it at all i mean tasting i guess reminds you eating an edible but you should already know what you're eating it's not great on flavor but it's it's medical marijuana it's medicine it doesn't need to taste amazing but it helps i don't know if these are the true gels or the vince ones but let's eat these pineapple ones from truly see these ones are really good but the consistency though a lot stickier than the other ones they're not as chewy as the other ones they're more like just like really sticky so i kind of get all in your mouth as my grandpa would say but i don't know where we're at on milligrams but i'm going to take another 100 i think this will put me at at least 300 maybe we're at close to four with all the pieces we've eaten all right we're almost at 400 milligrams let's see if we can get the 420 just like i don't want to eat all this right now i had some chinese food earlier today some fried rice you know i'm just gonna chew on all the gummies together gotta [Music] not gross but no they're gross i'm just gonna be chewing forever and that's how edibles work for me i have no idea how many milligrams i've eaten but i'm not worried at all because it's not going to be enough it's not good i said the three flavors of gummies were all battling it out of my mouth but that caroleep nano got me a [ __ ] one am i gonna eat this whole plate [Music] i guess um see the chocolate bar topped here chocolate bars are always primo it makes me wonder are chocolate bars the easiest thing to make like like we just take weed out of the equation and we're making stuff what's easier to make cookies brownies gummies chocolate bars i'm thinking with the chocolate bar they just melt chocolate mix the weed in it and then they just they get it cold in the shape my mom just told me we just spoke for like 10 minutes on the phone i forgot what i was doing um what was i saying guys somebody could somebody help me what was i saying i think we were just finishing these edibles i think i was trying i think chocolate bars are probably the easiest to make i feel like anywhere i've been to get edibles the chocolate bars always taste the best right my mama [ __ ] they're just like cookies and brownies we're both dry oh man that's a lot of edibles let's give me any more [ __ ] get another 100 down there we go here we go i think the wanna gummies my favorite although the truly ones are pretty close second they're just like different consistencies of gummy i think i'm more in the mood for the wanna ones now um if they all fit together there's only [Music] one how many milligrams do you eat bro we went for a nice long walk earlier but i might do another one i mean just look at him would you just look at him [Music] did you just look [Music] i feel so safe there's a kitty in here should we smoke a song before the doubles are kicking [Music] all right we're still waiting one thing about edibles i don't like i like taking a [ __ ] fatty bong rip and then my high is just like i'm like as high as i'm gonna be almost right after sometimes you know i'm gonna kind of take this off from there and like i said for me like edibles sometimes hit or miss sometimes i i'll eat a few hundred milligrams and just not feel it there's definitely a fun thing about edibles i couldn't do edibles every day i wouldn't enjoy wheat as much i don't think if i could only do edibles i mean maybe i'd figure it out but for me it's like either i think i didn't get high from it or i'm like i know i'm high from it and i'm just really sleepy i do like a 2 000 milligram edible mustang in one of my videos but i've got higher from other things when i smoked an eighth of weed in nine minutes i got higher than when i ate two grams of thc edibles basically and i think about this sometimes they ate the wheat has way less thc than 2 000 milligrams so it's like i've got higher from smoking flour than i have from eating edibles now mind you the edibles do last longer it is a different kind of powder but i'm just talking about me in my head sitting there and going oh you're high maybe i'm higher than i think i am i've been rambling sitting in this position for four minutes and i have no idea why so maybe i'm higher than i think i am maybe that's what it is maybe edibles hit like an hour ago you know i'm just like higher than i think i have also i did just rip that bomb and that's a good question man and like tinctures i mean this isn't really inedible but it's still in the i'm not smoking category so this is pretty good for some people i think i like this better than edibles but even more so than this i like a tac drink you get something that's really nicely infused and you just drink it it takes effect so much quicker than an edible i eat snacks and junk food all the time but i mostly drink water so when i reward myself with like a juice drink that has thc in it it's like out of the ordinary from what i normally drink and then also it gets me hot so kind of like a cold thing i don't know i'm not kind of on my pump that's not what it's a walmart how long are we i don't know it doesn't say on this i was just like is it 10 seconds is it a minute i can't even remember it doesn't matter [Music] the squares on that break apart easier than any candy bar i don't know how to tell you anytime i've ever tried to snap a hershey's it like snaps crooked right through the middle of one of me bro it's segmented how's this happening this is about amount perfectly there's so much chocolate how you [ __ ] up chocolate you're dome oh i kind of did a thing i mean it's just not as bright it still exists but let's get high about it [Music] oh these are just some of my uh adult gummies they have a medicine in them you wouldn't like them you wouldn't be interested how many milligrams [Music] like 10 each uh what they're not for you they're not for you because they're too weak damn [ __ ] kids man well if you like this video don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more content and check out my other social media in the

here's my dog's butt who's your good boy have a dumb day", "sm63HKhhdWY": "here what's good you guys it's your girl crystal k and today i'm back at it again with another video we're gonna be making some bourbon peach cobbler and this joint is so bomb now i know summertime is coming up but i keep making these fat ass recipes so i don't know what i'm gonna do exactly i'm thinking maybe i need to hit the gym a little bit more because i don't think that this is gonna work out but um yeah let's get right into the video we'll think about that later so we're just gonna add in our frozen peaches to a large pot and we're gonna cook that on medium low heat and then we're gonna add in a stick of butter now you can do this in a cast iron skillet and just bake the whole thing like from there like once you cook down the peaches and then put on the topping and just bake it in the oven like that that'll probably be the easiest way but for this video i am doing it the hard way i guess but um yeah so we're just gonna cook this down until the peaches are not frozen the peaches are not frozen anymore so now we're going to add in our sugars our brown sugar white sugar our cinnamon and our nutmeg and just stir that like an around tree always wanted more day job bother me but i get money now in my opinion our ancestors were geniuses because they were literally making the best food out of nothing like this is literally peaches butter and sugar like this whole recipe well besides the flour but literally like that's all it is and it's the best thing on this planet well one of the best things but yeah they was really out here really doing it like and then look at the fried chicken like look how basic that is just taking these basic ingredients and just making the best out of nothing so now we're going to add in our vanilla extract and some lemon juice i added in some lime juice because i didn't have any lemon and now we are going to add in our bourbon and just stir that around i really just got mad hype for no reason like i was dead proud of my ancestors but now we're going to take some corn starch and just pour some of the the liquid that we made or the juice whatever you want to call it and stir that around until it looks like this we're going to pour it back in and we're going to cook that for um i'd say about five minutes until it gets like slightly thickened and then we should be good to go yeah all right so you see how it's like slightly thicker now this is what i'm talking about um and it should look something like this i'm gonna do the little liquid test for you guys just like a little like a little thicken you know you know what i'm talking about so now we're going to make our topping so to some flour we're going to add in some baking powder and we're going to add in some salt then we're going to add in some sugar some brown and some white sugar and then just stir that around now for the measurements they're going to be in the description box [Music] then we're going to add in some cold butter and just work that with our hands now you can use a pastry cutter but um i don't know i just find the easiest to do with my hands so that's what i'm going to do it's going to take me a minute but you know youtube time take me real quick [Music] [Music] then we're going to add in some hot boiling water and stir that around [Music] now once it's done it should look like this and then we're going to go ahead and pour our peaches into a baking dish and then top it off with the toppings now i like to just put big old droplets on there and just spread it afterwards so that's what you're going to see me doing here and i'm trying to make sure that i don't cover like the edges so that i can get a good flick even though in my opinion peach cobbler does not look the best like it tastes better than it looks but i'm trying to do the best that i can to get a good thumbnail so that's what i'm doing and then we are just going to sprinkle some sugar on top and bake that for 20 to 25 minutes so this is what it looks like when it comes out the oven you know giving me really peachy bobs here um yeah like i said it's not the best looking dessert but it tastes so fire so i'm gonna go ahead and plate it up for me for you guys i'm using i'm gonna use this um halo top ice cream that i had in my in my freezer because i didn't have regular ice cream so um yeah it's gonna do the job and it's gonna get the job done and it's still gonna be bomb so this is me cutting into it and i'm just gonna plate now we're going to put a little mint on top and that is the best you're going to get peach cobbler to look like honestly it's so good it's so far make sure you guys check out this recipe um i wanted to add in that all of the juices got soaked up by the bread so it's like you know really extra moist but yeah let me know what you guys think in the comments and i'll see you next video [Music] later [Music]", "SwJ9S0J7x_Y": "[Music]

right here so we've got to flatten it out on this tray so I've heard of carving the bowl what would be carving the week uh it's got nothing to do with that stoners aren't known for their he wants terminology but uh you basically have to heat it up to activate it so it'll be primed two keys with the buggers so we want to put it in the oven first show the camera look at it so we're gonna put it

honestly unintentional I wasn't feeling yeah [Music] okay so let's divide our wet into these three bowls okay yes I have motivation well I think we all know why that is my parents wanted me to see

i'm amber and this is kelly and we're going to do another video for you guys so tonight we thought given that it's saint patrick's day we would maybe go ahead and do something green we're not very festive tonight callie yeah or not no well your shirt says happy oh my bracelet and your your bracelet's green your sweater this morning was green but i'm not very festive with my red and my black but that's okay we're making sure we are we are going to make a green shamrock shake because we love shamrock shakes we used to love shamrock shakes at mcdonald's mcdonald's when we used to eat mcdonald's we don't eat mcdonald's very often anymore now but we love their shamrock shake so we're gonna make the healthier version of the shamrock shake tonight for st patrick's day and then we also thought we would do another fun one we've been looking and eyeballing this recipe for a while yeah because cali she loves a good chewy candy she really does and she loves starbursts so we came across a strawberry it's supposed to be lemonade starburst fruit a super fruit super fruit food chew that is a tongue twister kelly can you say it better than i can starting lemonade limeade superfood chews hot you did better than me so we're going to make a couple of things for you and we're going to get started so kelly should we get started on the shake first do you want to shake first we'll do our green saint patty stay shamrock shake first i'll get some you want to grab the blender okay callie's going to get the blender just just the top no just the top yep yep okay bring it on over we can always go over there mix all righty so miss kelly you want to grab the ice i think we'll put the ice in the there's a bottom full in there yep so we've had this shamrock shake a few different ways sometimes we add chocolate and make it chocolate mint but tonight we're just gonna stick with the traditional shamrock shake i can't see any hold on let's see if we can get our comments nope we can't see any comments and it's not really showing us anything tonight so we don't know if we're having a technical glitch or not but can you say hello just so we know that our comments are working we're going to do six ice here should we double this recipe do you think we should share with your brothers and your dad okay okay so let's maybe double it these shakes are always huge i think doubling it will still give us lots so say a quick hello if you can hear us because we can't seem to see the comments right now i'm not sure it doesn't seem to be working well so yeah let's do 12. let's do 12 cubes so we're doubling the recipe for the sandbox shake so this shamrock shake is the low carb mint milkshake from brianna thomas so you can find it on her website and we will um post a link in the card somewhere oh the comments are working hello nice to see you thanks for commenting three four five six seven and we're being very precise tonight eight okay i'm gonna get your spinach ready okay so we're gonna put in a whole bunch of spinach to make a green you're daydreaming while you're doing that do you have a tough day long day at school maybe zoning out all right so we are gonna get the spinach ready hi julia um so we are going to put in so it's supposed to be one cup of loosely packed spinach but we're going to put in enough for two so two cups do you want to grab a measuring cup i'll grab a measuring cup you throw the ice away how's that done oh dear okay so we're gonna do some loosely packed we get a little generous on our spinach and our cheeks we really like having spinach on our shakes like you don't even notice you don't even know what's there right we had a chocolate hazelnut shake last night with supper it was kind of a strange color because of the spinach but that's all right we didn't mind right oh no okay two cups of spinach callie do you want to grab the almond milk yep yeah grab it grab the open one yeah that sounds good is this a open one nope i got it how much do i need you're gonna need we're gonna double again so you're gonna need it says half a cup so you're gonna need one cold cup you wanna just use this one that we've got out you might as well keep rolling with it [Music] can't join um what's that we gotta use until we can't anymore did you give it a shake good job i shook the other one oh you shook this one i think you're gonna need both i think you need both we kind of have a weird angle going here tonight yeah there we go until we get the tripod how is everybody doing on this st patrick's day anybody having green food our kids had green lunches they had uh spinach in their waffles for their school lunch so they had green waffles and they had micro greens and they had celery and green peppers was a real green lunch for school today any more this one's really fully let me give you a hand yes okay so how much did i say we were going to need one cup right once it's pretty like much like three quarters it's pretty close we might have to add some more depending on how thick this ends up okay cali next up the cottage cheese cheese you want to grab that yep all right callie's getting the cottage cheese i love the cottage cheese in these shakes because it is the perfect way to imitate ice cream in this shake so this is like a milkshake this one so you need the cottage cheese the traditional shamrock shake is actually ice cream based if you look at like ones that are not tma to thm they are actually ice cream based usually so i'll need a cup of this are you gonna need a cup actually that says a third so you're gonna need two thirds of a cup sweetie okay all right you got it oh i'll get you a tablespoon it smells interesting so it smells interesting does it smell like cottage cheese hopefully it's not smelling funky okay so you're going to need two for this side if it smells like cottage cheese we're doing the smell test it smells perfectly like cottage cheese to me i don't know what you're smelling but so we're using low fat cottage cheese just because that's what i tend to have in the house did it really callie read further into the recipe than i did apparently well it called for the low fat but this is an s shake so you could go full fat if you have it but i think we just don't want to get too crazy on our calories here with this shake no no need for it we like this one this one um again we've mentioned before we are in canada and we have some phenomenal cottage cheese if you buy the land one percent it tastes excellent if you buy the other one percent brands they're terrible so this is the one that we go with sitter probably be generous we like the cottage cheese in there you want me to hold it up so you can scrape it in get this in view so people can see you in action [Music] how's everybody's wednesday going it's hump day we're almost through the halfway point it is hump day right oh yeah yeah it is wednesday oh boy it's been a long week it's been a long long week one tablespoon mm-hmm keep going all right i'm gonna get the next ingredient ready we're gonna need some heavy cream and we are gonna need again we're doubling the recipe so we're gonna need four tablespoons of the heavy whipping cream you're getting close we're getting it all over the counter i don't care keep going keep it up good it's like the whole container is it pretty much the whole container oh not quite not quite that's looking good okay how about i take this from you and you can scrape that in i'm gonna grab the lid go all right we're going to get this put away [Music] maybe i'm going to wipe up your counter there too uh i'll just put this over here yeah you might need it again we'll find out okay so we're going to need to put in some cream and then do you want to grab the next day you're going to call us oh there we go yeah it's gone that's okay we can't take a call right now anyway next ingredient i'm gonna do the whipping cream so why don't you do the collagen okay okay so going back to this we are gonna need four tablespoons of our heavy cream to give it that nice ice creamy taste you got that that's really a big thing of collagen we love to get that huge thing of collagen at costco sometimes it goes on sale for a really good deal and it's it's really nice i like this one because it dissolves completely whether you put it in hot or cold it's really good at dissolving [Music] it's the organica yeah it's a really good one so i need a two tablespoon you need two tablespoons see if i can find one we need to get some more measuring spoons i feel like every time we do a video we're like we need to get that we need to get that we need to make a list just what we need to do we need to make a profit i think we needed scoops in one video we need measuring spoons there's a few things our kitchen is kind of lacking or some things are just showing their age because they were wedding gifts almost 15 years ago my husband and i all right the kitchen stuff kind of got put on the back burner right replacing all of our gadgets okay it doesn't have to be super precise in a shake you don't have to be quite as precise when you're baking you got to be pretty pretty particular but in a shake it's more forgiving so don't worry too much all right where's everybody watching from tonight yeah we are yeah we want to know this is your first video watching us we are in saskatchewan canada and it's a beautiful day we finally have less temperatures that are significantly on the plus side the snow is almost all melted four teaspoons of this it's awesome today four teaspoons okay we're gonna use this super sweet do you say four teaspoons okay kelly's gonna measure in the fourth because it's normally two teaspoons i'm gonna go ahead with the extracts so we are gonna need vanilla extract and we're also gonna need now it did call this recipe actually calls for dried mint but we don't have dried mint in the house and we don't have a garden going yet in the backyard for fresh mint so we are going to go ahead and just use the pure peppermint extract too bad we didn't have like any mint leaves i know we've done mint before in our pots on our back deck and it's been awesome we did mojito mint the one time and we used that for our kombucha and it was so good newport richly oh nice from florida i bet the weather in florida is nice okay kelly i'm gonna go ahead with this and i'm just gonna i'm gonna do we're gonna start with two capfuls we'll see if that's pepperminty enough and if it's not minty enough for our shamrock shake then we'll increase it we can always increase it but i find the mint is pretty powerful can't take it away you can always put more in and i just got it all over myself it's a good thing it smells good okay i'm gonna wash my hands i'll keep this out because we'll need it do we need it again oh this is the super sweet maybe if it's not sweet enough i guess but i don't like i'm pretty sure we don't need it for our other recipe it's just for this one okay so then we're going to add some vanilla and we're going to go through the dash so we're going to add we're going to be generous i love it okay don't worry about that one right now kelly let's just do this one okay so do you want to do the salt it says pinch so maybe do a cup of cranks like i'm gonna do like one crank well it says a pinch so that would be like one pinch and you're doubling it right perfect okay now we have to add the glucky but we have to do it while it's whirling because otherwise we might get it lumpy this stuff as soon as it hits the anything moist anything wet um it clumps up so badly so we are gonna do that over the thing maybe i should bring it over and we can blend it right up here how's that sound okay okay you guys should check out our youtube channel oh you think everyone should go to youtube yes we do have a youtube channel now and we would love if you go over and you go ahead tell them what it's what it's called i'll get the blender donut and okra donut okra yeah and let's grab this people say ogre's a vegetable and it shows it's seeds so i wonder if it's like a frenchy a fruit or a veggie a fredjie as frenchy as a fruit and a veggie oh you mean because okra has seeds in the inside and cucumbers are a fruit because they have seeds on the inside i don't know we might have to google this whether okra is truly a vegetable or whether okra is a fruit or a veggie is it freddy a true thing yeah i figured this is a made up kelly thing a frenchie a thread or a vegetable whatever it is we love it you could put okra in this shake too but we're just going to stick with the way the recipe is written because the okra would probably be tasted in this recipe but it would certainly give it a really nice puddingy milkshake texture we love the texture of okra in our shakes okay do you want to get this started kelly it's going to be super thick so i'm going to get the plunger it's gonna be loud [Music] we want it to be green it's a shamrock shake it's the perfect green okay if you want to grab a scraper we'll scrape down the sides we have a few little tiny chunks of of cottage cheese and a spinach on the side and that's not going to be very nice yeah you want to scrape down those little pieces of cottage cheese and spinach we might actually have to add some more ice we kind of decreased the ice because our ice cubes are big but we might have to increase the ice we'll see we're going to put that glucky in glooky lucky i still haven't figured out if it's glooky or glucky i'd really like if somebody would tell me if it's glooky or glucky so we could be saying it right or lucky yeah i don't know we said glucky for like two years already so now it's hard for me to get that out of my head i want to call it glooky still you want to call it glooky like no lucky clucky gucky lucky and what we can call whatever we want i guess but i'd just like to know what it's really called it's like you scrape these down here we want those chunks of spinach to if you say if it's like if it's glooky can you say if the two o so we can tell it's like okay so cali wants to know if it's glooky or it's glucky or it's glucky like lucky lucky we really want to know somebody tell us somebody help us out okay so i'm going to sprinkle it in i think you just splashed me oh sorry well you'll smell minty you'll be very festive okay i'm gonna sprinkle it in how much did we need hon we need a quarter of a teaspoon for one recipe rounded and we're gonna do double so we're gonna need half a teaspoon around so we're gonna make some noise again and i'm going to sprinkle it in super slowly get it going anytime this hits the liquid it's going to start forming these little rubbery balls of clump it's not very appealing oh she thinks it's like lucky lucky that's what we were hoping lucky so were we saying it right for those two years what did we say before i can't even remember now i think we said we said lucky yeah we said right the whole time so baby we're saying it right well thanks for helping us out letting us know what we should be saying there brandi okay cali so let's add a couple more ice cubes do you want to grab the ice back out it's looking a little thin we want it nice and thick like a true shamrock shape it's gotta be thick perfect maybe add well originally it said we should add eight and you added six right six times two so go ahead add four more let's go the original amount we should have just followed the recipe and done the eight cubes like it said all right i said wrong not lucky oh not lucky oh oops so it isn't lucky it's glooky with two o's like that sound lukey no i'm just confused glooky we're gonna have to retrain our brains callie okay [Music] so now what it said to do is it said once you've got your glucky in there you're supposed to just like let it sit 30 seconds to a minute let that glue activate and then put it back on again and it's supposed to give it the best texture i don't know i'm not a very good rule follower i have a tendency to just throw it all in there why don't you get us some glasses and some straws so yeah i'm not really a rule follower when it comes to the shakes i know many of them say add the protein powder in the last 10 seconds and i'm not so good at following that we like a fluffy shape so we don't we just usually all throw it all in there all right can you reach out get rich our fridge is way too full considering it has nothing in it can you reach it do you need me to grab one yes i don't want a glass to fall on your head no that would have hurt you're going to use that one okay sure you can use that one i'll use this one these oh this looks good let's see look how nice and shamrock shape and it smells like i think we got it had a really minty maybe you could have cut it back we ended up doing half i did two capsules so probably closer to half a teaspoon and it probably definitely could have been more like one one and a half capfuls but we like minty so a shamrock shake should be minty right callie we said we were gonna make for the boys we should better save some hey uh-huh we better just you're having less sure i guess i'm having less it's all right i'll have more if there's enough for everybody to go around let's give it a try um it's really good oh it's really minty i really like it but i honestly i would like to add okra to this i think the texture would be even more milkshake like if you added okra so i think the next time we're going to add two cups of okra one cup per recipe um yeah um you know those um things that you can find at sweet and sprouted which things are we talking about those make your own ice cream package yes you could make some of those and then put it in you totally substitute some of the ice you totally could so kelly thinks next time we make the shamrock shake we should make some homemade sugar-free vanilla ice cream and plop it in there and that's a great idea it would taste even more like a true shamrock shake okay we're gonna hop to our next recipe another really quick one and this one is our strawberry lemon we're calling them lemon limeade because we're out of lemon juice and we do have the strawberry lemonade packets so we're going to use one of these you have the same brown as this for the yeah we normally buy the same brand so we're going to do the strawberry lemon limeade starburst superfood chews um so if you follow in the trim healthy book the superfood chews i believe are in the original trim healthy cookbook but there's not this recipe this recipe was just found on the page on the trim healthy main page so i will still link it in the comments so you can see it there so it's just somebody tweaked the original recipe which is normally a chocolate one and there's a few other variations and we're gonna do a strawberry lemonade hardly any of this stuff that's okay we won't quite have enough of the strawberry protein powder but we will add a little plain two and a half scoops scoops oh this scoop is what you just dropped off of there let me move this out of the way and then we can bring the food processor in and then you can get started on it i can tell you guys kelly is chomping at the she loves starburst if you have any like really good cheap fruit processors food processors yeah we talked about that last time our food processor is very sad when we do one of these videos with it one day it's just going to give us the ghost because it's very old that's okay hopefully it won't be today hopefully it's gonna it smells like strawberries it's a strawberry yeah don't dump it we don't have a lot especially strawberry starburst well that's the goal here we're trying to make something that tastes like strawberry starburst do you want me to just dump it in if you hold the scoop over we'll do it as teamwork okay okay so you're gonna need for these starburst fruit chews oh we've got glooky again oogie i think it says goofy yeah we have to start saying it right callie we're gonna embarrass ourselves saying lucky a hundred times i think i just like that it sounds like a lucky i don't know okay so we need to think that should you maybe we should just call it oh we could call it lucky good point cali okay so we need two and a half scoops of the strawberry trim healthy mama we're using their strawberry protein powder you could probably use a different strawberry one if you've got it use what you've got we're just using what we've got which is apparently not enough one and a half so don't dump that yet because we're gonna top it up we're gonna need two and a half all together so we're gonna need some plain we've just got the plain this is just the trim healthy mama plain protein powder we are in desperate need of going for a shopping trip kelly because that's all i've got left for protein powder in the house and that's like a tragedy okay so we're gonna need two and a half this stuff's fluffier i wonder if they're gonna turn out different with the plane in there oh well we're gonna find out so that's two and then we need another half well maybe the other one's not so fluffy because they don't have it the other one is less fluffy because of flavor i'm not sure why the flavored trim healthy protein powders are less fluffy than that do we need glucose we need no we don't no we need uh collagen you want to grab the collagen one more time and we did have this from our previous recipe that we used it for collagen let me get these other dishes out of the way callie one half see it isn't see me does it mean cup cup yes a c in a recipe would mean cup oh oh half a cup honey so not the table food what's that oh yes not the tablespoon i'm totally wrong you are right i think callie's reading the recipe we have a cup of collagen there's a lot of collagen hence what makes them super food chews there's the half cup cali get some of that in there this is almost like the strawberry really dip it in here turn this like that sideways i'll hang on to it for you this is almost like the strawberry what protein powder because it's like oh the texture the collagen yeah it's the same half cup yep we want to be kind of more exact on this recipe because we want them to turn out where they stick together okay perfect and then we need to see the star ingredients which is going to be floss tea lucy lucy lucy they say glooky they say everybody says something different apparently yeah that's all right i'm gonna call it lucky that is so so so minty next we're going to try it with the dried mint like the recipe calls for see if it makes a difference because i really like that that's the difference between her recipe so okay we're gonna use in this case the recipe calls are you okay you bump your almonds it called for these the true lemon lemonade don't be mistaken and just buy the true lemon that are just the crystallized lemon you need these to be the lemonade mix and there's all different flavors so you could change this recipe i got two more in my hand i need a cup so you can use whatever flavor you want and change the flavor of your starburst fruit shoes to be whatever flavor you buy there you are dear cali is on a mission tonight we are on mission make this video short nice and short we're gonna try and be quick tonight one it smells like strawberry night kelly's gotta head to the bath after this it's like a purple color it is um that smells good this is a real life school weeknight kind of video we gotta be fast right kelly gotta go chop chop so i'm excited if these are good we're gonna buy more of the true lemon packets and do different flavors and we're gonna make a whole like mixture so when we've got those cravings for something chewy and candy-like we can be chomping on these her it's really perfect no there's a good chance cali we'll test it before we completely decide we like the flavor but we used some plain protein powder so there is a chance this might not be just a second okay there's a chance this might not quite be sweet enough because we didn't use all strawberry protein powder we did have to sub some plain in there so we're gonna taste it when it's done and if we need to we'll either add some super sweet or we will add another packet of the lemonade so we're going to have to just be careful of that don't let me forget to try it isn't lemonade like sour yes but there's also sweetener in this this is already pre-sweetened this one it's got um well there's actually cane sugar in here but it's just such a minimal amount and there's stevia leaf extract in there okay callie so it said you're supposed to combine all of this first blitz it up a little bit just so it's all combined evenly so that you're not getting like some that just tastes like collagen pulse it um you just whizz it on low maybe give it a quick whiz go ahead smells like it's burning i don't smell burning i smell lemonade no like when it was whirling then it smelled like oh dear that's just because our food processor is dying okay so to this cali we have to add some lemon juice and then we're gonna process it a little more and then add our coconut oil oh yes the lime juice we're gonna do lime juice because we're out of lemon so two table two tablespoons you can use that tablespoon measure over there extra collagen no all right collagen for what because i have like a little less oh that'd be fine that little tiny bit in the spoon will be fine i'm gonna let callie do the cooking video and i'm just gonna drink the shade give it a good shake those things when they're kind of new you have to yep you're getting it keep going [Music] keep going you're able to see this one you want it to be a bit more precise so that they stick together good keep going keep going a little bit more perfect one okay go ahead with one more we need two tablespoons it's bubbly in there add the lime juice or you could use lemon juice and two tablespoons of coconut oil i'll get the coconut oil started cali okay i'll get it ready to go but i'll wait actually because i don't want to interrupt you and i need to have a measuring spoon excellent i'm just gonna grab a spoon for the coconut why is it bubbly in there in here it's probably reacting with the um the packet of the lemonade that'd be my guess okay i'm going to grab something like that and vinegar yeah sort of like that okay so you need to begin processing and it says says when you put the juice in you need to start processing it like online like on low what no lime juice it smells like really like lemonade oh it smells really good and it's a little crummy it's supposed to be crumbly at this point it's supposed to be crumbly that looks right i'm using kind of a one and a half tablespoon measure and then a half tablespoon because again that's all we have for measuring spoons around here is random random ones so we're gonna use this one is a half so that'll give us two tablespoons of coconut oil i don't think you want to use a coconut oil that has much flavor here we're using this one this one's our favorite you see it there um it's ideal for cooking the omega nutrition one it has no coconut taste whatsoever i just got a sugar so it's my favorite to use i like coconut but i don't want coconut starburst that's it oops it actually sounds sort of good coconut starburst well that'll be your next creation maybe kelly okay so that you want to whizz it up again and we'll check if it holds together okay now be careful for the blade we gotta check if it's gonna just be careful there's a blade in there we're just going to see if it holds together i think it's going to hold together it's very coconut oily but it seems to be holding together holding a nice little ball there it's like a little gumball yeah we want it to hold together taste it see if it needs anything that tastes really good it tastes like a strawberry starburst mm-hmm which is exactly like a strawberry lemonade starburst i don't think we need to add any more sweetener there is no such thing as strawberry lemon there's no strawberry lemonade starburst but that would taste like a strawberry one you know all the flavors i don't but i'll take your word for it okay so now you have a couple of options a person can either take just take your fingers like we just did and make little balls out of this or you can roll it into a log and slice it i think we should roll it in a log and slice it what do you think callie can i slice it sure you roll on too long okay i'm going to grab a cutting board to do this one because this looks like it might be pretty greasy from the coconut oil and we'll do it on a cutting board and then if you want to grab a knife there should be one check if there's one in that drip tray over there for doing the supper dishes okay so we're just gonna form this into a log it seems to be sticking together nice okay then you can grab one from this drawer but just let me roll this out first okay because you have to get in there a little bit of sausage it's very coconut oily like i feel like it kind of had a little less coconut oil it sounds very coconut oily anybody made this does it look right i think it's supposed to be like shiny i think it's just melting from my warm hands yeah but it's very very coconut oily you're not gonna wait hey no no you're eager i'll just use this you're gonna use that big chef's knife okay nobody can see you want to come on the other side of me yeah but i gotta roll this up a little bit this knife in the house be careful with it please kind of holding it dangerously there for a minute all right now we may have a problem because this is not really wanting to roll out nice and thin we may have to do some forming of it with our hands i think that's what we're going to do it looks honestly like all the coconut oil is coming out of this and that can't be right so we're going to try and improvise well if your hands are melting well we don't want to lose all the coconut oil in our recipe yeah right so if you want to cut in pieces they have to be kind of even pieces calisora they're somewhat the same size and then what maybe i'll do since this looks a little on the big side i'm just going to break that into two maybe we'll go ahead and just form these with our hands starburst yeah absolutely you cut them in or even you just cut some and then you can help me form them i think we should do them in little squares like starburst would look like little cute squares can you see that our lighting in our house in the evening is absolutely terrible so i apologize because it looks like we're in a cave right now yeah we have a light on the way so that the lighting will be a bit better because it still gets dark here really early it's only 7 30 and it's getting dark outside so we're gonna get something but can you see our little starburst fruit shoes aren't those the cutest we're gonna have very greasy fingers when this is done cali did you cut them into half again yeah they're gonna be pretty big i think kind of just make them form them into little cubes flat they're gonna be bigger than a starburst i feel like we could have even made these into half again oh my god well you make that one whatever size you want it but i think the rest will make them just like little tiny one bite poppers because these are super filling with all that collagen in there and that protein powder you know this is a one right one that looks like a huge bite one you'd be full after just having one really you don't want to slice it in half and make it smaller i can make it smaller that would fill me up with just one it would so i think it's fun to do these in different flavors i like i do like the chocolate ones they remind me of a tootsie roll so i do like those ones too although i do not remember them being so drippy with coconut oil so i don't know if that is something to do with the lemonade packets just not being quite the same as the original recipe there's less dry ingredients but i mean they're turning out they're just drippy with coconut oil do this over guys this is pretty small and try to make sure sure you do it whatever you however you like that looks great this one has to cut in half after i made it you're gonna make it a starfish mini sausage a mini sausage so i think these would be fun to do with the kids if your kids like to eat thm food my kids do you can like probably make these any shape you want these would be really fun to do as something the kids could get involved in doing it's like school safe they would be school safe we have a tough time finding school safe snacks that in our house is really important as well because we have a son with a peanut and a sesame allergy so it's really hard to find snacks that are safe for him that are both peanut free and sesame free sesame is the even harder one i think than peanuts these days is finding things that are sesame free so whenever we find something fun like this this would be a super cute little lunch box accompaniment are you trying it yeah you taste testing it no see if it's any good i think they'll be even better once they're cold we'll chill them and then all that coconut oil will firm up and then they will be super good because that's what i used to do with the traditional recipe they used to wrap them individually and then put them into the fridge so like you'd wrap them and then you put them in the fridge so yeah i don't want to chill these because i well we're not going to eat them all this is making a lot so we're going to keep forming these and enjoying them yeah right i'm not sure if we have too much else to show you guys tonight we want to keep this really short and sweet we just wanted to show you a fun shake for st patty's day so um if you're just starting to join us now go and watch the replay we'll post the recipes in the comments and enjoy yourself

kelly's gonna wash up her hands so that she can be in charge because she's really taking the lead here you're washing up we're definitely coconutty from all this i just can't believe all the coconut oil coming out of these i'm gonna have well-moisturized hands by the time i'm done this recipe which isn't such a bad thing moisturize with your hands you can holly hello okay miss cali well thanks again for joining us we hope you enjoyed this video and we hope to see you again on sunday good night bye bye", "lUnNZTAcmAc": "[Music] hi I'm will and welcome to my kitchen today we're gonna be making some wheat apple pies we're kind of modeling them after that nostalgic like drive-thru apple pie I'm sure you bought a few those when you're stoned but now can you do both it wants to birds it won't stone [Music] yes so here you see we've got about an ounce of D carbs weed that's all ready to go to makings to sea water so I'm gonna bring it over to the stove okay so we've got our D carved wheat here but before we deal with this we're gonna melt some butter we've got about it pounds worth of butter in here when you turn your stove on you want it pretty much as low as it can you just want a slight simmering we're gonna mix this butter in [Music] take your time don't worry about the pace just take it slow so nothing burns you're not gonna put the lead in until it's all melted so you know that Shakespeare could have been a STONER in 2001 anthropologists actually found marijuana residue left over into his personal smoking papers okay it's all melted so now we're ready to add the wheat to the butter there we go so now we're gonna turn the oven far down close to simmer really and we're gonna keep it at that for two to three hours while we gently stir it that's gonna be a while but once it's done we're gonna strain it through cheesecloth and then just let it cool down for a while after that it'll be ready to go for our project see you in a little bit okay so we've got our weed butter it's all cooled and ready for cooking but first we're gonna have to peel and dice some apples Honey Crisp this is a Honey Crisp apple which is really good for baking because it's soft and sweet and it doesn't require a lot of other additions to it just peel the Apple essage so these are very soft apples which means you don't have to cook them in the pan for very long and so they won't get as burnt and there's less of a chance of losing any of the THC content okay now that the apples peeled we have to dice it up you want the pieces to be small but not too small [Music] we want to make sure you're being really careful when you're with your fingers when you're doing this [Music] oK we've got all these now can put them in this bowl [Music] and we're gonna go over here to make our filling okay so now we're ready to make the filling I'm gonna put this down and then we're gonna put in two tablespoons of the wheat butter that's equivalent to about 80 milligrams we're making five to six pies that's like 15 milligrams each per try and so after we've put that and you just want to dump all the apple slices if you want to turn this step up to like a medium temperature you don't want to burn it too much and then I'm gonna squeeze half a lemon over at the apples this is gonna trick them from oxidizing they won't get all brown and green okay we're just gonna cook these for a little bit see you're waiting for that pulse to get soft and warm and then once they reach that point you're ready to add the rest of the ingredients this is really easy filling to do there's a few steps involved but it's actually pretty simple it doesn't take many ingredients and it's really delicious so I recommend it starting to look just about right I think we're ready to add the rest of our ingredients so first we're gonna add a bit of cornstarch this will help thicken the consistency of the filling and then this is just cinnamon for flavor [Music] now some nutmeg awesome nutmeg is pretty awesome that's quite a twist okay now you need a big thing of brown sugar oh it all kind of came out in a clump you just want to mix it evenly throughout and blast you just want to add some water then you just want to keep mixing it up just keep stirring till you get that really nice thick consistency apple pie obviously is an American tradition this is a bit more of an alternative America but it's still really delicious and the way we're making them it's great for on-the-go it's amazing for a picnic a festival it's just a good thing and if it gets you high then that's just a bonus yes okay turning the heat down simmering okay so once again starts to get really syrupy you want to pull it off and let it cool okay so now we're ready to cooler filling so we're gonna just empty it all off onto this tin foil pan I'm just kind of spreading it out so it just can cool quickly nothing too complicated okay so now our filling is ready to be cooled so we're gonna put it in the fridge for like five minutes so we'll check on that in a little bit okay so now our fillings been cooled and we can move on to making our pie crust so we're just gonna be using a store-bought crust if you've made it yourself you could cook it with wheat butter as well but we just did it with the filling this time you want to cut it into two squares but one thing you have to pay attention to is you have to make one of them larger than the other [Music] shutting it down [Music] okay so now you sprinkle some cornflakes onto the dough all of this will have a stronger base to your crust when it's cooked okay so after that we're ready to add our filling you want to use a few spoonfuls not too much keep it in the center don't bring it towards the edges and then the reason you make the bigger one is you put that on the top so when you seal it it feels really well and it doesn't like explode in the oven or something so you just put it over and kind of fold the edges of both sides and and then once you're done with that you can take a serrated blade and just gently cut a few openings in the pipe definitely excited to get these things out then they're gonna be sick as hell I think then after that it's pretty much ready we can put it over here with the rest okay they're pretty much ready to go in the oven now they look pretty good to me you want to put them in the oven about 425 Fahrenheit and sleep it in for a half an hour but check on it after 20 just in case [Music] do you know that the cannabis use of adults 15 older has now outpaced the growth of use of any other age demographic and they're done look they look pretty awesome like they're fresh out of the drive-thru or something remember they're about 15 milligrams each no when you're dosing but have fun if you're able teen I

thank you guys bye", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we showed with an addiction to read if you like

for today's video the beer is courtesy of joe from the beer patrol thank you so much joe really appreciate it make sure you check out his channel as i usually say if you watch me you probably already watch him he's on a hiatus he will be coming back but um anyway thanks a lot joey really appreciate it man it's another froth liquid lollipop uh well in their series liquid lollipop and uh if you aren't aware i'm doing a theme week this week uh all adjuncted beers they have to have three or more adjuncts and this one easily surpasses that um it's a triple fruited sour ale strawberry raspberry blueberry blackberry fluff coconut so there's six adjuncts in this so definitely at least three uh 6.5 abv i've had a bunch in this series because of joe uh and i love them and uh again we can certainly talk about if these are beer or not and that's interesting um it is a nice change of pace um my man max put it that way in a comment he said you know like he said a lot of things but the thing that relates to this anyway is yeah sometimes really people who drink different styles of beer like different styles of beer myself included it's a nice change of pace it's definitely a nice and i would add delicious change of pace let's get into it yeah i mean it's it's not going to give you a lot of head all right so strawberries raspberries blueberries blackberries fluff coconut i mean looking at it it's making my glass dirty minus one point actually there's a little bit of a reddish pink head you see some pectin stick in the side glass already not a lot of head and i didn't think there would be much but it definitely does look like a a smoothie or like a you know in your blender typically if i'm blending berries it's to make a smoothie that's where my mind goes it does look like you bought a bag of frozen uh bare you know variety of berries assorted berries blended it up i mean that's the color that is so yeah i'm not particularly surprised by the color let's see about the aroma i actually get a decent amount of coconut i figured with and i don't know the ratio of things that they put in i was thinking i was going to get a berry explosion first but actually that coconut is fighting its way and it's really nice with the the fruity element that's there that coconut is super refreshing i kind of expected this to be super jammy and then maybe fighting for some coconut but no that is not the case i'm finally getting some of that jamminess it's pretty sweet too like it's not it's not letting on a lot of you know tart or sour characteristics i think this is one of those beers if you were doing it blind you you wouldn't think when you tasted it was gonna be sour but like i mean i i know it's going to be but like yeah basically aroma i mean there's just there's so much sweetness there's also like this vanilla thing i don't know if they do lactose in these beers or not it's not labeled so it could be the fluff i guess but it has a nice dude it has a nice vanilla note yeah i mean i guess it'd be nice to have a little bit more like of the berries just because i had so many different berries and i love berries but i bet it'll come come across in the taste there's only one way to find out cheers thanks again joe now it tastes what i want it to taste like yeah you do get that awesome sour and tart thing going you do get a lot of the berry it's a pretty good mix of the berries like again you know trying to think when i do these reviews um you know going in as blind as possible i can't hear because i know exactly what's in it but if i was doing this beer blind i probably wouldn't be able to pinpoint a fruit or a berry i mean it's very much berry uh probably because of the tartness i would say blackberry and or uh raspberry just because that's with the base beer and the berriness that's where my mind would go but like the fact that it's all for you know anything i know that all four are there but i could see you know maybe moments that were oh that's strawberry or whatever but it's it's definitely like a nice berry medley with that tartness so it's leaning in my opinion anyway a little bit and strawberries can be that way blueberries for me it's very rare that i get a tartness um it's very much that raspberry blackberry thing the coconut that i was dwelling on in the aroma definitely not a dominant taste it's funny now that i've had some i'm getting a little bit more of the berry in the aroma the coconut is there it's just it was a misdirection a mislead from the aroma but it's actually kind of nice i don't think i would get palette fatigue if this was just the berry but it might be a little boring of a beer indiscriminate or indiscriminate unidentifiable berry characteristics i guess is what i'm trying to say it's delicious might get a little old to review or talk about so now it has that coconut thing too adding another layer some more depth to it uh making a little bit more interesting to drink that's for sure um that vanilla thing i was getting aroma that i thought maybe was the fluff or lactose again i don't know if these are lactose or not i'm not getting that really in the taste at all um there is some sweetness to it it could be from the fruit it could be from the fluff so that's hard to say but i really like this i i i'm and again i i think that coconut is the hero here and again not that i think this beer will be delicious about the coconut just over crystal clear this beer is phenomenal but i think that coconut is adding a needed layer of depth i i'm thinking of like cuisina when you're cooking and like there might be something good but then you put a little bit of salt or pepper whatever spice it's like oh yeah that is making this even better it's already good you know so it's kind of like that thing this would be good without it but i think it's taking it up a notch thanks again joy really appreciate it um you guys had this beer before have you had anything else from froth are you enjoying adjunct week um any anything everything comment section below let's get a conversation going uh check them out on instagram on tap there's no hype your views of both those places so just please like comment subscribe and most importantly and bye cheers everyone", "hhTPYdjGxP0": "oh my god you guys all wanna be in my video hey guys welcome back to another video if you're new here I am Judith and today I do have an audience hello yeah but anyways today I am going to be eating or trying to eat a 500 milligram edible that I did find at a lab that I recently went to it was the first time that I had gone there and I just had to pick these up for you guys because I've never seen them ever in my life and once I figured out that these existed I saw a video on YouTube and there was comments saying that they really didn't hear so I'm not sure if I should eat the whole thing or eat a hundred milligrams of it because the other time if you guys haven't seen my if you guys haven't seen my last video I did eat a moon edible 100 milligrams and that edible like totally hit you guys I Loki freaked out so yeah I know that 100 milligrams will do me justice when it comes to properly hitting me right but yeah I had to pick this up for you guys 500 milligrams you guys enough to make me feel like I'm dying I'm not even kidding but I don't think I am gonna eat the whole thing or the whole string but I am gonna offer some people some of the edible its if you want it you want it and if you don't then you don't know pressure let me go ahead and set this camera up for you guys I am going to open and eat this in front of you guys you guys already know the deal so yeah if you guys haven't checked out my last edible video go ahead and check that out and let's do this okay I am literally on my knees for you guys but let's do this okay so this is the edible again you guys look at this cute new packaging I've never seen this type of edible ever I just had to pick it up for you guys I have to I have to this one unfortunately is not really like childproof it does have that starting cut there so it can easily be open unlike the other edibles I've said that it's a great idea not to suggest an opening just because young adults and kids can be around as for me I do have a baby around so you know not good for that but other than that it is cute I love it yeah they're medicated nerds 500 milligrams that's just tripping me out like I don't really believe it but I don't know I mean it just say it on the packaging so it says total dosage is 500 milligrams of THC and the rope has eight servings so let's see I don't know I mean that's you so it's saying one-eighth of the rope is 50 milligrams so we can calculate that by cutting it in half and then cutting it in half again and then cutting it in half again so that's pretty much a small ass piece like literally this is 50 milligrams and then another 50 and like it's just I don't know it's pretty crazy to me it just say that it's 60 minute activation time right there so I guess it's gonna take about an hour just like the other edible that I did consume for you guys so it does have this California warning sign that everyone always looks for on packaging but yeah I mean I wouldn't honestly you guys I wouldn't really trust this because I did buy it and an underground type of lab I've never even heard of this lab I was invited I wasn't even gonna buy anything so these are kind of like products that I'm iffy about so I don't know I guess you have to do your research I didn't do much research but I did see a video online yeah that was it that was pretty much it if you guys do want to have more research on this go ahead and look up videos because I'm pretty sure these are getting more known out there but yeah enough talking I'm just super talking talking maybe because I'm so nervous I don't know but let me go get some scissors actually no it has the tear there um and then let's do this so let me do a quick thumbnail and then we'll get back to it it is so hot in here you guys I'm really trying to just do this so let's do it okay yeah ready or not here we go so it says teryn share which I do plan on doing I am going as my uncle probably if he wants to try some hey baby baby okay I'm doing a video let's do it so I'm gonna open it sorry my babies in the background you guys okay look at this you guys what the heck so I had this in the refrigerator and my mom was just like freaking out telling everyone this is not a candy that this is marijuana and Dada Dada and I mean yeah precautions you guys so I'm gonna have 1/8 of the rope okay so 1/8 of the rope that's what it looks like you guys and it does say on the packaging it is 15 milligrams so here goes nothing not a soul bomb maybe you wanna try some it's so bomb you guys this is dangerous oh my gosh you guys okay two eights of the rope so this is gonna be a total of 100 milligrams why is that so bhama if you guys hear little parts as my sister's baby they just want to be cheese massage they want to be here and watch me the film for you guys these are so so bomb he says that it has a super potent formula okay I think I should keep it like that cuz I don't want to freak out you guys but okay I'll have a little more so I can have half of it which is gonna be 250 here's another one so it should be about 250 milligrams if not maybe a little less a little more nice learn can't film here you guys it is so hot in here mom like I ate a little less or a little more of 250 milligrams you guys I'm gonna feel like I'm dying but I'm yeah let me go see if anybody else wants to have a little piece of it maybe just 50 milligrams or a little more I don't mind sharing this it's whatever I did post this on snap so if you do follow me on snap you know that I did post this and I asked you guys if you guys have ever tried these and some of you guys said that they smack which is why I'm kind of scared because I don't want them to smack me so hard but some of you guys said that they don't so I guess it's just our personal experience and yeah I hope that they don't super smack but if they do a Plus let's go see who else wants to try some of these so we are gonna go outside and I am so hot here because I closed all the windows and doors so that no noise could come in but yeah your girls ready to go outside and just breathe but I will be checking up when this [ __ ] starts to hit and let you guys know what I feel so yeah let's go outside [Music] do you want to chase up it's a 500 milligram nerd okay you guys my uncle is down so go ahead and open it and then 1/8 of the rope is gonna be 50 milligrams so right there it does okay getting eighth you know what anything I know how an ape looks and we know candy no a little more a little more this would be good in them yeah I mean if there's a 500 milligram rope come with me yeah cheers Cheers you have to let us know how you feel okay I am back and I am definitely feeling this edible more of like a body high I feel yeah like maybe more of a body higher than anything else I'm like slowly freaking out like I can just feel it creeping up right now we are watching a movie so yeah I can definitely feel it while I'm watching the movie and yeah I'm pretty good right now but you guys I can definitely feel it just like it's gonna hit me like I know it's gonna hit me super hard and I just I hope that I don't freak out but yeah this is an update this is probably almost an hour after I ate the edible so keep in mind I ate about 250 milligrams this is about an hour later which yeah like the packaging said that it would hit me 16 minutes later and it's about that and I can definitely feel it creeping up right now so yeah this isn't even this isn't even the full-blown like faded moment but I will be back for that I hope that I am not freaking out or anything but yeah my mom is making carnitas and I just cut onion and cilantro and yeah I helped her in the kitchen and I'm gonna show you guys what we're eating because it just looks so bomb you guys that goes everyday bomb like super bomb and they make the best that Anita's so shout out to them but anyways let me get back to you guys and then if anything when I start to really feel it I will also ask how my uncle is feeling because he did take about 50 milligrams so he isn't really gonna feel as much but he'll definitely be feeling something if this rope is potent like it's saying it is but yeah I'll be back I already ate a taco and it was so so bomb but this is what they look like ooh ooh they look so bomb the airplane the baby I totally forgot to record I am still a little faded I honestly thought I was gonna hit harder but it didn't the day is still going the days are going so I'll be back to let you guys know the update so I thought the Edible was going to hit a little harder after the last video that I did make but no incident I was probably peaking right there and it didn't go any further than that but um yeah I was expecting it to hit a little harder just because I did consume a 250 milligrams and it just wasn't that heart of a high or a faded moment but yeah I mean would I buy them again I probably wouldn't maybe for the flavor and the taste because it tastes so bomb but for it to like actually hit and make me feel super faded mmm I don't know I'm gonna have to think about that one but yeah it was pretty good I enjoyed it I still have a little bit left and yeah I'm pretty sure it did hit my feel not as much but yeah he's knocked out after a while I thought it was gonna hit a little harder but it didn't so that's kind of a shame because other edibles that I have tried they've hit pretty hard so yeah when I buy this again sorry I'm in the kitchen and everyone's eating and I just decided the wrong time let you guys know the update but yeah it didn't hit that hard would I buy it again maybe not maybe for the flavor and taste but for it to hit me hard no I'll probably do a moon because with a moon edible eye it got me so good with just one hundred milligrams I did check up on my uncle he is totally asleep so yeah I guess I'm gonna ask him later how he felt after the edible but yeah it was a good run I did enjoy the edible it was really fun eating it I was pretty excited and yeah I've never seen an edible like that and I'm glad that I tried it for you guys like a rating out of 10 probably like I don't know a 7 just because it peaked and then that was it like I didn't really feel like super faded or anything maybe I was more of a body high but yeah other than that it was good I hope they get like the video I'm gonna show you guys a bit of what my sister is making and then that's the end of the video or maybe I'll include a little more because we are gonna drink later so other than that thank you guys for watching do not forget to Like comment and subscribe but okay but yeah let me show you guys what my sister's doing

to say bye you guys Nuala by my okay yeah so bye see you guys in the next video and Cheers", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "_nqGJCHOFNw": "thanks josh hey everybody my name is matt from matt's ice cream show thank you so much for checking out my page and engaging my content it seriously means a lot and it really helps me out uh be sure to tune in every week as we try all the ice cream world has to offer i hope to see you there hey my goaty gang i'm here for a food review collab with matt from matt's ice cream show we will be reviewing ben and jerry's chubby hubby ice cream i haven't had this in probably 10 years i recall it being one of my favorite flavors back when i used to try ben and jerry's like once a week i just remember this flavor being one of my favorites so i suggested this to him and he said sure i'll go to the market this weekend and try to get it he grabbed it so we're doing it he's been reviewing a bunch of cherries and so i found these royal harvest nature's maraschino cherries they're supposed to be non-gmo and all natural there's no high fructose it uses cane sugar they actually look super awesome i got them right here i think i got eight cherries in here they look awesome and they don't look overly red like normal super crazy fake cherries are these actually look like real cherries so i'm super excited for them i haven't had them before have had this but not in a long time don't forget to check out matt's video i'll have links for his in the description and without further ado let's get into some chubby hubby thing i don't really buy pints of ice cream very often so i'm a bit inexperienced the first glance at the chubby hubby give you a look at this and then i'll tip it in look at that looks so good i got my little dairy queen spoon let's see what this is like hmm first bite peanut butter and fudge can't go wrong with that that's splendid [Music] oh got a nice piece of um chocolate covered pretzel there nice and crunchy i always find it cool how they can keep pretzels crunchy in ice cream like that i guess it was chocolate covered it helped keep out the moisture and liquid i guess that's how it can stay crunchy there's one of the chocolate covered pretzels it's like a little nugget it's not an actual like pretzel shape [Music] it's been a while since i had some like quality ice cream i mean i'm used to getting ice cream from buffets and stuff and that's usually like hershey's and hershey's isn't bad but i i don't consider a higher quality like something like haagen-dazs or ben jerry's there's a lot better ingredients in the ben jerry's from my experience they're non-gmo and all-natural it says it's vanilla malt ice cream i'm trying to taste the malt in it i probably do it's just it's just so good that i can't distinguish it from like a normal vanilla it's more flavorful but man just look at that let me spin it i'm trying something different thought you know ice cream late at night you know my bed it's like you're hanging out with the goat come on over grab some ice cream sit down and eat with the goat it's such a perfect mix of fudge and peanut butter and pretzels chubby hubby is uh it's definitely still a favorite of mine it's definitely hard to share one of these with someone this whole pipe has 13 80 calories that's like around what i eat in a normal day so that's kind of crazy once you pop you can't stop consistent pretzels and fudge and there's no skimping with this ice cream all right let's uh let's try these cherries um wow that's the first time a maraschino cherry that's real look at that so good hmm i highly recommend these cherries i got them on amazon i just want to say thanks again to matt for doing this collab with me finding an honor when people want to collab with me it means a lot to me got a huge hunk of peanut butter so good if you've never had chubby hubby go try to find it it is the perfect mix of peanut butter fudge and pretzels i would be a chubby hubby if i eat this all the time wow there is tons of pretzels in here there might be like five more in here and they're they're big nuggets pretzel nuggets i hate when it comes down to the m oh this is a nice big bite of peanut butter i don't think you can see this that whole thing is a uh ripple i've always liked peanut butter ripple ice cream that is some good ice cream that is a winner in my book all right got every last drop out of that can't really get any more of that fudge so anyway ben and jerry's chubby hubby go get that give that a try go check out matt's review of uh ben jerry's chubby hubby i'll have links in the description and thanks for tuning in to another food review thanks for all your continued support and i'll see you in the next video the goat is out and without", "W5Eobk0pBNw": "what's going on

not wearing green today i'm thinking green so the first thing i'm gonna do is stab over to my local dunkin donuts and guess what guys a few videos ago i actually did a video and i tried to order the matcha blueberry iced tea from dunkin donuts here's what i got check it out [Music] sure it was the wrong drink so chances are i'm not going to be going back to that dunkin donuts again however i just want to let you know that i do my homework before i do these videos that way i know what the food and drink looks like before i order them i also know that maca is green as far as the powder goes so of course my drink should be green right happy saint patty's day i watch a lot of you guys basically comment on the video and oh it's not the right drink yeah i know it's not rocket science either guys although i do appreciate you guys watching i know for a fact i got the wrong drink no need to keep talking about it so let's all get past that and get into this video right now as far as what i'm about to get into you ready man check this out [Music] i want to try your blueberry um ice maca latte now this is the matcha tea right yeah okay this is gonna be a medium please um that's all okay

always have look at my label even the label looks correct let's get right to it [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] matcha powder has a lot of health benefits and it's green in color very interesting and truthfully the tea tastes really good i do like to see and i do like this drink the blueberry shot they put in it is a nice little mixture between getting that sweetness of the blueberry and just the straight tea on the marker the powder at least and if you look at the bottom of the cup you actually see some of the little tea bits and stuff so it's official right cool it's a very flavorful drink i would definitely get that again i would definitely get it again it was a good drink cost me four dollars and change for a medium and as usual dunkin donuts usually doesn't disappoint as far as their coffees with me i'm going with a four on this tea i do like it a lot i think it's a solid solid drink from duncan um is it one of my favorites no but very very flavorful the blueberry definitely stands out if you like blueberry or even curious it's a definitely a great drink definitely appreciate this one dunkin donuts thank you i appreciate it immensely and honestly it wasn't really extra sweet or anything so it was just a nice drink that if you're going to get a nice drink this is probably going to be a go to stamp of approval on this one guys very easy to the

while these are the the 400 milligram Pat so peaked rings yes yes so if you can read that the air infused THC 400 milligrams 50 milligrams per piece so yeah here we go we're going to do it guys we're going to do it so if you've got some edibles join it with me by all means join in with me I've been looking forward to this one I've saved it for them all in the reason being is obviously because you guys know that my tolerance to cannabis is quite high so I thought well you jump saying we'll do it in the morning when I've had not had anything to eat I am gonna have a smoke here as well I'm gonna smoke through today but we're gonna take these and I'm going to come back on roughly and then I was time when the star when the effects stop taking obviously I look a little bit tired as its first thing in the morning guys so I'm really looking forward to these these chuckles yeah so we're looking at 20 calories per serving so I guess a serving is a sweet though so yeah but I don't really care about that ingredients are calories oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour are seared dextrose palm oil nice nice nice guys so yeah very very very nice there is a nice warning on there as well so warning me intoxicate intoxicating effects of this product may be delayed by up to two hours may cause drowsiness the product may impair the ability to drive or operate machinery please use extreme caution now I'm still got a ninja with me today ninjas going to take the car off me now she's going shopping so I do not have a car I am NOT gonna be using a car I'm not gonna be operating any machinery as much as probably a toaster as much as I'm gonna do right so not gonna do anything guys so stop talking just let's get the [ __ ] chuckles on oh oh look at that nice nice gonna get my stuff go he's gonna get matched up oh look at these oh there are there are look at them guys what do you think of those see if we can see that see that I can't do the crack ah Sh the snap arch but that's what we're looking at Oh beautiful guys right stop talking just alright girls what's the time right 10:30 10:30 6 9 cheers guys [Music] that's like everyone the sugars seems to be infused nice I do like peach beautiful guys just watching me eat sweets yeah [Music] so you can't take the Congress here there is a distinct flavor of cannabis in that we are [Music] 400 milligrams there guys how much can you guys take to stick it in the comment how much it's going to take you guys to really feel their backs [Music] mm-hmm best for second as the 721 so they got a long a lot of date or love so much sugar in the morning man mmm-hmm I feel like feeling like I'm rushing off the sugar more than here people I'm getting a [ __ ] a bit of a sugar rush [ __ ] going on here my god the things I do to experiment knowing the things I do for this channel then you guys like that boy [Music] someone that guys when I meet my sweet hope you having a good day you been lucky enough to try any of this or anything like that stick in the comments again really into a interested to know what other people's experiences on with them - I mean I'm nailing with vegetables now obviously I do need a slightly higher dosage in mouth but I know also to take a little bit too much whew you can go the other way so you have got be careful [Music] sugaring the more advanced hearsay yeah too much so yeah to explain from last last night's live Bob snake we've got Lana here and we've got ninja here a little robbing in the room basically so my son's in Greece so just to move around a bit of a family night where a few drinks got on the live last night but that's why they're here in this review obviously off screen but yeah they're in the studio like they're in studio oh I mean I can't really normally eat that makes through that then one go but again it's an experiment do like sweets but I just have a couple normalling yeah and then I give it to the girls but not the sweets last one here oh if we should look at that one it's ridiculous to my sugar I need the pack we're gonna have to have as well what can I say guys Silurian sweets at bloody hour past 10:00 in the morning 114 [ __ ] years old but it's for a good cause Bottoms Up boy bottoms up let's see how interesting this get Sam lots of sugar and now secrets of use got every last bit [ __ ] right mmm well gotta say they went that pretty easy although I do feel like I'm having a real mud sugar rush right now won't run smoothly my sugar on them it seems to be more sugar on them but whether that's where the THC is whether it's infuse sugar or if you sweets I don't know I don't know how to make so some people will accuse the sweets as well as the sugar and some people would just put sugar on it so I don't know I don't know animate I will do once I come up on that because I do really really feel it then it's probably all the way through it I would say yeah as I say I need a dose I need a dose so you have four milligrams Bob's up got sugar all by my side by that guy's normal you see smoking videos to me but you've seen any in video me but I'll say it's a good good cause but suppose if you don't need a lot and you had a pack of those and they're like 50 milligrams a sweet you could probably carry them about stab a couple of sweets at a time and just sort of go along your day we as a nice do it mean put in a hundred milligrams into your body every couple of hours or something like that just gives you that little bit of pain relief and stuff like that I bet so good from that point of view that their portions you don't mean I like the fact they are portion in a way so you can do that I'm still I'm mad I just eat all of them all it won't go basically right long time guys so still on the black cheese but I'm still loving life guys 1190 so please join me peace wonder have a bomb and we'll all get along it's one of those I'll be back in roughly about an hour's time and I'll stick the camera on and I'll do another 10 15 minutes with a couple of thongs of snake oh my god I might not be able to smoke anything I don't really know that but we'll see from there yeah so cheers noise [Music] very tasty I did like them I do like Peter sweet son Peter sweets is the one that'll wake you up in the morning yes yes so guys mmm hope you have a good day today if you're watching this video and then you happen to watch the other one like that and yeah I just want to say have a good day by all means be a look out for the pot two of this where you see the effects all right my mighty would jump on a live stream at some point as well so have a good day I'll see you really really soon peace would love guys see you in an hour whoop-whoop", "dDYW775_CBc": "[Music] yo yo it is good to have you here on truebuds tv for another cannabis edible review i've done tons of these so check out the playlist if you want to see some more edibles before you go to the store and spend a pretty penny here i got this one on ease you can get a discount if it's your first time ordering i'll put that in a comment below we got the punch edibles here this is the fruit snacks first time having the fruit snacks speaking of other reviews i've done a review about their chocolate bars i've had all their chocolate bars i remember when they were the 225 milligrams really packing that punch as advertised so i had about four of these let me go ahead and open them up here i had four the other day when i was chilling but then i was smoking so it was hard to tell the exact strength i can usually tell if it's like that 30. i usually take 30 milligrams because i know how that makes me feel it gets me stoned so i can still kind of do stuff i got some more work to do today but it doesn't make me like 50 or 60 to 100 milligrams where i can just only lay on the couch and zonk out so let's go ahead and eat three i wasn't expecting them to break apart so cleanly like that i thought they were going to be stuck together but they break apart nicely that's three tastes good tastes like some fruit snacks weed flavors in there a little bit taste i give it seven out of ten or so let's see how these kick in and i'll be kicking it back with you in about an hour hour and a half or whatever so i'll see you then and as i thought consistent like every time on these punch edibles so good job on the consistency here if you're going for just taste and you're doing a gummy or something like that sweet i would still steer more towards like emerald sky or like a more handcrafted or you know crafted uh piece of candy but this tastes good potency's there very small and discreet um good for the summer you know it's not chocolate it's not gonna melt all over so thank you punch for another good time about to get busy here got some big stuff in the works for true buds tv and the true buzz show and i want to say thank you for hanging out today drop a comment below what do you want to see next i'll see you on the next review video where we'll be reviewing some other gummies i like to say they're wild [Music] you", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the weed in it because like you can still taste it but um it does taste a little better than we but it's still good if you serve this to somebody they wouldn't be like is there weed in this they'd be like what's the unique herb you have in there i'm putting the broccoli for the broccoli like the perfect temperature to eat right away if you do i have the same things that i add add more peanut butter because um there's nothing like peanut butter and like spicy chicken spicy chicken was the flavor i chose of my soup um uh oh my god i'm so hot and the soup is hot i'm gonna open my window the temperature why is it so hot what temperature is it in here it's only 22 degrees what's going on oh yeah that's a look okay i'm gonna finish this off camera because and then i'm gonna report back once i feel like it has hit me i'm gonna let you guys know how it goes okay okay i'll see you guys anywhere between well i mean it's gonna be immediately after for you but it's gonna be like two hours probably for me depending on how fast it hits me actually i should have added some muscle than into this but since i didn't i'm gonna take a less than capsule to help the absorption absorption okay see you guys soon in a couple seconds now bye because of all the fat in here has been making me full a lot faster than usual but you know the fat is necessary for what we're looking for thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you are at the end please tell me um um thank you for staying with me to the end even through my um my struggling through the video am i struggling with words my struggling with ideas am i struggling with really the whole thing doesn't mean it didn't turn out it just i struggled that happened so and that's okay well like i said already i think but who knows i'm gonna say it just in case thank you guys for watching i hope you enjoyed the video if you did please subscribe and um give it a thumbs up and i hope you guys all have a wonderful day goodbye um i feel like it's already hitting me and it's only been like 20 minutes i have so much that i need to do like i didn't even finish the soup yet i'm too high i can't oh my god um didn't you finish i didn't even finish the soup yet and i'm gonna have to read it again because i still haven't eaten it yet oh that looks gross now i don't want to brace myself also is anyone even watching at this point i feel like i've been like documentary my whole evening like i am checking out for the day for this i like i'm like i'm fairly able to like i'm like one step at a time i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so eventually i fell asleep eventually i regretted my decisions literally every minute", "1uOZe07yGjk": "today we're looking at low-dose edibles battle panel low dose round round round getting for good for good booked I bought four so that I can try and catch a buzz we got this drink I was mostly interested in trying the drink just to try the drink it's two milligrams it's [ __ ] pointless but it's a drink Aurora drift sea salt caramel a roamer drift soft baked chocolate cookies and then San Rafael blast berry gummies this is an animal day it's an edible day I had to buy four just to get a buzz and a bull day and a bull day all right that's [ __ ] ridiculous looking at four edibles today I brought in Aurora drift Aurora drift soft baked chocolate cookies two units five milligrams per unit total of ten milligrams or or drift sea salt and caramel milk chocolate chocolate squares five units two milligrams per unit total of ten milligrams tweed houndstooth and soda one serving two milligrams two milligrams in here San Rafael blast berry come East TG total per unit two milligrams per unit five units total of ten milligrams all right first up let's check out the chocolate I'm interested in the sea salt and caramel chocolate you know that on and then the childproof tab you push both these in there you have it nope anyways you don't want a packaging for five chocolates and so what I have to stable down all right we got the Aurora drift sea salt and caramel chocolate right here it's thin it smells like milk top it mm-hmm mm-hmm that's a tasty chocolate it's caramely it sticks to the inside of your mouth I really like that it's sweet it's rich but not too rich it makes me want to go back for more this is something I want after I'm high this is delicious but at two milligrams per piece it's not a lot going on in there for THC so it is what it is it is a delicious chocolate though so a couple weeks ago I went to got these chowie this was a one-shot that piece two sections in it that just tasted like regular old back seat of your car stuck in the seat chocolate yes Aurora drift sea salt caramel chocolate this is actually fantastic I really like that so good work on the flavor we're to save the other two we're gonna get into something else actually I'm pretty thirsty let's get the house tooth and soda drink going on here I sit down the sticky chocolate I just breathed in so tweed houndstooth and soda this has two milligrams of THC houndstooth I'm not sure what that is I might be a strain it might might be the extract from one of their strains I'm not sure what that is and it's basically just a soda carbonated water distilled cannabis terpene blend vegetable glycerin yada yada yada is stuff in a pop there's a total of two milligrams per can of THC now this isn't an aluminum can and I have an article that talks about THC sticking to the can the aluminum can many companies companies have made use of nano emulsion technology which makes cannibal cannabinoids water-soluble in their natural state cannabinoid such as CBD and THC are oil-based therefore they do not mix very well with water which is pretty essential part of producing drinks the problem is that the new water-soluble cannabinoid molecules may stick to the lining of aluminum cans some scientists have theorized that the emulsified cannabinoids may be attracted to the lining which is supposed to protect the can from rusting and ironically protect the stability of the contents so I read up enough by room I read another article that mentioned that up to 50% of the THC can stick to the inside of the lining so in this case we have two milligrams THC that means there's potentially one milligram or more stuck to the inside lining I don't know if they figured that out yet but we're gonna open it two milligrams isn't gonna do [ __ ] to me there is a child safety table here some sort of plastic I'm not gonna feel an effect from this this is simply for flavor to see how it tastes what the [ __ ] going on in here there's actually no instructions on it I'm not sure how that works I don't want plastic on that can I prefer to drink without that plastic that plastics supposed to stay on that can [ __ ] I'm just gonna drink it with the plastic thing on I don't know how to take it off I don't know if it's supposed to come off but it literally smells like nothing oh maybe a little kind of a limey flavor smell kind of limey hmm that is simply soda water as uh I can't quite put my finger on it but it's just soda water and a very light flavoring the flavoring is odd nothing that resembles cannabis or cannabis flavor odd is a very interesting drink it's refreshing I put it in the fridge overnight it's very refreshing after the sticky chocolate but the overall taste there's this not much there you're just drinking soda water with a weird lime popsicle flavoring it's just a 2 milligram drink like I'm not sure I'll never buy this again this cost 2 99 plus 3 399 this cost so if you're maybe if it's a summer day and you're out in the park you need a couple refreshing cans of a drink and six or eight milligrams works for you then you know potentially recommend it but it's not gonna it's not gonna have an effect on me this isn't anything for the higher dose user this is for a beginner I'll never be able to tell you the effect on it because this will not do anything to me so we're just gonna keep this what we get through the other things we'll go through the other edibles next up blast berry gummies that's weird to say and that looks like a blue raspberry flavor gummy two milligrams per gummy with five milligrams total in here I paid I don't know what I paid [ __ ] paid 11 95 for this 10 milligram package of 5 gummies 2 milligrams per piece the package date on here - they have that somewhere February 6th 2020 so just over 2 months old that doesn't really matter for gummies so let's get in there let's see what's going on let's see you with going Oh a seal the sealed is seal some of these don't seal that's it got it good it's yellow good pole they are gummies they smell delicious I can smell them from here I love a good gummy so 2 milligrams per piece they're a little greasy I love a good gummy some of these gummies are my favorite thing to eat out of candy so let's see what's going on here hmm that's a delicious candy the texture it's it's a little thicker it's a little tougher to bite through not a bad way when dealing with THC companies you want to play with it in your mouth THC is absorbed in your mouth through the blood vessels a lot under your tongue and the more you play with it in your mouth the faster the THC can start taking effect like the flavoring I just want more this is a candy that I want to eat after I got high because I need 100 of these mm-hmm that's great for starter dose 2 milligrams for somebody new to canvas that's a great little gummy for somebody's start now but again this whole package I won't even feel it so hopefully I feel everything together all right I'm going to take a little sip of the houndstooth soda to wash that gummy down actually the flavoring in there it's not bad like it's in that I can't say it's not great but it's not bad next up we got the aurora drift soft baked chocolate cookies - cookies five milligrams each five milligrams each and ten milligrams total we have a package date of January 9 2020 so three months old there is no expiry date on here nowhere to be found is there an expiry date there's the ingredients contains the equivalent of 2.7 grams of dried cannabis so I'm interested to see what a cookie tastes like that has no expiry date no sticker on this one like the chocolates a speaking the chocolates let's have a shot that right now don't you ever go to little cookies soft baked chocolate cookies come in a plastic train I believe that's unnecessary except for the child tab the child protection tabs on here a couple of Opie's Katie sticker on here they are hard this is soft bait these are hard cookies I just smashed it and it is not soft baked at all that might have something to do with it being three months old Arion cookie smells like a chocolate cookie it doesn't really smell enticing I don't know if that's because I know that they're three months old once it's in your mouth it falls apart and melts away it's way too strong in chocolate flavor that's not right it almost has a chemical taste it's like it tastes like synthetic chocolate it almost like it tastes like a commercial cleaner like a like a degreaser I can't recommend these at all there's no cannabis taste whatsoever it sticks to the back of my tongue like that's not good I need some houndstooth oh that's actually refreshing up so you got a cookie like that holy [ __ ] Oh crazy God is not a good cookie not one bit did I enjoy that roryd drift chocolates these are a pass for sure that's a delicious chocolate that's a chocolate I would eat all day long I'm gonna score that chocolate at in 8.5 that's fantastic I believe it can get a little better if they had salt on top of it would get a higher score if it maybe had maybe if they shaped it a little better to improve the aesthetics but overall that is just a good chocolate that's so 100% pass the gummies these were absolutely delicious as well these were [ __ ] great see that squishiness it's a good texture a great flavor I'm gonna continue eating these I'm gonna have one right now if you're if you're not a chocolate person but you're a gummy person another great way to start getting into cannabis is with those right there two milligram dose overall rating with these gummies seven point eight on the gummy scale for these is my overall rating I would eat these all day long then we went to the houndstooth drink the drink is interesting it's simply just soda there's no there's nothing in there just a little bit of sodium it's just it's just a drink but you know what when you get a soda drink that it'll live there you make that a little bit better after having a little bit of vodka in it it's a great great soda it's actually not a great great soda I don't know why the [ __ ] I just said that overall rating on the soda is a thigh it'sit's a five it's you have to eat the cookie this horrible cookie to make this taste good there's cookie overall rating it is horrible this is a horrible cookie I give this a 1 I will not purchase this again it has a chemical taste it smells like chocolate but it does not taste like chocolate so after you eat this and then you want to wash it down with one of these this tastes fantastic after a whole hour horrible cookie like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] party on", "mcImux044M8": "here's this James Beard chef opens our own restaurant pastry chef she's sort of well you know people know who she is she's written a cookbook and Wow she's like doing cannabis when we set out to create a brand for edibles we wanted it to be sort of sheffy under the Cresco brand we're looking at Mindy's artisanal a little bit more high-end that's where our chocolates and baked goods come in they're made with a distillate oil when we sat down and we talked about like I want to do my Brittles I've been making these brittles for years I want to see what it's like to make my brittles have THC in it what starts with good quality chocolate really she likes to blend so our flavors are a little bit of mix mixes of this chocolate that chocolates our specificity and then we add on the crunchies and the gooeys as we like to call them so she loves rich dead decadent caramel or peanut butter and then we'll make a toffee or brittle that will chop up and kind of mix into the bar I kind of feel like we have a really wide variety of edibles and I kind of feel like there is something for everybody and they're really really accurately goes on our more confectionery base and our sugar products I guess is Mindy's kitchen so that's where our gummies fall under we have Fruit Chews under that line as well as hard sweets so you know you're sucking candy is sugar base just kind of quick little bites I'm ahead of the game you know and I know there's gonna be a lot of other people are gonna get into industry hopefully my brand will be established and I mean it's gonna be like it's the craziest thing it's gonna be like you know like the Wild West I'm very excited about the future of this industry I'm glad that I'm in it and I'm glad that I'm a part of it that I've like sort of almost laid a foundation for other people like me [Music]", "UpFgp45boq8": "hi everybody welcome back so today we've got a juice review and this was actually sent to me by a juice doc deals you can actually find them on their website they have juice that's got hardware they've got a whole bunch of stuff and let me tell you something the deals that they have I actually just look some up and they're really really good so what we're gonna be doing is actually going over the holy cannoli line I've got three out of the five flavors the first one that I have is this glazed donut the next one is going to be the fruity pebble and the final one is gonna be french toast so these are the three flavors that I have from this line they are right now on special for 100 ml bottles like this for $9.99 you can get two bottles for $14.99 you have four bottles for $34.99 and four bottles for $42.99 and then addition to that if you use Wendy vapes you get an additional 15% off which i think is absolutely amazing so let's go ahead and I'm going to start with the French toast I do like the fact that the labels are really really simple I have to tell you that they come in usually 0 3 and 6 milligrams of nicotine currently they only have 3 and 6 milligrams but again Front 999 3 milligrams is mine anyways so yes now the French toast I'm gonna go ahead and read you the description for the French toast and these are 70/30 VG PG by the way and let's go ahead and try this smells just like so Prince juice actually I'm smelling like the top of the French toast like the buttered like the buttered cooked part of the French toast you know when it gets nice and brown that's what I'm smelling so I've got a fresh wick here as usual so let's go ahead and start prepping priming this up I do have to raise up the wattage as usual I did forget get that started come on wake up baby I don't want to give it away I don't want to give you any spoilers but i dont telling you i'm smelling some stuff case we got that nice and he did i didn't over drip I'm proud of myself so let's go ahead and taste this again this is holy cannoli and this is gonna be the French toast they do have two other flavors the other two flavors are blueberry and the lemon and you can also get like the breakfast too which is going to be like the fruity pebbles and the french toast you can actually get them like a breakfast duo for $14.99 too so you don't have to get the same flavor in the 2-pack so I do like that I want to mention that row thing so here we go a little bit more I like this and I'm gonna tell you why it's not overwhelming syrup an overwhelming syrup to me is yucky I'll be totally honest with you whenever I have one of these breakfast flavors and it has too much um syrup it's like too overly sweet for me so it wouldn't be an all-day baby this it actually tastes exactly what I was smelling at the beginning so I'm smelling like that buttered top on it it's really really good the description of this is french toast a juice by holy cannoli features a luscious breakfast vape of a french toast sprinkle with freshly grated cinnamon and powdered sugar and drizzled with maple syrup dazzle your clouds with flavor as you indulge the most important cloud of the day being that it's drizzled with syrup that's why it's so light on the syrup flavor it's not like where you can't taste it but it's not overwhelming the flavor of french toast which i love french toast it's actually my favorite between french toast and pancakes now the cinnamon the cinnamon and powdered sugar I'm getting more of the powdered sugar that I am the cinnamon but for me that's a good thing I don't like heavy cinnamon I don't vape heavy cinnamon I'm kind of allergic to cinnamon so I do tend to stay away from it but anything overpowering cinnamon I usually don't like anyway but again taste this subjective you might like cinnamon I don't so I'm really liking this flavor definitely getting the powdered sugar vibe also with the smell and the taste so I'm definitely getting that this could definitely be a vape for all day because it's not overly sweet and it tastes exactly like the delicious freakin french toast like the the toast itself really really good and as you're vaping it you can kind of envision the brownness you know like it's done and you flip it you can actually vision that vision that definitely definitely a winner especially for our breakfast flavor which I do like breakfast flavors for a breakfast flavor I think it hits all the really good points of french toast definitely okay the next one up let me just have a drink the next one up since we're doing breakfast anyway let's go ahead and do the fruity pebbles and the fruity pebbles is pretty pebbled cannoli juice by holy cannoli features a fun way to have your breakfast cereal and your after dinner dessert all in one delicious cloud a bowl of crunchy pebbled cereal stuffed ins sweet cannoli shell will make your baked tastebuds beg for more of this magnetic magnificent flavor so I smell fruity pebbles definitely so let's go ahead and I've got a fresh wick right here turn this up as usual I didn't forget okay so let's do this pretty pummeled I'm still tasting that French toast it's such a really good flavor I'm it doesn't say it's got a butter flavor but I taste like a light butter flavor it tastes like and then drizzled drizzled syrup it's like it's more of a powdered sugar french toast with just a drizzle it's really really good it's really good it's so funny how the taste you can envision the taste it's really really funny dose this one goes here alright so let's go ahead and try this fruity pebbles Wow this definitely definitely tastes like a fruity pebble like it right away on the very first inhale I felt pretty pebble I really really did which is kind of funny because I've tasted other fruity pebbles and their cereal like they're sort of like fruity pebbles they can be mistaken for like a fruit loop this can't it tastes just like a fruity pebble definitely definitely tastes like a fruity pebble it's not soggy it's like a really really like crunchy fruity pebble like right when you first get it you eat it and you're crunching it that's exactly what it tastes it does taste definitely just like fruity pebbles fruity pebbles has like a sort of lemon kick to it and this has it but if you like fruity pebbles you'll definitely definitely like this and I love fruity pebbles I don't all of them fruity pebbles is probably my favorite definitely definitely a great pretty pebble I want to say that it's been my favorite fruity pebbles that I've tasted I've tasted so many fruity pebbles but this one is so true to its name that it's it's weird because I can I can literally picture three pebbles it's that weird now last but not least we have glazed doughnuts and if you know me I love glazed donuts so another type of breakfast type of bait but of course it can be a dessert because I and the description for this one is glazed doughnut eg spiny holy cannoli features a bocce a badge of freshly baked soft warm Donuts straight out of the oven and smothered in a sugary sweet glaze these sweet doughnuts get stuffed inside a crisp and buttery cannoli shell oh my god offering a unique way to feast on the Italian delicacy and still enjoy your favorite after-dinner treat I don't know about you but they had me cannoli like seriously like oh my god I'm like hurrying to try this turning that up another fresh wick and here we go oh my gosh that sounds so I've never had a glazed doughnut in a cannoli before but I've had no and cannolis and I've had glazed doughnuts and I already smell the glaze I love glazed doughnuts I really do like it's one of my weakness kind of foods because you can't have it for breakfast or you can have it as a snack so so let's go ahead and try this one oh my gosh please don't right on the inhale you're getting the glazed doughnut but on the exhale you're getting that buttered cannoli and it's not overpowering butter it's definitely cannoli though you can definitely tell the difference between a dough and a cannoli and this is it this is probably bronze like glazed doughnuts to a whole nother level for me this is really really good definitely not over sweet it's just like the other two it's sweet but it's not overly sweet which is something I like I can't vape a flavor all day that is too sweet for me and this has just the amount the right amount of sweetness this flavor here with that butter cannoli it it makes the glazed doughnut just that much better like I wish I had one in front of me right now it's that good that good YUM oh my god this is probably I'm probably gonna stick with this one for the rest of the night this is really really good oh my god yes yes yes yes yes if you like breakfast flavors you definitely gotta try this line I don't have the blueberry or the lemon but these three right now knocked it out of the park for a French toast this is definitely my favorite french toast I've not had a French toast that was so where the the the syrup was actually more of just glazed on and not poured on so I really really like this so if you're like me and you don't like a lot of a lot of syrup in your vapes or on your french toast this is definitely it I tend to overpower mine when I make french toast I put a lot of powdered sugar that's what I taste in this but it's not overly sweet which I really really like Fruity Pebbles oh my god so close to actually being a bowl of Fruity Pebbles like literally this right when I inhale you can't mistake it for like fruit loops or any panels or tricks or any no it tastes exactly like fruity pebbles really really good not overly sweet but it's a flavor that's really really satisfying so I really like this glazed donut and you got my heart this right here is I still taste it the taste lingers this right here is definitely a great mix of a glazed donut with a cannoli it is definitely my favorite type of glazed donut right here it's not like your regular everyday glazed donut but yet it is but with that buttered cannoli it just gives it

imperial porter and one that will surely make you look like a connoisseur then join me on this tasting my name is eddie and i have tasted and sampled many beers from all over the world and it is my passion to help you find that perfect beer you're looking for whether you're looking to try something new or there is something very specific that you're looking for to pair with your foot i got your back [Music] welcome back beer lovers thank you for spending the next few minutes with me as i said in the intro my name is eddie and on this channel i taste and review all kinds of beers and give you my most honest opinion about them as well as some ideas to pair them with your food just like the one you're about to watch so if you're new here consider subscribing and hitting that bell icon down there so you're notified every time i release and you'll be a review video if you like the video hit that thumbs up let me know you like it now what did i say i have an imperial porter other wise known also as a baltic porter so um you know those those two styles are pretty pretty similar sometimes they are you know also known as kind of stuff and today i have one from this brewery that i have never tried anything from them before they are out of idaho laughing dog brewery and i'm bringing you their pecan porter today check it out that's right pecan porter that sounds tasty and guess what i'm going to pour that on in to my nonic pine here which is the glass i recommend that you use when you're putting yourself a nice border whether it's a robust porter or an imperial porter or any other kind of powder and remember having the right glass for the beer that you are tasting is always an important piece of being a beer connoisseur so if you want to get your own set of beer concert tv glasses look in the description below check out the store and see how you can get your hands on a nice set of glasses now where do we always start appearance more importantly the three c's of appearance which are color clarity and carbonation that is right now the color it was or it is but you know you can be full and think that this is black it was very very dark brown color very clear actually it was clear when i poured it a nice carbonation yeah i would call that a very lots of action carbonation the head it's not as big a head of foam you know and it's dissipating somewhat quickly i mean you can see some of the lacing you've lost about half a finger already but it's still a nice still head there and it's nice green color head of foam so very very nice appearance all around now where do we go next aromas right well they're not trying to hide that pecan for sure it smells like caramelized pecans in there and all kinds of kind of like vanilla maybe even a hint of kind of like espresso or maybe even like a cappuccino scent uh smell there yeah very very nice sweet malty kind of aromas there it smells like dessert to be honest with you and i like pecan pie so maybe that's what i'm thinking about and now i'm going to taste it and let you know how it goes well slightly different than i expected i would say it's a lot it's a lot more bitter than i would have led to believe with such sweet aroma so tip of the tongue is very bitter actually the carbonation is nice throughout so you know if you're looking for something that cleanses your palate very nice carbonation and then that malt base with some of that sweet pecan caramelized pecan maybe burnt sugar and even a hint of like i said roasted coffee maybe like espresso all that comes through the middle then what lingers is a dry bitterness so it's and i'm still feeling kind of like a smoky even peppery dry bitterness there in the back of the palate that that kind of lingers so uh just keep that in mind but it's very very good i would call that light to medium body so again it was a lot more um it has a lot you know it was more bitter and a little bit heavier than i thought it was going to be from the appearance and the aromas but it's not a heavy beer at all it's maybe a little bit light to medium body there um that all comes important when we go to the next piece which is the part that you come to me for the part that makes you a concert the foot pairings right now porters you know they are bold beers with bold foods you want to pair them with foods that are equally bold so that the food can stand up to the beer and in this case we always look for you know meats grill meats smoked meats that have maybe sauces and stuff like that and in this case the first thing i'm going to say check it out honey pecan barbecue sauce chicken sliders yes it's a thing look it up if you don't believe me but that is going to be a great great pairing because a lot of those flavors are going to harmonize and like i said nice carbonation throughout by the way this is 8.1 alcohol by volume and i could barely barely uh taste some of that alcohol so they they do a nice nice job of you know kind of like balancing all the flavors there but because of the alcohol that's also going to help you enjoy some of those bold foods like the one i just i just um suggested also if you like thai food and if you're like you know noodles and stuff like that thai peanut noodles yes it's going to go great with the beer again it has that pecan flavor so a little bit of that nutty peppery peas part of the beer all those are going to really help you enjoy that thai food and it has enough malt to stand up to spicy food so go and enjoy your spicy foods with this beer because it's definitely going to to help you you know put down the fire when you need it when you need it to and um you know i rarely give any suggestion to vegetarians and i don't want to forget my vegetarian friends who love beer so a nice grilled portobello mushroom burger with some caramelized onions on top that will go great with this pecan powder that i have here so all those are my suggestions and as far as the cheese is smoke gruyere yes anything because what i have been learning and teaching you as i've been learning here is beers that have that long kind of smoky part of the taste they benefit from a smoky cheese to kind of pair and sound like it can almost like a rest it stops some of that smokiness from lingering way too much in the back there so i think a small gruyere would be a great great pairing with this beer now you know you can always trust me to leave you a great recommendation as far as a dessert pairing and today i think you're going to enjoy that again if you enjoy this kind of flavors here that's going to be a winning pairing there for you my friend now that concludes today's lesson but not before i ask you have you had laughing dog pecan porter before how have you enjoyed it have you enjoyed it with food have you drank it solo what are your impressions what are your comments leave me some comments below that's how we we all continue on this journey right so i hope i have helped you increase your beer knowledge as we all continue on this journey of becoming beer connoisseurs and i encourage you to be on the lookout over the next few days when i release my next beer review video and until then [Music] enjoy", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "wYX_zhlTDr8": "you tried these new berries and cream starburst pardon me what could have stopped busters you just say very Larry's better than what else and cream Oh berries and cream berries and creams I'm a little out of those berries and cream there is a grave there is a pretty mom with a lot of those berries cream [Music]", "lKS_Yu1LxqA": "what's up easy bakers so in honor of st patrick's day we're going to be making some fewd pebbles rice krispies treats for today's video but if you haven't already follow us on instagram at edbaker's llc and let's go ahead and be a gang gang by hitting that subscribe button so let's go ahead and jump into this easy behind recipe well i believe this step is optional about adding parchment paper to whatever pan you're going to use but i just like to make sure that none of my treats stick so i'm just gonna use a little bit of nonstick spray spray that add some parchment paper on that or you can use your infused butter but i'm going ahead and spraying parchment paper on the pan as well as on the parchment paper itself and i'm just making sure that all of my edges are nice and clean and crisp so first you want to go ahead and take your butter i did not tell y'all this is going to be a fuse anywho this is going to be infused so to this i'm using four tablespoons of infused butter now if you don't know how to infuse your butter i will leave a link in the description box as well as in the i cards for you for a tutorial on how i make my infused butter but if you don't want to have this infused that's all right girl go ahead and use some regular butter just use four tablespoons of salted butter put your tem put your scope on a medium low before you infuse folks this is a little tip for you y'all see that butter that i ran out of that was in that mason jar what i like to do to make sure that my stuff is great and potent i take my mini marshmallows because i am using 15 ounces of mini marshmallows and i'm just taking them pouring them in that mason jar and using my hands to get all of that extra butter that likes to clean on the side now if you are a original schmidt or digital type of easy baker you know i get all my product you feel what i'm saying you see the difference in that but anyway so back to the video so now you want to take 15 ounces of mini marshmallow and put that inside of that pan with the butter and if you're not using any infused butter you're going to wait until your butter melts down but now you're just going to wait well look at this boom y'all see all that look at that gone girl we got all of that honey so once i get my marshmallows in there i just like to mix it up a little bit because my butter has already is already melted down i just want to make sure that all of the marshmallows are coated with the butter and like i said before my heat is on a medium low heat and what you're gonna do is just gonna continue to stir this as you guys can see the marshmallows are melting now so it's not gonna take that long at all and you guys can actually do this in microwave you don't even need to do it on the stove and i'm going to add a splashy dash dash of vanilla extract this is my little secret that i like to give it a little you don't know what i'm saying a little stretchy so i'm just going to go ahead and mix that vanilla all the way in waiting until my marshmallows melt down then i'm going to remove it from the heat and add my fruity pebbles so go ahead and dump in all seven ounces of seven cups i'm sorry of your futy pebbles with the heat off and just slowly mixing that in together until everything is as sticky as possible girl [Music] now that you have everything all mixed in you're just going to go ahead and dump it in your prepared pan getting a thing of water which is very important this extra water that you have right here is going to prevent the the treats from sticking to your hand so every time that you go ahead and try to um what is it called like even out your rice krispie treats you're going and you notice that they're starting to the marshmallows is starting to stick to your hand just dump your hands in the water really a little bit and it's going to prevent the rice kiss retreats from sticking and i wouldn't meet daverny if i didn't get to rub a spatula and get all of that stuff out of that rubber spatula in that pan y'all why am i like this like everybody else well this is infused so this is why i'm like this but girl i could have been like let's just shut that up to the game don't worry about it girlfriend get all of these rice krispie treats but that's pretty much it you're just going to go ahead and shape your rice krispie treats and form them to that pan on an even like try to get it as even and as flat as you possibly can let that go ahead and harden for a few hours inside the refrigerator and then you're just going to go ahead and cut them up and serve them so after they harden up this is how they're going to look you're just going to cut them into even squares however you want whatever size you want them to be so thank you guys so much for watching this video i really do appreciate you happy st patrick's day and if

from the glass basic lime the first one is going to be the banana cream pie and the next one is going to be the sugar cookie um if you don't know my favorite all-time favorite blueberry flavor is actually their blueberry cake absolutely loved it i haven't really gotten any other ones somebody i think sent me that or i got it because somebody recommended it the blueberry one fell in love with it i even made a dupe on my diy um on elr for my diy flavors and i vape it all the time because i like it that much so we're gonna go ahead and take a look at these i do have mine in three milligrams of nicotine they do come in 60 ml bottles these are actually 70 30 vgpg and the banana cream pie is described as a banana cream pie so original so this is what it looks like so that's the banana cream pie again 70 30 vgpg and they do come in 60 ml bottles the next one that i have is the sugar cookie and the sugar cookie also comes in 60 ml bottle and 3 milligrams of nicotine is my preferred with um 60 ml bottle 70 30 vgpg so let me see the description of this one we already got the description of this one is actually cinnamon glaze sugar cookies i am so excited i love sugar cookies i love banana and banana cream pie and banana pudding and everything bananas so i'm really really excited so let's go ahead and do this now i do have a fresh wick right here which of course i do because i always have a fresh wig and let's go ahead and shake that up and i'm so excited you have no idea okay i'm not smelling it yet let me turn this up okay fresh wig and i'm dripping and i'm pulsing and i'm dripping and i'm posting oh i'm smelling it i'm smelling it oh my god i'm so excited this is like one of the these are definitely like on my top list to try because of that blueberry just because of the blueberry that's what's getting me to try this so here we go banana cream pie again that's what the bottle looks like and let's give it a big this is definitely like a banana cream pie on a graham cracker crust that's what it tastes like to me it's got definitely that graham cracker crust it's giving me a natural not a candy banana um it's not a heavy banana but the mixture it just works really really well together i like that a lot that graham crust really really gives it more flavor i thought that it was going to be like i'm getting so vaped out in here i thought that it was going to be more of just like a regular crust but it's a graham crust that makes it makes the flavor even better i really like this they did it to me again this is really really good yum yum okay so now on to the sugar cookie and again 70 30 vgpg and i have my three milligrams of nicotine and i have a fresh wig excited i've been dying to try this sugar cookie as a matter of fact i wanted to try to diy it before i even got it because i love sugar cookies now the only thing is is that depending on the amount of cinnamon in it is if i can actually vape it because for a long period of time usually with cinnamon vapes i can't really vape cinnamon vapes often because i actually have an allergic reaction in my mouth from cinnamon vapes but i found that if i just take a little by little like you know i'll have a little bit today just like a few puffs and then maybe tomorrow i didn't do it that way but i can't vape it all day because that's when i get the reaction so i worked around it so here we go i'm gonna go ahead and drip on here of course another fresh wick i smell cookie oh my god you don't understand when i see cookies i smell cookies i'm like i'm your best friend like if you want me you want to get to my heart just give me cookies so there we go i'm gonna go ahead and put the cap on okay got the cap on got that turned up and let's have a vape this tastes like a warm cookie that just came out of the oven fresh and buttery and just oh so the cinnamon is very light on it but it is there you can tell that it's got cinnamon but it's not an overwhelming cinnamon that cookie comes through so buttery so warm so almost crispy i can imagine it being crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside absolute glass never let me i'm telling you i wish i had stock in the company and that's all i'm saying that is a really really good sugar cookie it's a cinnamon sugar or cinnamon glazed sugar cookie it just tastes so good it really does that is a good sugar cookie if you like sugar cookie and you can vape cinnamon i guarantee you you will like this definitely definitely a must try along with our blueberry cake just saying but anyway just for this for this review it's just the sugar cookie and it's the banana cream pie and both of them literally blew my my mind they really did oh my god if i was to tell you which one's my favorite just out of these two i would probably go with the sugar cookie first i love the banana cream pie but like if i had to grab one i'd probably grab the sugar cookie before that especially if i could vape cinnamon all day long this would be my all day vape absolutely amazing this one i like a little bit better because i can literally envision a warm cookie coming out of the oven and i love love love warm cookies i really do and you can taste like the butteriness and you can taste the sugar on it and you can taste the cinnamon i'm not really getting a glaze i'm getting more of a sugar um like sweet sugar but it's lingering it's lingering it's really really good so yeah so that was the glass basics sugar cookie and um banana cream pie let me know your thoughts down below have you tried either of these and if you have which was your favorite and if you haven't and tried both have you tried either one of them let me know down in the comments and also tell me what your favorite e-liquid is like favorite brand and name of it i would love to know your thoughts down below and i will see you in the next one bye", "7j0OY3236jw": "Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation. I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today! At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay. I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular. So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog. It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham. Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except getting a bath. So, one day, when he heard the \nwater running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard. Then he ran away from home. He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty. He played at the railroad and got even dirtier. He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still. He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all. In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots. Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away. He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home. When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence \nand sat looking at the back door. One of the family looked out and said, \"There's a strange dog in the backyard... By the way, has anyone seen Harry?\" When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry. He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped. He rolled over and played dead. He danced and he sang. He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, \"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\" Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped. He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously. Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks. He'd found the scrubbing brush! And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house. Up the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind. He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before. \"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl, and her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\" Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic. As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, \"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick! It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!\" they cried. Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy. His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots. It was wonderful to be home. After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty. He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow. Did you like that? \nWell you're going to like this even better. This is my friend Ringo. I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home, so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending. Thank you.", "-803OICJaqc": "[Music] hey chef wayne here today i'm doing another item on one of my favorite foods i really like bananas um bananas but i like my bananas a certain way i don't like them when they get the spots on them and things like that so what i do as soon as they get to this point i put them in the freezer and after i get three of these nice bananas i make infused banana bread you ready let's get started right now now before we get started you want to subscribe to the channel click that little bell and share with all your friends i bet a lot of them like banana bread too but here we go we're going to get started i have a half a cup of cannabis butter that came in at approximately 780 milligrams of thc three very ripe bananas that i've had in the freezer okay i peeled the bananas cleaned them and put them in the bowl with the butter now i'm going to add two large eggs here we go after the eggs i'm going to add two teaspoons of vanilla extract i'm going to put that on the side we're going to make our dry bowl two cups of sifted flour once again we always sift the flour i'm going to add one cup of sugar to our flour we're going to add after that one teaspoon of baking soda a half a teaspoon of salt and followed by the salt we're going to go with half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder we're going to mix all this up real well and after we get it mixed up real well we're going to go ahead and we're going to mix our wet and our dry ingredients together make sure our wet ingredients are mixed real well first of all that butter mixed in there real good here we go gonna mix the wet and the dry together mix this with a folding spoon rubber spatula don't need a whip for this just fold it all together nicely now we're gonna transfer it into our baking pan that we're going to place in the oven 350 degrees for 45 to 55 minutes there's what it looks like about halfway through now when we pull it out of the oven look at this beautiful banana bread we got 14

forget to subscribe to the channel click the little bell until next time happy cannabis cooking", "sl-pKOg1gso": "today Kevin and I are going to be reviewing the sugar-free Hawaiian Punch singles together these were $2.99 at Walgreens that you get 46 inside but there are four flavors of fruit juicy red wild purple smash buried bunkers and berry blue - so I'm gonna let you get them already while i read what's on the box okay now when you open them up they're not color coded they're all blue so I'm assuming that's downward reformer okay where do you see that oh yeah okay that one's okay so that would be an immediate compliant is easily identification right because for example we reviewed a 40 pack of the skittles the skittles are very clearly there is a purple one there is a yellow one there's a purple one there's an orange when there's a red one and there's a grey one the berry - it could be almost dark in the room and I can get in the box and look oh it's purple and pull it out so this you're actually having to take this out and read it which I just I think they could have made that easier they could have color-coded it like they did on the box so what did you go got buried bunkers here's wild purple smash blueberries - and a dip say these terribly you need a fruit juicy red there's a pretty juicy Brad okay it says now you can take the refreshing taste of sugar bring the wine touch anywhere you go with 40 packets in each box you can enjoy a quick and delicious drink at the gym during market pull in your car or wherever you go [Applause] yeah that is a pain because anytime I'm very trim comes in the box I don't I don't want to start like this just like with the skittles I liked all this fit they were all good but my favorite was the purple so I went through and I picked out all the purple ones so this one as unique as I was you know this one I would literally have to take them all out of the box if I didn't like certain ones and divide them up yeah what makes it easier on them to print them but still it would have been nice but it's easy for the customer so they just need to know that these are the fruit juicy red and wild purple smash are five calories these berry bunkers and berry blue typhoon are 10 calories so and these are the I would think these little skittles are primates out the same company they're made by its mods it's the gel cert company in Chicago Illinois it's probably the same company it's easy to make take a sip from a full bottle of water to make room for powder pour one packet into a 16.9 points bought fluid ounce bottle which we did shake the bottle bottle until the pilot resolves listen they both kills the gel circa that's it same company so yeah so the skittles is decided here but is this and I like all of these girls but I prefer like the purple one knowing it all everyone's first I've been drinking all the green ones first right so it's just it's just easier to identify them if there's a color-coded like that so or you want to trauma in this order no I just tell I don't care let's do the wild purple smash this one yes exactly that firm on the purple or the same one is a little bit wider person that's very cool mm-hmm um I mean it's uh bad it's not bad but it's also not overly sweet no I have been drinking a lot of skittles yeah so we're expert school yeah this is not near as Swift as the skittles well it's got oh my god it's a horse like in my column just bitter or anything like that it's just that I don't know yeah yeah smooth sweet yeah it's just not as good it's oh yeah it's okay but it would not be one that like that one out I wouldn't necessarily want to pick that one yeah that was pretty much great I think it was great yeah it was mainly grape it just wasn't an overly sweet right right so now this is the berry bunkers who knows once again it's not a sweet it's that same flavor the same level of sweetness as the one before it does have a very vibrant that's a very flavor the flavor is okay it's just as it has that underlying well because there are harshness like a roughness to it yeah no III understand what you're saying it's hard to explain this is very blue type thing well Scratchy when you're drinking it I mean that seems crazy but it is that would have liked more than any at home um it did have that it's sweeter I think that's why it this is so far has been the sweetest one there and it does taste like it does have a berry flavor to it so that one I would I would pick out of the box I mean I probably won't throw it wouldn't you not throw it but I really wouldn't give away any of these there's just something that I would choose before others so then this one is the fruit juicy bread and that Brian like that one the best that one in the berry blue typhoon are probably my very favorite in there is that fruit juice it does yes it tastes for me it's more like a tropical kind of I got a punch like why imagine I think is the best yeah like and it's also on the sweeter side so I do like both of these and I know just because they're sugar-free doesn't mean they weren't didn't have the ability to put the sweetness in there because the skittles or sugar-free as well and they're like over-the-top sweet so those first two they just weren't as sweet as the other ones this one you said tropical punch is this wine punch for ants I'd say this yeah why this is quite like the original red wine yeah um this though this box because I only like half of the flavors really a watch I would not buy this box again no worries like the skittles I was by the skittles over and over again I could drink any of them yes there are something I like more than others but I like them all these I just I wouldn't care if I ever had those first two in this frame would don't be a mix that I was right and the skittles me and Amy complimented each other because once she really liked it I was okay with the ones I would like she was okay with so we could split the box yeah with these neither one of us would really pick the Purple's out for us right exactly what's rubbing Riddler yeah exactly that's it that's probably the back side that's a personal preference I wouldn't buy this video I'm not sure I have the skills because they're just so good right yeah that quick drink of liquid Cavey yeah it really is yeah if you see only you need to get on we're still only seeing them at Walgreens so that's just where you have to look for these things for now hopefully they'll get them in Walmart soon and they'll be a little bit cheaper so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "tcy7F8gmRvY": "you did not eat like you you didn't eat that good you can't just eat those bad cuz you're gonna be messed up

again and people with us today as always we're joining back by our sidekick you guys know him as the box we also have with us today we have alexa when was ben and jerry's founded ben and jerry was founded on may 5th 1978 by ben cohen and jerry greenfield it is 42 years old 42 years old anyway guys as always it looks like it's that time it's time for other exciting insane super official thought-provoking straight edge food product reviews youtube's only true there's if i don't everybody where ben and jerry's punchline ice cream limited batch it says people it's got brown butter bourbon almonds uh chuckles of cherries chuckles of cherries so this is a netflix netflix taco takes on comedy as sears as we tight as we take making ice cream but neither of us takes ourselves too serious here's a punchy flavor to prove it we recommend pairing this lickable libation with any netflix stand-up special sitcom or funny movie netflix is a joke but this limited batch flavor isn't anyway guys we're gonna give this a review and see what it's all about so remember if you have anything you'd like read the box arch your legs review you gotta leave a comment below if we like that comment guys we might just pick it out and review your request next thumbnail looking forward to this limited batch of ben and jerry's ice cream all righty guys now i picked this up at kroger for three bucks so let's open it up here if it's not child proof that is it may be child proof it may be read proof i guess you could say and that's some good plastic i'm glad they really seal it up like that that's a good thing most people's not going to be eating this in their car so take it home and get you a knife and tire into it you know so there we go we got it that's good good sturdy package very impressed there from ben and jerry's let's see man oh it looks just like vanilla ice cream a little bit there as you can see nothing special it doesn't look like anything special does it let's get down into it here and see what we've got okay okay wow wow it's almost like they have the nuts very finely cut up inside of the ice cream [Music] they do that's clever isn't it very clever there's uh very finely the nuts are very finely inside of the ice cream very finely chopped up it's not like a big like a big almond it's very finely chopped up i like that very clever from netflix and ben and jerry's punch line flavor so this is probably gonna be a limited batch like they said it's not gonna be out long so i've always figured i've always seen ben and jerry's is a little bit overrated anyway people i think they're while they're good you know they're there's a little bit of cherry right there let's try this here it's like the cherries mixed inside of the ice cream you really can barley you can barely see it people you have to really look so they've done a great job people i was expecting to have like big size uh cherries in it and big peanuts but they've done a great job just you know chopping it up and mixing it right in the ice cream very nice very evenly done no doubt about that definitely a lot better than i expected people so overall people it's great flavor got the brown butter bourbon you can taste it the almonds are great it's good a little bit of cherries in it it's good ice cream it really is and i just said it was overrated well i think they're a little bit upready but it's good to see a company with just two people in it start a company and just do great at it so overall people i highly recommend it you can see the nuts if you look see the nuts all around it there it's pretty neat but overall people i'm going to give it a very solid is that a cherry right there you can see oh no what is that look at that people would that be a cherry i guess that would be yeah anyway people overall i'm going to give it a very solid score you know there really isn't any bad the only bad ice cream i would say that i've had people is ice cream that's out of date it's hard to find bad ice cream it really is so overall people ben and jerry's punch line ice cream vermont's finest is gonna get a very solid score of four stars it's good it's good so that's going to be the official review people as always thank you so much for watching me the box archie alexa we'll see you guys as always next time man that i was just i just could not get over how well they had this thing sealed up with that plastic man tell you what that was very impressive and uh it was it was sealed up nice and good nice and tight just like the ex-wife used to be before malcolm

vape let's do a juice review today I'm keep it 100 blue slushie hey we'll start off we'll read you the description on this flavor and then we'll we'll move along with it here and I'll tell you my thoughts on it says you haven't tasted a blue slushie baked like this keep it 100 hit it out of the park with this refreshing mix this refreshing mixed berry blend each use that will remind you of your favorite blue frozen drink from the convenience store this refreshing mixed berry juice will definitely become your new all day vape they are every juice I think I've reviewed says it's going to become your next all day vape and you know I guess at some point you know blind hog finds a nut every once in a while some somebodies we're gonna do a review and it's gonna be somebody's next all day vape and so this juice I got it from E G's Connect that's where I get a lot of my juices from not affiliated with them in any way shape fashion form anything like that 100 mil bottle was 100 100 mil bottle I gave $9.99 for him man that's a value in my opinion of course you have to pay shipping on that but you know I live in a rural areas I don't have a vape shop I have pretty well gotta order my stuff online and so I'm gonna pay shipping anywhere I go so to get the price point down to $9.99 for 100 mils of quality juice I'm a big fan of keep it 100 I've tried a few of their juices this is the first one that I've done a review for on YouTube I believe and I can tell you right now I'm a fan of their juices you know their most of their Jesus fit my flavor profile especially these that are the lemonade the blue slushie the mix of blue slushie lemonade I just man out I've really liked them ugh you can tell they're quality juices they use quality ingredients nothing comes out real real style so zero steep time for me on blue slushie I have this is not my first bottle of this stuff and I've never had to really steep it it does get better after a day or two but right out the package it tastes great to me so it just really honestly kind of just gets a little sweeter so hey good things with that comes in a 70/30 VG PG blend cloud productions which you would expect I just noticed my tank is not completely full and so we're going to fill it up here as I continue to talk I normally try to have all my gear ready before we go on but I guess it's not that bad to show you that and let me show you something these free max mesh pros when I fill them up I'll remove the drip tip especially if I'm using 100 mil chubby gorilla bottle and you'll see it will actually fit on there a lot better that drip tips not in your way oh that over drip and go all the way to the top there bad boy okay yeah we so you know I always try to come filled before I get on there and do a review I didn't this time so you can actually watch me put some in so that's what we're vaping on today a vapor isso looks revamping at 95 Watts I've got the wrap-up set to hard do have a free max mesh pro with triple mesh calls on the inside that's my go to thank you watch me and my reviews it won't take you very long to pick up that I'm a huge fan of the free max mesh pro tank as long as I'm buying on gear and buying my own juice I'm gonna vape on what I want how I want when I want where I want all that good kind of stuff if you would like for me to review your products get with me and I'll vape what you send to me I'm also going to give a straight up and down opinion on that particular item but for now I'm a fledgling in the review world I'm a small fish in a big big big tank and so the good part about that is I get to review the juices I want because I'm paying for them I only a hardware that I want because I'm paying for so this is a really good little setup I'll tell you right now I like to make bread so looks good and try it this happens to be a Sophie vapes Edition I just wanted to own it it comes with a great little SKR our tank I liked a little tank but again I'm a free max kind of guy so back to this juice I'll get sidetracked a real quick if I'm not paying attention keep it 100 blue slushie let's vape on it and we'll talk about flavors that I'm getting from it favorite productions what you'd expect with 70/30 VG PG blend again I've got the airflow crank down pretty low let's open the airflow all the way and take a bait much much much more vapor production again one of the things that I can say with this juice and with this tank combination is the flavors still there even with the airflow open wide up so uh you know I don't have anything bad to say about this eg you so I can tell you that right now if you like blue slushies it tastes like a blue slushie this is a juice that I'll probably start moving more into using this top my flavor profile is typically of like custards cakes that sort of thing as we move into the warmer months and in the south it's definitely getting warmer and it's going to get there quick I tend to start going more toward the blue slushies and the lemonade's and the things like that they just seems to be more summertime top vapes for me and so this is one I'll really start going through when I order this though I don't order just one bottle I were a couple bottles because I'm a big big fan it's not overly sweet it's not one that's just gonna blow your hair back with sweetness but it's got the tartness it's got the sweetness it's got the blue raspberry flavor it really does to me tastes like what I remember I bleach less you tasting like it's been years since I've had a blue sauce but it tastes like one best I can remember it's just really good it you said this thing if your flavor profile are the razzle berries to some of us lemonade's the the blue raspberries the anything like that and keep it 100 blue slushies going to be one you might want to give a shot and try it out now could this one be an all-day rate for me you bet I can I can all day vape this one oh no problem would I share this with a buddy I wouldn't give him none but I'd tell him where he can go get a bottle of that and recommend it because if this fits his flavor profile he's really gonna like it you know the quality of the juice real good I can tell there's really no hard there's really no discerning throat hit with this juice it's a smooth vape the flavor rolls across your tongue good it's got a real good inhale a real good exhale there's flavors on both this is just I mean it hits all points as far as the Vagos packaging I don't see any problem with this packaging we're getting a little close there with the blue with the you know the blueberries back there but I don't think that's marketing to children I think that's just advertising so I have zero problems I think this is a responsible packaging got your warning right there pertinent information on the back they do not Stu do's and all that kind of stuff so no problem at all with the packaging here this is responsible packaging and kudos to the company that designed the label on this juice all in all I would say this is a real good juicer I'm going to write this juice between a one being Dana way I'd vape it and a 10 being honey man that's the juice I'm gonna give this one a 10 and and and I think anybody this flavor profile kinda is similar to mine that might like you know this these type juices you're gonna like this juice a lot so

going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time the wonka gummies instead of the wonka uh chocolate bars we looked at not last week i think the week before um anyway lab tested i don't know about that lab tested for quality inconsistency confused with solvent free cannabis distillate [Music] so these are like a black market edible pretty much they have a bunch of different flavors i guess or types of gummies these are peach rings i think um there's some a nice nice government warning for you don't mind my dog complaining um but i like to like i didn't even notice this before but the rainbow finish on it i don't know what exactly that is but it looks fire 500 milligrams no children's california wow if we take a look on the back there's an actual nutrition fact section um no serving size or anything just really all that's in here it's just really just sugar and a tiny bit of saturated fat um not a significant source of vitamin d calcium iron or potassium i was not planning on it ingredients cannabis oil sugar glucose fructose syrup wheat flour malic acid dextrose palm oil citric acid artificial flavor antioxidants sorbic acid dufferin artificial colors um and usually these are um hopefully if you ever get these they will be sealed but even if they are sealed you can kind of tell they've been like tampered with like heat sealed you know what i mean so it's always a risk when you get something like this um it could be very very good but also uh could be very bunk but these ones i got pretty lucky because these ones are actually pretty gas for what they are i saved one of them so we can take a look at it let me take this bad boy out and there we are your basic candy ring and says these are infused but uh you can really really taste it on like the outside so i'm assuming these are sprayed and not infused but if you're looking for a really cheap edible that you're willing to take a chance on i i would recommend these uh it comes with a good amount of them and i i ate a few and i was feeling very nice so they do work depending where you get them but wonkagumi's uh a classic company made into something very frowned upon but oh well i hope you guys enjoyed the video i got a ton of videos like this on my channel if you want to check it out and uh yeah later", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "cmLmf5v9u0g": "hey

know when I showed you the front that I turned it around to show you the back I didn't realize you guys weren't seeing how much THC is in there but if you turn it one more time you looked out at the very bottom there not so much THC is in there got some spaghetti some Parmesan cheese some salad with some French salad dressing wash that down with a cold Molson Canadian and that's supper oh my flock off to wash my meat cigarette I'm gonna try one of these [ __ ] thingamabobs that came out of the grass chief order so it'll be broken up because I dropped it on the basement floor okay and you severe hurt you know then it's okay would there's a billion better things for the munchies in this [ __ ] smoking weed and the end of all like dry you know this isn't gonna [ __ ] help anything it's only gonna make matters worse came with two in the pack I'll save the other one for Dona she went to take Charlie for a walk I'm pretty sure she said she was going to what you call it drink one of those hot chocolates the 50 milligrams 50 milligrams of THC usually she only does I think 25 milligrams per night like over edibles at so 50 milligrams let's double what she's used to we'll see what happens Canada Post is working again they're finally [ __ ] moving so I decided today to order up that external piece for the GoPro and [ __ ] Donna found some little microphone on line for me there looks like it'll go nice so order that up too but Canada Post is pretty backed up I bet so I don't know how long it's going to take to get here so yeah yeah okay the water is boiled dollars gonna pour it into the cup which doesn't fly all over the floor do you want any milk or anything okay we'll let that cool down a little bit and then we'll come back to us tastes the weed you mean the THC you

and it took that if you having a good maybe having a good old time what you can hurt yourself more sure if your wrist was broken and it wasn't a lot of pain and then you have like a lot and the people away so you start like using your wrist for that's probably not a good thing if you have a broken wrist and you just start using it I think if you had a sore wrist you would know that your wrist had problems [ __ ] you just [ __ ] insect [ __ ] you or something [ __ ] right in view there you wouldn't feel the pain because if it landed on you slapping it off and running it wouldn't get a chance to

minutes and I will come back to you in two hours to let you know how I am feeling because that's the most important part of the edible review now we've got a sticker here that says hard to see with no background start with one bite that's the wait for at least two four hours for the full effects we're going to ignore that advice and go straight into the beans here we go whoo that tastes like dark chocolate covered coffee beans Wow that's not bad actually they're very bitter but no wheat taste so I see you I'm specific you're not also very caffeinated is that part of this I hope maybe a fun side effect so guys they're quite a few of them in here I'm gonna crunch and munch on them all and I will see you guys in two hours to let you know how these guys are feeling I should come to you quite high and quite jittery from all the caffeine well who knows maybe unroasted espresso beans don't have caffeine I don't know who says who's to say we'll find out soon see in two hours feels like I'm caffeinated already see you then peace guys I am back it has been 2 hours thank you for sticking around and man I love this the Terra the Kiva excuse me the Kiva ter a hundred and twenty milligram espresso beans are great I mean I'm really high for 120 milligram Anibal they tasted great and I feel pretty energized like yeah you know like there's just probably quite a bit of caffeine in there maybe yeah this is this is a great great product another real win from Kiva I was I was optimistic about it but it was a little you know trepidatious and never had like the chocolate-covered espresso beans and was a little worried about how potent they might be and how they might taste and on both fronts I gotta say they exceeded expectations really happy with this one from Kiva and this is again the Kiva Tara espresso beans it cost me I believe 12 bucks at my dispensary worth every penny home run love it if you see it a dispensary grab it and that's gonna do it for this episode here on wheat skies I would throw this at the camera like I normally do but I'm afraid it would break it because I think this screen is made of glass yes I think it is okay all right well thank you so much for

this is 90 milligrams of THC in the little square opening sugars but it looks like this swimming okay so um the strawberry cheesecake I'm sorry I'm driving the bumps and she said it's are because the strawberry well whoa mr. ivy cheesecake is 90 milligrams of THC this is ten milligrams per serving so I'm guessing like little squares I'm opening up right now she guess what it looks like okay guys

Caminos again I could instant little like twitch in my eye with this I don't feel that I'm wait about two hours and come back and let you guys know how I feel it it tastes really delicious it did taste like weed not like overpowering like disgusting you know weed flavor but it is a clicker good you do taste of marijuana it's not overpowering where it's like completely gross but you do taste it they know it's gonna be an edible cuz they're gonna taste it not super strong but they're gonna taste that [ __ ] how they held it the right amount continue on South Fairview Street for four miles

only only 2.8 of my viewers are subscribed which is very depressing so if you like what you see scroll down press the subscribe button and yeah enjoy the video hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time wonka bar edibles uh i had one of these over a year ago um but when i had it it was a bit fatter this way it was a bit wider and it was 500 milligrams instead of 300 and also they didn't have these um flavors it was just the milk chocolate but now there's a bunch of different flavors mostly based around cereal i think there's some like candy based flavors as well this is the captain crunch it says it's basically like a black market edible i don't think these are sold in any dispensaries that from what i've seen warning contains medical marijuana each chocolate bar contains 300 milligrams plus 300 milligram milligrams plus of cannabinoids i got your nutrition facts right there three grams of protein wow um 220 calories serving size one bar i don't know how some people can just eat edibles like that but i they [ __ ] kill me like i i cannot handle edibles very well anyway if we bust this bad boy open i i swear i'm pretty sure the one way back actually had wonka like on the chocolate but i guess i could be wrong because i don't remember it that well but i'm a big fan of this chocolate to be honest um very potent i would say as well for for for a uh black market not extremely legit edible they're very reliable and consistent for what they are so i would definitely recommend them but i would also be very careful unless you are experienced with edibles i guess unless you eat a ton at a time and know where you know what your limits are if you have any limits i know some people that can just eat tons and tons and tons of these things and i feel nothing my dog's complaining in the background what bud i'm making a review one second anyways in conclusion if you're looking uh for you're not trying to spend a crazy amount of money if you're if you're in the realm of uh black market edible then i would definitely recommend these if you're okay with that pretty cheap only about 25 bucks a bar if you're just buying one 25 30 dollars definitely worth it this captain crunch flavor pretty good and i'm not the biggest captain crunch fan so i'm sure the other flavors um are even better so thank you guys for watching i got a bunch of videos like this if you enjoyed it uh drop a sub check out my other videos and yeah later", "JqhDejT6d5M": "I'm not really an edible person but I have to tell you whatever they put in this thing they've done a good job I [Music] bought a couple of quarters at a dispensary the other day and they offered you know a freebie and so I decided to go with the edible that they were offering and it happened to be a kirova Saturday morning cookie sample and took it home tried it out and I got to tell you I really really like this brand I really like this I mean I'm not familiar with edibles you might have a particular brand you like I came across these and whatever they're putting inside this thing I got to tell you it works really well for me I think these things are awesome you might have other brands that you particularly care for but I highly highly recommend you try the kirova I am not affiliated with them in any ways and just you know came across them at random and I really really like this cookie plus it's only 150 milligrams so I would maybe recommend to kind of start with these if you're just getting into edibles as far as dosing goes it's a good idea to start small now like I said this is 150 milligrams and you know other cookies and other things in other bars and other products they have you know 250 500 I've seen it even a thousand milligrams which is for me is it's too much you know I can't quite do that type of a thing but this packaging here says that it's got 15 servings per package so if you do the math it's like 10 milligrams per serving so if you're able to divide the cookie up as evenly as possible you can kind of figure out your dosage from there and I would probably you know I would say start with 20 milligrams these things can you know come across you anywhere from 10 minutes to you know 45 minutes to an hour depending on your metabolism and kind of like what's going on with your body and stuff like that so I always like to pass along the information which is kind of the thing with edibles because you know dosing is such a it's such a gray area definitely be careful with this don't eat a whole one for the first time if you're just starting out because you probably would have not such a great experience and you might not you know you might not come back to pick up some more this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much in size even if you're a beginner start with twenty milligrams you know and see see where you go give yourself a little bit of time wait for about half an hour or so and see how you're feeling you know if you go on to maybe an hour hour and a half and you're still you know you're feeling good but maybe you want to feel a little bit better maybe try another ten twenty milligrams and then just call it good and see where you end up there some people will just you know eat something go I don't feel anything and eat some more I don't feel anything and all of a sudden they're just they're just blitzed it's the first time for them that would be that would be a shame because they wouldn't receive the benefits of the Saturday morning cookie so you know if you're just starting out that's what I would recommend for you to do dosing wise hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol calm and the kirova Saturday morning cookie thanks for watching [Music]", "PfYE4KY2DxQ": "it's rolling up until morning is certified pothead you may notice a I'm not smoking right now I do got some super flame for you and you put it on spin move never gonna be doing a review of some dank gummies so without further ado let's jump to the close-up [Music] [Music] [Music] hi Burke owes me some other bird emojis flapping in the comments section as we take a look at the base edifice never look at these dang gummies these are peach rings now I'm already about to in um I wasn't smoking if you know video so I can tell you how they make the reef you just go ahead pop this third one it you know explain to you how to take all right Burke up these have a very decent peach scent oil you don't really get a cannabis scent coming out of them you know it's a very good peach and kind of sugar scent place papi can try to break down how to taste actually it [Music] coating very sugary when you start to break it open very nice peach flavors come - and it's actually a pretty good Pete very good peach representation like it almost tastes like biting into an extra peach [Music] not really picking up too much of the cannabis at first but starting to come through is still behind the peach flavor a lot but figured up on the very end of the taste as far as what I'm feeling right now three of these are 15 milligrams this is the third one out hat so same won't break that break down the third mini twenties they're almost 30 milligrams I've already a and it's a nice feeling nice body high relaxing everything on and you spiny gummies but I will say they do them a try you don't want to go just eating a whole bunch of them because it takes a while creme to uh jump in nice you start to feel the effects so you can easily overdo it but they'll be afraid these at will be real good I'm I definitely recommended that to Lamar come out there [ __ ] cuz [ __ ] bring buddy trumpeted but daddy what a comedown [Music]", "ciNMbLUS_0k": "what's up guys my name is Shana we're back again so today I have a treat for you see what I did there ok so this stuff right here is supposed to be the granddaddy of desert babes this is a vanilla bean ice-cream sandwich between two Fruity Pebbles cereal rice krispies treat things right there this is a big mother bottle of juice right here this bad boy is huge I mean look at that thing it's messes the biggest bottle of juice I think I've ever had even the drip top thing goes all the way down it's absolutely a behemoth when I received this guy it came in this box right here look at that how awesome is that it's like a big wrapped up piece of candy and you got that nice logo on it right there it looks amazing that's actually maybe you want to buy this bottle of juice if you guys haven't seen the promotion for this thing check it out right here so I pretty much saw that thing and I was like oh my god I need to have this like in my life right now okay so inside the actual packaging right here came with a big bag with the juice in it right here as well as a separate unicorn bottle so you don't have to walk around with this big-ass behemoth in your pocket right here haven't really use this bad boy yet I assume it just works like any other drip cap but it does have a also a treats logo on it it didn't just come with a plain generic one right there the marketing for this thing is in full swing it is some really hyped up juice right now the low going is very minimalistic looks really good such treats it looks like a 1980s hotline Miami neon style stuff going on here two three milligrams of nicotine in this manner JAMA and Max VG so really really good drip juice right here so for getting further I've actually never had vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles meshed together as an ice cream sandwich so we're gonna solve that problem right now okay so what I have right here is a vanilla rice krispies treat homemade smash between some vanilla bean ice cream we're gonna go ahead and try this manage a minute then we're gonna compare it to the juice we go ahead and actually do the review on it oh wow yeah I'll prove huh tastes like diabetes okay so now that I've experienced that I know what to expect hopping right on into this bottle right here so we're gonna go ahead and open this bad boy up and start the smell test on it okay so this stuff right here legit smells like some fruity pebble ice cream with a heavy sense of cream coming out of the smell of it it could vape completely different so I have it all loaded up right here an MVP 3.0 Pro Edition tugboat RDA brand-new dual coil build new cotton new everything is loaded up run at 60 watts it's ready to go this is treats buy treats I think hmm it's mixing real well with the treat that I just ate okay so like usual the lemon is very dominant inside this cereal babe however I am tasting the vanilla ice cream a little bit very very cloudy juice it's not so much like a looper it legit tastes like an original juice it's not the greatest thing in the world and if for damn sure does not taste like what I just ate I just think it's a little overhyped I mean the presentation is absolutely amazing with that being said though I do however think it's a really good cereal juice I am getting the vanilla ice cream but it doesn't really taste like an ice cream it tastes more like a standard vanilla mix with some fruity pebbles it has a very distinct amount of cream to it kind of like a fruity pebbles milkshake does that make sense that's kind of what I'm getting out of this like a fruity pebbles vanilla milkshake now the cereal is not as lemony as some other juices out there the lemons is still very dominant inside treats I think with the extra cream and the hint of vanilla to it it actually holds its own do I think it's worth 50 bucks no I do not however it does only come in 120 milliliters so if you guys do want to try yourself dropping 250 bucks on maybe you guys can pitch in with some friends and you guys can all take like 30 mils out of it or something like that and just kind of share the bottle pass it around do that sort of thing and if you like it then go ahead and spend the extra 50 bucks and get yourself your own personal Boheme a--the right here I do think it's a little overhyped however it's still a solid cereal juice it's not a bad juice by any means I do wish it had more of like a marshmallowy taste to it versus like a creaminess sample it out a little bit because it is an investment this is a $50 bottle of ejuice right here now you do get a lot of a juice however if you don't like it you're stuck with a behemoth of a juice that you're not probably not going to use and you're probably gonna give away to your friends I however thoroughly enjoy it I think it's a pretty good juice I'm giving it a solid two thumbs up just because it does kind of hold its own in the cereal market and the presentation is amazing the juice is a it's definitely a top not a juice I like max VG juices so one of my favorite cereal juices on the market right now is kilos cereal milk and I still prefer kilos cereal milk over treats right here now I do have the juice and I'm gonna let this steep for a little bit longer and it's probably going to grow on me a lot more bottom line though it's a solid juice if you guys want to make the investment on it I'll put the link right down to description as far as being overhyped I really don't have anything bad to say about it it's still a pretty good juice and I will gladly recommend it and that's about it anyway guys if you enjoyed this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and stay tuned for another one hi", "NzrMBjghzmw": "what's up YouTube thanks for checking in is the dark heart nurseries blueberry muffin starting

in my home he owns here really he's cool as hell they're so sweet and top honestly do that go solid nine they don't taste nothing like weed they taste soft um they're sweet and I don't know it's just the only reason I don't give it a solid 10 because it's really sugary but I mean I guess is how shooters are you know the full of sugar but just personal preference like I'm not a huge sweet tooth so sometimes I'm like things that are hella sweet like I think my favorite kind of edibles like sour edibles cuz I like yeah because he is a sour patch kids mr. CPK what about you though one time I'll give it a ten yeah this is all good today's nothing like we ever like I can keep eating without realizing they're edible that's the best parts they don't taste like we honestly I hate eating everyone cheers boom so that come on your day we got a gang that stuff you guys um we're gonna go ahead and go for the crispys way softer but like let me taste a real with strawberries yeah you know the one seems like I mean the other ones are basically this plus the true texture and step over it so it's obviously will be a little harder but these are really soft I taste like yeah it's just like cereal man tastes like waking up like cereal everybody has the dry exactly what it tastes like you know what like hey you ever had um was it called alright only with a KO and I'll be having the dry like strawberry fruit on it just like that that gonna be so baked if this it's getting to one of these five words we have guys um hot chocolate Mexican style hot chocolate to be exact this is it up here not sure if you guys can read it or not but chocolate they I will eat that and has a dope-ass quote it reads you are not lucky to be here the world needs your perspective they are lucky to have you that is pretty tight man and that's from Antonio he hit on the hot tea hey what hey Antonio song bro he's the president and CEO of the Hispanic Heritage Foundation shout out to you Antonio saludos package is forgot like all of this stuff right here so you can measure out what's going on is this is a reflection of what the chocolate bar is you know but yeah so you get the chocolate bar like this and now you actually got to be a little slick with how you open it but you're just basically Shawn do that and then want to open just get your fingers up in there man and start busting it up buzz down tatianna you know anything snap them and croc on my how's it taste like that have you ever like as a kid took a little bite of that chocolate sounds like a dude's like it is crazy it even leaves out texturing your mouth and soup the same huh the little powdering stuff that you get from it bomb it tastes just like it I mean for lovely that don't understand we're talking about this like Mexican style hot chocolate it has an old lady in front of it it's like a yellow package and when you bite into that hot chocolate before cooking it this is what it tastes like BOM mmm mmm please make like childhood memories mm-hmm so long by far I think my variable from everything we've tried what about you so far mm-hmm you think so Jill that's really enjoyable right there and I thought this is the perfect get high to snack because it's easy to swallow down and eat like I you remember eating edibles back in the day that just used to taste horrible and you're literally like forcing yourself to try to eat that [ __ ] this thing will have you coming back and eating more than you should it was nice is that you can just come up and close it and it'll still right back up you know keep your product fresh it's pretty cool all right guys so check it out we have or chat die here and he will not be no two completely different colors here but I'm excited to try them out let's give them a good shake we're gonna go ahead let's do this one we're gonna try out or tap that man probably the one I'm most excited about just cuz come on Oh to check that that's traditional as him but who has that murder watch at back oh my god yeah but you should be those who compete right you have both of those what do you want or chatter on Micah go check them I think so too the one thing is like it is a dairy product so not everybody consumes Dariush it but or chopping this is so good has a little measuring bars and stuff to the side so you can measure everything know how much you've consumed they got 100 milligrams in here Babur about 30 milligrams in which is these which is a drink this is each tickle mark indicates 10 milligrams Oh each tick mark I thought I'd take them work yeah I'm already feeling it low key ow it is just like oh yeah you got goddamn she scarves like 30 milligrams down mm-hmm has a kick to it as far as explain it to them like it's I don't know her sweetie like it's not bad it doesn't taste horrible and it doesn't taste like wheat but it doesn't have a kick to it you could tell something in there yeah you know what I feel like it's the best way to describe that it was like that it's almost like having an alcoholic drink and then when you have lunch a little stronger so you know you're sipping alcohol went towards compared with having some drinks where you're just like drinking away then you can't even taste alcohol you're just like this tastes great you know that's kind of like your chat dies the chat that's really hard to even know it's anything in there like to be I think the best thing that was just shaking especially like this one so you make sure that yeah well you do get to like the last drink you could get intense good I want to like freeze this up I don't know if it would break off in you the THC but imagine freezing and making lollipops popsicles no lollipops which I'm way to make them yeah or you go Mexican style and then like you need a little stick or a stick and you get plastic bags plastic bags and then you just fill up the plastic bag you put the stick in there you put a rubber band around it and then boom homemade but look man if you guys enjoyed the video make sure you guys smash that like comment down below let me know from all the food you guys saw which one do you think

people", "4D6OuUeZTDY": "hey what's up YouTube so I just wanna do this real quick review on another Kiva product I got so something news coming into my co-op so it's pretty cool this is the Tara from Kiva confections of the espresso beans 120 milligram it's pretty it's a birthday warning not a food that's definitely for sure these come in like a little tiny coil like this and they tell you when you're supposed to use them like a date come with the seal it warns about being high levels of THC it's full of stuff it's supposed to have so but so anyways it's these are expressive things so you open up the can and then they have this little tiny thing in here tolik THC tolerance is very start with one bite wait at least two hours for full effect okay so this is what the little chocolates the thing is about these is they have the dark chocolate taste but when in the middle once you get past the chocolate part deed tastes like coffee there's a cough of course you know coffee bean in there and these are delicious as far as eating them they're delicious now these things definitely this is my second can may have other constitutes as my second can I will say that after when you eat a few of them these ones especially most ethical edibles I try I eat once in a while but I don't do it a lot because they just really just knocked me out like within a few hours I'm just tired so it's kind of boring and during the day especially if you want to stay medicated but you don't want to just sleep all day these are pretty good because if they medicate and then also because of the caffeine and the beans they kind of make you whether it's psychologically or whatever for actual caffeine wise they kind of keep you up so it says it's the ingredients are dark chocolate chocolate liquor cocoa butter pure vanilla and then see the coffee beans cannabis extract which the cannabis extract you see is one to think about the third the third item so that means that's the most these things the chocolate part of them has an incredibly strong cannabis taste and some of them which is good in my opinion some of the cannabis sticks I can't take like it gags me so this is not a gag type one it's pretty good this is something that if you want to just care you know we just you want to be discreet blah blah blah this is a really good one to get this is something I highly suggest to taste as well for a high usage guy like me I had to eat about five of them I'm six of them too I started noticing after a certain time an effect so you're figuring this is a 120 120 mil you're figuring you're gonna get maybe a few days dosage out of this but for most bang or keloid that's tough I usually eat the whole part especially the early 180 milligram but these ones are pretty strong so hopefully you'll enjoy them and thanks for watching my review love peace and chicken grease", "5-o1BEb8eek": "now speaking of getting high yeah you know not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "hLJSNCsQkLs": "hey what's going on YouTube this is Steve Stevenson with Maryland

This plant the Sauco when it sends its roots into the ground it converts that oxide mineral into a liquid digestible substance, known,  the process is known as iontopherosis or the conversion from a solid to a liquid and here Mother Nature has converted iron which is solid into a berry for you to enjoy. And over here we find now that the flower, unlike the berries that contain iron phosphate the flower now is a different chemistry here we have potassium phosphate when the children here in Central America has fever rest assured that the mother would come here and ask me to give them some of the flower of the Sauco to remove the fever because it means that inflammation is sitting some place in the body and this is extremely effective because of its high content of iron and potassium phosphate the SAUCO  ", "qM8h87Cx_AY": "[Music] what's up guys I'm so about 7:10 and today I'm back with another video today's video is gonna be a edible mukbang and I thought the perfect way to start out an edible mukbang it's with the drinks so I actually have one for Skye and one for myself I'm gonna take the blue Rhys and I'm gonna pour her up the Tigers blood she's like upstairs chilling and she had somebody go like scroll up a blonde you know I'm gonna just start eating all my edibles but just thought I'd introduce these syrups because they don't have a label they just have the flavor on them I got them from a really nice guy the other day he runs a company I think it's called like power nap or something I actually have to get the the name of their company I just know they're not too big online and they're not too big on like anything so he was one of me to try the serum so I think this is a really cool looking syrup so far it doesn't look too liquidy but we'll see when we pour it out I just thought I'd say it like you know before everybody's like what kind of soup is that okay I don't know but looks fire so we're gonna try it out don't want so in senior you okay but take two on that sky look we just came downstairs to like make some food or whatever and like hot that she's seen that whole freaking thing but it's all good blue raspberry here we go for a random guy this guy knows how to [ __ ] package something what the [ __ ] it's childproof possible so far that looks fire at the bottom you can't really see it's so blue we can but you can't just looks thick oh I'm scared to open this back up I can feel it like carbonating a [ __ ] and when I open this back up it's gonna explode I promise you that it's just making me nervous you got to take it slow I don't really use that much I'll use like you know there's a 4 ounce bottle can you see it I'm gonna pour them up I need to stop getting so excited with this [ __ ] I'm gonna pour the whole bottle in here though I'm gonna put all of it in when I can fit it in it's gonna be some of the best stuff I've had so far because every single syrup so far you could taste like a really thick thing or like you taste like weed in your mouth this is really good it's actually really really good I like it a lot how much is left in here literally 1 ounce exactly is left whoa is he getting I didn't wake up you're supposed to mix that up man that wasn't a bad taste I just didn't like that looks like one of those like lava lamps when he makes it around cause it's so syrupy it's like real I think I don't know if they made this way additionally I don't think he made this with dissolute man cuz like that I've had this bottle for a while and usually when you make series of dis wit it like looks like a ring around like the whole bottle like wherever its it's if it's like filled up to here it'll leave a bottle like a ring around the bottle of dishw it like right where it sits like this this didn't do that and it's not mixing like dis will it would normally dissolute would sit at the top of the bottle this is actually really cool I don't know what he made it with I need to find that guy now I need to go find sky and give her hers we should look far I just go upstairs and I'll say I should have put this [ __ ] over some ice he's amazing I mixed up skies by the way where's yours and she already started drinking her rosary these were up the stairs yeah quench your thirst I like that one [ __ ] you I got a bag of goodies here I'm gonna start off with yes actually no this is so heavy on my stomach I actually just ate some pizza so I don't know why I decided to do this after I just ate I don't know but all right so you know what let's start off with something light I got these myths they're Kiva petra minced for petra means compliments of Kiva confections this says they're two point five milligrams each and there's four in here so two points like two two four six a there's like ten milligrams what a minute to use [ __ ] it smells like toothpaste eat them all video because I'm not really a fan of mint but it's interesting that was interesting here's my decrepit bag of goodies and I hold us all the magic in here so I have some three heads company sharks these are gummy sharks 50 milligrams each so there's 500 total in the bag that means it's par like what like 10/10 in there or something I float there's more than ten it looks like a lot more than 10 so prime more than 500 milligrams are there this is also for three heads it says sugar-free butterflies 50 milligrams each so 500 total in the bag sugar-free butterflies that actually really intrigued me what do these taste like sugar free gummies do get a say they smell like ganja's oh man I taste like weed dude knocking on front these look dirty but that's the weed on it I'm gonna eat them all don't try one whips by eight two three four five six there was turning the bags they do it kind of dirty those are that oil oh wow no way I want to like it mm-hmm it's so we dude it's such a weed these are chewy yep I'd really joke yeah sure you just felt like all those amounts to serve us anymore I should go you could live I got two of green ones in a pink very nice I'm sure ate them separately shoot they've different flavors I don't know I feel like at this point they all seems like you don't chew in the butterflies [Music] don't run with these don't really taste like we I can see the weed all over the bag they're good right these I feel like these like don't taste like as much weed but I thought they're gonna get me more [ __ ] up I feel like the other ones were sugar-free and that's why it looks so dirty like the weed because if I didn't have much to stick to like though like the weed and stuff but this has so much sugar just like the we can stick to it all over it everywhere there's like the sneaky ones [ __ ] you up it seems so good like real candy smack you these are really really like the texture is more slimy hip the truth is even more well this is so fun there's 500 milligrams in this bag there's 500 milligrams and the other bag that's Kathryn milligrams but I gave Scott - so it's like 900 milligrams I've adjusted damn near 900 milligrams almost in to edibles are gonna get so sick from eating yours candy this is why I just smoke weed guys you don't get sick through smoking blogs Louis tobacco makes you feel sick then you probably get some type of nausea I got one mo up there's really we all over my bed last baby shark and now I have well okay now I have excuse me the nerds from boss-lady products these are medicated nurse um I'm not too sure how many milligrams I want to say like 500 milligrams 300 to 500 milligram I know it's like somewhere in the hundreds it's not like in a thousand anything but these are these it's child to man oh okay oh good thing I'm gonna dull I see them these are the I think the cherry ones the wild cherry or just regular cherry it's from infinite extracts it's like a gummy it says 150 milligrams THC a space domain hmm gelatin sugar corn syrup citric acid citric acid [ __ ] me up guys just so you know I'm not really supposed to eat a lot of citric acid by doing anyway malic acid coconut oil THC doctor who's like five ingredients I'm not allergic to anything in case you guys are read the ingredients some edibles don't have ingredients though this one does so I thought it was important to read it it doesn't have a flavor but I could smell it great album even those I feels like I'm biting into human skin I'm biting through a an arm like a stomach a shovel there mmm but tastes like a tongue mmm green apple tongue these are the truth after I'm done like with most of these nerds I can move on to the baked goods I just don't want to like be eating a [ __ ] brownie and then switch over to the lyrics that's kind of gross I think the stuff that makes this edible is the white stuff on it mmm this is this buff I try with a myth you like minty and sweet that's the one I already ate [Music] Wonderman milligrams are having my mouth spa that's all half a minute - nurse posh lady makes all types of different like flavors of Denver's she does like like over 10 flavors I think like a lot of different flavors an infinite extracts they have like I only seen two different flavors of these gummies but they're really really good I actually think who's gonna be as good as it was if they're the three heads company they have amazing edibles I think no matter what gummy you get it's always gonna be bomb but they have tons they have watermelon ones and they have like a million different baked goods doing like they make them so oh no all these edibles are pretty official actually I had our own edible bacon and that was from blazing edibles but I took a bite of it and like I don't even know what happened to it and then I also had but yeah I also had um some what it was a corn bread and like I don't know it was like a like a banana bread type thing and that was from be healthy and that was another edible that was fire because I got to build mighty little bread loaves and then it came with like this this like churned like whipped edible butter it was so good but I actually kept it in my bag by accident and it went bad so I didn't get to like eat those on camera I had a lot more edibles than this just edibles you know they're perishable and a lot of mine perished you can't hurt my teeth they have like cavities I got filled those hurt I asked on popcorn this is from Cali dope corn Cali pop Kelly dope corn I'm not too sure exactly but I know like their Instagram is pretty lit these have all these different popcorns in shape I've been dying to try this you could tell if I've had it for a while sitting in the Sun because it got all like buttery all over the packaging ship but this is what's Mac dude edible popcorn this whole entire bag is like 800 milligrams or something like it see it's like a lot of milligrams for some [ __ ] popcorn I just sit in the movie theater just eating this [ __ ] [ __ ] up there's a graham cracker in here yeah these mints are fire I don't even think I want to throw the mitts right now like I want to save some of those for like a good day when I'm where I'm going to talk to some official people and I've got a meat in my mouth like any breast was good what kind of mitten is that it's a Kiva Pecha two point five milligrams so last time I had these popcorns it's like their flavor didn't [ __ ] and I have like these yellow ones and those were like banana so I'm guessing that there's like a strawberry blueberry digging happening here these aren't yellow these are like a tan so I wouldn't be surprised if they're not just regular popcorns and there's like some type of weird flavor but it always smacks yep with some type of weird flavor the blue one is I don't know I don't know what any of these are I don't know what the flavors are with a [ __ ] bomb let's play how fast can I eat the whole bag [Music] I looked Oh Oh where's my edible spray wash them

baby and i'ma see y'all next video you know the vibes baby", "l13SfeCm65c": "okay everybody so I have a bag here that I found I met with the owners last night and they actually played a little trick on me and it worked so I'm actually gonna do a live demonstration with somebody a complete stranger they don't know they've never seen this product before but they brought up a problem and I had a solution for them which is this and I'm gonna show their hands in this video and they're gonna try to try to figure this thing out okay so this is the e pack I think that's a company name but it's basically it's a childproof bag okay so here it goes alright opening I think I would name sensory remember this is a complete stranger this is not this is not a setup okay okay I'm gonna give you some more time anything you want except scissors okay I wouldn't do that all right can you try it okay hold this camera like this like that all right so it's a child it's a child safety lock there you can try that right there bring it down okay all right can we turn this thing around no okay so here it goes okay it's child lock you got a pull back that's how it opens okay so you pulled the back with the lever with the front gear now I think that was like kind of a kind of a genius idea you know I was on the show like these like yeah this is childproof like how did you make a bad child loop and I'm like I literally couldn't open it and it just went pow and I was like oh my god is this so amazing so there you go but this year we'll actually see oh that the odor in and then it's child proof at the same time up to maybe like age 13 depending on the IQ level I think Oh anyway I don't know this will solve your problem right there you can have that just take it home and play with it now you actually got a bet you got something you were just gnarling I think we're ready to pull your own hair yeah so yeah I think it's it's a pretty neat product it's kind of smart yeah so it's back and in the front pull it from I'll give you guys I have more detailed demonstration actually here to be sure maybe you might not be able to see it so she actually tried to bite on this thing and you can tell so anyways um normally bags are open up right in the front here but you can't open it so obviously an average kid may not figure it out but you know depending on their IQ level so you have to pull the back here okay with the front and then it opens up that way and you reach back into the front here okay so there you guys have it this is a EEP AK flexible packaging made in USA thanks guys hope you guys enjoyed this video", "F1_v78p9e_A": "hi everybody I'm will welcome back to my kitchen today we're gonna be making some weed milkshakes buckle up and we're gonna go on quite a ride etc so in order to start we've got to make some canna milk which is a pretty simple process you don't really need to deke are peer were you to click other recipes because it's gonna be simmering with the milk for like 3 hours the weed will activate over time by itself ok let's get started first we've gotta fill our pot up about halfway with water like so and then we have to put this bowl on top of the pot and this will create a sort of double boiler because we want to be really careful with our milk while it's being prepared so we're gonna need 4 cups of whole milk remember it has to be hold because the weed won't gone to a low-fat milk well it all really careful and just pour it in then we're gonna use about 2 cups of cream which is equivalent to this container and that's just gonna increase the fat level so the weed will bond even better [Music] awesome so we've got a quarter ounce of weed right here remember it doesn't really need to be carved you can just kind of pour it in there now we're going to leave our bowl here and we're gonna bring our pot over to the oven so we're just gonna leave our stove on high and wait for it to boil okay so now we're gonna play named the strain basically I'm gonna list a bunch of different strains and you're gonna have to figure out which one is real and which are fake and then at the end of that pisode we'll reveal our answers The Simpsons Bob saggin mile-high club the Philadelphia Experiment old mother now you've gotta stay tuned to find out what the real ones were that's how we trap you all right so now our water is finally boiling and we're gonna bring it down to a lower level to simmer and we're gonna go get our weed milk just place it on top to create our makeshift double boiler it'll be simmering for about three hours but you want to make sure to keep checking back on it and stirring it it's pretty viscous and just lots of weed chunks everywhere making a nice whirlpool so if you're waiting around for your chamomile to finish you might try a banana and get of potassium fix before your poison [Music] yellows my favorite color since it takes forever to make the can of milk we've got some already prepared and cooled down in our fridge so the milk still has a bunch of little wheat bits in it so we have to strain it through a cheesecloth [Music] we're done with our cheesecloth so we're just gonna put it in the sink so now we're gonna put some of our kena milk into the blender for a milkshake it's really strong though so you only really need like half a cup I don't believe I've ever actually had can of milk in the past but I could very well make some for myself in the future now we're just gonna get our ice cream from the freezer [Music] we're going to put about 3 cups of ice cream into our blender my favorite flavor is vanilla but I'll survive with this I guess it's a little stuck that's okay now we're gonna blend our can of milk and ice cream together it's you a milkshake consistency [Music] cool now it's time for a weed fact weed is actually in the same plant family as hops which is a key ingredient in beer hops actually has a mild sedative effect just like weed and so people used to put it in their pillows that night to help them sleep we're gonna just deck out our glass for aesthetic purposes we've got marshmallows chocolate chips Oreo strawberries pretzels Twizzlers leaves Kit Kats straws the blue is pretty divine I think we're gonna put our chocolate chips in the microwave for about like a minute and a half and until they're just like melted very finely [Music] okay okay so now our chocolate chips are almost melted now we're gonna stir our melted chocolate chips into a saucy consistency we're gonna give her a glass nice rim job and just there we go it's a little sloppy but I'm sure it'll taste pretty delicious anyway now we're just gonna chop up an Oreo to add to that we're just gonna sprinkle this into the chocolate bowl to just add another layer of deliciousness rim again this time with Oreos next we're gonna slice the strawberry up to put on the rim you just want to cut it like two-thirds through so it's split but not in half strawberries are definitely my favorite just because I'm an organic [ __ ] I guess so you just want to gently place them around the rim of the glass we're just gonna let that chill there I guess so now it's finally time to add our milkshake Wow now we're gonna get some whipped cream from the fridge get it in there I really like as much whipped cream as possible you could totally stop at this point but I like going the extra mile so we're gonna add some Twizzlers it's overflowing a bit but I like it now some KitKat bars and for health reasons just a little bit of mint and finally a pretzel on the head now we've got a crazy straw we're gonna stick a marshmallow through and tada it looks amazing but I might not live very long it's a lot of work to get to this point but I think it was worth it [Music] now it's time to reveal which traits are real and which are fake The Simpsons is real Bob Saget is real mile-high club is fake the Philadelphia Experiment is fake old mother is real Congrats I knew you guys could figure it out Wow it's a chocolate explosion I'm overwhelmed with flavor [Music] if you want my opinion I'd say this is totally worth the early grave well we're all done thank you for joining me in this amazing chocolate weed milkshake adventure until next time I'm will bye-bye", "A-1U5CS7260": "hello i'm jerry ford going to be reviewing some granola this is from field day company um so this is a organic

weeds out in it when i was pulling one out it kind of whipped whipped me across the side of my my nose feels like a like a sunburn just kind of going right down right in there so if you see something

whatever the series is called anymore today we're gonna be vaping on some Moxie distillate on this is a root beer float fair warning I had to go back today so please bear with me my head's all drink as I had to deal with traffic but um had to go back to the place get it replaced because it was leaking from the bottom so please note cards can leak just call ahead to the dispensary to make sure you can stop what they're on things are I just went in with my receipt and everything else gave it to the person once I could pass security and all that other stuff to go to the actual on display room slash serving area got a new one no hassle walked in walked out took about a few minutes because they had that printout all the legal [ __ ] and receipts you know so that being said haven't tasted yet on just from giving it a little extra priming it really does taste like a nice root beer float and from what people have said people who said it's actual like root beer flavor and some and a single person said from what I've heard it tastes like a flat root beer I don't know but anyway let's give it a try taste is subtle smelling aroma though smells like root beer doesn't taste like root beer smells like it oh I can smell like the head on a good night so he's cold root beer right now that's trippy I'm not even gonna lie it smells like after hitting that it smells like root beer oh my head the taste is not there but you feel like getting warmer when you hit it give it one more good on hit off of on the taster side it just smells like root beer doesn't taste like anything at all I didn't dissapoint it but it really does like root beer am I getting high off it yeah so let's see like I said those were taster puffs not really like Oh die you know I mean but definitely doesn't taste like root beer smells like root beer a whole hell of a lot though so if you have people who complain about your your stuff smelling like weed the epoxies got you covered with your root beer yeah I use it just random people asking places smell like root beer down me hitting my bong like frosty I don't know what I'm saying anymore Oh freakin hate that you go to a tail you think you like sealed everything then you're like that's a little Spock the worst part is I don't feel high but I have the symptoms of an indica high already so I don't know give it about 20 more seconds [Music] but yeah I really hate when you're like inhaling and then you have and when you exhale you got that little bit left over in your lungs so you're trying to like like try and get out of your system I'm making sure it's wicking because when you do when you're doing your hitting a cart like this when it's heated up the liquid will sort of start to drizzle towards the mouthpiece and you don't want that so when you see bubbling like this and your cart trying to see if I can even capture it on camera but yeah like right in front of there you know but like right there you see that like it's hard to tell but you see bubbles coming from those little wicking holes give it a few seconds because the bubbles mean it's actually starting to wick again so like if you're not like hitting it directly like this you know and you're but you're doing it like this just give it a few seconds after every puff you know you every hit you take like that and don't feel bad just not hitting it but like toking on it like this you know dry hitting doing that every few seconds you know if you don't want it if you want to take a hit but you ice but you don't want to take a hit you know like you know you're high but your body says keep talking you know like you know sometimes people do that much for me it's like that it's like cravings you know whatever but it's like like those like these are priming hits and then when they keep going a little more because once I see the bubbles stop forming around the fill holes that's usually when I start hitting it again there we go plus I plus his card he's feeling a little you know so I wanted to give it time to see if it was going to do anything or not but anyway then yeah those carts okay I mean it's not the strongest door right away hitting us but four is my average puff counter when these were more like one in a hat well three heads I would say the user Thor he hits intolerable so better an average I will say this though I think my body likes tea a tea hcv a lot and this has no THC V in it that's why I was looking at peach rings - so that's next card I'm gonna try and get I had a couple that I wanted to get again and then they had these new ones from Terrapin which were like monkey bite and like mountain monkey something or other and it just said indica Terp salad and I'm like 440 Matt versus root beer float or patrons or something cuz honestly it was like I was thinking get that good bat Tommy it's cheaper you know plus any other cart you're gonna get is like this you know but then when I was looking at you know it's like there's no THC v and it's just THC for that cart you know when the terpenes you know and it being an indica it was under 80 percent THC and that was like really so that's why I went with the Moxie just because of the higher THC honestly it was this versus the beach rings like I said but ultimately I've heard a lot of good things about the root beer I haven't heard anything about the peach rings and I was looking at him I was like the peach rings are better but I was like you know what peer pressure gotta try to root beer so I'm honestly not disappointed in it but I've known better from this company so I'll leave it on that but so far so good I'll let you know on the next review which I have no idea when it will be anyway peace", "U2GfoCBKJL0": "what's up y'all listen boys jumped with another fire ass episode of wake-and-bake Inc this morning we got ball of Barry's sure you guys heard a ball of babies have you not anyway ball of Barry's is not what I would call a beginner strain it packs a heck of a punch it leaves you swimming around in your own thoughts well I know there are many out there with a much higher tolerance than myself I feel like ball of Barry's will still pack a wallop even for those THC hardened professionals out there that's me i'ma TT all right professional let's give it a shot I'm gonna got a couple of popcorn bugs but ain't go there you go you good look at it so when I open up the package let me see what I smell immediately it smells like it smells like a platinum that's what it smelled like right you've had a platinum cush that's what it smells like like platinum anyway that's going to get in here because this is a tasty smell I said the thing you guys already knew i'ma say if you haven't subscribe to the channel go ahead and subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fires videos it kind of feels like one a marathon but we're gonna keep it going as long as we can we got a clean Bowl we got ice in the bone let's break down some buds yes sir drop the piece of blood it doesn't really smell like berries well stop sniffing let's get up in here we worried about the smell we worried about the flavor in the higher me oh no lighter gotta take a pause for the cause and we are back with a fresh brand new lighter let's get it who's gonna get my air right how'd you guys sleep last night you already know what I'm saying huh I slept like a [ __ ] King last night and woke up just his blessed let go actually did not work already Norma start sweating now cuz it is SuperDuper hot in my house see my mom's is staying with me so you know we came to mom's because she's older she's 79 so I guess your skin gets thin when you get older so you get cold quicker yesterday was 83 degrees in the house I turned the air conditioner on she's like yeah maybe I'm cold I'm freezing I lost 83 degrees in house but in my room like the whole house will feel one temperature but for some reason in my room if it's 83 degrees out here then it's 93 or 103 in my room [ __ ] ridiculous I'm like Gavin when you walk out of my room it's like as soon as you pass the UM the door jamb or whatever you call that [ __ ] soon as you pass through it man it's like you feel cool immediately step back hot step out clueless like [ __ ] me or something what the hell is going on let's get back in here I told uh before talking between hits to give the buzz of time to catch up we hey man you new subscribers you guys are on point man y'all we get into a thousand really quick we're gonna make it that sounded so white right there man but that's okay you mean we're gonna make it [ __ ] out yeah let's go on to get this buzz going because right now I'm completely sober it's no bueno that was the one ball of berries huh what you got going on so I feel a slight burn in the back of my throat I still taste that platinum taste this doesn't taste like a berry taste like it really tastes like platinum cush to me or platinum og it's really nice taste but definitely platinum I might even find out what this is mixed with wasn't very much online about baller berries you guys gotta understand we don't get these exotics excuse me a lot more news so a lot of won't even have any information online about it I usually look through Leafly or I'll go to the website that it says on the package itself and it usually doesn't have a lot on infants a new strength I think someone told me a long time ago it takes two to four years or three or five years to create a strand because you know if you just just cross germinate some [ __ ] and put it in the ground put it together man and that's the strand that you created it's not just you created this one strand and here you go to the world nothing you gotta have some years of creating that same strand before it becomes a known strain so ball of brains just has a little bit of information on that's why there's people like us doing this stuff so we can give you all information of how it tastes how it smoke how it smell how high is you know all that [ __ ] now I'm not I don't get into the real particulars of [ __ ] if I don't know about it so I really don't know about ball bearings I can just give you my critique on it you know so so far I've tasted a platinum platinum cush on exhale so let's get back in I really don't feel a budget slight buzz right behind my slight buzz you know bird come quick - so this bug well I really didn't put a lot in here but it did seem like you burned up pretty quick you guys know about me blowing all this [ __ ] out or my garage floor oh pretty soon I don't have an ounce or two out here on the floor because I'm like burning burning them to Bowl all the way up you don't tell you don't like it burn until his ashes until it sucks through lie I don't want that flavor [ __ ] I want the green flavor I want that that sweet case oh yes now the hives really starting to kick in you know it's a nice top of the head high I feel it like like right here not on my forehead but like just right here starting to sweat a little bit lick it back in tasty delicious okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the flavor critique of ball of berries with this platinum flavor sale so I would have to give this a I have to give it a five no it's a good flavor its average it's it's a it's average plain you guys know platinum tastes like that's really this would this tastes like to me like a platinum cush or platinum og but um it's it's average it's a normal flavor I'm I'm used to it it's regular so I have to give it a five you can see a c-plus maybe let's go ahead get back in here and see what we can get out of this yes I called the papers on that we go oh [ __ ] son the whole heart I am who Jesus oh my bad y'all I'm just the buzzy dog Willie boys kicking you white flag awesome some people feel like Riverdance and some people feel like way even a moonwalk you know I'm saying yes but like no one is saying my bad y'all I just took a little side trip there and I brought y'all with me Louie so the highest really started kicking really nice now I feel like I underestimated not the flavor but I feel like in my mind I scream underestimate my stress too made it I underestimated what the hot was gonna be you know me start smoking you pretty much feel after about five or six minutes you know what the highs gonna be like but this one is kind of like creepy it's really creepy I started from the bottom now we're here sheesh yo I'm getting hot I surmise a few more Hitler will be baked if you guys notice it you stop hearing about the virus a lot anymore you know what it first came out it was talking about it every second of the day man I got tired of hearing about I was having dreams about coronavirus what the [ __ ] so that's what exactly what they wanted to happen they wanted to create a mass hysteria and now it's on the minds of everyone so they don't have to say anything else we'll let you guys run with it now we'll put look big baits a we're gonna take some fear throw some fear in there and stir it up with some simulation and here you go alright they're good now when I talk about in a moment let them go in every once in a while I will say somebody died from chronic virus like a weed like a week that went by so all year somebody died some get up somebody does so what they're doing now in my mind um in my mind re-engineering the virus or maybe they're not even reengineering it perhaps there was never a virus because I told you guys before about event 201 it's a video about how they was gonna make a simulation and see how the public responded to a pandemic so they told us that they were going to do this simulation and then I swear it man and like a week or two later oh we got the corona virus here's the corona virus this feels like a [ __ ] simulation because I didn't know anybody but corona virus and I pretty much believe that you guys don't know anybody with corona virus just because the doctor has said oh you got Corona box you know what the funny thing is this person had clearly died from something else and they say that he had corona virus [ __ ] me up man I was like don't you see that big-ass bullet hole in that [ __ ] head man didn't [ __ ] did not die from the [ __ ] coronavirus that's a bullet hole that's when I knew I was like wait a minute wait a minute some slick [ __ ] going on here y'all know the muffin government they some sleep [ __ ] anything even about black or white you know anything about all the white people that's messing up the world we already know that but it ain't about that what it's about is the government give them a politician [ __ ] the muffins they got all the money dead ones that is messing up the world and ain't black or white she's green it's all about cash man you know everybody kind of knew this was gonna happen but nobody wants to go back and think about what they said before Trump got elected before Trump got elected when he was running everybody was like do we need a businessman to run the country how's a businessman gonna run a country y'all see he didn't squash out all the little muffled little businesspeople if you're a big businessman you know we got to squash the little people cuz they in a way that's that what he did we shut the whole [ __ ] country down so all little mom-and-pop shops all these little stores that don't have a chain or a franchise bottom the biggest shut now man are we gonna fix that cause we gonna get y'all alone we don't get the small business people some

you guys the up high fatigue of this because um we're just like badly now okay on a scale of one to ten one being the worst ten being the best of the hog critique Oh baller berries we're gonna give this it's better than a five we're gonna give it a seven a mid seven it's a mid set yeah we're gonna bust it out with a mid seven I think that's a good strong number would I recommend this to my friends if I had a lot of friends in a lot of this weed I would probably smoke it with them I don't think I would be so anxious and tell them hey this is baller berries you guys want to try it check out this bowl of berries nah no it's good to smoke if you just want to sit around get high no not even if I had a lot of homies I'd take that back I take that back that was the wrong way to put it if I had this and I was just chillin by myself and this is all I had yeah I was smoking but if I had like nine or ten different weeds tell you I probably mix all ten of those mofos together I pack a bowl but if I had not attend different weeds this would probably be like seventh on the list I get it number seven [ __ ] out of here all right go ahead and finish this and get you all the hell up out of

and guess what stay back", "jSFfodDgf5M": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to another foodie Friday that isn't actually being filmed on a Friday and probably won't be uploaded on a Friday either but Shh I haven't retitled the series so today mostly because every time I passed it in the store I laughed at the name and thought it sounded stupid until I mentioned it to one of my online friends they were like oh I've had those before they're actually really good no I was like seriously like yeah and they are the Del Monte bubble fruit and these are the peach strawberry lemonade ones there's three flavors so I know if I bought all three but this is the one I was most excited about cuz I love peach I love strawberry I love lemonade everything about this sounds like a winning magical combination like even the pictures like it looks so freaking refreshing right yeah it's peaches and poppin boba with sweet and juice I've never had boba I've heard but loads about it like all over the place with boba tea like my sister is obsessed with it I don't know if there's difference between the boba that's in that and whatever poppin boba is is it like pop rocks I don't know but uh delicious bursting bubbles that's new there's four cups that come in each one of these packs I didn't show much you can chill them but they don't have to be there four ounces each take that as you will bubble fruit feeling bubbly we've added popping boba to our tasty fruit cup snacks for an unexpected burst of flavor popular in bubble tea and frozen yogurt shops popping bubble burst and relief or I'm sorry I read that wrong popping boa burst and release a blast of fruit flavor when you bite them our juicy peaches are grown in the best orchards producing fruit but it's sweet and succulent it's a way to add a little sweetness to your day so this is about five bucks for the four packets little steep for four fruit cups but then again I don't usually go out of my way to buy fruit cups so maybe that standard I don't know I'll have to look next time I go to the store and see did they all cost that but um if they do maybe it's not that bad but just sticker shock of not usually buying those seems like a lot for four freaking cups the other flavors are sour apple watermelon and pear berry pomegranate I tried the pear berry pomegranate didn't like it much and sour apple watermelon I haven't tried yet I did try one of these already because I could not wait the second I got a whole my I kind of had to that's why there's already two gone this the one that I have out to review right now and there's the one that I kind of creeped did I don't have any patience so our ingredients are peaches water boba which is water fructose modified food starch calcium lactate citric acid sodium alginate Van thin gum calcium chloride carbo or carboxymethyl cellulose and then sugar white grape juice concentrate lemon juice concentrate natural flavor a sorbic acid to protect the color and carmine colors made in the USA in Walnut Creek California I know where that is that is not far from here that's kind of cool that's like not even a half hour drive that's pretty cool so Nutrition Facts serving sizes one cup no Sherlock there's four in this thing calories per serving sixty that's pretty good that's pretty good there's no fat no trans fats no saturated fats no cholesterol only five milligrams of sodium that's like a 0% 14 grams of carbs that's 5% your daily value one gram of fiber which is four percent was like nothing twelve grams of total sugars including six grams of added sugars which is 12 percent of your daily value so it's a little steep on that but it's fruit we kind of knew that was gonna be a thing and no protein no vitamin D there is 21 milligrams of calcium no iron and 61 milligrams of potassium that's a little surprising but it's not very much it's only 2% for that and calcium so and they're not like crazy healthy but I mean it's better than giving your kid candy for in their lunch so now may I point out they make a public call frigging magical and  on the box let me take it out and it just looks like this it's like oh that doesn't look as fun as it did on the box expectation versus reality right that I mean I definitely see peaches in there and I see balls that I can only assume must be whatever well bi is so you can see balls yeah yeah there's much balls balls that are gonna go in my mouth yeah make the joke I know you want to hold on peaches but the danger thing we see how full the juice is it is like impossible to open these without spilling it fair warning I'm glad that I pre did one off-camera so I knew going into this to not like trying to hold it and do it because it will go everywhere even solidly on a table which I'm gonna do this one it will still go everywhere so I have a napkin down cuz I'm gonna need it I'm positive but you can see like is a hella fool all the way to the brim my suggestion to Del Monte would be either make the cup a tiny hair taller to give just a little bit wait'll room there so it doesn't immediately spill the second you open it or just slightly less juice one or the other like not by much just by like a hair just saying because that is kind of a pain in the butt so kind of try go real slow see if it makes a difference I don't think it's going to cuz if you go slow you're pressing on the middle but you also pushes it out if you hold the edges then it's going up there's no winning there is no winning no matter how you do it JEP saying I'm going real slow real easy try to be careful cuz I'd rather not spill it all over the place but pretty sure it's gonna happen pretty sure it's inevitable but hey am i pointing it out am i actually proving it wrong making a liar of me oh my god but it is like right to the rim guys it is I'm gonna submit okay I feel a little more secure about that now so right off the top the juice does taste lemonade e I'm gonna sit a little more pretty good so let's get some stuff I don't want to tilt it cuz it's got a spill I do but we can see boba we can see peaches kinda sort of that is not a very good angle okay I've got some peaches out see how are these peaches are those our peaches what can you say that they're canned peaches dude there's not a whole lot to say there but who have a bubble let's see what this does nope oh there it went okay Wow okay I like to the back of my throat was like oh okay okay wow that was surprising I didn't expect to actually like pop pop like that I have three balls here okay so those weren't quite as violent in there popping that was more pleasant they just like do you think against the roof of my mouth like a very gentle bubble wrap or something yeah almost zero pressure from your tongue against the roof of your mouth all those new so alright fair enough we have the peaches I mean they don't have the funky canned peach taste where it's almost like beat so I'm glad that it's not like that by me at the same time it's not the same it's like a freshly cut and diced peach either so you can tell that yeah it's like fruit cup peach there's a difference even though yeah peach is a peach I do create some delineation between a fresh peach and what's in a can and what's in a so the PT stays like peaches and the juice tastes like lemonade where's the strawberry is it what's in the boba maybe maybe that's it sounds like I can tell there's somewhere hidden in there some strawberry not very much though like a very minimal amount sorry like half gone by the way there's not much in these so they're not very satisfying if you're an adult if we're a little tiny kid maybe that's an adult of like I could probably eat this 4-pack in one sitting I shouldn't but I could I won't but I could easily pretty good though I like it these are pretty tasty at least the peach one is I would say if you like lemonade and you like peaches mostly you would like this the strawberry is very very minimal so if you're going into it for strawberry you might be disappointed but um the other two are good I can't speak for the other two flavors really yeah but I do those reviews I will let you know somebody's messaging me like non-stop hold on okay sorry about that this is practically God low I mean there's a little few pieces so let's just finish this up and then review but it's just you so that goes up there's not much there but does taste good it's just weird but they make a point of putting strawberry is the segment on there the only place you really particularly taste the strawberry is in the aftertaste I find cuz it's mostly just peach and lemonade which are good I like peach lemonade specifically - I mean it's pretty good but I don't know I think if these were if they had an option to get one that were a little bigger for an adult audience that'd be great or the sell one with more in it than just four that would also be great I don't know if these are kind of like a novelty snack or what I'm not sure but I mean they taste good I like these combos of flavors I haven't really seen these particular combos and other fruit cups before to be fair so I give them credit for that but no it's five bucks a pop for four of them it seems kind of steep but for what they are in terms like flavor and texture and all that good stuff I would probably rate these like a four out of five I think these are very tasty it just they're not as satisfying as I'd like them to be if they were a little bigger but then again I'm an adult and I think they made these with kids in mind and they're just a little pricey for what they are probably for the convenience of it being all pre-made like that so anyways that is it oh and I noticed while I had this pause that they are non-gmo and non BPA just so in case you were wondering now you know I didn't think these were bpx they're not metal but the non-gmo is good to know so anyways that's it for this one so as usual if you guys like this video go ahead and

to work for Walt Disney so not surprised Reagan's lair play as the heroic Dirk the daring the valiant knight on a rescue to the fairway from the clutches of evil great Prince's name is Daphne and we learned how to pronounce that name last night [Music] all right [Music] yeah we need a substance Eddington Oh close like a drawing time oh yo fresh we'll watch the intro this this is the art original arcade intro when the cabinet was idle Dragon's Lair look bad as the adventure will you become a valiant light on a quest to rescue the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon you control the actions of a daring adventurer finding his way through the castle of a dark wizard I love the staticky noise on the screen to make VHS 83 baby so the thing about drink is lair is you guys have to understand when you walk into an arcade and you're surrounded by games like Tetris Galaga [ __ ] pac-man space invaders okay a guerra like that and then all of a sudden you see this machine that literally has a [ __ ] cartoon plane and you control the character it was mind-blowing it was like how could they possibly do this in that time in 1983 this machine was like this game was like so ahead of its time you just didn't comprehend in right it was kind of like the equivalent of when when what's it called Donkey Kong [Music] but Donkey Kong Country first came though for the Super Nintendo yeah I see what you're saying calls and you know they had all this pre-rendered [ __ ] so it was really clever what they did with this of course it's all cutscenes that's how I worked around it but back in the arcade days like this machine was [ __ ] expensive for me I think around the time where everything was like 25 to 50 cents this machine was like a dollar so when I was a kid I did not have the ball to play this game and it looked [ __ ] hard I saw all the adults play it I didn't know what the hell they were doing because I'm just watching it and like mesmerized and not understanding like what the controls because there's nothing on the screen that tells you what to do and they're just controlling the cutscenes so I thought it was like mind boggling and I didn't understand how like different capture scenes worked like that back then so it was it was [ __ ] madness bro so yeah like this these games laserdisc games or art are really really sick ok see if I can fix the video sighs my cat will just fullscreen it it's not a big deal you the research I think Enzo put it too put it - what's a coal hey we'll just fullscreen this [ __ ] we'll just fullscreen like re3 Louise the re3 over there No you it should have a good change all right let's play ok so I was looking at some of the settings and I don't really know which settings we should use definitely should max out the last [ __ ] here's the way to get infinite logic to do that move beeps we'll keep on moved I definitely have on then the original arcade version it showed you nothing on the [ __ ] screen the controls are literally up-down left-right and attack and it's just I guess I'd cancer our cake at with the phone off so the arcade version play the original scene order from the arcade cabinet easy [Music] the homers is the original laser this version of the game third must pass through each scene before I think we should do the home version just so we see all the cutscenes and difficulty easy we'll have more time to react for certain scenes some difficult moves have been removed [Music] we should pipe it on hard and see how that goes oh we should play on the hardest setting first alright alright let's do this you if it's too hard then [ __ ] it we'll play on easy [Music] in the arcade version I haven't even have that scene for something oh I think I [ __ ] I see how spoons press right twice dude in the arcade version it wouldn't tell you anything you just have to know you lose your [ __ ] dollar right there like this game is hard as balls if we match this can I go show you guys there is an arcade version man I'll show you all [ __ ] stupidest to at least a shoal something there but still I think you guys going to see the screen a lot by the way man you're gonna be fast dude who's like Oh [Music] [Music] but his screams are so funny dude no [Music] [Music] I [ __ ] press right oh no Rapids okay how am I supposed to kill the press up here how the [ __ ] would you figure that out oh god okay this is obvious dude you be screaming too if you're in this [ __ ] situation [Applause] okay good let's let's continue thank god this is just scary bro what this whole castle is a Disney [Music] revitalize Daphne that's sound effect [Music] once again I'll have to remind you guys that the original arcade version had no prompts on the [ __ ] screen you literally just had to figure it out and you would go broke trying to beat this [ __ ] English is he stabbed in the back bro you this game is designed to eat your money exactly it was oh [ __ ] holy [ __ ] down [Music] [Music] [Music] and there you can choose different hats too in this game which is really sick but we're playing so we see all the customs Oh God holy [ __ ] oh my god okay that seemed looked impossible like without the prompts you would be dead there's no way do don't get my ass kicked that I do have prompts like I said after this I want to show you guys the original arcade version I want to show you guys how impossible [Music] Oh God oh my god I like ice cream damn it I think that chad has counted how many how many ladies have spent on the game how many times have I [ __ ] up guys 14 dude that's not even enough for a for a [ __ ] apex gun skin I can't even buy anything apex legends with that apex gun skin is $20 oh [ __ ] like sometimes the game has mercy on you and shows you at him man up for days [ __ ] [Music] this sounds e makes or so I thought we just did this [ __ ] oh it's another way to try to trick me dude reusing accents what'd you say oh [ __ ] what'd you say no [Music] Jesus bounce if you actually saw come on [ __ ] I didn't let three times bro if you're in the medieval times and you went down the elevator that's looking faster you [ __ ] your pants oh [ __ ] I remember this [ __ ] I remember people swearing at the arcade arcade cab during this [ __ ] cutscene this is notorious this is cancer [Music] - it was cancer this dude is on my ass slice them holy Kate how are you supposed to figure this out in the arcade I just wanted him five times you're telling me someone figured that out on their own what I didn't see a prompt hold the [ __ ] weapon rack what the [ __ ] fifty dollars deep at this point bro I'd be [ __ ] broke-ass by here and dude I'm talking about one with the swing six times that's GG there's no way to get past that scene oh my god [Music] no not the [ __ ] marbles again slice it Oh God reuse assets Oh hopefully doesn't trick me drink me okay so it requires you to memorize certain scenes and if you have it in the reverse you gotta remember the opposite directions that's crazy Google is over [Music] what whoops dude the time it is so fast [Music] okay oh no not this [ __ ] again [Music] [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] this is fine this is the status tree Firefly right now this is fine [Music] [Music] [Music] what what this was supposed to do there [Music] okay that shake hand fall oh [ __ ] what there's a different time guys it was a different time a better time [ __ ] don't weigh all the way back here [ __ ] impossible [Music] [ __ ] it's hard to see the damn arrows because the [ __ ] goal is the same color [Music] [Music] save me the cage is locked was the key the dragon keeps it around his neck to slay the dragon use the magic sword run run nice no come on I pressed it so [ __ ] fast okay it's three swings in a row it's three swings in a row god damn it you guys are understand this is explosively difficult difficult yeah this is this final boss [ __ ] you just the Regal bro yeah this game separates men boys clothes almost [ __ ] up there the damn sword okay three swings [Music] nice [ __ ] the tacky we win no consent they'll consent [Music] so how many tries that take us while technically chinking not changing what am I saying cheating I was gonna say thinking and she at the same time [Music] 29 that's with the arrows that's with the air if I had no arrows would be impossible especially that one scene where you got to swim like five [ __ ] times but it gives you the mood yeah that's what I'm saying that's worth cheating basically 29 death so how much in our case do it be like in the arcades when I played it was like a dollar each and that was back then when games were like 25 cents to 50 cents that's why when I was a kid dude I was I was like way too poor and way too afraid to play this game it looked so insanely hard and it is hard it's basically memorization yeah here I'm gonna show you guys the actual actual arcade machine and I'll show you guys the ridiculousness of it a second I'm good oops Kevin gonna set up for us here the actual actual arcade version - version brain-dead for laserdisc games I got pretty much all of them [Music] you dragons lair of fantasy adventure - a as the actual cancer at least to tell you some stuff on the screen there's nothing on the screen there is nothing on the screen you literally just have to know definitely boys to men this is boys them into the extreme sometimes the screen will give you hints just to show mercy on you and believe it or not there is no pink in you there is no continue you will start from the beginning of the [ __ ] game if you lose all your lives [Music] boys the men I was boys the men honey lives per dollar it's between three and five four it depends on what the arcade owner is sets it to right but it's usually like three lives it's too oh it's too long for me to remember as a kid but like like I said like this kind of game was kind of like it was so pristine back then because like I say you stepped the arcade you see all these [ __ ] games like space invaders and Tetris and pac-man is [ __ ] and then you see this game here like wow like this game is amazing you know it is just so expensive and so difficult right but it was a very amazing game yeah so if you--if you had the game of completely memorized I mean I guess you can show off to people and show them the whole thing but yeah okay uh we're gonna jump ahead now to 1984 we're gonna play time go and then we're gonna bounce back to space ace so let me a sort of time go here you [Music] so I showed you guys a little preview of time go on the Sega Saturn but like I said most laserdisc games the ports of laserdisc games are most of them are pretty bad the only good ones are ones that came I reported to PlayStation 1 or higher or PC but for the most thing you gotta use that emulation you should just do straight image because anything that's poured over two Sega CD or Sega Saturn right is most of it is garbage there are really bad ports how did you play laserdisc games there's a there's a laser the specific laser discs emulate emulator called Daphne you got to use that okay you before we get picture okay good we're good so this is the actual arcade version we're playing right now but it does have on-screen prompts so this is the actual arcade version come on make sure the volume is good for this [Music] start by blasting your ears [Music] so this will be tough because once again I don't think we have continues in this but at least we have on-screen prompts guys it was a different time it was a different time a different time [Music] it was 1984 those 1984 guys [Music] Oh [ __ ] it was an action but he knows an action button [Applause] [Music] take that go up shoot the enemy go down [Music] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] good tired I love this D oh [ __ ] it changes directions it tricked me no that's the chat that's laughing right now the action one throws me off go down [ __ ] it [Music] we had a 33% chance of getting that right the chat told me to go down so I blame that on you guys didn't see anything come on nice I'll share in the future 2001 2001 baby [Applause]

bike let's go kill her like what [Applause] [Music] turn right make a u-turn [ __ ] turn right [Applause] looking lesser man wait u-turn why would a u-turn be a good idea why would I want to u-turn then it makes no sense so they can crash I'm gonna die you're gonna get me [ __ ] killed that makes no sense [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right we'll see you guys know what you're talking

difficulty settings I mean we already know what we're gonna pick [Music] there we go there's worship oh I love the music already oh [ __ ] [Music] energize their Rashid Oh ah [Music] I like how you still I was like when he's the kid he's like still like super hardcore you know [Music] holy [ __ ] look at the sequence aha boy is here [Music] [Music] I thought money was ease [Music] No [Music] dude I have a fraction of a second in confession get ready and ready what you want to hold it down or something I think at the hold it down or there might be another button that I don't know about what the [ __ ] I'm gonna mash it [Music] what okay it must be a different key or something left am i pressing left's you got you guys see a left arrow I just see energized that's all I see cuz the left is lining up oh maybe you're right no don't know I don't see you left I just see the gun that's it maybe it's a different key we don't know about athos spacebar though because it's left on the animation oh right it didn't tell us though that's odd maybe the game [ __ ] up there and it gave us the wrong command yeah we'll just remember that for next time good I though it seems like every time it says energized we can't use the gun if maybe it's like only if we have it we can skip a cutscene yeah because I didn't use it I just press it up instead there it's hard for me to read the chat score very hard OC house really use my gun there [Music] Oh Wow and it has a different button maybe if control I'm going to guess this controller okay so if it just shows the gun its spacebar and if it says energized I think it's control I press spacebar backs and there we go we get lots of the funds control doesn't work I don't know the controls are we can't get further if we don't figure out what the damn control is for this unless we don't fire and it's one of those things again where we have to wear the right lights up okay thanks I was just about to say unless be at the Dodge [Music] you [Music] Wow wait wait holy [ __ ] I can't imagine what the arcade version of this game is like [Music] [Music] [Music] No [Music] just check the PC version guys if you can help you find the controls for the energizer it's not control I try control could be alter something or shared [Music] [Music] nice Jesus this is such a long cutscene look at this this is [ __ ] crazy what's going on Oh No don't timing the game is frozen that's the end like this you you die Gigi you you see vertices kind of bugged we always have the original arcade version would you like to exit no continue you and inserts coin it's not a [ __ ] arcade port I see the pause symbol that just brings up the options I think it's [ __ ] guys you guys find out what the other control was No Oh No there's that tons of controls [Music] / let me try relaunching again real quick just in case if it doesn't work then we could try the arcade version but it would be impossible it would be virtually impossible without knowing the directions because you [ __ ] impossible [Music] Oh Oh you could continue maybe this will work where is the same this is yeah this is seen before see if it goes further yeah this week this scene is so [ __ ] long I couldn't imagine spending a dollar on this [ __ ] [Music] please work it's thought it's actually [ __ ] dude no this port sucks what should we do what should we do there's a million parts of this game though I'm sure I can find another port or another stream a mill there's a million ports of this game ok we'll try one more time on a new on a fresh thing and we'll see what happens if it doesn't work then we can try the arcade roll Avenger what you're glad come out though you guys are breaking the rules without rules here you guys now that we've played one laser at this game you guys want to play them all can't do that in the 90s see a 90 then you guys got asked me to play mad dog and then Johnny Rock you can play all that in one stream no can't we can't just indulge in a single stream like that guys there's rules that's trying to game I put the move beeps on this time we change the difficulty maybe you think that won't make a difference [Music] I was just gonna say both of those oh okay whatever will I'll put it the captaincy it makes a difference so you said slash for energized [Music] now I didn't do anything we do not know what the energized button is [Music] master ik nice [Music] how the hell my people say that key [Music] aha boys here [Music] you [Music] then um have my keyboard doesn't have a numpad so that makes a lot of sense oh nice we're a

some runs", "-fLSI9dm5us": "the bars look yummy but be careful when it comes to edibles there really can be too much of a good thing did you just come here from Kansas and you haven't smoked pot in a decade then you need to have half a square you know if you come in here and eat one of our bars and go hit the ski slopes you're not getting off the chairlift the production of infused edibles and other non smokeable products has taken off making up nearly 40% of all recreational pot sales it's easy to see the appeal no smoke no stench no cough no bongs business is booming it sure is legal but is it the right thing to do what I'm trying to figure out in my own mind is this innocent or insidious do I think this is better than a beer yeah the beer has zero healing properties that sounds like rationalization to me I personally don't have an issue whether you're doing it recreationally or whether you're doing it for medicinal reasons just like anything else in this world as long as you handle it responsibly the emphasis falls back on you personal freedom you", "_pg1lPaeQaA": "in your words tell me about the very basic difference of ingesting marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "-5GZuZnVVGw": "ariana here this is my friend indira hi no we're not related today we're going to be reviewing smokey's gummies i've only ever tried like the non-medicated samples that they have in the dispensaries so i'm wait actually oh my god i can't believe i can't remember the fact that the

know when you're done i love when i was eyebrow yeah wait no too far above it i tried i'm finding it that's your eyebrow what are you serious yes that's so crazy do you not feel the hair are my eyebrows too thin what is that yes have you not been using the right i'm gonna draw hair strokes on your eyebrows okay so for this one you really need to know where my eyebrow is okay round one was practice okay round two is like we're gonna get it we're gonna get trying really hard this time i believe in you and there's always like some there's always some at the top that like i have to in the arch around here okay you didn't do the other thing with the other other eyebrow i just forgot to give it no wait what are you saying what did i forget i'm just saying um didn't put that on that eyebrow i don't think i'm gonna get it on right now no it's a different one i'm not crazy you're crazy i had a water bottle somewhere and i'm gonna need your help locating it so your left hand reach it forward and just right down that was like the claw game we did so good yeah this cloud paint by glossier we're gonna put this on your cheeks okay i have some yeah okay oh my god i just feel like you're gonna look so beautiful we're gonna do the cut crease i need you to give me the brush that is green that is fluffy on the tip yeah yeah this one yes okay the cut crease and the girl's eye was like a brownish taupish color and if i remember correctly on the top right somewhere over here there's like a brown color that we're gonna put in her crease yes is this your eye yeah this is your eye okay that is your thumb this feels right the tricky thing is is trying to get the same color on that eye i think we're going to find out that's like yeah that's your crease am i stabbing your eye yes i'm so sorry and that's my eyebrow okay i'm so excited for this look can you point me towards the concealer oh is it the little one this one it has a silver top yes this is okay so we're going to put this on your lid to cut the crease that was the fireplace how are you feeling indira like how's the high i'm very very high so i guess these edibles work you guys for me yeah for sure they definitely

[ __ ] get started I have the pine mango Suns a sativa I'm gonna pour it in the cup and I'm gonna try to give an accurate representation of how many milligrams we're consuming but this bottle is about half a Stu hundred milligrams so we're gonna say it's 100 let's add this flask I think so this is gonna be 150 here it's definitely more than half okay all right 150 milligrams so when I finish this that'll be 150 but I'm gonna be drinking that small time oh it's not bad all right let's get started here I don't want to eat anything all at once because I want to try to eat as much of it as I can

milligrams of THC I ate a lot of different edibles candy bars that means lollipops I'm not high yet from the edibles so take a little while to kick in the drinks I might be feeling the drink a little bit they don't think I love you in my experience I might be feeling that but a little bit here I mean I don't know how high I'm gonna get from two thousand milligrams I took 1100 milligrams of

again we are talking about punch bar punch bar key lime pie this time I've reviewed I believe three punch bar products in the past I've liked them all they're an impressive little package this cost me $12 the dispensary know we're thinking $12 for something so small but as the name suggests it does hit hard and it tastes pretty good too or the ones I have had in the past have I've not had the key lime pie before but I am looking forward to it and hoping it is just as good as the punch bars we have reviewed here on wheats in the past so we opened up we can see a little chart there telling you different 25 milligram breakdowns but of course we're going to ignore that and eat the whole thing and if you've never tuned in to weights before and you don't know how this works what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open this up eat this bad boy or at least a portion of it here in front of the camera for ya and then I'm gonna come back in two hours to let you know how we're feeling because that's the most important part of any edible review okay so the key lime pie is white chocolate which is not my favorite kind of chocolate but you know could still be good has a slightly donor and a lime motor for short you can smell both weed and lime break it apart there ignore all those 25 milligram little break ups you can see it's fancy little printing there this little fist printed right into the chocolate pretty cool just give it a taste that's interesting um not my favorite thing I've tasted from punch bar but it definitely tastes like white chocolate with a hint of lime in it um it's good nobody like my chocolate I do like one so it's uh it's okay oh and there is I take it back there is some actual like a cookie crunch in there as well for the philip for the crust of the pie it's a little bit but you guys pretty much you're gonna know exactly how this tastes imagine white chocolate with a slight lime taste and a slight cookie crunch and also a slight weed taste that's the fudge bar uh uh just trying it here is not the most important part and the most important part is what happens in two hours from now which is when I'm gonna come back to you guys to let you know how we're feeling and hopefully it'll be just like the other punch bars in the past and it'll hit pretty hard and we'll be singing their praises so guys I will see you in two hours to let you know if this punch bar continues on with the positive legacy thanks for watching well we hit the two-hour mark guys and I am pleased to tell you that the punch bar key lime pie does not disappoint it's just a star strong as its brethren love it love punch bar the only problem is they're a little expensive at my dispensary this warrants 12 bucks which probably is a value for a lot of you but for my dispensary runs a little high but it is uh again such a little a nice package it's so small you know for a small thing you would expect you to have a heavy weed taste there is a weak taste it's not overpowering but it's easy to transport easy to get down and it really does hit hard it does so man this might be the last punch bar I do of the 225 milligram variety they have a whole bunch of flavors I don't think I need to do them all for you guys but I even more happy to have done the ones that I have done so far uh yeah so guys punch bar gets the highest seal of approval from us here at wheats thank you so much for watching and we will check you out on the next review bye hello and thank you so much for watching wheats if you guys enjoyed this video please like or subscribe to my channel and if

fellows because I am reviewing yet another gummy I always say don't be a dummy don't buy a gummy but today for you guys it smells good though you can smoke through the packaging I have purchased yet another gummy because people told me the flourish flourish F flourish gummies are really great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited

not mistaken yes 100 pill bottle and you guys already know okay see now I said this before it's seven dollars for a hundred and twenty mill there's it's a zero milligram nicotine that's what you can get it for so the view babe zero nicotine and you guys want a hundred mil bottle I think of any of the e juice that I reviewed it's seven bucks but when you change it to any type of milligram nicotine it goes up to three milligram is actually sold out okay it's a good thing I did that so 3 milligram is sold out let's see if 6 wow it is actually sold out so now I got to go ahead and check ultimate vape deals and see if they have it there because if I'm reviewing a juice it must be really that good so let's go ahead and check it out I will okay 1699 on 1699 on ultimate vape deals.com from 120

got if if you guys can't go ahead and tell it's sealed from top to Midway here so I'm gonna go ahead and pop off the seals but if I get that lemony kind of pledge if I get like that lemony kind of pledge thing then it's probably gonna turn me off but being that it's sold out I would imagine it's good so this is supposed to be a cannoli with Fruity Pebbles cereal on top so they're good to go they got all the colors there they got your warnings your prob 65 nicotine badge good to go notch out like at all let's go ahead and give this one we'd already gave it a good shake let's give it a good smell see now I smell that Froot Loops aspect now if this is like straight-up Froot Loops and if I taste the fruit loops or that lemony kind of pledge I'll tell you I do get a creaminess though creaminess there let's see I am getting a very creamy note on this one so that could be the cannoli but I am tasting the fruity pebbles now fruity pebbles and Froot Loops are pretty much decipherable is that right yeah yeah I think I taste fruity pebbles yes and it's I'm getting that creamy no demand all right so we got the beater box the visa go from sigelei to k3 with the OBS cheetah poison - this one's own went out 2.2 - let's go ahead and saturate him you know it's getting saturated I'm not gonna go too crazy but today it's just gonna be a nice and calm day we're gonna go ahead and do everything nice like Bob Ross is gonna paint the coils very nice and maybe a little happy blob of juice lives right next to this white cottony Trini and then we'll take a little bit of short Roose blue go ahead and paint it all right you know what today's a happy day so let's paint a little shrub right next to that happy when cotton tilled tree what's the tree without a river so let's give him a river of Fruity Pebbles holy cow yeah that was my impression of Bob Ross you guys are eighties kids I grew up in the 80s so Bob Ross was the man and still is man sometimes I still watch them on Google I still watch them he's just very calming and soothing so a few guys that were born in the 90s I mean the millennium in all that goods all the Millennials you guys don't know what I'm talking about but all you guys from Boeing from the 80s Bob Rose [ __ ] on the burn I get like that fruity pebbles and I'm getting a little bit of that fruity cereal aspect so let's go ahead and we already saturated dem whoo-hoo let's go ahead and we are at 80 watts so let's go ahead and bring it down just a tad let's do 70 sweating like it's free while it is free 70.5 whoo what let's do this whoo wicks you see on this one on that first blur that first blur talk talking English today that first burn I am getting that lemony fruity cereal so let's see how this one pans out yeah I'm getting now it tastes like fruit loops it doesn't taste like fruity pebbles and it's more along the lines of the lemony stuff it doesn't taste like lemon pledge but it does taste lemony do I let's see if I can decipher if I have the if I have the the cannoli in there as well yeah this one's not bad this one doesn't turn my stomach like all the rest of the fruit loops rapes but let's go ahead and try it again we're at 80 point one who wets after a while it dies down I don't necessarily get a cannoli on this one but I am definitely getting that fruity pebbles Froot Loops kind of cereal like I said it's not bad I'm not gonna repeat myself nor am I gonna stay too long on this review but I taste mostly that's fruity that fruity cereal aspect that's but that's the majority of what I'm getting yeah and it comes through um it's it's a creamy thing I already explained it to you I'm not a proponent too much for the fruity pebbles Froot Loops kind of apes there are people out there that that do like it so it's not overpowering which is good I mean if I know whether you juiced to vape I would probably bake this one it's not bad but I'm not into this flavor at all I'm just judging it for y'all you know what I mean like I said I'm sorry I'm repeating myself I don't get too much cannoli I do get like a like a sweetness on the end but mostly of a fruity I think like a fruity cereal I gotta finish my sentence um once you put that fruity cereal fruity pebbles kind of thing I think it takes over the juices in the majority of juices so that's what I'm just saying everything else from the line except that strawberry cream was good so this one not bad I wouldn't chuck it across the room but it is what it is it's a fruity pebbles fruity Froot Loops kind of cereal vape to me I don't taste cereal I'm blabbing last vape let you guys know yeah even get more of the lemony - don't like I said no lemon pledge which is good but kind of fruity but that's it all right so that's holy cannoli that is fruity pebbles by holy by holy cannoli all right you guys can go ahead and check it out at ultimate babe deals.com of a juice deal so go ahead and go check them out they have the same awesome deals over there ultimate wave deals I trust them they ship to me all the time never had any issues and I'm sure people that have ordered from them you know they could agree with me on that the cheap

[Music] [Applause]", "FZD3SldXppQ": "[Music] hello friends welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of that crazy weird confusing and sometimes a little anxiety inducing place called your dispensary and if yours is anything like mine sometimes it is a little overwhelming even for a guy who tries to keep up with all of the different weed products and companies and different consumption methods uh it seems like new things are being cooked up every day in that regard which is exciting to see but can be overwhelming as a consumer today though we're not going to talk about something overwhelming nothing new nothing novel one of the oldest forms of weed edibles that there are is something singular plural um and that that is the good old-fashioned weed gummy yes we are going to be reviewing some weed gummies and one from a favorite brand in our past one uh who is more known for their chocolate bars but now is branching out to the gummy world and that is punch punch edibles a lot of people really like the punch reviews in the past we reviewed these guys years ago they've been around since the um good old uh gray market um more uh only medical days making 200 and i believe 25 milligram chocolate bars uh and they've been around um they continued to exist throughout our new 100 milligram cap era where they curiously uh continued making chocolate bars but they only ever come in 90 varieties there's uh they don't go to the 100 they do 90. why i'm not sure um and it looks like their gummies follow suit as this is a their excuse me tangerine lemon a pink grapefruit citrus flavor all those are citrus fruits assumedly um and it is only 90 milligrams of thc probably shows up a little bit more clearly on those lab testing results in the back or 90.5 milligrams of thc not sure why they don't do the full 100 um but if it's anything like their chocolate bars they you know hit above their weight glass i apologize for the terrible pun i'm sure i've even made it before god damn me um but you know it's uh who knows it's got me talking about it right so this is a 90 milligram edible uh and like their chocolate bars uh they are a more affordable edible uh on the cheaper end i picked this up from my uh beloved dispensary in long beach for 12 buckaroonies and may or may not focus there but yeah not uh not bad for a 90 milligram edible usually trending a couple dollars down from the average so again but you get 10 less thc supposedly uh so without further yammering about this citrus punch fruit snack let's go ahead and open it up see what we got now we got a little dosing guide here uh it shows you what we need we've got 10 or excuse me nine 10 milligram squares because you can divide a square up that way for you geometry fans harder to divide a square into ten very easy to divide it into nine um that's for you arithmetic fans so uh it's got a fancy little plastic contraption very uh uh unnecessary in terms of packaging but you know i've seen more ostentatious but that's a hell of a lot of plastic for no real reason and then we got the extra plastic wrapping this that all says 90 milligrams 90 milligrams everywhere on it oh okay so it is three different flavors of gummies not one giant citrus catch-all smorgasbord kind of handsome looking very starbursty looking and very starburst colored i wonder if pink will be the best here as well let's go ahead and try one of each so i'm going to go and uh like all of our weeds reviews say this every time i review the whole uh product i'm going to review all 90 milligrams that are here i'm not going to necessarily do all 90 right now in front of you but i'll do them over the next hour or so and then two hours after i have that very last one i'll come back to you guys and let you know exactly what we think of these very affordable punch edibles citrus flavored so this pink one is i'm gonna guess the tangerine no this orange one that i've got i'm gonna get my colors right that's tangerine hmm that is a gelatinous cube um quite a bit of weed taste um not as pristine uh a um gummy taste uh or a flavored gummy taste as like a plus or a steezy gummy it's not terrible but there is a definite weed aftertaste to these lemon yum and then for the star of the show the pink grapefruit i'm just going to pretend it's a pink starburst because my mind will make it taste better pink starburst [Music] tastes exactly like it wow okay yeah very strong very strong wheat taste um not overwhelming and you know uh they are more affordable and hopefully that means that they are just potent as af [ __ ] uh and for that we're just gonna have to wait and see i got six more of these guys to go as i said i'll do them over the next hour so how fun was that and once i'm done two hours after that see right back here until then stay high stay healthy i don't know why i tell you to do that you're just gonna see me in a couple seconds anyways i'll see you then [Music] hello guys i'm back it has been uh three ish hours maybe three and a half hours uh since my first piece of the cannabis infused punch fruit snacks um and i am very very happy to tell you nice and simply uh really like this stuff doesn't taste great but it does the trick um even with its 90 milligrams it still feels pretty strong to me um not a lot to have to get through just nine tiny little squares you're good to go or one if that's what your tolerance limit is um yeah and then of course the most impressive part of the entire package is gonna be that price uh usually you can get these substantially or you know somewhat cheaper than other edibles at the same or almost same dosage um and so if these are cheaper for you if these are a couple bucks cheaper than the next level up grab these these will do you um uh they're fruit snacks well i'm always gonna be a chocolate guy uh and i'm gonna always prefer punch bars chocolate bars the fruit snacks um holding their own for punch that's for sure um they're uh two for two on products as far as i'm concerned so that's a big old thumbs up from me uh and that means anytime we do those big old thumbs up we're gonna do a little cherry on top a little something extra that you know not necessarily weed related you can enjoy with or without weed it's up to you it's just a little cherry on top just a little something extra uh and this week uh i'm gonna make sure you guys keep those hbo max subscriptions um from lapsing you don't wanna cancel now you know you've only been a subscriber for however many months it's been around too i i feel like all these subscription services are sort of bundling together in my brain they're all launching at the same time it's all pretty wild anyways hbo max you got that one probably and if you do check out the righteous gemstones there's only one season it's another show from um i was gonna say wonderkind danny mcbride but that seems like um whatever the opposite of hellion kid whatever the opposite of wonder is is kind of danny mcbride um righteous gemstones is the uh story of a christian televangelist patriarch um played by jeff goodman and his three bumbling sons one of them played by danny mcbride who's also a show co-creator um and uh it tells the story of what a bunch of bumbling hypocritical [ __ ] the leaders of a massive um uh christian organization are and it's very funny and um judy one of the children of um jeff goodman the children of the patriarchy one of the main characters of the show the daughter uh one of the funniest performances i've seen in my entire life had me laughing constantly uh this cherry on top is for the righteous gemstones but there's an extra cherry on top of that cherry for i can't remember the actress's real name

up aces see you guys on the next review stay high stay healthy more important to stay healthy goodbye", "5QSuBn15taw": "hey what's up YouTube Enzo Tropper here with but super calm and in this video I'm gonna show you how to open the Korova Saturday morning cookie so one other thing that this offers is childproof packaging when I first got this I didn't really realize that it was childproof packaging and I was kind of ripping and tearing at it and getting frustrated because I couldn't quite open it you know and every time I would I would kind of just I would have to fight it but after a little bit of research I figured out that on the package here it has the instructions for the childproof packaging so there is a technique to opening these things and I'm gonna show you how to do that in the video so here's the packaging and it has a little tear tab on here you can see I've already open this up so you just basically just tear it peel this off once you get this open you look inside and you'll see okay it looks kind of like a normal ziplock bag and you kind of want to you know just open it thinking that that'll pull it but that's not really the case and then if you're trying to peel this apart you'll notice that it is like you know seriously stuck to the packaging itself and then once you get down to this portion right here you notice that there's this part right here that's open and that's actually the part that you need to stick your thumb in so what you do oh and by the way the oil from the cookie sometimes makes it makes this bag a little bit slippery so just be aware of that and that's kind of what I was thinking is it's a it's it's a little bit frustrating I know I'm all for Children's packaging you know child packaging and stuff like that but this is a little it's a little bit difficult especially if it's a little bit oily from the cookie but what you do is you put your thumb down in here and what yours what you're trying to do is you're trying to separate right there you can see how it separates this little ziploc thing here and then once you get that open you're supposed to do something like that and like I said it's a little bit difficult you can see I've already taken in my sighting one cookie here but you know to reclose it you just kind of you know like a normal ziploc bag pinch it down and then just go across and and this thing is like heavy-duty ziplock so no kids are gonna get in there I can guarantee that and I think some you know serious like adults are not going to get in there either because this thing is a little bit difficult but let me try it one more time so you just pop your thumb in there and then separate it out all right let's try that one more time so go ahead open this up this way once you get inside be sure to find the portion where you're supposed to stick your thumb which is separated from the packaging and then you can go ahead and stick your thumb down in there and you can figure out your own technique that I like to do this and then pinch it here once you get your thumb in there just pinch it like that and then you pinch hold and pull and I wouldn't really try to force it because it feels like when you try to force it it almost feels like it it doesn't want to open so that's where the frustration can come in from this packaging I think because it's really there's not a lot to work with at least I don't know cuz my hands a little bigger maybe if you had smaller hands it might be better but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad so one of the things well I can already tell this is been out for a little while but you definitely want to put this in the refrigerator you can see the cookie itself it this has been out of the refrigerator for about I don't know maybe 30 minutes 40 minutes and you can already see how this is starting to like you can see how like kind of I don't even want to say it's a moist it almost it's almost like succulent it's weird but this is about the size of a dose that I would do probably if you're just starting out I might do something around that size but since I've tried this a few times I'm adding this much more but I would try about that much inside and unfortunately I started this video before I should have shown you the whole cookie but I'll show you what's left I'm gonna go ahead and eat this now let me show you how big this cookie really is so it's a decent size I've already eaten almost half of it as you can see excuse me while I finish it kind of has a coconut birthday cake flavor to it and as you can see it's fairly thick and I kind of want to break this off just to show you I mean you can see that this cookie is really really moist I don't want to break it all the way but this to me is almost it's it's it needs to go back in the fridge so definitely store your thing in the fridge like I said since this is a video about childproof packaging you know I just would like to say if you have little ones try to stash it in the best place possible but I'm pretty certain that even if your little one was to find something like this because it's got you know cool graphics on it you know there's a cookie on it or at least something that looks like a cookie it's you know it's enticing so I do think that if your little one did find this I think that would have a very hard time getting into this thing they would have to get very lucky you know their little small fingers might be able to find their way into that but you know the other thing is if your bag is a little bit oily maybe that's a better thing because then you know little fingers will slip off of this thing but anyways hopefully you found the information in this video useful if you did please comment like and subscribe I'm Enzo truffle with bud symbol

in my last video i showed you guys how to make can of butter in the magic potter 2.0 machine if you don't know how to make magical butter click up here and i'll show you how in today's video we are going to bake something with it i asked you guys in the comment section what you guys wanted me to bake with it and the number one comment was chocolate chip muffins and i'm totally down for a chocolate chip muffin i love muffins and i'm a basic guy i don't like a lot of crazy like random things like cranberry muffins or anything like that like blueberry muffins chocolate chip muffins that's that's about it so today we're going to turn this can of butter into some chocolate chip muffins i want to give a huge shout out to magical for sponsoring this video and for sending over a magical butter machine to give away i will be giving away a magical butter machine on my instagram page check me out on buds and beards on instagram for your chance to win a magical butter machine thank you so much magical for sending this over and without further ado let's get into making some weedy chocolate chip muffins oh yeah you guys can use cookbook and beards to save 20 off at passionbutter.com okay now let's get into making some weedy muffins there are a few ingredients that you will need to make these cannabis-infused chocolate chip muffins you'll need one and a half sticks of melted can of butter two cups of all-purpose flour two large eggs a half a cup of milk 3 4 cups of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and lastly 1 cup of chocolate chips let's get to making some muffins the first thing you want to do is preheat your oven to 375 degrees [Music] the first thing we want to do is add all our dry ingredients to the mixer so i'm gonna add the flour the sugar two teaspoons of baking powder half a teaspoon of salt and then we are going to mix that up [Music] once you're done combining your dry ingredients then it's time to add your wet ingredients the first thing i'm going to add is the melted can of butter [Music] the vanilla and the two large eggs and mix those ingredients well [Music] once you've mixed that well you can add your cup of chocolate chips [Music] and our muffin batter is done before we fill our muffin pan with our batter we need to prepare the pan and what better way to prepare it than using more peanut butter i'm going to use a tablespoon of melted can of butter and i'm going to brush that all over each of the muffin tins now that our muffin pan is prepared it is time to add the batter to each of the tins all right we're going to place these in the oven for 20 minutes what just had a thought i think once the muffins are about halfway done baking i'm going to add on top a little bit of sugar and brown sugar just to give it a little bit of extra sweetness we're trying to hide that wheaty taste as much as possible so little sugar topping to it these are our cannabis infused chocolate chip muffins yes i went a little bit ham on the sugar topping but i'm gonna let these cool for about probably 10 minutes and then we'll try one all right you guys i'm back i've been waiting over these muffins waiting on them and i think they're ready i think they're ready i think they're ready okay so i'm so excited i have a nice glass of milk let's get one of these muffins out and try one first things first the can of butter worked really well at acting as a non-stick like type spray because it came out all in one piece like this is the most perfect little [Music] it smells a little weedy i'm not gonna lie when we were baking it it didn't smell at all but like now that it's actually in my hand i can definitely smell the candy butter which is [Music] um it's not the best it doesn't taste the best it's not the best tasting on a scale of one to ten i'd give it probably like a a six it's edible oh my god it looks green [Music] look at that it literally looks like lime green inside of the muffin from the can of butter and the taste is just like it's just so off it has like such a strong wheaty taste but you guys know i'm gonna still eat it so that i can give you guys a report on how did it make me feel i both said from the big bite that i had at first it just kind of felt like a walk on my stomach which is more like how edibles feel when i'm like this is gonna like slam me adding that sugar on top that was a good choice [Music] because there is such an aftertaste to this muffin you were gonna want that sugar it i think it's what it's like saving it like i keep lifting my fingers because like i have the sugar on it and it makes it like slightly better i need some milk gonna go finish my muffin and i'll be back i don't know if i'll have a second muffin or not probably not because like i'm not feeling the taste unless this muffin just like knocks me on my socks and then i might have another one like right now but they're gonna be something i'm gonna have to space out and make myself eat i'm not gonna lie to you guys all right i'll be back in probably like 30 minutes to an hour probably an hour it normally takes about an hour cheers [Music] oh my gosh when i smile ew what gosh no you can't have my muffin no no what the hell all right let's talk it's been like probably 45 minutes and i'm gonna tell you guys what i've never had an edible hit so like hard so fast before ever like ever in my life like these muffins have to be at least probably like [Music] 150 milligrams probably each like these are strong ass muffins um they taste absolutely horrible like no lie this was probably the worst tasting edible that i've had in a while like it was pretty bad like i did not enjoy the taste of it at all the feeling though is amazing like 10 out of 10 recommend for the feeling the only thing that i've ever made that i would recommend more than this would be the sugar cookies that i made at christmas time i think it was last year or the year before those those actually taste pretty good and they were like really effective these taste like crap but they they are really really effective so i'm not mad i'm not bad at all because like at the end of the day this is what we're searching for is like this feeling right here if i'm able to do that with like trim and like a little bit of shake that's amazing because that's just stuff that would have gotten thrown away anyway so thank you guys so much for watching this video if you like it give it a thumbs up leave a comment down below let me know what else you guys want me to make because i still have some peanut butter in this refrigerator over here like we still have three and a half sticks of can of butter over here to make stuff with and we're gonna make stuff with it so let me know what you want let me know what you guys want to see me make out of this canned butter i'm like having problems with my sentences now i'm gonna go check out my instagram page if you guys want to win a magical butter machine you can use cup buds and beards for 20 off at magicalbutter.com and i'll see you guys around for whatever sewing activity or video that i come up with for next time and i hope that like whatever we make is as effective as those muffins and i seriously think that it had something to do with this butter i think that that d-carve box really ensured that i was de-carving that cannabis properly because i feel like my oven was off not that i've made a bunch of edibles in this oven but i bet my other oven was off too and i wasn't de-carving it properly i think that that made all the difference in this butter which made all the difference in those muffins [Music] i'm like out of breath and i slightly have the giggles from the the um the muffin but anyways thank you guys so much for watching and i'll see you guys around for whatever show activity or video i come up with for next time bye guys [Music] you", "HXWrJhtaqfM": "today I'm going to be attempting the crown

next time", "QHvP5l9-VyQ": "hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today's review we are taking a look at a new to us capsule brand from the folks at get zen we are looking at their cannabis infused capsules today this is the high thc line where each capsule has 25 milligrams of thc uh for 750 milligrams in the total bottle uh like all of our wheats reviews we're not going to be doing all 750 milligrams at once we're going to be taking four capsules for a hundred milligrams uh and that is what we will base our review off of so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach california uh for i believe uh with taxes included uh around about ninety dollars uh so pretty expensive for these 750 milligram capsules uh certainly on the upper end for what i've seen in the area uh so we've got some decent expectations for them uh and on their website they've got such wonderful boilerplate uh text as this let's let's give you a read here gitzen is on a mission to improve the quality of life for patients by manufacturing the highest quality of cannabis capsule and other cannabis products our goal is to bring honesty integrity and accountability to the cannabis market and change the way cannabis is perceived by the medical community in the general public how noble i'm sure they are uh fulfilling that mission uh with the absolute utmost zeal every day of their existence so uh let's get into the product review here uh here's our little bottle uh it's got some lab testing results on the bottom that doesn't really give us more than just the number there uh which actually comes out according to these lab testing results to about 821 milligrams 10 more than advertised there's one of these like little funky stickers that you can pull away to get more information than you occasionally see on these pill bottles oh and uh back here we just have uh the ingredients which uh is more elaborate than i would have thought and now i am seeing that this is actually um rso in here or at least as advertised this is uh not just any um thc distillate it is rso rick simpson oil doesn't really change things that much it's just a different extraction method uh let's get that sticker off and get to the promised effects of these pills which are high euphoria we shall see i'm realizing now i have no liquid in here with me so good old-fashioned dry swallow it is and here are capsules ah okay these are quite a bit different than what i have seen these are just little gelatin capsules but instead of like liquid filled there's a very dry amount of i guess rso there at the bottom uh just kind of splattered in there i'm not sure how well it's showing up on camera uh but it just looks like somebody just took a little dropper of some really sticky goo and put it in this capsule um not very appealing looking but you know uh you gotta do it one way so here we are here is again our 25 milligram capsule uh let's give it a try down the hatch it goes one and two no taste believe it or not other than the elegant capsule two all right that's half of what we're gonna be doing for this review we're gonna do all 100 i'm gonna take about i don't know uh 30 minutes to an hour or so before i try these next two but once i do about uh 90 minutes to two hours after i have my second half of this dose i will come right back here guys to give you those most important part about all of the reviews the wrap up thoughts are these get zen high thc capsules gonna get you high for that guys you'll just have to stick around and i'll be right back in just a bit thanks for watching welcome back to weeds guys it has been about two and a half hours since i had my first get zen capsule i was about to show you the logo again but i ripped the sticker off i can't do that uh and about what did i say two and a half hours inside my first probably about 90 minutes since i had the second two the other half of my dose and these capsules work pretty well they're good uh the rso oil in there will get you quite high i'm still pleasantly high two and a half hours later um i'm not sure however that they are worth the premium over some of the other capsules uh of a similar strength at a lower price or higher milligramage um uh so if they are cheaper at your dispensary or if they're the only ones capsules they have available and you like capsules these will certainly do the trick but i don't think that they are necessarily worth a premium over anything else if um if they got some buddies or some papa and barclays or whatever in there and there's you know cheaper than these you're fine using those uh but these get zen will certainly get the job done so i'm gonna give them a thumbs up but again it's kind of a qualified thumbs up uh these are good but you don't need to spend the extra expense if these are more expensive than any other at your dispensary anytime we give a thumbs up we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that is not weed related we can give a little recommendation of very simple quick easy one this week just finished or re-watching the 2012 uh movie killing them softly uh which is i think available on netflix the stream right now stars brad pitt uh was a legendary bomb the year it came out but it is a great great film pretty quick like 90 minutes to get through too uh super cynical super dark uh about um oh uh what is the movie about uh it's it's about [ __ ] you pay me that's what it's about i guess uh so check out killing them softly on netflix and if they're not too expensive check out get zen capsules the high thc especially if you like the capsules they'll get the job done and that guy's then is gonna do it for this cherry on top it's gonna do it for the review until we see you for our next one stay high more importantly stay healthy we'll see you then goodbye", "KRVCMUH9_PQ": "okay this is rose sugar free peach
