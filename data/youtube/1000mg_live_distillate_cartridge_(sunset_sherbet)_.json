much in like a DM teacher it right there but I've seen Joe Rogan and a bunch of people talk about it and I said that whenever you're dreaming you're producing like but as a [ __ ] and my phone's producing an acid log DMT way more than you would can smoke or whatever I'm thinks what they were saying it's what you do with it is I've seen them smoke it too but I haven't smoked it before you put a bowl of somebody then you put a little DMT and then I think you put another little bit of butter over the top of it so you don't actually get the flame on it but you get the Ember from the bud to burn it or something like that and then you just [ __ ] blast off I never seen anybody [ __ ] up on and I think I watched uh I think they might have smoked it on that drugs Inc [ __ ] or something like that whatever [ __ ] I was watching but um I looked like the meat the [ __ ] just knocked out and just like pretty much went to sleep for like 10 to 15 minutes and then came back yeah where's my phone is on 12% right now the CBD actually gets you high [ __ ] man whenever I smoke CBD stuff then while the [ __ ] knock me into damn head but it's like different from like if you smoke the bowl of Bud and you smoked a like a dab card or some like CBD pen or something like that it's it's a different high but you still feel something you know I'm saying but it's I will say it's different but it's not like you're hitting it like you're hitting some [ __ ] fake [ __ ] it ain't gonna be like you're like man hey I'm just smoking [ __ ] nothing really you will actually feel get like a kind of a

love you cash meeting you guys on their cart review today I'll be reviewing sunset sherbet and it's a Muhammad's cart so this is what the box looks like since a sure bet you got one ground my resin on the back got the little code you got the Instagram and on the side is just a gigantic you know here you go you got that little sticker on the bottom having been peeled off it alright I'm going to show you guys this backhoe real quick so y'all can see you now that we scan the code we go ahead and open this up so let's start by peeling off the sticker this is usually one of the hardest parts you know I'm over here doing this at one hand but after this part it just gets easy from there all right peel this off there you go mohamad slow go right down the bottom now that we took the sticker off I slide this out there you go you guys go better look there's the cart yeah that sexy sexy alright let's take this out go ahead and take it out there you go look at that thick thick oil this oil is so thick well you could discover Atlantis go around the world three times two feet the crack and come back and still have time before the circle reaches to I mean up the air reaches to the top yeah it's not thick it is all right now listen screw this there you go came off easy I've noticed this one has a red a little red or that's no little red thing around it that's something alright guys let's try hit this let's see how it tastes before we put in the battery almost see how it tastes without it cuz you know we got to do this well gives it the flavor looking nice this season in our spring yeah tastes really piney like like outdoors my oh no yup really really piney flavor I don't know if it's just me or but yeah that's how it tastes like I'm gonna put it in the battery I see how it all how I taste alright so here's my battery imma take this and real quick boom gotta screw it on go that magnet and then let's just dry here one more time yeah very odd lorry all right here's my battery we're gonna preheat it for five seconds then one more time just to get the oil extra warm because I've been outside and cold all day today alright now let's hit it for ten seconds I couldn't do the turn turns up me because I can do the 10 seconds because of the power but let's all put the power on medium all right others do these 10 seconds it almost tastes like hazelnut like my some type of like nuts from trees when you hit it you do a hit darn long life well I say it one more time yep hazelnuts definitely hazelnuts you know all right guys that's my review on this cart thank you guys for watching like my videos comment on them subscribe to my channel I'm Audi", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on

so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man

vaporizer filled with concentrate with something called refined live resin which is a form of extract and it's something it falls in the category of high spectrum which is just it just means it's good [ __ ] good [ __ ] cleaner [ __ ] and it's regulated so you know what you're smoking and it's dope and it's brought to you by pacific stone fifty dollars a gram and uh what i like about this cartridge

for you this brand i'm sorry pacific stone that's what's up i'm almost out i didn't try them out sooner well it's a good product that we just had to talk about it you know we had to talk about it and um there's no leakage there's no there's anything it's very compact and it's still in there it's pretty straightforward product very straightforward disposable it gets the job done very economical fifty dollars a gram hey that's cheaper than some other gram cartridges that you actually connect to a battery correct and it's disposable and you can recharge it yeah they got you covered so they're really looking out for you yeah if you guys are fans of like raw garden and you know yeah i feel like this is on that same it's on that same level as like raw garden you know it's lit potency and flavor it's just it's on that level yeah you will not be disappointed with this exactly we usually we usually review concentrates and um you rarely see a sign about about pens or cartridges and disposables you know we've done them a couple times but this is just one of those videos you know where we just have to talk about it to talk about you know because exactly like it's not something you find every day yeah and it's very honestly i haven't bought disposables in a while just because i've had a bad relationship with them but uh this one's really good you know this one gives me hope that there's actually brands that are dedicated themselves to help you help the stoner out help people encourage people to enjoy smoking and not just to get stoned but to enjoy the actual experience so that's always a win yeah it's always a win in our book honestly and uh the last patent uh the last review we did was of a pen was the lower level one right oh yeah oh right yeah that was the last thing it was a live rosin pen which i really did enjoy it was really good but the thing with that is that it died with a quarter of my oil still in it my lot of my life rosin and it sucks because it wasn't rechargeable it wasn't anything you know so i still had product in there and i just couldn't can't do anything yeah it's very disappointing when you can't even smoke out of its own the way that it was intended to you know so what i had to do i i just dabbed it you know i just dabbed the materials in there and uh it still tasted good but it just sucks that there are some some companies that still don't have that like function yeah like because it's time for an upgrade yeah and i [ __ ] with it you know i like what what these companies are doing i really do think about the consumer so yeah that's what's up yep and it's always dope when the brand looks out for you yeah [ __ ] like we said before we recommend it and once again you know we're slumping sloth like comment subscribe do

same damn jars the last jars with a different label on the jar they're empty but uh it's kind of a pain yes and i really think it's bad well maybe we're gonna try this one maybe they did a better job but the last time the perforated edge never wanted to pull off so it's like literally pulled the whole paper off and worked better but as you can see they must uh i'm sorbet man you lit is that what i said that's all i mean i'm telling you that vaping flyer from an actual good vaporizer definitely uh look it has that like poopy black spot at the top like i'm dissilent carts like how it gets a little darker at the top but it is what it is i mean i don't know sunshine sherbert my dude says it's fire there's a [ __ ] everywhere this place is like attracting fire but just like you i had cherry diesel heavy oh i'm about to be coughing like crazy probably the discipline cards they really make me cough i don't know i don't know from back in the beginning when it all started hey let me give you a little little show what she looks like uh it's that much full it ain't bad i'm not complaining were they working with see so you know regular videos be fired thanks bro i really really really appreciate it uh regular c-cell battery um i like the ones with the tap with the tops on them sorry my fingers i got this glue from work on them that won't come off like a freaking week but let's throw it on the battery and uh try her out man oh [ __ ] let me grab it off the charger right here oh it was crazy all right we got the moxie battery i'm actually going to give it a little zwip twit with the uh q-tip to clean this out i've been trapping this thing at work uh pretty wild lee well just out and about i've been having this with me every day and it tends to get you know crappied up in there and the one guy that said oh i don't buy one gram a layer of cards because you never can trust the card it'll uh gum up on you this that in a third it didn't gum up on me but it like kind of did gum up on me which like kind of sucked i did get the most of the amount out of it but uh to be honest with you i don't even think i did a review on it it was the garlic cookie select cart it actually got smug before any video even got put up i don't know why i don't know what happened it was a phenomenal cartridge but at the end i threw it out it was not a lot left over but it was stuck at the top of the jar i'm hitting it with a lighter i got it in my hands for a half hour trying to warm this thing up warm this thing up to try to get it you know working again and [ __ ] i could not get that wax to go down uh to the bottom kind of uh pissed me off you know what else is fire that the video ain't up yet is uh the donnie burger yeah yeah well that was the first time i had lemon grenades pele roa bubba diagonal garlic cookies the pele roja was the best one and for on me for me that thing had me exuded man straight sativa 83.4 um actually coming in almost the lowest percentage but the bubba diagonal i'd stay away from that hold on let me show you these two carts i got up here there's a couple more over there see what you guys want to see next uh magical papaya live delta nine cartridge uh from pharmaceutical rx or we got the blueberry space cake scarlett queen i is this new am i crazy that i have this probably but enough talk let's rip this thing and see how it is uh it's on double tap for the preheat session oh god my tongue hmm damn me myself i like i said i probably i'm repeating myself but i think i gotta smoke before i start smoking carts like there's four and a few that will uh what fold is saying you have that all the way up it's on red but it's because i cleaned that eye you know if you clean your uh 510 threads out every once in a while it keeps all that gunk out and [ __ ] and it really makes them hit decent about the cigarette tobacco and hair wax you know i mean god knows what else i got a new cookies bat i'm watching your live while i'm driving to the dispensary what are you grabbing and what disability got into hit that preheat and go a blinker yo that [ __ ] wax these lights are blinding the [ __ ] out of me yeah it's kicking him for sure oh my

already did a review on it uh but yeah i don't think i had this uh blueberry space cake scarlett queen we grabbed this it was like four weeks ago a month ago i had this sitting up on the shelf uh and then this i'm actually switches around which ones you guys want to see first the magical papaya lucky charms and papaya mix yeah that by jesus fire wow there's like no terps in this one that's why i was on sale these are like 40 bucks or something uh on sale there's a few strains i mean it's still 82 70 some percent what up what up kurzod uh and then this one here look at this baby no thca [ __ ] the [ __ ] 81.812 foreign yeah exactly that's yeah it was on sale i just noticed that right now i didn't even look i was like oh forty dollars half gram screw it because it was like when they were doing their deals and uh they were doing their deals where uh if you spent like four hundred dollars you got 80 off or whatever it was whatever it was uh oh i got a little wedgie uh um that cartridge oh the taste on it um i think i lost it already the taste i i kind of like let's that's the boy yeah so i mean that's why i grabbed it you couldn't beat the price so i scooped it up you know what i mean uh i had to um i don't know where the [ __ ] i did with the cartridge i lose these things that was like a yinzer cart from pharmaceutics it was a smacker love that cart on the moxie battery uh here it is that i just that this moxie battery laid but whenever i did the [ __ ] snow um i built a igloo and did a review of the first time of the pele rojo 42 cartridge and it's a long story but uh

leaf uh i just been i have so much wax i just been getting flour now i'm just trying to chill on the wax everybody likes the uh cartridge videos so that's why i just be getting the cartridge videos

fan of anything but llr from back in the day when the videos just started nobody knew nothing about making cards this and that and i was making cart videos i can just taste that fake flavor and like i can smell it in the air bro yeah i mean before ivan him as underrated stream thanks bro thank you thank you oh man i'm lit yeah i chill with you man i answer all you know i mean all questions anything i try to you know companies send me [ __ ] to review i try to get extra just boom so i can give it back to y'all yeah i mean because i know it is what car cartridges or flour or what you break it when you're eating them it's there's really like there's really no pain it don't hurt it is just busted into like a razor sharp edge and every time my jaw rubs against my back tooth it is just sawing away at it you know it sucks so every time i cough whenever it just rubs my tongue because then my mouth wants to open but this has a great taste back to the flavor and it definitely uh is fake flavored um it's not natural terps but it it is good it's not bad it's like a moxie cartwhere there's [ __ ] you know taste like the root beer float tastes like the root beer float and so on and so on which i haven't had a moxie cart in a while i think that's what i'm gonna grab because i literally just hit everything uh but we got the donnie burger but i just did the cheese rack oh i'm lit and just

know i hate smoking them but if you've been on here for 30 minutes we're homies you guys rock", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "qJcoVWbVObA": "what is up you guys welcome back to beyond skylines today I have a cart review earlier today I filmed the video for the sunset sherbert flower review so if you haven't seen that yet go ahead and check it out anyways back to this day we have a Cali pith cartridge right here the one gram just right off the bat one thing I noticed is that this is a little empty on the top so I mean it's supposed to be the full gram but anyways back to it it has a good decent packaging I really like the back how it has the little string right there with the metallic color this is sunset sherbert like I said usually I can't get this to focus but anyways anyways oh it's a sunset sherbert testing out at 96 point 38 percent THC point 59 percent CBD and 1.27 CBN moving on it looks really awesome let's go ahead and open this and you see I'm gonna go ahead and be let's open this first I'm just gonna take open this up boom so I'm sorry about that first footage it might be shaky in the beginning just because I forgot to turn off my car so the camera was just going like that anyways right here back to it we have the full Graham hopefully because of that missing piece let's go ahead and screw this on to my the battery I'm using is an uzi out out who's there the batteries are really good and they rip too so I'm gonna go ahead and do this and let's give it a test Cheers hope you guys are smoking along with me I thought I heard something Oh tastes very very good I really like that on the top up here it's like a kind of like a glass or plastic tip it's actually a plastic tip but really nice it has really good air flow let's go ahead and take another rip so I can get that flavor so on the flavor strangely enough if you guys have smelled pine-sol that's pretty much what it tastes like how it smells is exactly how it tastes and I actually really like it it doesn't taste bad at all it actually tastes very good and uh yeah well awesome if you know it's I just keep eating it so on the taste I'm gonna go ahead and give it a job up there on the taste I'm gonna go ahead and give it a 8 out of 10 let me know down below in the comments what you guys is favorite uh carts are and what else I should pick up that way I can review it and I got you guys as soon as I can get my hands on it Cheers hope you guys had a lot of smoking a lot open those edibles up s skated one thing I've really been wanting to review lately is THC crystals if you've had THC crystals let me know how they were but yeah this is a really good kart this is my first time trying one of these taste is really good the high is pretty intense and from what I know they're a pretty well-known brand but I mean I'm it's gonna be a passing me if you guys know anything else of course you should let me know but yeah with that you guys this was gonna be a short video since I'd previously made one so let's go ahead and get it I'm gonna take another favorite piece out I'll see you guys later on the next one", "jVJzhCQ2wng": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene so this is episode 4 about 2020 strain review series and today I'm gonna be taking a look at sunset sherbert let's talk about the background of this caliber strain I've been excited about covering sunset sure but for some time this is an absolute powerhouse of a strain that crosses Girl Scout cookies with pink panties and indica dominant hybrids it captures the complexity of the Girl Scout parents and its appearance it captures some of that magic with both these parents in the tert profile and it is a really nice strength interesting fact it's also been bred back with the Girl Scout cookies to create gelato so if you're a fan of gelato any of those Cali strains that have come from the gelato lineage once that removed in the sunset sherbet super interesting that stuff big up to Roadrunner this batch of sunset sherbet has been organically grown using the no teal growing method and this gives some of the nicest tasting cannabis that I have had the pleasure of sampling today I've already reviewed the skittles grown with the same method and this week it's all about the sunset sherbet you can also check back on our previous strain reviews going all the way back to 2016 via this link I smoked mag Cote UK forward slash strain reviews we've got all in the data they're organized into a table so you can catch up with what you've missed learn the lineage of some brand new strains and generally enjoy some of the previous smoke reports we've put out on the channel really famous breeder this one mister shipp in ski he has been a guest at several UK cannabis club events taking place over the last couple of years he bred the Girl Scout with the pink panties to create the sunset sherbet let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain looking at this bud in detail I love the complexity of this bud it reminds me a lot of the Girl Scout cookies I've tried Girl Scout cookies on numerous occasions it's got these lovely deep mottled green with the darker leaf bases and the lighter color raishin of the bud underneath this got popping orange yellow pistols and they just look absolutely fantastic the blood structures are amazing especially considering this is organically grown in living soil so no nutrient use the soil is fed rather than the plants it's nice and dense it's got a solid bud structure and the complex look and coloration of this bud is lovely the calyx is a stat but not overly densely stacked into one nug so you can separate it quite easily I would rate this really highly in terms of look there are still some basis of Leafs left on there but it just adds to this different coloration and complexity I know if you'd have got this from a dispensary in California they're probably trim all of that off and you'd be left with these little boulders that probably didn't resemble this as much this is more than natural form of what the flower looks like before it goes from that really strong trimming process and I actually like this the smoke that it gives will be nice it's not going to taste data from the leaf bases because they're covered in trichomes as well top marks from me in terms of the appearance I would say that this looks nicer than the skills that I've reviewed last week and that got pretty much 10 out of 10 for every other area and that covers the appearance let's talk about the smell of the sunset sherbet let's get some of this jar slow whoa it's deliciously sweet and pungent this one again reminded me of that Girl Scout cookies flavor there's earthiness there's pepperiness and it's kind of like a sweetness underwriting all of that it's kind of a lot of really nice sort of smell just creeping in with a deep inhalation pungent offensive you know what I mean offensive if you don't like the smell of cannabis this is gonna piss you off instead of citrus but it's not like a sour or tart e-types no it's just hint there a little bit like hops really nice smell to it guys again nice and complex led with that pungency let's break it open and see what it smells like inside these mugs cor blimey the pungency just shut up the pungent notes just shut up to the level of blue like not Gorilla Glue like actual super glue when you open up a super glue so parents of this one include og cush Durbin poison so it's got that kind of gassy power to it and you really do smell that coming very super rich super strong smelling strange Oh lovely smell to this sunset sure but top marks from me but how does it taste my favorite bit of a review is upon us we are gonna taste the sunset sure but guys I've got brand new grinder here I've got a brand new lighter here I've cleaned the bong ready because I know in my last video featuring the skittles it wasn't as clean as it should have been let's grind up some of the sunset sherbet and put it into this nice new grinder should have definitely watch the grinder at first got a lot of new grinder smelt going on here smells like a bit like a pencil case I'm like I don't want that oh wait some ground some up let's put it into the bung and smoke a bowl of this fantastic smelling cannabis strain if the smell comes through to the flavor we are in for a treat guys we're going to test it out if you're joining me for this one you know what to do get those joints rolled bongs ready dab rigs heated up hit that pause button if you need to and I'll see you on the other side [Music] white ash deliciously smooth no bite actually pulled it further in than I normally do with a bomb because I wanted to bubble it at the end you noticed as I pulled out the bar we actually pulled the down stem up no need to cough no acridity the flavor that's coming through is kind of like the leading part and a flavour is the sweetness and the pungency is kind of gone it's sweet hoppy sort of flavor yeah really nice it's just not as strong is there the smell that was coming fro let's try again Bowl number two of this sunset sherbert and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] it's got a nice sort of cookies taste on the exhale very very clean no bite no acridity sort of sweet berry but not so pungent in the flavor and the bomb smoke I've got my agro vaporizer here this is a vape by a riser it's their most portable smallest vape heats up nice and fast the agro vaporizer I like the Arizer products you don't really have to do any cleaning because of the way that they are built you just make sure that the tubes get it tonight so now and then alright the vaporizer is ready let's try some of these sunset sherbert war you get a really really strong taste coming through that and what is it it's complex it's lighter that's more definitely more pungent there's more skunk enos in that flavor when I talk about pungent I'm talking about that classic skunk type flavor a lot more guess in that than less of a delicate that I've got rid of smoke interestingly some users reported it tastes a bit like sherbert and I'm getting like different sweet notes but not that fizziness that I would expect from like that the word sherbet but definitely like hints of berry skunky earthy pungent gassy tonight I mean all of those nice vapor let's talk about the effects at the sunset sherbet so as I was vaping this the bongs hit me and I can tell you this is a strong indication my body my eyes feel like this sort of closing a little bit and it's got a very very bright in here actually nice and relaxing but feels that I could be creative and with this sort of mood this mindset that is putting me in you know so so I like that about it yes a heavy smoke yeah I can feel it in my head but like not as in my mind in my head you know like feel it in your body but in my head I can tell from my voice that is on the indica side as well we sort of slowed down my talking a bit and to put a little bit more base and and took a little bit of the energy out of my voices well at the same time so solid indica effects there and that about wraps it up so let's sum things up today I've been enjoying that sunset sherbert is a lovely strain growing organically no-till living soil by Roadrunner big up lovely smoke and everything from the appearance which was complex in this different coloration nice trichome coverage as well but just the different colors of green making it look fantastic smell wise absolutely lovely really like those sort of under sunder tone berry notes in addition to that pungency and then flag well this is what I'm trying to work out is it better food through the bong or is it better through the vaporizer I think I prefer smoking it I'm just gonna I'm just gonna smoke one more bow and we'll we'll see win a mummy relax my main man [Music] Wow some smooth really nice clean smoke from that organically living soil growth week yeah they're smoking it to vapor there's nice through both methods effects wise the indica dominant highest is certainly kicking in nice and faster it's a strong strain suited for an afternoon or even in warm weekend smoke

about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "4ujd1ufbGeI": "nowadays in this world they come along I'm along and they'll make a rolling paper that looks like mine in fact it's some kind of a lot like mine not so bad but they make it in a third-world country like China and they sell it for less and now you're going underneath me so rather than a ladder going up we're going down and then most companies will respond to this this undercut by making a cheaper product I pull my production out of al-khoei and I start making it in China also and I come underneath you look I'll be even cheaper and then you go underneath me I'll cut back on materials to make it even cheaper and then I cut back on my materials and get even cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and we end up with a [ __ ] ass product you guys don't get to smoke and enjoy the way you should we end up with an ocean full of garbage that nobody wants and we never end up getting being able to fly through space at warp factor 9 because capitalism has been corrupted so I'm gonna teach it to you now in a way on the show to in a way that well I guess I'll show you the progression of one line of rolling papers I have to come around sorry I can't stay this from behind but let me show it to you so we have this raw one and a quarter which was the first size or all I ever made at the similar time we ride around then we also made raw king-size supreme interesting ly enough this was made on our oldest machine called the bicicleta 100 or 200 years old and it was used to be powered by bicycle now it's electric and it's a flat pack not even interleave the sheets themselves you have to take them out and fold them that's the oldest style so we have this kind of older packs we move on to things like rolls paper on a roll so now we're still progressing as you can see the evolutions still happening you make a paper you can tear this off make any size you want beautiful now we move on and we make connoisseurs come up with this invention a guy named Joker helped me with this it's papers and tips together with an elastic band to reminisce us of the ancient rolling papers our ancients are al-khoei and ancients who made papers tied with a rope and the original rolling papers which were tied with a string which I'm gonna get off on a tangent I keep going there so I'll stop but you get it you get the point then we move on and another friend of mine helps me make the art asano and together we all make this beautiful pack now we have papers tips and a built-in rolling tray detachable reusable you've seen my videos again this is evolution it progresses magnetic closer progression we then go back and improve the original connoisseur the original connoisseurs awesome but we make a connoisseur with pre-rolled tips again going forward evolution I have no competitor that's forcing me to do this so I just kind of compete with myself it's supposed to be someone else doing this by the way it's supposed to be them doing making the cool stuff and then I make something cooler but nobody does that really so we just do it ourselves alright so make we go on to this then we make the masterpiece box which is roles and pre-roll tips a sharp cutting edge and a magnetic closure so you have everything you need and I could keep going that I could but the point isn't it isn't about products isn't about making footlong rollin machines after making 70 millimeter rolling machines after making seventy nine millimeter land shoes after making hundred ten millimeter rolling machines after making seventy nine millimeter adjustable since 70 millimeter decibels and 110 millimeter holes and making them out of hemp plastic it's not about that I'm just want to share with you this mindset because my fear my concern is the more the capitalism gets corrupted the more that we do this thing of undercutting ourselves undercutting humanity and going down into the garbage the less that we really get to enjoy and the less we progress as I said before the world needs less hype men you don't need someone to come up and say yo man this is the best rolling paper because I said it's the best you better smoke it or else really we are grown [ __ ] men here we are adults with incredible brains our brains have more synapses than there are stars in the universe this is true you don't need someone telling you that instead what I think everybody needs is for an explanation knowledge why is it the best rolling paper ever my videos I think I have taught more about rolling papers to the world than anyone else who has ever come before me and I do this for a reason and I'm getting a little upset right now because I know that it will not be too long until I'm gone then all this knowledge and all this information and everything that poppy taught me will be gone unless I do these incredible videos and teach you about acacia gum and how it's turned into rolling paper gum and I teach you about how rolling papers are made and I teach you the art because it is an art of watermarking see a rolling paper when it when it's first coming out like there are the production it's just a flat piece of paper it's like a canvas but the art is painting on it is doing that watermark which I've shown you before is just done with heat and moisture but it's difficult and it's definitely an art rolling papers in itself is an art all of this is all right before I get any more emotional again I hope that I've been able to teach you more than most and my goal is to uplift you because the world needs more uplifting a negative you know not less negative sorry you don't need to hear about my problems or anyone else's problems at this moment especially as a smoker I think you need to be uplifted and that's what rolling papers in reality are really about their job is to uplift you and to give you an incredible experience and my job is to help you with that now before I end this there's what have I forgotten what else do I need to tell you guys I wish I could introduce you to Joe Kesselman you would have loved him he was a man among men I miss him all the time sorry alright so what else should I be talking about is in essence the blue of mankind it's a mindset and it's capitalism in its purest form and I'm going to teach you all of these products are about the evolution of smoking which is in essence the evolution of mankind it's a mindset and it's capitalism in its purest form that boy is nervous as hell doing seven-minute videos about us calling me a hype man talking about copying his whole style look man you're looking weird man you're looking weirder and weirder every day man

with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "HZ4aCvghcLs": "what's going on youtube fam it's looney coming at you with another video as you guys can see this is the mask i was talking about that field gave me when i purchased a cartridge shout out to field dope mask appreciate it really nice so this is what i reviewed last video if you guys weren't aware definitely enjoying the product not talking about that one we're going to go ahead and be visiting a brand that we have uh already came across on this channel which is friendly [ __ ] farms excuse my language but we last time we uh had a little rodeo with their cured resin absolutely hated it and now we're going gonna go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt and go ahead and try their live resin their actual live resin this is going to be the smoothie with a z total thc is coming in at 76.49 total cannabinoids at 79.86 so it's not that much uh not that much of a difference between the cannabinoids and the thc only three percent difference uh less than two percent in cbd packaged on 8 24 expires on 8 21 2022 so this is a it was a package relatively recent i already cut the box open just so i wouldn't have you know struggle with that on camera but obviously i haven't looked at the product yet they're a little saying you use it you know you deserve this i hope i do i didn't deserve the last one definitely didn't deserve the last one uh anyone that's not aware with friend uh about you know of anyone that's not aware of or know of friendly farms they're all true spectrum the whole live resin the whole real deal that's what they claim to be i'm gonna go ahead and see what their cartridge is looking like i've never had their live resin cartridges my first time so i've never had the strange smoothie and oh that is beautiful that looks nice look at this guys look at this beautiful live resin oil really nice they did a really good job so all right off the bat it's looking a lot better than the cured resin uh was looking smells really good like it smells smells very like uh very cannabis-y which it should you know it should smell like the smells smells real dab dab like it smells like real resin like real like resin is what i'm trying to say though obviously it's real resin but it smells like real like real resiny wow let's go ahead and take this garlic cookies off and attach the new and new one since i took this uh where was that little rubber piece damn so let's go throw it away idiot so i wanted to put this rubber piece on this cartridge right here on the bottom since i'm not using a cartridge no more that way to put it away keep it protected i highly recommend you guys to do that save those rubber pieces and use them all right screw it on this is the smoothie i have no idea what the crosses are what makes smoothie if you guys know go ahead and comment and let me know below i'm gonna go ahead and take this down to 2.8 because right now that's red is 3.7 blue was 3.3 plug oh no i don't want to preheat it one two three as green as 2.8 and they recommend you hitting you smoking vaping their product at anywhere between two volts and three volts so don't go above three don't go below two is what they're saying pretty much oh i'm so excited guys friendly farms i love their packaging black and yellow beautiful box packages is always nice they always have a they give you a little pamphlet with a bunch of random information on there if uh you guys can check out the other video on the gmo you know i'll show the pamphlet off doesn't really tell you much it's just pretty much re regurgitating what it tells you on the box that's pretty much what it is i'm going to try to get an aroma from this you guys already know the deal try to get aroma try to get a see if i can smell anything and taste anything before i vape the product let's take this off to do that i'll be honest so right i'm already having high hopes for this live resin cartridge and the reason being look at the headspace their headspace reminds me of ursus ursa has a lot of headspace just like theirs not a big deal but pretty much what i was saying is uh before i interrupted myself is most live resin cartridges most cartridges in general i don't get a very strong scent or aroma from the from doing this from the tip before vaping it this one excuse me this one has a very strong scent like i can smell it it smells like it smells like purple it smells purplish like it has given out that purple scent like so like a purple punch kind of scent wow all right that smells really good i'm actually wow this smells really good it has me kind of like wondering how it's going to taste you know cleanse my palate let's go in for it it's going for a pool cheers guys you guys got a friendly farms with you or any other cartridge you're smoking with you comment below let me know what you're smoking on take a hit with me and let's let's go ahead let's go in for this ride guys wow really good wow forgot to mention it's a hybrid really tasty wow tastes straight like a dab it tastes like it tastes like a purple smoothie like a weed purple smoothie that's oh lung expansion is there very intense uh cerebrally and um the relaxation the mellowness on the body is kicking in wow yo this this shit's uh this is uh some good ass [ __ ] this is some good ass [ __ ] oh my god that wow this isn't even my first smoke of the day either guys it's like it's in the afternoon for me right now probably 4 or 5 p.m right now and i've been smoking this garlic cookies uh you know i was i hit i hate it probably like three times today you know twice in the morning and then once in afternoon and so it's not my fruit this isn't my first smoke of the day not my first high of the day but it hit me as if it was like this smoothie live resin cartridge from friendly farms already from that initial pool from that initial hit already is better than his garlic cookies and garlic cookies is my favorite strain but i would rather pick up this this is more potent than this this is 82 percent this is 79 no this is 79 cannabinoids this friendly farms 76 thc 82 thc but this smacked me more than this did so whatever that means i don't know it might be just how potent the strain is but wow that was uh that was a very amazing surprising good hit excuse me all right let's go ahead and uh go for another one let's see if i get the same thing oh excuse me guys wow this thing actually uh it hit my throat uh my throat so you got me lit already hit my chest harder than usual usually um i can take these like nothing all right let's go go for another one that hit i said it's a hybrid it's an indica this is an indica but it hit me so hard in the head that i thought it was a hybrid wow so let me try to explain this to you guys the taste it tastes like something purple it has that very strong purple taste to it has a very strong live resin tone to it at the end upon exhale after you're finished hitting it you get that dab like that resin like a sensation like you taste it and then it's super smooth but on the exhale or rather on the inhale it hits you it's like a meal kicking you in the chest out of nowhere wow because it's smooth going down and then when you go it's like whoa you know it's like oh i don't know where it just hits you as you guys can see there's no bubbles it hasn't really gone down and uh and uh hasn't really gone down and uh the oil hasn't really uh decreased this has me faded guys you guys need to pick up this smoothie this smoothie um live resin from friendly farms you guys need to pick this up you guys need to pick up a friendly farm live resin in general this um ran me uh 60 bucks but and then with taxes it takes it up to 73 which kind that's like so much but honestly i see why the product is so expensive just because the quality is really there like it's this is some [ __ ] that i can literally hit one time put it put it down and i'm good i'm good to go just one hit is enough and you guys see i got the smoothie right i'd even mention but i'm about to i got another one coming for you guys hey this isn't uh sunset uh sherbert sunset sherbert i seen uh so this is smoothie which is a one i've never tried but sunset sherbert in a live resin cartridge four gram i can't wait to try that for you guys that one is uh coming in at 82.45 thc and 88 total cannabinoids so i'm gonna review that one for you guys uh probably after the ursa one after the after i review the ursa one but that's coming up so um in terms of what i uh expected from life from the friendly farms i'm not gonna lie i thought i had i didn't have high hopes for their live resin because i for some reason after trying the cured resin i just figured that the cured resin was gonna be similar the cured resin was super dark it tasted like straight soil like straight plants and oregano like like it even it almost it faintly tasted like weed but it tasted more like the soil that the wheat is planted and it was crazy i've never had any flavor like that in my life that's probably why i dislike this so much excuse me but this on the other hand this is like this rivals nug this beats field this kicks field right in its ass this is up there with ursa this is high quality good cannabis that you should be uh definitely consuming if you're somebody that that's looking for you know the top-notch [ __ ] the you know top-tier [ __ ] wow this um they had strawberry banana i almost got that one but the only reason why i didn't is because they had two different strawberry bananas one was a collab version which was friendly farms collabed with humboldt's finest and that that strawberry like a banana live resin cartridge full gram cartridge was at coming in at 90 thc 96 total cannabinoids and for some reason they have another strawberry banana but it's straight up just friendly farms and like like just like these just strawberry banana friendly farms and for some reason that live resin was at like 80 thc and 88 cannabinoids so so since it didn't have the most potent one i didn't grab it but i picked up this one instead and let me tell you i'm not disappointed whatsoever this [ __ ] exceeded my expectations and i'm looking forward to definitely trying the next one but let's go ahead for another hit and so i could uh describe it a little more for you guys because it does i see why it gets the name smoo smoothie because it's definitely smooth like it's smooth but then again i'm taking some fat ribs guys so that's probably why it's hitting me so hard and why it's uh hitting my chest so hard but let me take a normal hit and see how that goes wow so a normal hit like that you won't even feel it like it's so smooth like nothing absolutely nothing the taste it's hard to tell on the taste because those two fat ribs kind of have my mouth all like like not it doesn't feel like resiny but it's definitely like like i can like it's just smoke like you know you guys you guys know what i'm talking about after taking a hit that's what the water's for all right so i didn't get much flavor from that hip it was a small hit so let's take a big hit uh [Laughter] oh [Music] sorry guys sorry for any headphone users that crank up the volume wow that brought me to tears okay guys that uh what i just did there how i took three fat ribs i clicked the button three times i'd never do a blinker i like to do bigger hits than one blinker wow i also believe blinkers will eventually deteriorate your battery but that's besides the point anyways they got the cartridge uh kind of all warm and [ __ ] which i would expect but wow wow so normally i'm able to take three hits like that normally three hits like that and and blow out the smoke and i have a problem this had me choking as if i took a dab off of a rig that was insane i've never coughed like that off of a cartridge a cartridge what and it's not my first smoke of the day guys this is crazy i like i'm not ever reviewing another cartridge unless it's my first smoke of the day but i didn't want to hold i didn't want to put this video i didn't want to wait you know to review the product i was so excited to review it so i just got got to it but wow this [ __ ] is uh not only is it potent it's smooth it's tasty it hits the lungs at the same time of being smooth you can choose if you want a hit that's going to kill you or you can choose if you want to hit that's going to be smooth and you can go on about your day no problem all you got is just all depends on you taking a big hit or taking a small hit i'm hitting this at 2.8 volts any lower would be so much tastier i could only imagine and yeah you guys will probably could could uh so some of you guys have seen my other videos could say yeah why didn't you bring out the ursa uh ursa battery for this uh cartridge the reason being because i want to review that ursa battery using the ursus cartridge how it's supposed to not only that but they do say on friendly farms doesn't say on the box that you can use any voltage between two to three three is the max so 2.8 should be like if not perfect like you know if i would assume to 2.5 would be perfect but 2.8 is like you know two two below zero point two below the voltage uh limit so i think that's right around where you would want to be if not a little lower but i definitely would want to try this on a lower setting i probably will when i'm reviewing the ursa cartridge after i'm done talking about it reviewing it and doing my full review about the ursa i'll probably take a hit of one of these uh friendly farm cartridges uh probably most likely this one because i might have this one uh available to hit so i'm probably gonna try this one on the 1.9 volts and see how it is but so then this 2.8 perfect perfect hits perfect vapor production clouds i'm medicated as hell but i'm able to speak this is weird this is an indica for some reason i'm so faded in the head that i thought it was a hybrid so that's my that's another thing to say where in one of my other videos i mentioned how indicas and certain indica certain sativa certain hybrids certain strains affect everyone differently so even though this is labeled as an indica it's affecting me like a hybrid because i definitely feel relaxed i definitely feel the body sedated i feel my legs almost numb like it's amazing but i also feel extremely faded in the head and behind my eyes and right here in my temple area so it's very cerebral but in this very uh body height too it's very couch locked like they would say you know that's very it's definitely a couch lock i took three big hits so uh that's probably not going to be the normal dosage that you know you guys are probably going to be doing but if you guys want to experience what i'm experiencing then i would recommend to do the same thing take three big hits but i want to know comment below what you guys think about how my hits are because my friend uh my partner he always looks at me he'd be like damn do you take some big ads no wonder you run through your cards i don't feel like i run through my cards but let me know what you guys think about my hits are my hits normally or my head small do you guys take bigger hits do you guys take smaller hits like let me know what you guys i'm just curious is something that you know a little high thought but in terms of this cartridge man there's no complaints nothing i can say they can do better and i love the the tip the this tip is way better than this plastic tip that uh field has the this tip is perfect like you get like it just feels everything about it looks better feels better and it's just better quality the oil viscosity is perfect like it moves slowly very slowly like barely like exactly how like live resin would move is like it can uh hit it's crazy because it's like you can't watch it move up but as like i'll look away and then i'll look a look back a couple seconds later and then you'll see it uh at a different spot excuse me let's go i'm going to take another final hit for you guys wow i'm really enjoying this this is a big thumbs up i i i wish they had you guys going to hate me i wish they had this cartridge as a gmo and live resin instead of cured resin all right let's go for this final hit hope you guys enjoy your day like comment

definitely 10 thumping in the background knew what we're coming artists some fire right here but anyway today's string we're gonna jump into some Jack Straw a nice pure earth cartridge so one thing I love about the kill period cartridges is that they're very clean no PG no peg no MC teens none of that garbage in here like I said in other podcasts ain't trying to get killed by no cartridge I can try to get taken up by the cartridge survived the Bronx for 25 years and you know I'm trying to be put in the coffin by this coffin but anyway comes in this nice coffin style package and once with these guys this little sticker here has a tendency I know when we hang them up on the shelves they kind of drop down a lot but anyway you see how it slides down there Jack Straw is the strain today now Jack Straw is Steve a dominant it's a touch of touch of gray with Jack the Ripper but one thing I noticed with this it's got a big old bubble there so I don't kind of like that I usually got two bubbles so it's got one on the bottom one up top there so I try to avoid anything with the big bubbles in it obviously I'd like my cartridge to last a little bit longer and that has a tendency is not allowing that to happen but anyway it's just jump into this cartridge to see what's going on got my Moxie battery here allegedly this is good for anxiety depression but everybody's cannabinoid system is different so you know that's a hard one pinpoint their everybody's different so like for instance sativas they say you know german poison is the expression of sativas they put me to sleep so we're all different but shots of vaping for providing a hack also WTF which is one of the newer brands out there in the extract world and it's world's THC Factory they're definitely jumping subnet products and you know do some reviews on there and definitely stay tuned there but let's make this for episode the rest of this for the rest of the smoke man but yeah we got this Jack Straw and it's gonna be a sativa dominant let's see 80% sativa 20% indica I like they provide that information right there and a cartridge for us but yeah let's jump into this okay definitely a very lemony Wow lemony very sweet also button tap that bubbles bothering me usually you know you don't see that appeareth cartridge but I'll have to learn to live with it be able to get one more year definitely very tasty got a really nice taste to it normally I would give it a two stalks up but because of that bubble one chokes up and one toke down you know I don't do bubbles but anyway until next time please hit that

what's up guys p2 peeps back again with another cartridge review and we're doing the friendly farms exterbzilla collab sunset sherbet stream yeah before we've done let's see the alien labs and gelato 41 on the friendly farms car we have done another service of the one the oreo cream one and we've done a humble's finest one with i think that's the straw nana cartridge yeah we've done that one as well so yeah on to our next adventure here with our friendly farms brand spree um honestly guys i'm really liking the cured resin carts this this is my first brand i've ever had resin carts with and i've just been thoroughly impressed so this one is eighty four point ninety one percent thc with six oh six percent cbd that's beautiful ninety two percent total cannabinoids on this one that's really nice oh beautiful honey honey like color there as well yeah i've been really enjoying the cured resin cards as you guys know and here we go i'm really excited to try this one out guys so pack yourself a bowl dab get your pen ready all that stuff cause i'm gonna jump in with a hit right now and i'd like you to take one with me so cheers oh man yeah this this is another really good one um i'm a little a little disappointed a tiny tiny tiny bit just because this tastes just like the oreo cream one now this may be because this is the same um you know brand sharpzilla the same collab with the friendly farms as the oreo cream one was so that could play into maybe why they kind of taste similar maybe similar extraction processes they had the same terpenes type thing whatsoever but um yeah i was expecting sunset sherbert to be a little bit more um a little sweeter you know a little bit sweeter this is still sweet but um like i said in my oreo cream review it there's a lot of like a heavy doughy taste to it and this one gets that too but at least this has a little bit of a deeper terpene taste to it than the oreo cream one did so now we're going to take another hit and see how it goes see if we taste anything different cheers [Music] oh there is a slight little sour tang at the end there i like that i like that a lot kind of like the regular sense that sherbet so yeah you know these cured resin cartridges really capture the taste of good flour and i really appreciate that you know that's something i really miss when i switched over to going to concentrates and and you know just dabbing or using constant cartridges mostly just the taste you know most of the cartridges don't really get the same exact taste of the plant and it's just nice to be able to know that there are cartridges that are out there that can do that so yeah and as per tradition we got the hamilton ps1 right here ready to go and we're going to take a little bubbler hit of our cartridge the sunset sherbet cured resin cartridge i don't know if this is the best cured resin cartridge now um we're gonna have to see we're gonna have to do some more heavy comparisons between this and the other ones i still have some of the other ones thankfully just a little bit left but still got some of them so we'll have a few comparisons of those in a bit but yeah once again this is the friendly forms extra zilla original sunset sherbet cured resin cartridge 92 total cannabinoids 84 thc 6 cbd this thing is very tasty and very very potent so yeah guys please if you are willing to join me pack yourself a bowl a dab get your cart pen ready all that good stuff and cheers okay now let's go on to the bubbler it's got a different flavor than the oreo cream i'll take back what i said earlier um maybe it's still very similar but there is a different flavor like i said earlier there is a slight little tank sweetness at the end but now i'm getting a very very very small amount of tininess and citrus no no suggesting it just pine it's just a little sweet kind of puffiness which is nice so yeah i'm really enjoying this one and maybe in the cartridge comparison i'll have more better and maybe in the cartridge comparison i'll have more developed thoughts on the flavor profile of this thing you know maybe i'm still missing some things out etc etc thanks guys for watching and yeah peace out actually hold on fakie out let's take another hit before we go all right cheers relax that should be it for now um you know thanks guys for watching and if you enjoyed please leave a like comment subscribe notification bell hit it please and uh yeah p2 out peace you", "GJVRZVcDEYY": "what up YouTube this is your host Ling and dad and welcome to another Kanaka reviews you guys I'm back at it again you

two lovely cash back with another cart review for you guys today I'm gonna be reviewing the cart fire oh gee by Mohammed and let me show you guys how it looks like we started this cart review guys I hope y'all had a good Christmas it's the 28th that's good too it's almost New Year's you know all right well first it's a fire ogee curve is a indica one gram and of course it's by Muhammad's on the side it has organic the bottom is got your little stick here and on the side it has premium live resin oil concentrates on the in the back it has these little details I got star Instagram and a little code that almost scan right now for you guys you let's feel the sticker real quick let's get this box open alright so you guys know I do this with one hand so it's kinda hard for me to do this but you know I'm early there you go peel that off and that's open you guys go signing it out right now it will always have the little scoop captaining on the bottom little go thing and also right here it would always say Mohammed with some little mouhot stickers or muha logos on it and you guys could see the oil would stake me holding it upside down and you're moving like that alright alright so let's unscrew this real quick there you go same as the other one this one comes with a red plastic you go let's go y'all could see the bottom yeah but let's try hit just now that's the other taste sorry y'all go dry hit this cart oh it tastes like regular wheat very funny it tastes like just wheat kuniva straight-up we'd probably the maybe the battery will change its flavor because this other cart that I have right here this one wants to serve it cart and it tasted like walnuts but it smelled so different so let's see if that's the same case with this one already know I got my battery right here we grab this you know put the card in there like always magnets in there screw it on real quick and I will be using the six cents trip and trip and battery I swear if I said speaker anyways I'm I've been using this battery I also got this other battery this one is called the Atmos - Kim I got it with this used to be a wax pen but the you think the wax used to go into broke so I just use it as a pen now and it doesn't damage the car to nothing that's what I like about it is strong and it's reliable all right I got my battery right here got my cart let's preheat it one time I'm not hitting on red because that's the best temperature to hit it at high all right this Headey y'all take it here with me too cuz I know y'all smoking or watching this who you are who you trying to fool damn I've got man hey it tastes like a little bit like lemon I'm not gonna lie tastes interesting is it true oh my god this is it chief this is it just caught yeah I had to stop the video for like quick five minutes without looks like coughing coughing and coughing non-stop I'm gonna take one more hint this time as long as I go three second cuz look at my eyes like do it you could tell I'm child they are getting black wrong I'm starting to look like like a raccoon thought you know if you worked all right hit it one more time it tastes like a good it tastes like that you know them candies I have a green apple apple heads I think that's what they're calling on you remember but it tastes like that all right oh that's my cart review thank you guys for watching this cart it's it chief fire oh gee let me know what other cards you guys want me to try like my video subscribe to him I'm Audi", "i-43_r_zi5o": "all right it's all right for another diver of you anti we are smoking on don't [ __ ] say anything about my pronunciation but I think it's [ __ ] Oh Mikoto not sure I can't really pronounce it but that is what the card is looking like here's the back I'm gonna try to get y'all wish I can yeah oh let's get to it and it's all you know if they're got a voice we got the Highness we got the taste and we got the harshness off the hit so without a further ado and wasting time let's get this [ __ ] started and for you guys that I'm wondering while my carts are half ways because I do someone calls them down before make a video because I procrastinate and I'm slacking and I don't do my part as a regular or not a regular but a real oh it was called reviewers it should be a first-time sir you know I mean I just I get so into it I want to smoke and I'm so late all right here first time spoken all today mm-hmm getting pretty low in these carts so we have at first what I was going to do is stop smoking sir every time I finish a cart like I'd stop for like weeks but no I can't do that like I don't want to do that I can handle it but I don't want to I've done it before plenty of times you just because I didn't have we to stop smoking so what I've changed it to is that I'm only gonna smoke once so that's so much how to cut back instead of actually stopping at one point even though I would get me baked but do it alright today we're going to start with taste if anybody or anyone's ever had green apple of this it tastes more like green apple then green apple does it's very sweet smooth warning do not exhale through your nose where that [ __ ] does burn very bad we're gonna see green apple taste and I kind of like the taste of green apple so one through five we're gonna give it a 4.3 it just wasn't good enough to be four and a half now we're gonna go with harshness I know change right here in a second but right now it's just this little buzzy so harsh it's let's go I wasn't really painful it was more like it was [ __ ] with my head like it was just twirling I'm bringing around and making me do your spin really really fast and now it's just like I'm lightheaded but it's like a high light head is like like that that time actually took a better second but yeah it's not really a hard [ __ ] like yeah it's making me cry yeah tear up and [ __ ] but um-hmm a 1:15 and I don't know if it's a 1:13 with your folks I went to Temple um coughing it's it's pretty bad but like usually I feel like shaking up and [ __ ] and don't feel so nice but that was nice it felt good I even thought again now is that bad but yeah that was pretty good I like that so - we're gonna give it about it - I should week but it feels good like I like it no a [ __ ] sitter so you don't wanna be if you just want to feel good take nice it's smooth it's night Rhett definitely recommend this you only a bait I'm just talking out of the wazoo mmm Highness I feel like my moods changed it's not so tense because usually I'm very light and loose but today I've been all tense Oh since yesterday later last night I've been - I lost my wallet I just got me bones or not my bones but I got me I just I just haven't been in a good mood since lost my wallet oh my there wasn't a money or anything in it was just my tea it was like [ __ ] that [ __ ] that [ __ ] some more get another ID gay not some good dudes make some nude feel better so I'm a loser I'll probably go play something more video games in a minute after uploading this video so yeah this is my Road Oh guys I would recommend it any day any concentrates recommend loved it as long as they're safe and test it out don't do this on this year 18 and up love you guys and subscribe see you later", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "J516sf4qHe0": "good morning YouTube

State labs [Music] stay Derby", "aEaoDC2EwM0": "it what's up guys it's your boy master blinky back again with another video today what we're gonna be taking a look at is this live East Coast cartridge cart I haven't really seen these around before I recently got one and I've been really excited to try it for you guys it says that it has one point four percent CBD eighty-two percent THC and six percent Terps I like that it has the stats like that and they actually seem believable real cards shouldn't really test above 85 percent if they have Terps in them um and having some CBD in there is cool too apparently it's supposed to give you forea um and give you an energized mood and it's a sativa hybrid so yeah let's go ahead and get into this card so opening up the cart we pull it out and we see that it is AC cell atomizer with a white ring on the bottom a lot of people says that that means that it's a fake atomizer but I also want to think that maybe it's because live rebranded at C cell atomizer they also put their logo on top of the mouthpiece which actually looks pretty legit not gonna lie so I'm hoping this car actually hits pretty nicely and tastes good as you can see the bubble is actually pretty slow it doesn't move too fast at all so I'm definitely definitely having some high hopes for this cart so let's go ahead and get into my first puffs of it alright y'all so I'm gonna take my first puff off this live mimosa cart I'm using my C cell m3 battery because that's the pretty standard battery that most car companies will sell with cards so either way let's actually check this card out Cheers [Music] okay feels very smooth cheers again [Music] when it comes to the potency of this cart I am already feeling effects I'm already seeing the flash very weird it looks like a star in my vision taking that blinker straight looks a bit rough on my lungs Matt go lie well I'm sorry I feel very warm as well I think I'm gonna be a fan of these cards oh of course I can't give my full opinion yet I always want to wait at least a day to tell you guys if these carts are good but before I go for right now I'm going to be taking a hit out of the damn cap so Cheers [Music] but I tell you that this part feels a little different um it's slapping a bit more than I'm used to not gonna lie like I'm for sure gonna take a night to review these and then tomorrow I'll tell you guys that these are actually yes but as of right now I'm like a hugger home it is just [ __ ] awesome all right yeah I'll be back tomorrow B's all right hey guys again I forgot to record a hit from the CBD [ __ ] battery so I'm gonna do that real quick I already preheated all we got to do is hit it Cheers this card produces such thick smoke oh my god bro also what you hear in the background is me about to record another gaming video in case y'all are kid get hip to my gaming videos they're actually kind of funny like what the [ __ ] are you doing also subscribe to the channel if you're not subscribed and leave a like I'm really high right now I love this cookie I'll get back to y'all tomorrow see it alright hey what's up guys I'm back so I've been smoking on this car for two days now and I think I'm actually a fan of it so after two days I've only used around 1/4 of my cart which is really good on those TKO cards I two days I was around halfway done this I definitely still have a good amount of uses out of as far as the highs go I don't think I could honestly get over 10 hits of this thing without having like take a break for a bit because I was just too tired or too high when I say too tired I don't mean like this car put me to sleep or gave me a headache or anything like that it's just after 10 hits I was like way too far gone to even know how to like actually function it was pretty awesome not gonna lie another thing about this card it's starting to get a little cloudy which doesn't worry me a little bit but I tried to do some research on it and I've been seeing that some extractions or like some people who extract their own oils end up with levy oil - and I don't know if that's something to do with the plant that they start out with but it has something to do with the extraction process but either way I'm not tasting anything odd that the current hasn't become harsh and it hasn't become less potent that's something that I do notice with other card brands that I've tried at least like dab was TKO sometimes even dank vapes sometimes after you get around half to two-thirds of the cart done they start to hit a lot harsher and then they sometimes change color actually with that with the dr. zodiacs bait card I reviewed the bottom of the cart started to turn a little black from where the atomizer was so those are signs that I look forward to seat bag carts versus this one which actually does feel like a quality and good kart I massage with it a little bit just to see if like maybe the wax is getting a little cloudy because of it just sitting so maybe after heat it up a bit it'll be fine so I'm gonna take around three puffs on it and then I'll do a wrap-up Cheers [Music] [Music] just a little - coughs from that but very nice vapor and very good flavor on it I forget what I said it tasted like last time I'm gonna take another hit right now just to see you again but it definitely does still have a very consistent flavor cheers again [Music] I really can't get an actual like opinion on how this car tastes it's so odd because I really can't like pinpoint the exact flavors of this cart I know that it had a around 6% turps in it so that's probably why I'm not getting like super strong flavors versus like other cart brands where they actually use like flavoring or they use a lot of Terps and that's why they're very runny this car isn't runny at all it's actually very slow-moving and it feels like it is I really think that's why I'm not really getting super strong consistent or super strong indescribable flavor simply because distillate doesn't have flavor um I'm gonna go ahead and hit it out of a rig though and see if that helps Cheers [Music] [Music] all right so we got a good amount of calls from that hit but I'm not gonna lie I don't know if y'all have ever smelled play-doh like if you had a little cousin who like played with it around you or you have like siblings but this cart tastes house this cart tastes just like how play-doh smells um I don't know how y'all will take that I think it doesn't actually taste that bad I'm not gonna lie but I've also never eaten play-doh so if anyone in the comments has tried play-doh go and let me know if it tastes good either way if I had to give this Curtis or I would give it an easy eight out of ten the wax did end up getting less cloudy once they eat it up a bit so I think that that's not really a sign that I'm gonna be worried about if I should be let me know though but yeah this card gets an 8 out of 10 potency easily a 9 to attend this cart is amazing I don't need to hit it a lot to get high it lasts a while um and the wax feels quality when it comes to taste I'll give it a 7 to an 8 out of 10 because I cannot really exactly describe the way it tastes other than how play-dohs smells or however I described it in my first it's a bit the atomizer is a real C cell so it tastes good it hits hard and you get good hits out of it versus seven tens which I don't think hit as hard overall I have never heard of live East Coast cartridges before getting this one but after getting this one I would put these above tank vapes or even kingpins king pens in my opinion are a bit overrated this is what a cart should actually feel like if you're buying it especially off the black market this is amazing so yeah 9 out of 10 this cart is great it's consistent and I would definitely suggest it to y'all if you see them around you um good job live East Coast cartridges so I'm in the video with two blinkers from the CBD 5 battery if you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like and subscribe check all the links in the description if you like this battery which I would highly suggest as well check the affiliate link in the description below it helps out the channel I'll put either way I'm master bling see it's been a pleasure I hope that if you guys can see these hurts and you try them out you have good experiences with them let me know but uh either way Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "-LOgUO7XJMU": "[Music] what's up guys simply secure and back with another video we got our NJ takes a picture Jimmy no RJ eats subscribe to the home he's about 580 right now let's get him to 600 should be a easy goal you know I'm saying but this is not about RJ even though he's in here subscribe to him but but if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge and this is by far the cheapest live resin cart that I was able to get my hands on I did give money to Randy cuz he stopped by the club yesterday and he bought it for me I've been mowing him the money and he got it from me but this is buddies and this was for 30 to 50 and this is about the cheapest live resin car I've ever like received or not received but and yeah I've tried buddy's before so nothing like special or new here but it is a new strain it is a lien push can you open it hold on we're gonna have a Randy open it not right now I'm gonna oh it shows the back first so these are the terpenes that are on there as you know with buddies and you can see right there on the right it says manufactured April 3rd that's by April 3rd 2021 all that good stuff you know just talking a monoids 280 7.39 on that alright let's go just get this pop oh and baby just come of it yeah so you can see very similar to the select cartridge I've had a buddy's cartridge before guys so hold on thumbnail right here hey there we go all right my ugly askin to or not it's a bad habit but a lot of people do and trying to start the bad [ __ ] done better anyways but you can see right here it's very much similar to the cartridge type of select but this is alien cush so I'm interested to see if this tastes like [ __ ] uh thank the lemon salt stuff that everything's been tasting like I hope not even though I like the taste of that is not bad it's just you know I'm kind of like all right kind of taste something different so was the first time you tried buddy's cars only like five four or five months ago so I've had it before they definitely run out quick these cartridge types the they go out quick turn it off we're gonna take a blinker so they don't last as usual as long as like a water and probably like a short like a day or two earlier it would run out on me but cheers boys popping a session below what you guys just smoking up let us know man always keep us updated to keep us in the mix we want to know man you know I saw some strains you guys are commenting on the other day kind of forgot honestly all the names oh well that's a hitter and yes the cartridge hits and apparently it says these are ceramic coil carts as well so that's a that's probably why it tastes very very much it's a tasty experience that's probably like looking resort so a real stoner high then this is the wood good starter huh just good tastes good it doesn't taste like the light like like an OG Kush it is alien Kush you know so it definitely has the more flour taste and then the more citrusy taste that you would generally get from sativas or everything else on the market you know saying but that was a good hair right yeah excuse me boys let me take another hit and we're probably gonna call it a video after he gets another hit and he's gonna do a blinker no blinker I got not beat so hot from the room that had a good level huh just so you guys don't think don't believe me with the 3250 program I'm gonna show you it's a dirty price huh for live resin that's a very good price and you know this this video is not gonna come out until like a week or two so I don't know if they're still gonna have it but I will show you the proof right now just so you guys believe me and it's not all talk you might make the drive from where you're at just to get like you know she's in product yeah so 32:54 the alien cushion 30 to 50 for the blue skittles as well so cheering yeah but yes stay tuned we're also gonna be doing another video with money I know you guys have been requesting money or aka be cheapened because he can take fat hits that hits the ones that you like to see you know I'm saying like he will take those packets and yeah my homie don't give a [ __ ] so I'm gonna take one more hit how do you like this cartridge so far 8250 would you buy it and consider buying it for 30 to 50 yes I would anything higher than that probably not it was more than 40 I probably not go ahead and buy a cart unless I know it was beating some fire I'm saying this is I don't know definitely it you can spend basically happy oh yeah you can split that in half in at 2 grabs with some wax spend another $3 each you know on each one you get some decent good wax yeah but as a cartridge person once again he's getting price on the cartridge yeah I'd buy it for that price that's a good-ass price on the it for grams - that's not you're spending like half a gram sometimes almost at same price for even just a little less so that already tells you that's a good purchase you know yeah yeah definitely what's go in and buy something like that if I was looking to buy a car okay that's good to hear we are gonna end the video here guys hopefully you enjoyed it subscribe all that good stuff like the video if you enjoyed it subscribe to rj eats and see you guys the next one [Music]", "PK_cYGetw_Y": "[Music] we're back with the new review today I have bank beeps sunset sherbert look at that holographic purpl dings babe sign front top bottom see so look at that these are the 2019 boxes guys this is what y'all should be getting if y'all are buying thank babe still look at that think base official account all organic no propylene glycol box is a little messed up I've been having it around on a rubber band but look at this bumpy the name as well plus well you should be feeling like these little little images there looks like little Suns on the back look at that as well as the name is bumpy this one is ninety two point fifty percent THC see how it is it does say that it's a it's a red donut Girl Scout cookie parent so this has something to do with Girl Scout cookies probably came off of that same strain it doesn't say if it's the end of course at IVA look at that look at that beautiful oil let's disable at the bottom round tip Plasti Dip at the top if it doesn't have a seat guys I've said this before my older videos it's already being used I also have noticed that the carts should come almost completely full like this one is literally almost completely full it's just that little bubble so if they aren't almost completely full they've probably already been baked on feels a little tip somebody gave me take the seal from the bottom as a seesaw caper Kush and a seeing five to eight number might not catch it on there if yours doesn't have a CA serial number it is fake don't even smoke it don't even vape it when you're about to buy them if you have the opportunity they give you the bucks before you pay for it check it to make sure you're buying the right thing as well as the oil the oil should not be dark it should be looking just like this look at that you can almost see through it I'm still burning these on my battery that whose battery has been marvelous ever since I got it vision spinner didn't do so well soon give him out I give him props for this let's let's dry hit at first all right it's citrusy as hell it literally has from the giant hit and literally has a flavour of grapefruit orange unlike a light pineapple flavor but it's it's taste delicious I wonder how it hits let's see how it is that was a pretty strong hit right off the bat guys it does have I do taste grapefruits it's like a kind of like good like a citrus slushie of like fruits in it which are kind of sour and sweet at the same time so I will definitely say it has orange grapefruit and like a pineapple flavor to it and probably like raspberries in it it is really good though cuz if you look at the image it is kind of like a slushie but it is freakin delicious they kind of set on the back it would have like a candy flavor or smell I don't know about the candy flavor on it it's literally just sour fruits but sweet and sour fruits that are in here in my perspective but they're freaking delicious to see the second I'm already feeling kind of hi guys the first hit actually got me a little bit let's see all right for 92% 92.5 percent is actually pretty strong guys I'm baked my eyes are really low my chest my bad if you ain't choking you ain't smokin but my chest feels really heavy after that second hit I almost made me cry a little bit but definitely high as hell like I'm high it's a really good high as mainly for me like a head high like I really I feel my head pretty heavy right now as well as my eyes and I feel like I'll keep coming down and then I'll go for my head high so like a body high so if you sit down and play video games you'll be slumped literally faint babes they're doing their thing guys if you get them try them if you see this flavor definitely recommend it cuz the flavor for me guys 10 out of 10 it's better than the tangi the tangi was a little bit too much orange this one is like more than just oranges in it so it's better to me in my opinion the high on it definitely ten out of ten guys unbaked like it's strong for 92% if you like I said guys there is a lot of flavors out there but as well there is a lot of counterfeits you might as well keep looking keep looking for the right ones spot out the fakes like everything I've told y'all before it is true look out for all of it and stay tuned guys I will be out with more [Music]", "H_oZqqt0tbE": "[Music] [Music] went out without without you know what we doing tonight Pineapple Express ooh

good stuff ain't you some bad stuff but let me tell you like this they never ever ever ever ever in the history of presidents never let me tell you again never in the history of presidents has there ever been a president that everyone liked so don't don't think that's gonna [ __ ] ever happen imagine the shock an entity somebody did it like them straight up you gotta keep that in your mind people need to stop thinking that all this [ __ ] is new this a man the only thing that is new is that everybody could be heard that's the only thing that's new that's why it seems like there's so much anger or so much hate extra going on no it's not that there's extras that everybody has a microphone now so they're gonna be [ __ ] hurt but [Music] you crazy if you think of everybody like Obama are you crazy you know how many racist people are in America couldn't stand a man he was one of the most hated presidents ever it man cost so much slack that [ __ ] was crazy [ __ ] Lincoln freed the slaves and they still shot that [ __ ] in the back of the head alright Isaiah yeah man think about it there has never been a president that everyone liked it just nah but she ain't gonna exist you gonna make everybody happy [Music] there's no way [Music] he said the white man that the rich man let me tell you that that whole white man black man everything all that that's all an illusion that's how an illusion that she was created to keep rich people rich and poor people poor only poor people argue about color and race rich people don't argue about this without Zen yeah I chased [Music] let me explain to you why let me explain to you why first of all Steve I understand white and black the fight between white and black was created as an illusion you know it's an illusion because white is not a racist black is not a race so for two people that hate each other there are white and black 11 an illusion there's no such thing both things do not exist none of them exist it's not a thing not real it doesn't exist it's an illusion there is no white and there is no black everybody has a country everybody has a place where they're from all white people are separated into many many many varieties of different whites from all over the place there are super light-skinned blue-eyed Spanish people everywhere so it's never been about light-skinned or dark skins or your hair or none of that [ __ ] it's an illusion to make you believe that that exists and that you should hate it it's not even real it's an illusion it's fake none of that [ __ ] is real [Music] now don't get me wrong I don't want you to think that I'm against races because I think that we all should believe in our own race and we should all believe in our own culture and we should all understand where we come from and who we are I don't believe in that whole we're all humans and we're all the same that is [ __ ] do not ever believe that we are not all the same that is a [ __ ] false reality if you think that [ __ ] we are not all the same we are the same parts we're not all the same and it's our differences that make us beautiful that's what makes us amazing that's what makes us incredible to look at to each other because you are different and than me so it makes things exciting to see the differences but the minute you start to believe that we're all the same you start to lose focus of what we truly are who we truly are you lose all that [ __ ] don't lose that Jeff poster is what separates us but that separation is good it's not a bad thing we were taught to believe that separate is bad and that we should all be one look at all the problems we have today and it's because the average person doesn't even understand their own culture their own being their own place on this planet they're trying to live in this makeshift created digital world not even real what up Anthony no weed makes you think wheat is knowledge because it makes you think we smoke a man we discuss some things so that's all a false reality but you have to embrace your coach your friends you have to know where you're from know your people know who your original people are know their stories just to make you a much stronger human being on earth to know that stuff not to just be alive and be like oh you know um don't I don't consider myself a race I'm just a person you're the your what does that even mean like what do you mean then what do you mean you're nothing you're you're a flake of nature you don't even exist you're just a a piece of the wind just passing by you're attached to nothing you matter nowhere you know I'm saying attach this up to a to a culture attach yourself to a people be something you know be part of something gigantic [Music] yes it's okay to dislike there's no problem to not like something or to not like people or to not like whether you know it's no problem that's not an issue the problem is people acting violently according to their dislikes that's a problem but there's nope it shouldn't be a problem for someone to say I'm not interested in that I don't like it at all and I'm not with it and that should be okay as long as that person that is that is not acting violent towards those other people it should be alright but the problem is the violent part people think that they should act violent towards [ __ ] that they don't like that's the crazy [ __ ] [Music] I should be able to say oh no no no no no I don't know no I don't like that I don't like that at all and everybody should be like hey that guy doesn't like this hey that's okay but in today's day if you say no no no no no no no I don't like that get that away from me people will lose their [ __ ] you'll be [ __ ] up you are forced to like everything even if you don't like it you have to openly say I like that I'm cool with that because if you don't say that you're gonna get [ __ ] crucified on [ __ ] all over the world your life could come to an end tonight just by saying no I don't like that [ __ ] man you got to live for the moment but understand your path to your patch is part of a concession of us a billion zillion moments so don't lose your identity on the fact that you're enjoying the moment gotta love the moment yes but understanding yes you're a part of a grand scheme of things so always pay attention to the big picture never forget that there there are other people around you live life how you want to but don't be a dick you know nobody knows how big the universe is it's impossible to mathematically equate some people so they can sound smart they answer that question and they say this is how big we think the universe is the [ __ ] out here you know who knows what the universe even is we have no idea what the [ __ ] universe even is nobody knows what the [ __ ] it is we just know that there are planets there are solar system there are stars there's a bunch of [ __ ] all there but nobody knows what it all is together what what is it why is it there what's it here for what's it doing no one knows yeah I'm trying to tell you I was talking about that before drive where I mentioned that um maybe that that's a big possibility on why aliens don't [ __ ] uh communicate with us maybe they don't even acknowledge us as smart or is something that should be communicated with maybe they're just walking by us the way you walk by a squirrel every day was the last time you saw a squirrel and felt the need to have a conversation with it when was the last time you saw an ant and tried to intelligently contact the ant when was the last time you sat in front of a big-ass pile of ants and try to communicate with it you don't do that why because you know that the minute you try to communicate with those ants those ants are gonna [ __ ] you up with no hesitation maybe that's how aliens view Earthlings and they're like that you don't don't [ __ ] touch those like your mom would tell you you go to the park don't don't touch those red ants they'll [ __ ] you up maybe all aliens are taught that [ __ ] don't don't don't touch humans don't you [ __ ] try to communicate with humans they will [ __ ] you up are you crazy you're tripping don't you touch one of those [ __ ] humans ain't nasty but if that's the case what if we're all afraid for nothing the same way ants are afraid of for nothing you know just like bees yeah if you go to a bee's nest you can mean no harm all you want to do let's say let's say you intelligently wanted to walk over to the business with no intentions of harm at all and you wanted your best to try to communicate with the bees no my friend no that is not gonna pan out well not at all within seconds you will be swarmed and devoured by thousands of [ __ ] bees and they would [ __ ] you up so bad so bad so maybe aliens feel the same way about humans maybe they just passed by like don't you know don't you [ __ ] touch those things ooh those things are sharp they'll [ __ ] you up so fast and like mom can I take one home no no no no don't do that they'll send a whole bunch more looking for it in their [ __ ] saw look don't you [ __ ] bring that type of drama through my [ __ ] house you better leave that thing right there and now picture this right picture yourself as a child and you see you see a little lizard right you see a little lizard or a turtle or something that you consider to be a cute animal and you grab this lizard and you pick it up and you examine the lizard and you check it out and you might hold onto it for a while you might put it into a box you might [ __ ] take it home with you and show it to a whole bunch of [ __ ] friends there's a little lizard right there's a little lizard and it's in your box and you're showing it to the world and you're keeping it as a pet for a little bit and maybe before you go home tonight maybe your mom says to you what's in that box and you're like nothing and she's like what in the box and you're like nothing she's like let me see and you show her she sees the lizard she says put that thing [ __ ] back where you found it right so you take the lizard where you found it and you drop it off sad and you go back home now did it ever cross your mind how did that affect that lizard is that lizard now going around to his lizard buddies talking about aliens took me they took me with them they probed me they checked me out they did a bunch of [ __ ] and they brought me back maybe maybe not yes it could be just that simple it could be that simple why aliens don't communicate with humans why do we see them in the sky why do we see signs of their existence but why don't they communicate with humans maybe for the same reason you're walking through a [ __ ] you walking through the woods you will not try to communicate with a pack of wolves what are your chances that that conversation with that pack of wolves is gonna work out well what are the chances not much as a matter of fact it's probably so close to zero it's astonishing think about it like this what would ants need to do to get your attention what would ants need to do to get your attention so that you can say wait a minute they deserve to be communicated with and how long after understanding that they're intelligent do you treat them as an equal when do you start treating ants as your equal just because they can communicate with you now you know yeah but do you still treat them as equals just because they could spell out letters what would they need to do to gain your respect besides going to war and taking their respect what would they need to do [Music] if ants I'm gonna tell you right now if ants were any bigger we'd be [ __ ] I'm trying to tell you if if ants were the size of let's say not even let's say cats if ants we're the size of cats humans most likely won't even exist the evaporation of humans would probably happen overnight yup if ants were the size of mice you have fire ants the size of mice dumb [ __ ] would destroy the planet overnight there's something like four I could be wrong a hundred percent but it is something like four million ants to every person yeah yeah it'll be it'll be catastrophic you know humans ain't that crazy humans ain't that crazy we're not that far off we've only got several hundred years of real serious technical technological you know advancements the rest of the thousands of years have been human advancements you'd wake up cants would carry you away in a heartbeat you see people being carry carried away by ants everywhere that's beside the point you know the point is about that about communication you know even even if you see strength even if you see intelligence even if you see signs of real life titled intelligent life at what point do you feel that they're your equals so you can communicate with them we do acknowledge that there are a lot of really really intelligent animals on this planet we still kill them the [ __ ] off with no problem so at what point do you recognize them as equals so that they could live harmonically you know [Music] all right George art Oh baby please yeah man that's the craziness the craziness is that scientists if you look at scientists this is the problem I'm gonna tell you what the problem is with scientists that that talk about subjects like this online and on TV you know documentaries you know the huge problem with these scientists is that they always always always give aliens human intelligence you know when these people talk about aliens they always think that aliens think the way we think that they do things the way we do things so that's why a lot of things to them don't make sense because they feel that they answer everything in the sense that in the way that human would do stuff so this is why a lot of scientists don't have any understanding of [ __ ] like that because they always always always think aliens are going to have the same type of intelligence and understandings that we have and that's not true at all they can have a different viewpoint of everything and not even look at us the way we're looking at things right now they can look at us as whatever you know who knows who knows what their viewpoint and their understandings are maybe they have no need to communicate the way we do we have a need to communicate and talk and you know balance ourselves with others but maybe they don't maybe they have no [ __ ] need to communicate with us at all they just do [ __ ] around us with no thought about us we don't even across their mind that's I'm trying to tell you like the same way you walk by pigeons on the street the same way you walk by a cat you care about like you're just gonna keep walking there's somebody Blake did you see that cat over there like okay exactly didn't even cross your mind that there was a [ __ ] cave in this yeah it's creepy when you think about it you can get real weird we're doing all this work and all this hard work to get their attention and maybe they give a [ __ ] about our attention a Thea's waving what I've soaked sucker life what's going on man we discussing weird [ __ ] that's all with huge nug ooh just talking that [ __ ] late night you know talk about aliens and stuff soccer what's up man you believe in aliens you believe in aliens bro yeah we just did we just did some of this right here havoc look you better start believing [ __ ] you better start believing [ __ ] aliens

beings that have existed on this planet long before humans where ever that the number one creature on the planet so with that being said depends on how you study your history and how you're looking to the past you'll find out what's real what's not it's easy to find out what's real wasn't that [Music] [Music] [ __ ] imagine dinosaurs are still around some people believe that there are many forms of

this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "a2vpcPbQWdg": "hello RSO SOS here and today felt like the first time ever let's go

"[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you

today you're definitely gonna want to check the it out today I'm smoking on sunset sherbert coming up I'm strains and this is strands of the bay if you're new here I review strands around the bay area as well as other cannabis and non cannabis related content my non cannabis related content will be in my new channel which I'll link also down below please follow that I haven't put anything up there yet I've been a little busy backed up so just be a little bit patient with me and there'll be some new stuff on there real soon appreciate that and you should also subscribe to this channel as well so hit that Bell button to be notified every time I release a new video our goal with this video as with all my videos is 15 lengths which i think is very possible so you can go ahead and do that now or whenever you feel like it hey at any point in the video check out my links and show notes down in the description anything I forgot to mention as well as any extra things I wanted to show you will be linked down there so go ahead and check that out just cool down there now back to it actually I just want to start off the video by saying I did not actually purchase this but myself again this was another one that was given to me I'm not gonna tell you exactly how much but this was given to me by my boy Freddy down at Secret Circle so if you are in the Freemont Union City area go ahead and check him out he has really cool stuff I've been coming to him now for about two months and I don't really like to travel around and go to new people if I have a really good dealer already so that's what Freddy is along with 3 p.m. and the others that I'm gonna be showing you in the upcoming videos so just be on the lookout for that this is a indica heavy hybrid with incredibly strong and potent effects this particular strain has a really strong lineage starting off with the Finn Girl Scout cookies parents whose ancestors are OG Kush cherry pie Durbin poison and crossed with another indica called pink panties expect some full-bodied effects when taking this along with a nice head buzz and some kick of energy from the sativa it smells incredibly sweet and fruity almost like fruity loops or fruit loops almost exactly like fruit loops actually very creamy sweet and fruity like I said so tension stress and bad moods will be alleviated almost instantly with this awesome hybrid you basically give about anything though some of the effects you could be expecting a feel on this strain are relaxed happy euphoric uplifted and creative some medical are for stress depression pain insomnia and lack of appetite so and some negatives are some dry mouth dry eyes dizziness anxiousness and paranoia so make sure not to take too much because like I said this is a really really really strong strain it's an exotic strain so it's not to be taken lightly and the flavors you can expect to taste from this are sweet citrus and earthy alright so I'm just gonna grind it up for you guys real quick and we'll get the smell test going on from there alright so I'm just gonna start the smell test and hey if any other dispensaries or delivery services here around the Bay Area are interested in me doing some videos for them please hit me up at strands of the bay at gmail.com and I'll definitely respond to you as soon as I can so if you guys can see just that much there you go not too much so we'll grind it up and give it a smell test alright guys since I grinded it up we're gonna do a quick smell test so let's smell it goddang guys the smells a lot more potent than it smelled when it was not grinded up when it was not grounded up it was very sweet like I said more like fruit loopy cereal but now that gassy og is really penetrating through and is actually in the forefront of all the smells so very og very gassy awesome smell one of the best smelling ones I've probably smelled in a while it's the point of the video where you should pull out whatever you have if it's a blunt the joint a bong a pipe whatever you got go ahead and pull that out so we can hit this together I'm just gonna go set this up this is actually still ash there's ash from the previous video so I'll just blow it out and I'll fill this up we had the sunset sherbert and we'll try it out usually when I do my strand reviews I tested it beforehand but this one I have not tested yet so we are gonna see how strong it is together but I do trust Freddie as I picked up from him before other stuff always good all right guys Cheers all right guys I'm gonna start the timer as for the flavor very very strong OG DS Lagasse type of flavor which is my favorite flavor it actually reminds me a lot of ghost OG which is a strain I had a few years ago but haven't touched in a while it was another one of my favorite early on strains but yeah very OG I'm thirty seconds in and I could start it start to feel it up here in my head so I guess that's a t4 kicks in pretty quickly but I could feel it starting to creep down towards the rest of my body not yet in my arms yet but it's coming down so I think the indica effects are kind of kicking real soon so I'll catch you guys in a little bit and I'll check it in a few alright guys it's about a minute 25 in and the effects are still slowly coming down but it's mostly in my head for right now well yeah I'm pretty relaxed I don't think I'd be able to hold a pretty good conversation so if you got something important to talk about or you've got a presentation or I don't know anything like that I would suggest not to do this one because this one will kind of mess you up a little bit but it does feel nice this is really good at the end of the day or if you are feeling any kind of pain from whatever issue you guys have this is one to take guys in terms of my Highness level I'd say I'm about at a nine out of ten and it's only been two and a half minutes so it could still climb up I'm pretty good right now but again I just want to let you guys know where I got this from this is in the Union City and Fremont area you could hit my boy Freddie up at Secret Circle check all of it out I'll link everything down below his number is gonna be down below as well he's a cool dude I'm gonna do more work with him so be on the lookout for that and again I'm always gonna plug this if any dispensaries or delivery services around the Bay Area want to do some work please hit me at my gmail at strains of the bay at gmail.com I'll link that down below as well I got more strains for more companies coming up real soon guys we're really starting to get somewhere with this channel thank you guys for rockin with me I'm actually gonna do some shout outs real quick alright guys actually before I do the shout outs I'll do one more check in it's actually eight minutes and ten seconds into it now so I feel like it's fully set in I'm really really really really lifted but I was saying earlier that you couldn't talk on and I think you could actually hold a conversation and do pier to day activities with this but I am super lit so unless you are a veteran and you can control that I don't suggest you take this during the daytime but it is possible because I feel good I feel like I could do stuff but like at the same time like I said I'm super lit so alright so back to the shoutouts the guys stuff for the shoutouts I'm just gonna shout out your names cuz you guys rock with me and you guys comment on almost pretty much every video and I really appreciate that I see you guys so shout out to day at night o g4 you're like one of the

your boy never not medicated you can call me mr clean if y'all are watching this on instagram check out that youtube if you're watching this on youtube peep the insta now we have a new brand today that i saw in my local dispensary and i was like i want to try that out they look interesting so here it is it is cresco never heard of them i don't know anything about them so uh let's get into it this liquid live resin rest indica i believe each uh strain has their own so like indica sativa or hybrid has their own name or whatever like a lot so like cannabis derived terpenes is a line so their lines are like indica is called rest all the indica cards say rest on them anyway so this is the lime sorbet coming in at you can't see but it is 73.4 percent it's just funny they give the [ __ ] thousands thousandths place for the [ __ ] i don't need that you know give me the hundredths anyway and at the bottom it has a nice little uh two things that will come in handy in a little bit so anyway so we push these in the back and then we pull from the sides pretty interesting way to do it and here is where it gets interesting this what can it there we go this little pamphlet if you open it up as you can see it matches with two of the things on here now that is the discovering our terpenes section which i thought was pretty interesting so it says that the terpenes here are clove slash herbal and floral slash pine when i think of floral i think of flowers so i don't i don't know either way here's the cart right as we pull it out right so anyway that's that's the whole thing about that 73 liquid live resin lime sorbet let's get into it pull it out here's the cresco cart pretty nice right i've been chiefing on it a little bit however i will say it did come with a decently big bubble i can't cap there it says cresco and there it says rest now as you can see it is dark we're going to take the cap off and we're throwing this on our superb battery because the superb battery milks and i've tried it with this cart as you as i said i have been smoking it a little bit and this [ __ ] [ __ ] milks the liquid live resin for stizzy to be honest some of the airflow through that is kind of bad so it's it's not as milky for tricks but this [ __ ] milks like this i've been chiefing i i haven't had too much like i said there was a fat bubble so it only came like it didn't come too full it was like to to there maybe but anyway let's get right into it lime sorbet let's get a [ __ ] thumbnail crisco y'all never tried them thought i wanted i wanted to not thought i wanted to thought i'd try him out so yeah cheers that was a bad first ghost i'm sorry for that however right off the bat you get a very not intense but i will say it's a very obvious taste you get of course the live resin taste you get that bud but you get a lime for sure you get a lime and a pine taste very different type of taste it kind of gives me a uh the lime and pine mix kind of reminds me of a cannabis derived terpenes uh cartridge or pod taste so that's a little bit interesting how the the combination of flavors causes for it to taste like a whole different type of anyway so yeah it it definitely i definitely taste the lime i don't know so much about the sorbet obviously that's the strain you're not gonna [ __ ] you know they just named it what sounded good it's not i'm rambling out of my [ __ ] cheeks right now anyway so with the lime sorbet it is a nice taste you definitely taste the lime it's definitely like a lemon lime though it's not like it's more it's got the the lime taste to it but it also has the sour hints you know so very nice though tastes like bud of course because it's live resin right now all the air is kind of rising in my room for some reason i don't know why but it's causing my ghost to be ass but like i said the cresco is when i when i first ripped it and put it on my superb battery i was like wow this [ __ ] is milking usually live resins i don't know it it does they don't tend to milk as much maybe it's airflow on all the live resin products but with most of the live resin different companies that i've had a lot of their stuff doesn't milk but of course it gives clouds it just doesn't like ball up to milk you know but i'm definitely feeling the cresco high already the live resin it is setting in which is surprising because usually from for uh like stizzy live resin it takes a little bit longer um but i feel like this one doesn't take that long you know which is nice i don't care either way i'm not i don't mind waiting you know it doesn't bother me but some people do some people want it instant like [ __ ] nicotine you know when you rip it you're oh [ __ ] nah i don't care the problem with these carts i will say it's not actually a problem but the the chamber is so big that the all that smoke you know when i as soon as i get my mouth off the tip all the smoke already is leaving i'm like no while i'm doing my ghost it's already leaving so i only get a little bit left um it's the live resin is super smooth i will say it is a bit harsh on the throat at points but it's all together it is it's very clean very nice i'm not like coughing it's well i could but i don't i more just have a dry throat the dogs anyway ignore my dog however so basically the high i'm getting from this is very intense uh eyes it's a severe indica eye high my eyes are super low-key they're super uh down to the ground and i'm like you know it's relaxing it's super nice but it's it's mostly intense why is she still going it's mostly intense on uh the eyes which i kind of like you know for the most part highs don't alter me too much you know like i can tell a high from a different high but they don't you know i'm not like out of my mind you know so when i get a nice like eye high i don't know it just feels different i like that i like the eye altering as you can see definitely milking but sad about that bubble that it came with if you've been following along you probably see originally that it came with a big bubble but bubble butt i didn't mean to say that but yeah cresco live resin if they're by you they're good i honestly like them you know i don't know if all of them come with a big bubble like i said this is my first time having them first time even hearing about them i i just saw them i was like interesting you know but i like the back push i think why isn't it working now i think it's cool you know back push instead of a side and i like the little terpene provider you know it's a nice little uh little uh trinket anyway so yeah this was lime sorbet liquid live resin from cresco hope you all enjoyed hope y'all were able to chief along if you don't have anything i'm sorry y'all you'll get some soon but if you do have stuff hope y'all were enjoying it with me if you see cresco check them out cheers by the way this is not sponsored last rip cheers all right enjoy i mean like the rest of your day or whatever cheers", "ey2F0xpp6o8": "hey what's up guys so today i'm coming at you guys another video today and today we're going to get justin what's good what's good and today we're going to be

hanging out with me hey i", "Gi2TBSQqFCE": "what's up YouTube MX Crower I'm gonna do a strain review this is some sunset sherbert I picked up from Queen Wolf LA it is grown by jungle boys you can check them on Instagram I smoked this strain before it's a really good strain it's really pretty it's got some purple actually a lot of purple really good track homes you can see it's pretty frosty it tastes really good actually to me it tastes just like it smells really clean kind of milky the smoke in a way I get culture mouth it's really really good the high is not super intense like the indica I would say it's 50/50 not too much in the gun not too much sativa it smells really good actually really really good sometimes you open the case there's a little container as you see right there jungle voice sunset sherbert what else can I say it has really good appeal orange hairs almost like a form cut Girl Scout cookies what else can I say yeah the high is pretty good it's a maybe one to two hour high which is not bad I really love the taste of it it's actually one of the tastiest strains I've had a really long time it's really smooth it's not harsh at all it's really clean and yeah it's a really pretty flower really really nice ring I love it I wouldn't mind smoking this for a long time and it's just overall good strain jungle boys they're doing it really really good always clean white ash I smoked a couple other strains from green wolf and everything that has jungle boys on it it's really smooth I can't complain really good bag appeal and it's worth it a check to get this training smoke it I've seen a couple guys on YouTube grow it seems like a really good producer not very high I don't know how we would do outdoor but at least indoor it looks really good would love to do this outdoor hopefully yeah oh just a couple close-up of this check it out yeah it's really really nice nice and purple dark green not that much lime green this looks like more of a darker green forest green almost and then that dark purple it's not super black as you can tell you can still see a lot of green but the purple is there and you could it does have that purple taste that dark almost great bass type of taste but I don't know it's kind of hard to explain this it's kind of earthy but somewhat sweet very smooth and it just coats your mouth I mean it tastes just like it smells it's great yeah you guys got a chance you know check out green wolf they've got coming pretty good strings yeah try this one out see you later guys", "Z9fwd6H83FY": "yo what's up you two is your boy

"HjaBD4Xbib0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "gA_u309IDA8": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing an avatar or avitas cured resin a cartridge all avatars as far as i know are single origin extracts and they make um distillates cured resin and live resin carts and pax pods as well so they're super high and super high quality from what i've seen so i haven't tried one before just do the price tag but i've been wanting to try one for a while so here's here it is and i'll give you a close-up and then try it out and let you know what i think [Music] let's try this thing out and read it um talk about it so forth so this is made by avatars which as i said seems to be a pretty high-end brand i've wanted to try them for some time um the strain is cherry og which i looked into it seems to be a mix of cherry thai afghan and lost coast og which all seem to be pretty old strains so this might be a fairly old strain as well this is single origin hybrid cured resin meaning it all comes from same grow of cherry og you're not getting a bunch of different growers people's cherry og so that adds to the price tag of these carts that's pretty exciting though uh that just makes you feel that much safer with what you're getting and know this proper um the strain and everything about it really it is cured resin i opted for cured resin over live resin because i'm actually one of the probably one of the few people who i think i like cured resin more than um lime resin i like i feel like generally a more complex taste and it has more more terpenes that live resin is usually overshadowed by like beta miracin pint um limonene a couple others like that where some of the heavier ones seem to stick around in the curing process and get more interesting ones so anyways um very nice looking packaging as you can see very sharp um these are i think 40 recreationally um i got mine i think it was like that'd be like 32 med and then i got 25 off that bringing it down to like i don't know what uh eight dollars off that twenty four dollars or so i know it's like 36 for the live resin then a little cheaper than both of these for they also have ultra which i think are distillate carts all of them are single source they're all a little pricey they all look really good so that's probably part of it oh okay let's get on the back first on the back you got cherry og one gram thc coming in at 82.3 percent or 823 milligrams for a container cbd is at loq um you've got 10 total terpenes in this and um okay and then you got thirty percent of that ten percent is beta cardiophiline i guess i'll just say that um what it is of the total thing it should be three percent beta cardiophiline one point nine percent selenidine one point one percent pinene one percent limonene one percent cedrol c-e-d-r-o-l i'm not familiar with that one that's exciting um nine point zero point nine percent humulene zero point six percent alpha cedrine and then alph um zero point five percent alpha terpenial so as you can see pretty complex and also a lot more terps that you don't really see so often oh weird anyways that's someone going down the street that's cool so this was made on what is seven um march april may june okay july i'm terrible with months sorry this was made on july 13th 2020 and tested on july 15th a little bit older than the other cards i've been getting but still not old at all really in the in cards i start wearing one they're about like a year older um you got light scale labs report id they even have the report id on here so you can look up their um lab reports how cool is that um and then they got the uid so you got everything there all the general info a lot of info on the terpenes which i like and potentially more if you look at light scale labs who they run a lot of tests or a test for a lot of companies around here a lot of the good ones especially i see use light scale labs and some lower end ones we'll use rose city but i don't think there's any real like correlation uh i think it's just a lot of lower end companies have a lot of like lines and brands like mana and lovely and um a lot of things like that so they probably just use the same people usually all right so when you open this up you got this which is super cool i probably should have showed you a close-up but i'll take a picture of it and post it in here too um let's see if focusing helps at all not too much but that's all right so what it says says avatars natural additive and flavoring free no pg vg or peg which is um okay i don't know i just uh don't remember the what that stands for but it's often used in vape vape juices and whatnot that says for best results store upright at 65 to 75 fahrenheit ensure the battery is fully charged for best taste use a 3.7 volt battery not recommended for refilling okay um and then you got same stuff but in like a little picture form got full battery 3.7 volts i think that's just the cart with a little up arrow saying store it up right and then at 65 to 75 degrees fahrenheit and then you also get this interesting thing definitely will know if you ever got a fake if anyone tried to fake these because these are pretty intricate little packages so you got that which kind of holds it up oh wow i'm gonna have to use scissors which luckily i have some right by yeah it looks like you gotta use scissors to open this there's really no easy way to open that might be able to find a way but i don't really see the need to so i'll just slice that and here you are really beautiful oil in there very very clean looking i know nothing wants to focus on this but that's alright and i'll take that sticker off like i always do very nice looking looks vaguely cloudy on the camera but it doesn't look like that in real life it's very very clear so again you get a jupiter c cell high quality c c-cell very no leaks or anything like that so all good jupiter is always fitting my vessel jupiter's fitting everything i swear those are some of the best cartridges you can get all right so it says for best results 3.7 volts which i'm 99 sure is going to be the um the middle setting on my vessel so let's try this out cherry og beautiful vapor production as usual with jupiter c cells that taste is so good damn that is a good good card right there it's already one of my favorites right now that's so good just an effect on everything so far or we'll see about effects i mean but like taste and vapor production that's smooth in the lungs and everything wow that is a solid cart high quality right there these might be like my new favorites a little pricey so it's hard to grab them as often but that is seriously good so it's a pretty clear taste too that's when you get i guess i don't know if it's from like single origin or just the quality of the production or what but i mean i have no problem like getting a good taste off that very very much like you got a very like earthy taste to it i lean heavily for earthy on this one which is weird it says it's mostly cardio filling um let me get that yeah now it's kind of like a not not very spicy because all the other terps and i don't know if it being cured matters at all but it's not a very spicy but it's very like earthy not very herbal but like very earthy um and then you got some nice cherry undertones see where they get the cherry from um yes i'm just like sweet cherry tom um i would say cherry because like usually there is definitely like a berry taste i'm not quite sure what ter what terpene it is but there's definitely like a berry taste that cannabis can produce and it usually reminds me of blueberry or like rasp kind of like raspberry but it's definitely like a heavier berry like a blue or something like that but this one's a lot sweeter and like a light way so it definitely reminds me of cherry i mean you can just see the vapor production on that that is intense it's got it they got it dialed in for 3.7 volts for sure that smells so good too that just like very light cherry after like an herbal tone or i mean a earthy tone that's crazy how clear that is so you know i buy a lot of i don't buy like a lot of low end cards except for the hushes but i don't expect flavor from those but these are just a whole whole different level um i didn't think about it till afterwards but these i think 40 bucks wreck we're a half gram these are four grams but we're a half gram half rock hash rosin cards i think it's live hash rosin that goes for 45 so next time i'm gonna buy one of these i might just go for a half gram live rosin to really get the best cart because but otherwise i think solventless these are some of the best cards their live resin cards are probably incredible um but i prefer cured resin as i said all right i'm close this video out thanks for watching everybody thank you avatar for making beautiful beautiful oils and great extracts like and subscribe um click the notification i don't know if you can do that do all this stuff that generally subscribers tell you to do i mean youtubers tell subscribers to do thanks and have a great day", "XvwWP_7cE80": "hey everybody this is Ken eccentric films excited to be bringing you another video today from quarantine I'm losing my mind here a little bit but that's okay I'm sure most of us are but nevertheless I'm really excited to talk about this topic of what's in a strain name how much credibility is there how much of it is a marketing ploy and how much does genetic expression play into the differences in two strains that may share the same name but look completely different to me the accuracy of strain names is something that bore much less significance say seven to eight years ago than it does now and will continue to increase it only stands to increase I really can't see any other way about that with the further legalization of cannabis and perhaps the federal legalization of it throughout the United States following in Canada's footsteps since cannabis is history lies so heavily in the black market and hence there's a lack of regulation there it's really hard to know who propagated what strain you know to put it most simply it's very easy to imagine scenarios where black market distributors attached inaccurate names of more high-profile strains on flower they might have been trying to move to give it more of a bag appeal right so a lot of that is behind the inaccuracy and strain names but regardless of the past what I think is going to be a really effective thing for people moving forward is to be able to identify most accurately as possible the strains they wish to medicate with this will help people select certain phenotypes and breeding if they're crossing with completely accurate strain names and this will help companies market effective medicine I think better as well for me on a personal level I have several strains I've had recurring pick ups of different cuts of the same strain for example one is sunset sherbet that's how I'm gonna do my first video on here and hopefully in seeing the different batches I've gotten through time of the strain you'll see what there is or is not in a strain name and what differences do we notice what similarities what parallel phenotypic expressions do we see and what not it's a really interesting thing to look at so let's first take a look at a very legendary strain and sunset sherbet and one of my personal favorites that I've had multiple times so sunset sherbet is a cross of Girl Scout cookies and pink panties within those genetics if you look at the genealogy of this strain you'll see that there's a lot of legendary strains in the immediate ancestry for sunset sherbet and because of this a lot of breeders and cultivators who have done their own take on sunset sherbet have gotten very different results there's a lot of phenotypic variation and I've noticed that myself and the cuts of sunset sherbet I've gotten my hands on and been able to take footage of and you know been able to smell and check out the taste and the effects so to me like I said this is a really interesting thing to explore the differences in one strain that may share the name but in different cuts there's all kinds of different phenotypic expressions so let's check out some cases of this with this sunset sherbet strain so this very first video is the first sample of sunset sure but I ever got my hands on this was in Oregon and I want you to take note of the Orange pistols and yellowish complexion the second example you'll notice it also has orange pistols however this flower is much greener the nugs are a little more compact I would say and there's more vibrance to the trichomes they're a little bit shinier in general but like I said they do both have those bronze pistols very prevalent this third example you'll notice is a little bit yellow like that first example so they share that coloration these nugs were gigantic really massive colas and this but also had an extremely sweet smell I feel as though it probably had more of the Durbin poison genetics and its volatility of terpenes and flavor and yeah this is a picture of the same bud you'll notice those notes are absolutely massive and they still do have those vibrant orange bronze pistols and then this last example is probably my favorite overall cut of the sunset sherbet that I've come across you can see a really purple complexion to this one that may come from the Cherry Pie cush that is in the Girl Scout cookies medics it may come from pink panties really sweet coloration to this one however taste wise I would say I was much more comparable to the Girl Scout cookies cuts I've seen very doughy and it's odor but a sweet nose on top of that so it's definitely kind of that sunset sherbet smell a creamy sweet smelling absolutely gorgeous trichomes you break a khole of this open and it's really a nice gassy smell almost that kind of gelato Terp so really good smelling bud but across the board you see a lot of different phenotypic expression and these strains of sunset sherbet so hopefully that footage gives you a good indication that there is quite a wide array of phenotypic expression amongst what may be all named the same thing you know sunset sherbet lots of different cuts lots of different phenotypes given its ancestry so hopefully as I said with further legalization there will be more regulation with how genetics can be patented and all that kind of stuff hopefully the people that were the pioneers in the black market can find a way to get credit for the genetics they Fino hunted and you know found and sniffed out I genuinely believe they deserve that the interesting thing about all these different strains too is that they had different effects all these different cuts of Sunset sherbet some were more sativa dominant all were kind of hybridized I would say none were more pure indica or more pure sativa some though were more sativa dominant giving me more of a productive feeling more of an energetic boost while some were definitely heavier indica like that last example the more purple one was definitely heavier indica had more of the Girl Scout cookies genetics I would say in it overall but yeah guys that's about all I have to say today this is stuff I could talk about all day so shoot me a message if you want to discuss this further can shed light on any topics that I may be ignorant on because I know I'm no expert by any means I'm just really into this stuff and talking about it so let's keep the conversation going stay safe and stay sane y'all", "zKUs6gj3hF0": "okay everybody this is the cookies cookies burner certified cookies

try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "C8eucporxcE": "good morning it is unity marguerite and i am opening up sunset sherbert by pistol and paris this morning you'll probably notice i'm not in my usual location i am kind of in transition right now i am in the process of moving and um staying my uh covered bubbles home while i get everything sorted so it's going to be a fun next couple of months as you're going to see my location and background change frequently so enjoy the process with me um so sunset sherbert by pistol and paris so if you're asking yourself hey who's pistol in paris not a surprise pistol in paris is a brand new brand um in the canadian cannabis industry and uh from brand concept to launch of this flower it was one of the quickest or the quickest in canada so congratulations to the pistol and paris team um quite an undertaking and i believe they do have a really really small team so they don't have all of this like um stuff that was created before bringing a product to market so what this company is all about is essentially supporting micros those farmers and getting their products to market and they do a very fair pricing um thing so i believe that they pay them first and then bring their product to market and their prices are also really decent so for instance for this eighth um we are looking at an independent retail price about 44.55 so with the 12 tax that's 49.90 um maybe you had the citizen stash uh sunset sherbert so that one on the private retail side was 55 dollars and about 27 cents or 61.90 with tax so we're looking at like a 12 um end consumer price difference and that is reflected um from the wholesale price which um this is uh from a retailer point of view you are paying uh quite a bit less for this so um that's one reason and also to support this company it is a better end price for consumers as well as they do support farmers as well so that essentially means that they are like white labeling this product that's actually fairly common in the cannabis industry a lot of these um smaller farmers what we want to do is we want to support the farmers in you know just focusing on growing the product and then what you know pistol in paris does is they team up with joint venture joint venture craft cannabis they're based in salmon arm and so what they do is they take those bulk bags of weed um that have just been harvested dried and cured and trimmed and they take the bud and then they package it in these um tins so it's a very cool thing and then they ship these to the bcldb to be sold to the public so there's a need for everyone um in this process and it is a quite the process so this is um a three and a half grams uh nitrogen sealed for optimal freshness it was packaged on february 25th and it has a thc of 19 like 20 it saying is 19.7 so we can just round that up to 20. it's an indica dominant um the lineage is girl scout cookies and pink panties i really don't like saying the word panties kind of feels a little bit like sexual but celebi the older i get the more prude i get um so the origin of this cultivar is that's an indica dominant hybrid 85 indica 15 sativa is a potent cross between the girl scout cookies and pink panty strains um the family tree is that the sunset sherbert hails from an impressive lineage including its og kush cherry pie and durbin poison grandparents famous for flavor this flower boasts a uniquely sweetly citrus flavor profile thanks the dominant terpenes of carophyllene laminene and lena lull often described as sweet berry and creamy citrus sherbet followed by an earthy aftertaste the fruity undertones will linger and intensify as you exhale um so this the breeder is frabinsky's and you can go to their website and you can find out more about this um and currently i think in bc there's been three sunset sherbets available tantalus also just launched a sunset sherbert and as i said previously citizen stash had sunset sherbet um sunset sherbert for us the village bloomers always been very very popular so it's really nice to have a new brand um that is also grown in bc the moisture level on this is 11.9 and the total terpenes is 2.3 percent um so very cool so the limonene is 0.5 percent um this particular batch according to their coa myoscene is zero point three nine percent and caro filing is zero point three five percent so different from what i just said from the breeders website um so this is very exciting so let's open this up um i hope i have all my tools like i said i'm i'm traveling i would say i'm living out of a bag but i've been told to unpack my bag and once it's unpacked i'm not living out of a bag um oh gosh definitely not as smooth with this childproof packaging as i would like to be so here we have the um tin part you can see just like a tuna can tin um i think maybe this is the child proof part that was pretty hard to open and then um you just open it up like a tuna can so uh joint ventures they do hand packs you can see that they've done a nice job of adding some big buds in there with some small ones um which is something that we would really want to see um sorry i don't have my chopsticks i'm going to use my fingers um really really nice uh bounce back nerfy feel really sticky already can you guys see that i want to show you guys my fingers yeah so nice stuff let's weigh this first bud really nice color on here um so nice purple tones so this first bud weighs um 1.1 grams so that's a nice big size bud in there and these two next two look around the same so this bud is 0.6 grams so nice size buds and this bed here is 0.7 grams so those are the three biggest buds and to have one bud that's over a gram is really nice and then what we have left is some smaller ones but i really don't see any shake like this is the smallest bud and that's still like nice you know i would just say they've done a really good job this one doesn't even show up it's so small and it's weight um and then we have i guess two kind of three sizes so 0.4 grams for that one 0.2 grams for this one 0.2 grams again so really nice distribution of sizes um this is nice nice hand packing for sure um 0.2 grams again and then the second to smallest one is doesn't even register so the two smallest don't register the biggest one is 0 1.1 grams then we have 0.7 0.6 and then a few at 0.2 and then oops i forgot to put the smallest one back and [Music] and it comes in at exactly 3.5 grams so a really lovely um job at packaging all of these buds i don't know if you guys can see that so this is um really well good job at the bag appeal you want to kind of make sure you have a bit of everything just feels like a really fair um packaging and i like that i do admire that for sure um so as i was saying a really nice nerfy feel nice um you see the purple leaves and pistols let's do a um yeah nice crack there you can see the dry crack and really nice trichomes i don't have a microscope right now um but super nice so the moisture level is 11.1 this was packaged on march 25th today is i mean february 25th and today is march um 23rd is it so a month ago um i'm just holding up an empty 10. so that's good so we have a nice moisture level um they didn't put a bavita puck or anything in there and they didn't need to they've done a really really good job here i'm actually super impressed with this well done pistol and paris um super moist um nice scent so we get some skunky in there and some citrus and i guess sweet berries mmm god does smell really good really nice nose sticky buds this is really nice i'm excited and a really good price point so you're saying it's um with tax you can pay around 49.90 so 50 for an eighth um let's roll this up um first we have to grind it so i'm i'm i've had to really you know what i i really like camp sand and uh i've used this grinder a couple of times in the past and um i was really missing it a lot so i went and bought myself a hanson grinder i just love this grinder so freaking much it grinds so much and i love it um i'm gonna roll up you know quite a bit and actually one of the great things about the henson grinder is you can you can actually uh you can grind quite a bit and i am actually on the road today and so i want to maybe roll two joints for the road so i'm gonna grind enough for two joints there there's such a nice moisture level with this if you are someone who likes you know juicy nerfy nugs with a beautiful scent profile this quite possibly could be the cannabis for you um nothing dry about this at all nothing at all it's so nice so you can just see i'm loading my um i'm just loading my grinder up here my beautiful handsome grinder this is a canadian company out of ontario um they definitely do sort of like higher end accessories but you know if you're an everyday smoker or even a weekend smoker and you know you're an adult it's nice to treat ourselves to things that are nice like you know i think so much you know i think the stigma can still exist and you know maybe maybe you're still only spending 20 in a grinder but like go out and treat yourself this is honestly such a great grinder because once you grind it it stays in this chamber down here and it holds it so i can grind quite a bit at a time so i have put all my buds in here except for the largest two buds which are still here and let me show you again how nice this bud is can you see the purple hues there sorry i'm trying to get on the camera so just like a nice nice size this bud is 1.1 grams so well done i'm also not really i haven't gotten any sticks in here there's no shake um you know i got this stick here because i pulled the butt off of it but you know sometimes you'll kind of get the extras so well done with the packaging that's joint venture and they do hand packaging for a lot of companies um you'll see that they've also done this done karma so i haven't opened this one yet but anything that looks like this sort of tuna can and i guess this color is a joint venture uh packaging so that's something you might want to try out um usually when you go into a canvas store you won't know who the processor is um so that's good you know in small town bc salmon rm you want to support them so yeah you can kind of see that i'm struggling a bit with grinding this and that's because um it's really sticky which is i think it's a good thing i like sticky weed i don't know about you guys but i do like sticky weed so now you're kind of getting this nice smooth grind and then um with this grinder it just falls into this other chamber can you see yeah look at that look at all that beautiful weed oh and it's just so nice ground up it's not not dusty at all it's this is really good weed i'm so impressed actually wow and you know and like i said you haven't really heard about this brand because this is their first product to market i think the brand concept happened in the fall of 2020 um today or yesterday or this weekend was spring equinox um so they probably just came up with this idea just before winter solstice i guess so you know brand new company um launched you know concept happened in the winter i mean in the fall um launched in the winter and i'm opening it up in the spring so really excited about this so now we have all those nugs ground up and this is such a beautiful ground up material it's super moist super sticky beautiful scent my my my tray is really dusty okay and then i have my ace king roller my roller i love it so much so all i do is now take out this ground up material i'm going to put it in my roller and i'm going to roll up a joint and i'm going to do a dry pull and a tote so we can taste it really nice material to be working with this is probably gonna roll up really really nice it smells so good i wish um i wish i could share this scent with you all i think i think this is gonna be really good i'm really really excited and i'm really surprised not to you know not believe that this is going to be good but i opened up a lot of weed and this is really refreshing to have this good quality bud so i just got to make sure when i'm rolling it up that the weed kind of stays in that rolling part and then with this i always have to use uh big papers i'm still a fan of smoking silvers there's only one left craig from expert joints sold me on it and i love his work so much so very biased towards these papers anyone else out there missing expert joints i am such a great show you could watch it on youtube they did live feeds really really fun um really fun so he was like the pre-regulated market um sort of like fun journalists and you'd go on a show and get super high okay see like that nice nice joint let's do the dry pull um super tasty super super tasty really vibrant taste and flavor in the dry pull um let's light this up and see how it burns so this is pistol and paris sunset shorebird um available in bc only uh it retails for with tax um about 49.90 i work for the village bloomery and so i did pick mine up there and it's delicious [Music] um because of moisture level it doesn't it's not burning super fast which is nice i'm seeing some nice white ash there um i was like oh no i forgot to bring an ashtray but look where i'm staying they have this wonderful little like cute little scottish soldier ashtray how adorable is that nice nice slow burn um it is burning quite slowly but you can see that it's got white ash so that's really really nice um it's burning really smoothly you can see that and it's burning really slowly which is really nice hmm so yeah you're getting a really really nice ash and a nice smooth burn well done pistol and paris so my name is unity marguerite and i am trying the pistol in paris sunset sherbert um available in bc it's an eighth it was packaged on february 25th and it's 19.7 thc and 11.9 moisture level really fantastic product um pretty limited because it does come from i believe a micro producer or craft producer um somebody that is definitely operating with um less rooms and smaller rooms um really really fantastic nice smooth burn as you can see nice nice ash really like this product i definitely recommend it um clearly this is a brand to watch um i'm sure they can be bringing new products to market and my understanding is that their philosophy is really to support the farmers um paying those farmers up front and giving them a greater cut and joint venture works like that too so they're kind of like equalizing um what's happening in this uh i guess from growing to selling this product um you know margins are super super tight in legal cannabis and i know that it's a hustle for everybody um everybody is just doing their best to bring great product to the market and you know these are type of things that we've been waiting for you know to be able to support um legacy farmers transitioning and pistol in paris you know their team that does the procurement um has also been in the legacy industry so they have like 25 years i believe of experience and so they really know what they're doing and it's just you know they know a lot of these farmers and they've developed these relationships and they travel all over bc the procurement team to you know visit uh these farms and you know to see their practices and what they're doing and how they're growing and their work is paying off this is a fantastic um product i definitely recommend it so thank you so much to pistol and paris for um doing such a great job can you guys see that beautiful white ash just a really nice smooth even burn what a great product and remember the biggest bud was 1.1 grams fantastic product so thank you so much for watching this morning i really appreciate your support my name is unity margarite and i know there's been lots of requests for me to do products and i will get to them so thank you so much everybody have a great day", "r-JymEVV8ak": "what's up to Fabio coming at you with an update so it's been a while since I've given you a lot update and the reason being is because to be honest we don't have much going on here in the flower besides our girls are just fattening up but um it's pretty much the reason why I haven't posted because there's not much going on so you guys don't really get to see too much but anyways so we got going on now so we are on day 38 week 5 of flower and everything is looking okay someone's starting to yellow but my opinion that's kind of normal coming into the end of the cycle just kind of how these photos work start sucking all the nutrients out of the fan leaves and feeding into them girls get bad you see [Music] [Music] but yeah she's coming along she's got about three more weeks or so just trying to lighten up on the newts but overall she's looking she's looking good she's definitely looking good which my cones are definitely coming on we got some orange hairs coming in and that these smell is incredible that sherbert incredible smell and if you guys smoke from Shirley before it's lovely very lovely so let me know what y'all think again dat flower week 5 is a sherbert grow dark hot nursery clothes hates", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know

so we are we are one with YouTube I guess I don't even know but we got a new cart pharmaceutical rx I've never had one of these yet sour Joker live resin cultured this is what I don't get total THC 7404 you come down that s THC a 50 percent THC 29% so that's just down that up doesn't know it never does alright we got here we've got the cush one 18% but then it says that's 20 right here so it's like I don't get it whatever cartridge here we go pushes and leak Locker certified it's mixed with haze in East Coast Sour Diesel it's like I don't know how to get that Joker name like that but it's just exact same boxes dizzy state you know it's the exact same for the box business dizzy which is kind of weird alright out just a different anyway that's pretty cool Zen box cartridge there's no writing on no writing on it all it's a nice girl Jupiter Jupiter I love these battery they work very well we have a bong in the background and we got this guy you ain't hit a pen until you hit this telling that right now but let's try as is throw it on the pen here and give it a shot it looks like a nice cart full resin they're supposed to be all about their flavoring so we're gonna see sour Joker la pr\u00e9sence pharmaceutical rx Wow that taste very well I can't even tell you what it tastes like that just tastes good like one of the standard farms best cartridge like it has that standard farms well as that standard forms taste to food they'll make you call maybe once or twice a quarter block that's real [ __ ] good we're gonna blast it your boss oh there it is - you'll see it's a Bab cap even though we missed our Halloween it's all grooved in a spot and you just pop it right on there blink I love this thing I love it who switches camera", "m_RvuDfuNIA": "hey guys we're going to be talking about delta 8 t8c uh i've been educating myself on it actually picked some up thursday before last it was by treetop himco it was orange cookies and it was the last cartridge they had so i figured why not you know just try it so i i wanted to try three chi um i actually picked a cartridge of that up this past weekend um that was purple punch i had to go to kentucky for that actually they didn't sell it in my area even though it's made here in indiana but i actually had one coming in the mail ordered it two sundays ago we just got here today and with the holiday and covid and coming from wisconsin it just went all over the place but it finally arrived so this is uh what that looks like and i like the packaging of it you can actually feel the uh the grooves these lines it's all they put some time i guess into their box and it's pretty cool how you can actually feel the ridges and it's not just a flat box and on the back they they do give some uh pretty detailed uh info which i like um now these are both uh purple punch um this i have not uh tried the effects of the purple punch tree top yet just got it in the mail but um dry hitting it it tastes uh pretty good um not very grapey um but this cartridge tastes more like grape kool-aid um as you can see there's the package and on the back they they tell you all kinds of stuff 931.6 milligrams of delta 8 thc 17.6 milligrams cbn 0 delta 9 thc and 0 cbd it tells you only two to three second puffs i recommend only take two to three seconds you're gonna get choked up and you might risk burning out the uh you know the cotton inside of the cartridge and you don't spend all that money to waste um no ingredients hit back hip extract terpenes directions remove silicone uh take one puff wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more that's only to me if you're not used to thc at all or if you've never had thc or it's been a while just take one because i've read about people you know just getting so stoned because they're not used to thc at all um don't use it pregnant or nursing uh i i i don't condone this if you're under 21 and use this um i was under 21 whenever i started using cannabis and i if i could go back i would just wait you know just live your life and uh just be happy and be a kid don't waste your brain cells on this [ __ ] right now you know just wait through they're a little bit older you know for me it's more uh medicinal i don't go around with people and do this recreationally it's personal i just want to let other people know that this stuff here is legit so we're gonna give her a role i have been kind of tugging on it now i paid 29 for the treetop one and they gave me a code and if you buy one they'll give you another code to get like 20 off so you save money either way every time you buy hemp living usa is where i got it from and it seems that that is the only one that i found that really gives you discount codes they have like my cbd haven and all that and i haven't ordered from them yet i'd like to order locally you know because uh this comes from fishers indiana by indianapolis they say not to screw this on tight i usually will go tight and then i'll unscrew it and i'm using a goo stick battery if anyone's familiar with that and i'll wait until the letter c cell are matching up with the uh button and that seems to do all right and uh we're gonna go here i picked this up uh last saturday i've kind of been using it every night and uh they last a good while if you're just not being stupid with it either so here we go now i will say that do not exceed two to three second puffs just take two three seconds stop two three seconds seconds seconds breathe in let go and then you can take a couple more and two at a time if you want to so here we go first hit feels like nothing but you'll get choked up as you keep hitting on it this stuff is very good if you're trying to abstain from flour or delta nine you know this is a very good replacement still get you to sleep still get you through the day still make you high it was just a bummer the flower illegal in indiana but i can drive 10 minutes away from where this video is being made in illinois completely legal in that [ __ ] but this is some pretty good stuff you know you know this here is more of like a one-two punch to the head they describe it purple punch hence the punch but it uh i prefer orange cookies now i've only tried now the purple punch and orange cookies but orange cookies was more of a cerebral behind the eyes you know really good for bed uh good for the day if you're trying to get stuff done this here just kind of like makes me so unproductive for the day it's better for night you older dude it seems like if you hold it on like for like even four seconds like really it's like a one-two punch to the head but this stuff is uh legit guys it's uh it doesn't last like forever you know if you just want if you just take one or two you're still gonna feel it but it's not gonna last like super long um other people will tell you it doesn't do anything um maybe they didn't consume it the right way um i did try the gummies by treetop hemp co i tried the rainbow ones they were like 30 milligrams a piece uh and i just i never was an edible guy never had him around i was just i like that immediate feeling from smoking and i get that from the cartridges i just gummies is i don't like something that just hits me you know whenever i'm not ready for it um but this stuff is good i uh i highly recommend it as a replacement um i picked one up from my local shop uh an hour away from here and then i picked the three chia from a shop uh cbd time in lexington kentucky um but then i ordered uh this purple punch from hemp living usa from wisconsin the only thing that went from wisconsin to illinois to indianapolis to kansas to missouri back to indiana then to kentucky and then indiana and kentucky again and then back to indiana so it was like all over the place but i can still track it you know on usps and uh maybe that was because it was a holiday weekend uh and then coveted also but um you know it did arrive and now i have a little bit of orange cookies left i have three cards so i'm probably gonna order uh some more so i do recommend this stuff um try it out make sure it stays legal because it is hint derived it follows the law according to the 2018 farm bill so you can't just give us a good thing and take it away so make sure you try it make sure you buy it make sure you support it and just keep it on the market because one day us here in illegal illegal states are gonna have delta nine we're gonna have cannabis legally and this is just you know a stepping stone so thank you guys for watching uh if you wanna see more um like comment subscribe just leave me a comment if you want to see some more of me sampling different strains and letting you know the effects so thank you guys see you later", "DJSPey5vWGA": "[Music] then [Music] yes yeah you should hold it i should hold like no no um i might do this as a thumbnail we'll see all right what's up guys simplisik here with rj eats subscribe to the boy if you haven't already you know i'm saying but if you can tell from the title we finally picked up the bear labs cartridge and i know you guys are probably gonna get mad when i tell you the price that we paid for this do you have the you have the [ __ ] uh receipt you don't toss that [ __ ] oh sorry it was 32 out the door for a full gram i swear 32. no it was 32. they trust they believe me you know what i'm saying it's not on weed maps yet you really can't check it honestly you're not going to see this video probably for like two weeks but it's 32 out the door lemon sorbet i'm gonna have him uh so as usual i like to um film this so get a better look wow i like the packaging very very nice the bear and then the labs yeah sorben what's the percentage percentage also show yours so the homie got uh his uh strawberry cheesecake [Music] and then the back of the strawberry cheesecake [Music] now open mine so live resin cart as you can see oh that's very light okay yeah i don't have my pants i'm just like okay i got mine my bro is bad too i can't get too harsh on my back all right so boom boom we're opening this up baby let's go ready until then pull out that for a thumbnail [Music] so uh from what i've heard from uh p2 piece this is some fire [ __ ] you know what i'm saying so i was really a fan of the lemon sorbet so all right we are gonna try this so very much very light what i've noticed is with that light lighter stuff it might have uh terpenes mixed in with it instead of reintroduced i mean instead of uh already being in there [ __ ] wait what is it that you just don't know uh when i when it's lighter i feel like they add turkeys but when it's darker they don't really add much children to it or if not any but that's just an assumption i don't really know but he's going to be opening the strawberry cheesecake and we're just going to take some ribs off this i don't have my battery on me you guys and my bad and maybe we shouldn't just meet get out the car we'll just use this battery let's trade them off oh yeah that tastes like the [ __ ] lemon sorbet oh wow refreshing hits that's like super lemony like if you haven't seen my lemon sorbet video it's exactly the same way it tastes like a lemon slushie oh my god that [ __ ] this is the [ __ ] that this was 32 buck that 27 [ __ ] even though it's still it's all right the cartridge itself is good [Laughter] damn bear labs you guys go check them out that's the damn seatbelt is it oh no i'll pick it up later all right taking a take another hit off this and did you want to try this one too yeah yeah oh yeah that's why i pulled it out [Music] i should probably like keep the keep the packaging actually still because i haven't finished my other one yet yeah you're right here but you want to take another this is the [ __ ] fire yeah i'm trying to smell it yeah this is a little surprise but yeah this is this is it 32 out the door 80 plus cannabinoids well and it smells like lemons you're not gonna get caught up with this [ __ ] bro and actually looks nice with the white the black tip coming out of the the device the black on black yeah all right let's try this one oh yeah all right if it tastes bear in mind we gotta switch no no no that one's [ __ ] good i feel like they're both gonna taste hell again if this one doesn't taste good we got a [ __ ] problem i didn't just say it doesn't work uh yeah there's something wrong with this car it tastes like [ __ ] it says strawberry cheesecake but it tastes like [ __ ] let's try strawberry cheese [ __ ] or what strawberry cheese [ __ ] all right cheers guys i'm excited 32 for bear labs i kind of want to just go back and buy like two more but i'll reserve myself because that's not the way what's the way that no it moderation taste like strawberry i don't know but not even the wires came out right there i think that was broken well did it taste like strawberry cheesecake i didn't even taste it it tastes flavorless to me i need to try it again i'm bad y'all need to try to slightly like a little bit in the beginning but not really huh yeah damn i always get stuck with one of them [Music] turn again try it again i should have got me uh the other one that they had the gg4 or some [ __ ] i don't know do you think the gg4 would have been good that's crazy this is strawberry cheesecake you would think it would taste like strawberries no something you know we shouldn't taste like the name sometimes or sometimes it does happen you know i don't know i don't know i mean it doesn't taste bad but it didn't taste this good no they're not it's not bad yeah that's not bad i've had worse doesn't taste like that limited sorbet but it definitely hit so i'll tell you that right now thank you uh but yeah that's uh it for the video uh i'm really excited that we did get to try uh bear labs the cartridge but i'm a little bit disappointed that randy didn't get one as good as mine um but at the end of the day he can just use that one first and then he has that other uh the other jetties one that's way better than that one so yeah yeah but it's only 32. you know well it's not like you're paying 40. that's what happens when you're not moderate [Applause] yeah see he was actually going in there not trying to buy a cartridge he was just gonna buy wax and then i saw this beauty i thought that was beautiful it was all right it's not bad it could have been worse yeah but whatever strawberries okay and we also got uh i got a bad fish so expect the video on that um you got anything to say to the people before we end it hope

that's pretty much it guys it didn't really say much about it um i didn't really say much about it uh pretty much always said that uh it's uh by mohammed and they broke down all the strands used to make this [ __ ] up so yeah guys we're gonna fight the [ __ ] up see what's popping uh i was smoking this [ __ ] earlier bro this [ __ ] got me so lowered it earlier man hopefully this [ __ ] don't

alien laughs a little green things i'm going green thanks i i made a video on backing them back in the past i thought she was gonna bring some [ __ ] like that but she brought this and then she brought some other [ __ ] the other [ __ ] i didn't like it for the fact that it was sativa i took this because this [ __ ] was indica so she brought this i'm like oh [ __ ] i ain't never seen a raw garden uh disposable penis i'm like [ __ ] i'm gonna take that [ __ ] so i took that [ __ ] brought it back home and i would never expect to get a battery no lie that's wrong like i think they got a whole free battery guys like after i finish smoking with this [ __ ] throw that [ __ ] out i got a whole bag to the neck that's tight not alive it's some weird [ __ ] though that is the 0.3 like i never seen that [ __ ] bro small this the smallest cartridge i ever ran into bro and hopefully they don't got smaller ones bro because man this is crazy but y'all see this [ __ ] bro it's a 0.3 right here [ __ ] it it is what it is man you feel me also another good thing about this [ __ ] bro is the flavor the flavor is actually good no lie it has like a little kind of citrus flavor it ain't it don't taste nasty don't taste like chemicals or none of that [ __ ] bro it tastes kind of fruity but uh yeah you feel me it's pretty cool and a lot you should [ __ ] me up she got me loaded i'm gonna get high bro for high as hell i give it up from one out of ten i give it a nine just for the fact that it comes with a whole battery they do give you a 0.3 is small but you are paying 25 dollars so

subscribe i'll see you guys next time", "2fZK7ykAPBI": "yo yo sup guys back here for another video man it's a sort of rainy day today it's kind of cloudy hasn't rained yet but um I'm about to go to a dispensary called purple Lotus and I'm gonna buy a bara garden because my raw garden is pretty much empty if it even shows you it's pretty much empty so I'm gonna pick up a raw garden so then we can do a review of these new cars that I got up in Finn and I've been waiting to even try these I haven't even tried it yet it's called Ursa extracts Ursa extracts this is live resin I don't think it has any additives or anything so we're gonna test these out I'm gonna put the link to their Instagram and stuff down below check those guys out there kind of a new wax I've never even heard of them so we're gonna try them out and we're gonna compare them to the raw garden we're gonna see which one's better but we got to pick up some more raw garden because this shit's done sup so about to knock on my friends door and he's gonna pretty much take me so I'm waiting for him he doesn't want to be on camera so using probably not gonna be on camera this whole time sorry guys but how you doing bro all my friends dog dogs except for me as you can see we're gonna get out of here soon guys oh I'm still mad I'm mad about these versa extract the only thing I'm mad about versa extract and I want them to explain to me is how how is this a gram when it's 659 milligrams of THC and 2.3 milligrams of CBD that makes no sense it should be a thousand milligrams all together for 1 grand if I'm trippin tell me I'm trippin in the comments but I'm pretty sure it's a thousand [ __ ] milligrams this is almost like I have [ __ ] gram it's like a big-ass bubble it in [ __ ] but it's probably hella good we don't even know if it's good so I don't even know but no cars guys new cards so we're gonna see what it is I'll get back to you guys when I faith back in you guys already know [Music] [Music] we just pulled up about to walk in here probably won't bring the camera in because I don't think they'll let me record even though cookies let me record inside there I'm still not gonna bring it in just in case you know I don't want to be awkward as [ __ ] but we're gonna go in here bro didn't get as much as I thought I was gonna get but here's Nicki from me this looks like he got the Mendel punch golden gold sauce cartridge strawberry banana cartridge and then yogi berry let's check this [ __ ] out [ __ ] was how much was that [ __ ] BAM 177 53 after taxes for three carts oh four carts I mean sorry four cards one two three four and I only got two cars because I'm broke and because I already bought two other carts to raw garden mendel punch dough see about 120 125 up the tag [ __ ] taxes guys um it's gonna be like an hour and my card 17 minutes just to get back so that these were all garden carts then Nick he got some unique [ __ ] never tried these the Cresco tell me if you guys ever tried them if they're good in the comments you know if you try the cress goes and and you know if you tried the rolls I've never tried to roll I don't even know how to open this box man it looks confusing us [ __ ] probably not even confusing but probably get the taste those later maybe finish lets me get some eventually and then he got the raw garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking for a good rock garden flavor to get it has punch in it or some kind of berry in it usually those ones are pretty good honestly compared to banana bread definitely good banana bread was cool though I ain't gonna diss banana so we out and we're gonna get it we don't get it Ian soon we just gotta find a good place to smoke man all right guys it took [ __ ] forever to get back here but we're back and it's kind of dark so I'm not even gonna go outside and smoke or are we gonna go so I don't know what do you want to do we gotta go outside can be smoking it so we're gonna try this real quick behold alright so we're gonna try out the banana OG first I don't know if I'm gonna try the next one yet but well I mean we're gonna try it another video so that's what it looks like it's focused [ __ ] persona raw garden pin now we got to get the Earth's opinion when is the Ursa pin coming first I tell me in the comments come on [Music] alright guys here goes I'm not gonna lie this [ __ ] is [ __ ] shits ding this shit's powerful it tastes like legit just straight wax was put in there you're taking a straight dab so I guess the live res like it has no distillate no nothing nothing at it cut it to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw garden stuff we got to try that we got it compared to the raw garden no one's better so far though I like the Ursa this shit's pretty dim did you like it what would you take [Music] you heard it you heard them that shit's [ __ ] powerful here you go bro oh yeah

76.68 and on the sherbert flash cushman this one was clocking in it's 73.090 thc 0cd for a total of 73 this is the cush mints oh it smells really good it smells uh i didn't have the flour so i cannot compare it but i don't know it has like a fruity wheaties smell fruity wheaty fruity fruity something like that let's do it i like the texture of it i have it in my room i mean it's not like it's hot in here all right let's do what i have cheers all right cheers [Laughter] wow oh wow there's a fan come on let's do it beyonce can you handle it oh got a new little rig what you know about little mushrooms they're cute okay so sunset sherbert and cushman's i'm pretty sure yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 10 out of 10 we'll be getting again fire i didn't get the flower but um if it was anything like the ray bay which was or the grape cake because i got both of them they were both fire i just haven't had this in flower but nice heavy indica in fact babe my back is killing me right and i just loosened up a little [ __ ] hair okay there's that okay i can well maybe it's just the way i'm sitting i don't know if it's the way i'm sitting or what i don't know but there's that no i definitely heavy indica love the effects of this stuff [ __ ] fire i i love it i don't even really need to take another dab right now but for science purposes and because i said we're doing a twofer we will do that of course i'm just gonna get super more high off of that but i have been smoking this so we could talk about it all right so let's talk about this space age cake this one's like a little bit more gassy and it seemed to be a little a little bit harder than that one like the texture it was a little bit more firm like the other one was a little bit uh i don't want to say it was gritty it wasn't gritty but it wasn't this is different this one's like shiny and now mind you i'm keeping all of these in my room in room temperature setting i do store it in this little stash box that i got but for the most part i keep it at room temperature i do want one of those cool little refrigerators that people get honey all i want for christmas is a fridge for my wax no there's that i really don't need this i swear to god that was a nice dab all right let's do this let's do the space age cake we're on it oh it's 3 30 [Music] cheers oh [Music] oh i'll show you guys this little hack real quick on how i've been cleaning my rigs i'm not gonna recommend doing this doing this at your own risk but check it i've got my hot rig now this is room temperature water i am filling a q-tip i know y'all use alcohol right but just watch it actually kind of like cleans up a lot of it too instead of using alcohol look at how much boom now if you have a shitty banger do this at your own risk boom there's my hack you're welcome all right so space age cake i'm glad i picked this little guy up i thought it was a new strain and i was like hey i've never seen this and the guy's like informed me that no i was wrong it was not new it's just something they don't have a lot of i've never seen it someone else let me know if they always saw space age cake i don't know what i i've been going to truly for three years now i swear i was like this is new i haven't seen it in wax anyone bueller either way 10 out of 10 will be getting that again both of these are awesome true indicas heavy hitting love them i ain't mad at these waxes at all i never really am i mean that's one thing about reviewing the canvas it's not like there's a lot of products so i'm like [ __ ] this [ __ ] i'm out oh let me say i have had the issues with the wax i was like [ __ ] this [ __ ] i'm out at sotera's wax i haven't even been back to sentara and uh purely crumble that will look like frozen but i still have it i never returned it i haven't been to daytona all right yeah i think we're done here so yeah both of these waxes absolute fire i hope i'll be able to post a video wednesday you guys might back like i said i heard it today and i really know i won't feel the effects of it until like tomorrow so wish me luck if you don't see it maybe i'll pop a little like help me video if it's that bad on wednesday

big face and drop a dick's like yeah okay there's that", "A5u90Nqj-mg": "all right guys and it is New Year's Eve and I've got a new video because of a very special special special a special special that essence was running today they're running a New Year's Eve special buy-one-get-one-free desert grown vape cartridges oh yeah oh yeah so I went and picked me up buy one get one free even got this cool shirt oh I got to cool sure these two cartridges and then [ __ ] uh the cartridges are like they're I mean I had I did the video on the San Fernando Valley one and it is really good flavorful they reintroduce the chirpings into the distillate so good just a really really solid oil when I bought these two I did check like this seems that desert grown vape doesn't really put like an amount on the oil like that they put in there and like their cartridges like kind of have like a little bubble so I mean I hope it's 500 but it doesn't really say but they're only 50 bucks so an instance by one get one free so like you really can't complain even with my like I mean I'm in my med patient taxes low so like really like you're coming out paying like under $30.00 for these things like and that's [ __ ] that's a steal so they had some good flavors and I ended up getting a sunset sherbert and cherry pie both hybrids and a cherry pie I've gotten both kind of off of the recommendation of the lady who worked there gave me the free shirt and also kind of my own feeling about that recommendation so that was cool and I'm gonna do the I'm gonna do one of them in a video each so that like I can you can really get a feel of each cartridge but so first one I'm gonna do is the sunset sherbert because I'm really excited about tasting that and these are the stats on the back as you can see and it is a disel it they reintroduced terpenes in there she said steam terpenes i'm not sure what that means but if anybody does you can feel free to let me know but yeah I mean and here's the front I mean here's the front it's even got the sticker of the of the of the [ __ ] of the strain off periodic table like really really good oil really really nice so that's really cool and yeah we're gonna give her we're gonna give her a whirl I'm gonna open her up right now all right and and like I said these are they are distillate cartridge wickless it's a wickless cartridge so I really like that it's and this one seems to be filled up pretty good and it's a really really good cartridge it's got a plastic top it's not metal but I mean that doesn't really seem to matter because this is all really really solid and so I'm gonna get this thing on here and then we're gonna [ __ ] give her a whirl but yeah this is a sunset sherbert is a hybrid and if it's anything like the San Fernando Valley one it should be really really tasty alright and I got a little notification how to move that so here we go here it is right here since the [ __ ] sunset sherbert desert groan vape cartridge DISA lit reintroducing the steam terpenes hybrid strain sunset sherbert desert groan vapes let's give it a whirl do like the wine connoisseurs all arrogant here we go seriously alright I'm happy here we go New Year's Eve let's go we're gonna take this puff to 2018 being [ __ ] bomb as this [ __ ] vape cartridge nope and it's not even on that's probably not a good omen alright to 2018 being his bomb as this [ __ ] cartridge oh no that was good that was really good ah do you know doesn't have as much flavor as a San Fernando Valley one but that was a nice hit we're gonna do another one for you because I really wanted you guys to get a good it's for you guys not me right for you guys to see that I it's a good hit or not right [Music] okay so not as much flavor as a San Fernando Valley packs a very good punch very balanced like you can feel the explosion in your head you feel the body high really balanced hybrid it's [ __ ] good real good I like the vapor production again classy cartridge wickless [ __ ] beautiful I mean this is in desert grown vape speaks for itself it's a great great product great great people and they just put on I mean this their cartridges are [ __ ] amazing man and their strain-specific so they've got Durban poison they've got sunset sherbert they don't pay me a lick for this I guess they gave me a free [ __ ] shirt but that doesn't matter I just really like their [ __ ] cartridges so again we're gonna we're gonna look at that's the sunset sherbert desert groan vapes you can see there they put the stats on their sunset server dissolute vape reintroduce team terpenes there you go right there with the [ __ ] product all the [ __ ] statistics and yeah that was real good that was really really good as far as rating goes I would say I would I mean this is I mean I would say that is a very very good hybrid packs a very good punch cartridge very good vapor production solid all-around taste wise I mean we can go off that it's not really much taste a high wise I give it a do it an eight point eight and yeah just a really good cartridge man I would totally totally buy it especially if you like hybrids if you're a big hybrid person and you like that good balanced high cuz I can feel it right now like I feel the creativity a little bit not as much as a pure sativa but I feel it and then I feel like that good body high so like that's pretty cool and yeah that's that's a solid solid solid cartridge right there like I said a desert grown desert grown farms there sunset sherbert their line of vape cartridges if you're living here in Vegas and you catch this video before the end of the day they're doing buy one get ones dude [ __ ] sweet all right now thank you guys very much if you have any if you feel if you feel like this video informed you [ __ ] helps you make a decision on whether or not to buy a product feel free to like subscribe share would do what you do happy new years have a safe one have fun do what you do and thanks for watching", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "Ptw9M0ldOZo": "you hey guys welcome to hot bucks little stray today we got a dope-ass cart review for you guys [ __ ] muha meds [ __ ] just [ __ ] been wanting to do these for a [ __ ]

I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off that so the flavor on that is so good though like that it tastes so [ __ ] good just if you ever see them in your area definitely pick them up and if you ever tried them down below in the comments for you guys sing at them but 4.5 out of 5 like I said and besides for that it's been Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like

i sleep like a king every night this morning we got a new stream for you guys and this screen is sherbert aka sunset sugar we gotta smell so delicious let me see if i can pick out a nice juicy bud good lord look at that bud look how big this butt is y'all yes sir look at all them colors sunset sherbet that is a beautiful bud wow okay anyways when i open when i open the bag it smells gassy let's get this butt out it smells gassy and like a sweet gas okay so took the time to clean my bong this morning so we got fresh water clean bone and as someone said before make sure there's no stems in your bud so that uh it'll eliminate most of a lot of the coffin we'll see we'll test that theory so i broke it all up the stem bomb put that over there all right let's test that no coffin theory on i would use my um ash catcher on this but my ash catcher remember i told you guys i broke the one ash ketchum i went got another one supposed to be the exact same one but it's like the other one was like maybe a point this way which helped it out because my bones is linked that way but this one is kind of straight and it hits up against this so it doesn't work for it anyway let's get in on this sunset shirt with you guys or sherbet nice my first taste was like a lemon it was like a sweet lemon i can only imagine that that's the shirt i didn't expect it to taste like the ice cream or anything but one moment let me get my breathing together okay yeah that first hit was was quite delicious let's see take a small light so i get a good flavor that's a sweet it's not too sweet it's like a slight sweet it's like lemon with i can't say lemon with sugar on it it's like lemon with with cake batter or ice cream on it because it doesn't taste like lemon and straight sugar it's pretty good though it's not a very complex flavor but it's pretty tasty now here's the weird part well it's not really weird if you're from cali you know this um this definitely does not taste like cali bud i would say that this is it tastes more washington uh colorado type because somebody said that i'm partial to a cali weed but perhaps i am partial but i've been to all these places that i say that i've tasted weed at so it's not being partial this i've actually been through all these states that have legalized the wheat oh my god you guys i just read an article that said that california california that florida is um is modifying their weed to only give out 10 thc for all [ __ ] smokeables and concentrates they're going to cap it at 16 so the the weed will be 10 cap on the uh thc content and the concentrates will be a 16 cap on the concentrates the edibles they're gonna leave it alone but if you're making edibles with sixteen percent concentrates or ten percent weed what are you gonna get ten percent or sixteen percent concentric [ __ ] wheat or uh edibles just doesn't make sense i told you guys before that they were genetically modifying the wheat out here i told you guys that see i knew the weed didn't have a flavor and it didn't have a smell so along with that flavor and smell brings down the thc levels i knew they were already doing it they're talking about well they're thinking about doing a muffler you guys been doing that [ __ ] excuse me y'all i got on topic a little bit it tastes gassy like fuel okay so sorry guys anyway so i've got a pretty nice buzz already i'm not like baked or anything but that's only my second hit third hit this is definitely not dispensable grade but no lie here's pretty good though it helps that the bone is clean too if you're new to the channel go ahead subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of these fire ass videos excuse me y'all it's really hard to breathe this morning all righty then yes sir you guys have you ever had a weed that leads to like a real faulty taste in your mouth this doesn't do it but i'm saying you ever had a weed that has released a real faulty taste in your mouth that's the way mids in in reggie was to me when i first got here and i didn't know what it was but i hate weedily's a faulty tasting mouth this leaves a pretty good taste in your mouth it's like it's kind of sweet and gassy it's weird i mean it's not weird i've had sweet and gassy weed before but maybe not in this combination um oh wow oh my goodness that is really nice i kind of feel it right behind my forehead right now but it's it's weird this is a weird sensation i have right now but i feel like like this pressure right here feels funny because it feels like the highs right here but it's pushing down my ear it's weird wow it's quite nice i can tell already that this weed doesn't have a cap like there's no seal into this [ __ ] sherbet that's pretty damn good [Music] all the new subscribers i really totally appreciate you guys remember i told you guys yesterday i think it was that i'm in contact with a designer i've actually already paid the designer to design my logo i don't think it's going to be this crown even though i wanted the crown because like i said we all kings and queens around this [ __ ] but whatever they come up with i'm gonna see what it is because this person is a really good artist so we're gonna we're probably gonna end up giving her a shout out so i'm not gonna do it yet until i receive my art and see how good it is and i'll show you guys and then we'll have some merch online boom because as soon as she brings me that logo and i approve the logo if i like it i'm sending it straight out to the company to get to get get it printed on [Music] shirts [Music] and um in the dispensary grade that really makes me cough that much on bones but this is weird i could tell this is not this fits great if this is dispensable great it's dispensary grade colorado or dispensary grade washington state yeah because um it tastes watered down it's good bud but i that's the way that's way um that's the way colorado weed tastes to me colorado wheat is good do not get it twisted but it tastes watered down to me it doesn't pop as much as cali weed every place that i've been there only there's only like maybe one place that came close to the weed popping as much as cali that's washington dc [ __ ] chicago weed garbage detroit weed is good but still fails in comparison um the only thing that well there is another bud that i can say that that can't compare to it but i had this but many many years ago and that's uh uh canadian but bc but bc bud has always been delicious but still i wish you guys will stop trying because nobody can take the pepsi challenge with california there's not a state to do it yet like this like i said yet somebody said that that cat that new york city smokes more weed than cali or has better weed or smokes more wheat or whatever i was like what i said i'm thinking do you know the population of new york city it's about 9 million do you know the population of [ __ ] california it's about 40 million man so you think 9 million people are smoking way more weed than 40 million people i don't think so it doesn't matter though you guys the way i look at it every place every state in the united states has good weed and do you know why they have good weed because in california baby i'm just playing no but every weed is good you know for certain people you know me i like the [ __ ] intense [ __ ] high thc let's get it going type buds you know but there's some older people that like the uh the relay the laid-back weed of like reggie or minutes there's some older people like it because they don't cough as much you know they and they get a good high those are people that haven't been smoking long if you've been smoking for years you're not smoking [ __ ] mids or reggie for years especially if you've tasted some exotic or taste of some dispensary weed that's crazy oh yes it's crazy [Music] anyway [Music] [Music] we're going to give it a 8. for the flavor we're going to give it an 8. it's really a beautiful butt and it deserves every bit of that flavor of the flavor critique of eight so gave it an eight would i recommend this to my friends i would recommend it to my friends because every strain of sherbet that i've had has been kind of laid back it hasn't been very intense high you know so this is kind of indicative or or whatever the word is to uh serve it this uh this high it's not really intense it's not wow am i it's like yeah man i'm hot so i would definitely recommend it to my friends um it has a a mild to heavy expansion rating your lungs it kind of expands like i don't know not too fast but it's a little more than mid-range expansion yeah so um yeah i figure eight is well-rounded and well-deserved for this flavor critique of sherbet strand baby that was cool that was a nice hit okay all right wow i think i just got hired too now it's behind my eyes that is nice though and i don't know i don't know if it's in my mind excuse me guys i don't know if it's in my mind but you know when people put things in your mind and all of a sudden you experience that like if i say don't think of a pink elephant with purple polka dots you already thought of it just because i said it so i'm wondering that if i'm tasting the sherbet because i know that it's sherbert because it does taste sherbety to me now all of a sudden all of a damn but it's still delicious no cat oh i think i'm gonna take me some dab hits after this i found that last night i was doing the dabs all wrong because i don't know why you guys didn't tell me because i torched it in front of you guys and when i torched it i torched that [ __ ] like i was cooking some eggs or something and i'm torturing it and torching it and torching it and torching it and torching it and torching and torching and torching and torching and it's like so as soon as i put the [ __ ] the uh the wax on there so i put it on there it's just gone you get a couple hits and it's gone you know what i'm like damn i put a big accident like last night put a little bit of flame on a [ __ ] you know let it warm up a little bit through the thing there got me a fat head got me another fat head got me another fight torched it again just for a little bit got me three more fat hits tortured again i got two more fat hits i was like whoa this is how you do it [Music] that is quite lovely it's a really mellow buzz i can tell that this is this has got to be um indica dominant i don't know i'll look it up but it makes me feel like it's indica dominant hmm i am pleasantly high though there's no cap on that y'all already know what i'm gonna say i will go play the game now that's what you do when you get up in the morning this is the perfect time to play video games it's early in the morning so if you guys don't know if you're having problems with your kids or your girl or your parents or your friends coming over calling while you're trying to play a game get up early and [ __ ] in the morning man when everybody asleep smoke yourself a fat ass blunt a fat ass bone a fat ass bowl and play the game you can play it in peace you can even put both headphone things on your ears you don't have to have one off you know what i'm saying so you can hear what's going on you have to hear [ __ ] because ain't nobody moving everybody knocked out it's [ __ ] six o'clock in the morning nobody getting up for at least another hour and a half so i get up at 4 30. so i got 5 30 6 30 7 30. i got like three hours actually like four hours because the um the um my best friend's uh uh child goes to school at 7 30 she don't come over here to get my nephew until like 8 30 so i got four hours a straight game plan but i try to get to the gym between 7 30 and 8. you know what i'm saying because it's all me time this is um quite nice quite lovely a deep yeah delicious oh i can't wait to see what the new logo is going to be i told her to make sure she kept waking big across the top well i can always add that to the shirt so whoo oh okay okay wow that's really nice i am so pink i'm quite hiding i cracked myself up i'm just playing yo that's how you know i'm in the bathroom about my goddamn self giggling like a school girl oh i'm in the mood for love simply because you're near me feel like donald trump and he hug the flag [ __ ] out of here okay all right we only was able to have one bowl in this episode because because it seems like that's all that was needed [Music] because it feels like i'm struggling with this mug let's take a pause for station identification well perhaps we'll be able to get another ball game i don't know maybe i should okay yes sir we're gonna get it in here i hate when people look down the glass like that makes me feel old when i do this [ __ ] because old people do

trash to my mom and i told them to stop i say man y'all see martin like this and she was like my mother was like hey can y'all stop and they just kept arguing back and forth but i was like it came down to hey y'all need to stop arguing and he turned around with one second i said hey stop arguing my sister got quiet but as soon as i did that my heart started and i was like i had to go lean against the car i was like hey bro look down okay let's get in here well scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] tim being a good [ __ ] of the high critique of this sherbert aka sunset sherbert

[Applause] yeah you see a white ash gang all day every day make sure you guys shoes quality over quantity and I have to say beside say sunset sorry bro I give it a 9 out of 10 make sure you guys like subscribe and comment what flavor should we do what flavors should we do next it's already hidden yeah - next time I'll see you soon", "y9Ol3SAn-Ms": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here and today I have an eighth of sherbert flour from true leave its got sixteen point six percent THC 0.6% CBG for a total of 17.2% let's open this sucker up and see what we got inside got a good seal on it you know I'm a sucker for good seals oh hi Katie Katie nope cut sorry about that give that a little kitty a bit of attention I know is popped that seal and see what we got inside it looks like some decent little buds in there what's it smell like oh wow it's got this it's got a sour smell to it a very very sour aroma like tropical fruits our almost maybe a little bit of pine eNOS in there but mostly overwhelmingly it's sour let's take a look at these bugs and see what they look like there's some nice-looking buds it looks like they're well covered in trichomes this strain is 53 dollars retail I got it for 10% off with my true livre points so that brought it down to 47 dollars and 70 cents still an expensive eight this does look like some good quality stuff there's some decent little nugs in here let's take a close-up bring it in for a close-up of these beautiful buds these are really well covered in trichomes the look reminds me of Jack Herer because you know they're jacker air is usually pretty covered in trichomes like this but even more so for their Jack career this is really nice though like this mellow very pungent you know I think there's a bit of pine eNOS in there too with that but the the sour smell I'm talking about is not a Sour Diesel smell I want to make that clear it's like a sour tropical fruit smell like sour fruit punch or something it's really really nice and it does have a nice robust smell to it you know a nice aroma it's going just a little bit closer to get these trichomes alrighty I'll get that check out the trichomes on these things right here that looks pretty it's got a little bit of purple in there it looks like with some green and orange got that Halloween effect going on and I'm you know my face is away from the camera and I can still smell this stuff wafting over look at the trikes on this one oh it's so nice all righty let's get some of this stuff weight up and toked up all righty now that we got that stuff on the camera up close let's get it weighed out so that we can see what we got here might help to put the tray on there first and then tear it you sure all right no no see how much we got 3.5 to 3.6 so it's probably right on the line there and it's not bad just switches back and forth between 3.5 or three point six oh here we go let me get some of this but all grounded root it up and then we'll get it baked in the extreme cue over here I gave up on elbow packing because I just wasn't getting dense bags out of it so I went back to trying you know gave up on it for maybe a week or so and then I went back to try and just pack in the main bowl and that seems to do the best job when I'll bow pack it it's just like you have to either put not enough to really get a big dense bag so that it can flow through there or if you put enough for a big dense bag for me anyway it seems to clog it up and it doesn't really work very well the elbow that is but this should do the job I mean this stuff looks so nice let's see I'm not sure and as you can see this whole time sherbert is a blend of Girl Scout cookies and pink panties by mr. Sherr bin ski and now you can see that I have the most terrible handwriting in the whole dang world there we go ha ha I was like hey I forgot to read him the stuff and then I was like wait it's been on screen the entire time well that's convenient alrighty save me a little time but then I spent more time explaining it I'm gonna get a little bit more here alrighty I got that all chopped up get this bowl packed not the easiest bowl to pack because it gets hot but it does have that heat resistant stuff the tape on top that helps decent little Bowl back there I prefer the elbow and I would prefer to use that because it's more efficient but I really got to have the nice thick clouds as you can see I got the extreme cube bag i modded to make it have more capacity and not leak and we're gonna get this sucker started my remote control vape here is kind of crazy is this the future now are we in the future all righty where's this camera a little bit you can have a look at the bags going up there all righty no that is sometimes paper so apparently I've got to use this part this chamber that works I did accidentally combust one the other day by leaving it on 260 that was not good maybe was 250 a camera or whatever the high temperature is alright that suckers filling up nicely got some dents paper in it I don't think you can see through it tiny bit take a look at this beautiful weed so this sherbert smells amazing it looks really nice I wouldn't spend 53 bucks on it just cuz I don't like spending that much on weed but you know if you get it 20% off it's like 42 dollars and 40 cents so it's a good deal you know for this quality weed I'd say it's a good deal is it a great deal nope it's not a great deal you know there's a lot better deals out there but you're not necessarily gonna get this quality so that's the thing excited to get a taste of this stuff feeling the effects of it here we go got a nice fat bag wow that's like that tropical sourness really comes through in the flavor do don't really taste any other flavors they're mostly just our to me that's good you see how bold produce plenty of vapor I'm starting to feel that call mmm definitely nice yeah it's really starting to hit me the effects this seems like it's gonna be more of a spiky kind of strain that a really relaxing one I could barely get through this bag it's so much vapor in it I saw a video where a guy does an entire huge bait bag it's like ten foot long or something with circular breathing a circular breathing where you just just inhale only vapor then exhale then inhale vapor then exhale and inhale vapor then exhale without taking breaths in between man I can't even imagine that that would give me the hugest panic attack on the face of planet Earth like my brain would probably pop with anxiety so this is my size bag right here a little bit see what else we got oh we're gonna have some more in there I would think we all righty so if this gives us two bags of vapor man that's just you know good stuff cuz that first bag was dense this could be um a little trick you can do I haven't done it this time I guess I'm being lazy but a little trick you can do is for that second bag even for the first bag but put it on 262 get it started and you have to you know you can't just leave it like that cookie you can't leave it on 260 because you will combust it but now put it on 264 that first 10 seconds something like that maybe 20 seconds it'll really get the vapor kick-started and then just drop it straight back down the 2:30 or whatever your temperature is and there you go they'll have a extra dense bag another thing that seems to help is making sure your bud is kind of moist not moist but you know has enough moisture if it's all dried out you're gonna get less paper out of it I mean I imagine it's kind of like pressing where if you have the right moisture content that vapor coming from the moisture helps it all evaporate I mean you know helps it all be pushed out so I bet it's similar for vaping and this strain is really nice the effects are the smell is really good and strong smells really important for me I love like it won't be my favorite strain if I can't put it and put my face in it and go man that smells really good like or wow that engages it doesn't have to smell like desirable but as long as it's really potent and it hits me the right way you know it's like some some are stinky but it's just how they hit you probably a particular thing for each person's body chemistry or something like that all right so you can see the second bag is not nearly as dense but that's cool it just means I got most of it out the first time should be able to get through this bag a little quicker [Laughter] [Music] much lighter vapor you taste the toastiness but it's not all toasty flavor there we go got that bag sucked down this is good stuff what I recommended at 53 not necessarily unless you got money to burn but at 40 to 40 if you can get the 20% discount this is a really decent deal I think your best bet would be to wait for minis of course because then it's only 27 minus 540 if you get it in 20% off so there you it's a pretty dang good deal in minis like probably the best deal in minis you know one of these nights trains all right so we got sherbert 53.8 sixteen point six percent THC pretty good stuff thank you guys for watching you have a good", "AvIPuwZCYyg": "welcome back fellow youtubers subscribers viewers medicator z-- tonight's video is gonna be on can you guess can you tell by looking at the bottom what it is it's called sunset road

know what you're out slow and see if it's something you like why not you know me on the other hand I'm I'm all in all the time see them I'm getting the Tang eNOS not much on a citrusy in more time maybe pine is concern a citrusy smell but it's definitely I'm definitely getting the definitely getting a tangy snow camera guy tell me what you think I like that good it's definitely tangy and it's kind of like a tang and its own little way that piney citrusy smells those that uh that's more primer than all right so we don't have a bag to look down in for an in the bag shot but you go in the container and look there that suckers filled to the brim I mean like I think the lid is what kept it from bursting out it looks very green and I see some crystals and a lot of leaf I see a lot of leaf in there so let's uh one big stem here in the top I'm thinking this is one big old bud there does it looks like it's folded over look at that look at that that's long button that is one bud that is gnarly guys look at that my people look at that that is gnarly make sure you get plenty of close-ups okay so I see that this is not one but I can tell you right now this is not one button although it came out like one because I have a feeling there's maybe it's one big one and a couple little ones like they normally do for me cuz right here is two little fatties so see if we can see if we can get some like that's pretty decent that's pretty nice that's one big chunk right there guys that is really nice wow that was really awesome shout out CBD hemp direct you guys are awesome look at that I

just like that maybe there we go there we go that's a lot better that's really nice looking this can't get over that one big bud that's just craziness Wow you little bugs right here oh wow look at all that crystal on there that's a whole lot of crystal that's one fact I'm down uh-huh camera guys really utilizing the features of the old cell phone there right so although it pains me to put it back into the John I have to do it I have to do it I think we just roll with this little guy right here so this take the peaceful let's say right here so I'm gonna give this a taste just like an orange and then like is really strong in terpene wait really bitter II parsley okay give me like my whole tongue like hot besides my tongue it feel really tingly and dry and the top of my teeth from the roof of my mouth well there's a lot of terpene business I'm very strong Wow it almost makes my eyes water they got filled in my nose like like right in here what it's like it's very strong as the strongest terpene now I've had some terpene that was like uncomfortable like pretty mouth like oh this is unpleasant it wasn't near strong its strong but it's not overpoweringly horrible Wow it's strong even really that smells really really dank it's strong okay nope now you can see like like there's a see Colonel and there's a seedpod there's a seedpod there and there's one not much leaf there's a leaf

telling the back of the roof of my mouth oh wow that's can I can't get over how strong it is like I feel it already like I feel I mean I'm not even kidding like that's that's a pretty potent stuff the thing is like it's just to the water and yeah these little tubes they like they condense the bubble so they're real tiny so their Lords are trying to be filtered through the water up and out so there's little tiny bubbles filter a lot lot faster a lot more aggressively then like it was just a hole in the bottom and big bubbles coming out this is very sweet although it's very dense like this Mary take the flavor very very very oh man it's crazy smoke cloud so the daily thing almost 20% CBD the packaging is awesome felt like a Sun bursting orange like the sherbert real citrusy color I mean

great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than

got a really cool set up now called click and Collect so it's really convenient basically you go on their website take you've ever store you want to cup your your items from select your items and then they basically just hold them for you for 24 hours and you can just go pick them up so that way you just in and out if you're not the way for all the people standing in line and ask you a million questions so this first one here is by citizen stash know if you can see that it's called sunset sherbert sitting at 23.6% I haven't actually seen this one yet before but I've been excited to try it get some mix between like Girl Scout cookies and lady something I can't remember but look it up anyways as soon as I open this it's just like the entire room yeah doesn't really do much justice but super nice big nugs oh yeah that smells unreal I'll do an update after I test it out but citizens - is very high-end or high-grade I should say they don't grow a lot so it's hard to find sometimes but really good quality that stuff is more of like a you know looking begin tree because it's like like 55 bucks for Neath so just buy it you know here and there but it's one of my favorites even though I haven't had this one before citizen stash is one of my favorites they've got another string called Mac one which I'll do a review about that is actually my favorite government stream right now so yea lot a lot of trips a lot of flavor as far as the smell I have tried this before it's not from these guys I'm expecting big things but I'll get there give you guys an update when I have it review all

everything that they use you know if you on their website they even tell you they're the terpene company not many places do that so yeah that's pretty cool can't wait for them to get their license you know and just like West Coast cure they're out there they're known but there's still not license so you know a lot of people are out faces I don't know what they're up to but this is cool right here

special to show you and something that you don't see every day well certainly something I don't see every day this is the blue shirt and it is kelly input week so today I'm going to be taking a quick look at this blue server in a bit more detail just want to pick up mr. TG botanical extracts is when you've got some of this he fought with me and made sure that I managed to get myself some as well so last time I tried this was during the wake-and-bake session think maybe three weeks ago it was a ten pound bomb and basically the history behind that is that I went into a coffee shop in London chipped in as hot group to buy a gram that cost fifty pounds what do I think about those prices I think they're outrageous this is a bit different people have now started to provide me with samples that have been imported from the states so that I can share them with you on the channel and this is going to be one of those video so I'm not gonna go into as much detail it's got a little sample just gonna show you what it looks like and then we're gonna smoke some guys so this is blue server imported from the US I think it is imported from Cali I'm not 100% calm be sure the bug itself is a completely different color so the string is blue cookies crossed with sunset sherbet so it's quite a different strength so that everyday ones that you would come across in the UK I know this bunch of those strains are big in Cali and people are bringing locally to the UK so this is a cross of both of them and the bus looks more like the blue cookie society's really respond they're actually really dense and compact and it has this fantastic coloration so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go under some part like that don't not want to be mixing this with the UK cheese mixing that we UK cheese would be like some sort of transatlantic gunk I would so yes in corn someone put in the chums bowl and we see how smokes guys the cookies and the sweetness of the sunset sherbet is really going through it is more purple than your average budget by far too greedy purple guys and I am looking forward to consume it this isn't quite the ten pound bomb but actually looking at this blue server it does actually look a little bit nicer than the one that I had previously so purple really nice sort of mixture of green and purple is great you've got some ice in the chums bunk today I've got some ice in the freezer not for you is meant to have ice in it makes it a little bit smoother not that I need it but sometimes I like do a bit differently I've invited today this is it guys gonna consume the blue shove it through the tongues bomb let you guys know how it is if you're smoking alone dabbing it on faith in along get your joints wrong get your bones ready or get your fabrics heated up and join me for this one I see your number side guys Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's quite nice especially with the ice in the bomb because and the smoke is filling up my lungs instead of it feeling like honey it's cold it's just like a nice little notification almost hmm probably should breathe out now not as intense no it's accurate and mmm that was really smooth through the bum looking at the ash it is quite [Music] reasonable I like Ray Wyatt what do I think about the taste it's not sploosh over is quite sweet get the cookies coming for a bit it is a little lacking on the taste side and particularly for import but at the same time it was really smooth really enjoyable wood if I pay you a designer wheat prices for this no will not be happy about it I did know what I paid for we should keep anagram know what and the same time was really enjoyable that's why to say about that guy and why finding it's not cool dude definitely starting to feel good the effects are more it seems more on into the side and finding relaxation at the moment just fill in a nice happy stoned feeling really is not as intense as some of the other bottoms that I've done recently on the channel it's not sort of overpowering but it is in nights that I do feel good that's a nice feeling they go guys I hope you have enjoyed a quick look at the blue sherbert Canada strain what did you think of this strain and have you tried it and what do you think of the whole sort of Cali weed in the UK let me know in the comments and I will be back with another video soon guys pokey [Music]", "w-RrFVp7j14": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy time welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one might be a little long one because i got some things to show you some stuff to talk about uh and some dabs to smoke okay so without further ado i stopped at simply pleasure here uh in hagerstown shout outs to simply pleasure thank you guys awesome i didn't have what i wanted but i got some other cool [ __ ] which is pretty [ __ ] cool i did need a new torch so i picked up the new torches the first thing i'm going to show you i thought this was pretty [ __ ] cool it's these nuts torch and check that out these nice torch lighter professional butane torch right this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope they had a couple other um you know characters like mario and uh i i don't know any of the other ones i really didn't care to look at them because they didn't catch my eye but this one and mario caught my eye uh i think it's badass i did um already put some fuel in it so nice big torch right beautiful that's exactly what i needed so i got gotta get used to get used to that thing what else did i get here all right uh i did get a new optimizer for my puffco but uh i do not think it is the right one so i might have to uh take this thing back you heard me i might have to take this thing back if it works for my for my uh puffco thing then so be it i'll use it but if not i'm gonna have to take it back i'm saying that because the same pleasure i know how you guys don't like to take [ __ ] back ain't give me a receipt and even offer so i mean my shit's on mine everything's in the in the [ __ ] there you know what i mean but first thing i want to show you guys um of course the rig it comes with a a normal uh flower banger right the normal ass [ __ ] flower banger and the one cool thing is about this if you have a round uh cartridge not like this you might be able to do it like that but if you have a round cartridge you can actually put it in like that in your ball and uh take a pull off of your pen which i have showed that uh in previous fought videos i bought a new box of dirt wipes shout out to [ __ ] dirt wipes and go anywhere without [ __ ] some dirt wipes right all right this is the cool thing here so this thing is called a uh a reclaimed banger the lady lady at the head shop sold me on this i thought this is pretty cool aspect uh what is it yeah oh i'm sorry a recycler banger for dollars okay fifteen dollars i thought this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope so you guys probably seen it on on the on the net somewhere along the line you pull this little guy out there check this out right so you heat the bottom up it has this weird looking coil type i don't know thing in there right but anyway how she explained it you put your oil when you have to heat it up and as you're you're hitting instead of the the reclaim coming out through this bank going into your rig it goes through here uh or comes back down and then up and then back in so therefore you don't waste anything it's always a cycle of of uh catching your recline so once again instead of your recline going in through here it goes down and up and then back into the [ __ ] that coil looking thingy there okay here's the aspect of that 15 okay 15 i'm just gonna sit that right there in the thing all right now let's see the actual main piece what i got you guys ready you guys know meme i like i like my little uh my little rigs but i seen this i fell in love with the colors uh this was sixty dollars ready check this thing out man i absolutely [ __ ] fell in love with it my normal size rigs you guys know it's kind of like a beaker right a beaker style um yeah i mean it does remind me of my other one there with this type style thing there but yeah check that [ __ ] thing out right uh only thing i'm worried about is these little slits you see these little slits there if they get clogged with oil uh it's gonna be a rough day you know what i mean but you guys know me i don't i don't let my [ __ ] get too [ __ ] dirty but uh yeah so that that's pretty much what we got from the head shop so check this thing out yo this thing looks sweet check that out right right down now let me get the banger they come with a uh a carb cap you guys the carb cap here all right nice big ass [ __ ] bubble carp cap and right as long as it's supposed to go straight up and like like that all right right up in the middle boom so that's uh that's everything i got from the head shop i do not recall the [ __ ] price on uh the total of what everything cost but i do know the rig was 60 that thing was 15. um the [ __ ] puffco thing was 25. this was i don't [ __ ] know it was like 120 something 130 bucks but anyway here we go so i'm going to try this out for the first time i'm just going to heat it up i kind of like sterilize it a little bit i'm gonna put some water in this uh new rig here and uh we're gonna you know do a dab but before i i do do all that i do want to show you and talk to you guys about these g-leaf cartridges okay these t-leaf cartridges i am not rolling over bubble wrap rolling over bubble wrap i am not too happy with them liquid live carts by g leaf um they didn't even last me a whole day to be honest like they were [ __ ] the headspace is just [ __ ] killer okay i bought four of them actually i bought five of them but one was distillate but so i bought four of them of the [ __ ] live resin fse full spectrum extract cartridge right here's the la chocolate i saved this one because i wanted to uh like do like a little review on it right i don't know what this one tastes like but i will tell you the um the star dog was the only one i liked i didn't like the [ __ ] the uh what is it pineapple skunk pineapple skunk live resin cartridge i did not care for uh the taste was was that's that's actually a good one there the taste is just yeah it's terrible i don't [ __ ] there's another nation so i'm just gonna say like they're nothing compared to cresco cartridges um i'm gonna hold off from buying them from now on g-leaf like your live resin cartridge are [ __ ] whack and and to me it's a waste of money like i said uh i only smoke like when i'm on break like i don't smoke throughout the day like like a normal person would like that you know just constantly puffing these [ __ ] so like i think maybe i don't know it's i don't smoke a lot it's what i'm trying to [ __ ] say and it didn't even last me a whole day which is [ __ ] ridiculous but oh with that said i do want to open up this one on camera and give you guys my opinion on this one here okay so as you see it's not opened all right not open you're gonna crack this [ __ ] open bomb there it is now check out this headspace okay all these [ __ ] headspace or just killer i thought cresco was bad like my wife is really tired of me saying oh headspace headspace headspace but look at this look at that guys that's crazy now i could say oh it was sitting down inside yeah it was sitting down inside but still i can heat this [ __ ] thing up just a hair just to get it warm and uh you will [ __ ] see the headspace in it this is crazy like i know this [ __ ] sucks into the wick i know it settles and you know i know all that but i'm just saying like that's pretty rough guys you know what i mean you're paying top dollar for for your medicine like i expect uh i expect some some you know some full stuff you know what i mean can you really taste it but hopefully that that heated up enough i mean you guys can tell just about how much head space is gonna be right down to that [ __ ] base of that coil there i can't [ __ ] see it but while we're waiting for that to uh that bubble to go down you're gonna let it sit right there um stop hating on on geely [ __ ] live resin cartridges because they [ __ ] suck and i'm never gonna buy them again uh unless they actually change something about it but like i said the only one i did like out of those four is the [ __ ] star dog that one was not bad at all but getting into the tea leaf that i did buy i did buy a two gram jar of mai thai cured sugar okay and that is right here and i'll tell you what guys this stuff right here is [ __ ] fire look at it [ __ ] fire i would suggest if you got that on your menu from g leaf there in frederick or even in rockville go pick that [ __ ] up like asap once again i'll show you guys the numbers real quick there's that cart falling over on the side that's a wrap get that right there's the numbers stay stick okay so um i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video heat this thing up get this thing nice and sterilized and then i will return all right so i'm back we got that thing uh nice and clean and fried up toasted i've been downstairs rinsed this thing out got this thing on nice and clean nice bottle of water all right let's put some water just a little bit above that huh what do you guys think i know i think maybe i have too much maybe just a little bit too much i think just a hair too much all right i believe that's good all right that is [ __ ] beautiful that is beautiful oh yeah oh yeah all right well let's try it shall we let's see all right now i believe she did say that you heat it up it did say you heat it up first so let's uh let's give it a go and see what happens huh there's a little lock thing here this is locked in here right there there it is all right there we go all right let's get it boys hopefully

every day you know I've been doing it for years and I still find myself learning that's half the fun about growing you know as long as you're willing to learn boy there's a lot of fun that you can have I enjoy just growing it as part of my therapy you know bonding with the plant is just an amazing thing you know getting to watch it come from maybe a little seed or a clone maybe and then at the very end you get all this medicine that you grew you know it makes a difference you know if you can heal your own problems with your own medicine you need to come down here so we can play some D and E

have Wow beauty Private Reserve I definitely can say that this is a tasty tasty Rolly you know and I'm finding that a lot of the pre-rolls these days you know they're using a you know good pops flour in it they're not using you know the trim good morning you know they're not using trim there yet Northwest cannabis solutions yeah a lot of these guys are you know using really good flour you know they know that somebody's gonna go buy a pre-roll and try it and if you know they like it then they might go buy that house you know or they might continue to keep buying those pre-rolls but if it's a um this one I think they're 750 if I remember right correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they're 750 there are a three quarter gram pre-roll and really tasty really well done very well flushed you

what was it an eighty dollar one out there the other day it's two grams of oil up in a gram of flour you know I don't think it even has a leaf on it it's all mmm crazy beautiful job look at that nice burn nice ash and no runs the nice thing too is you almost have every one of these has these filters on it now they don't do to just playing papers anymore so you're able to smoke your entire rolling down there and there ain't much of a roach lift you know that's nice good job Private Reserve I believe they have a website on this somewhere be my glasses I guess hmm very nice I like the flavor of the flower because it leaves that taste on your tongue Reid you know where the difference between that and a wax wax is a really flavorful doing me wrong but they don't have that staying power of the flavor where you know that's why I still like smoke and flower you know wonderful stuff wonderful stuff excellent job excellent job 3/4 Graham re-roll all flour in there I assure you flower power definitely mm-hmm I love that taste has that tingle I almost leaves a team believing on your lips mmm really good for you no wake you up get you going kind of a strain you know I noticed the other day

there that's me I still had the flavor you know that tingly flavor kind of the Hashi flavor from the sunset sherbert and that Girl Scout cookie oh wow amazing that's some great stuff I think I need one more of those before I go actually I think I got a little bit of this this was some this was a Dutch haze was from another company that tried this was more of a shatter shatter definitely has the the Dutch treat flavor to it nice alright I know my needs to be cleaned a little bit again I was like every few days it gets gross fire in the hole a Dutch treat flavor mmm almost like candy Wow now I'm running my rig a little hot to the most beep I guess I run it right around 700 you know kind of depends on preference I know that some people run this down closer like 650 you know it kind of depends on what you want I kind of tend to like it yeah some people think it's a little hot I even run it up to a you know seven thirty I kind of like that you know that really big kind of a hit you know as long as you don't earn the terpenes so it doesn't taste good you know the lower temperatures are really flavorful they're really good for like a live resins horizons you know we have a real huge turkey profile that you don't want to burn off you want to enjoy it you know so lower temp dabs are just great for those it's something like a shatter you know I tend to do it a little hotter you know there's not as an inter beans in there you know the terpene profile hasn't been a long time paired to the good wax or a sugar tur so anyway thanks for tuning in educate elevate and enjoy one love", "u3jSUdHLe7w": "alright alright today we're gonna be looking at sunset sherbert and fruit punch from the green door been going them a little bit more recently since I'm more in their neighborhood here and they're looking good looking good both $25 16th although this is a lie right here it says 20 I should have told her maybe a change that [ __ ] but came out of 47 1/8 for both of them so uh yeah this is a hybrid this is a indica is it a hybrid indica dominant out [ __ ] though I forget I forget what they advertise it as everybody advertise this [ __ ] differently alright just zoom in real quick so you can see that frost the green door you'll never be disappointed they always got some good [ __ ] this fruit punch really smells really [ __ ] fruity that's for sure macro this [ __ ] all right well let's [ __ ] macro it I haven't smoked it yet but it smells lovely both of them do be real quick alright and here's our macro of the fruit punch looking [ __ ] spectacular of

necklace of this [ __ ] the gold chain this is bling alright let's go straight to that sherbert right over here to the right side sherbert looking a little different not as purpley sunset sherbert is usually a purple this can't be the real sunset servers I know I guys we're all wheat snobs here but we got to appreciate hourly so it looks really good smells really good but but is it the real sense of service probably not is it a form of cookies most likely most likely so he snobs out this dude truth cookies mixed with um final G and shut the [ __ ] up you're not smoking like I am that's the end

do you really think you're smoking more loud than me alright", "E3PdK6oWQ50": "hey y'all trevor here with ready to leave and today we're gonna be tapping into a new citizen stash strain the sunset sherbert i'm really excited to try this train out and uh get going on you guys we're gonna get the intro in right now before we start rattle off the information and get into this urban scale and the full one hitter read review y'all cheers and i'll see you on the other side welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into citizen stash's sunset sherbert for this monday indica review so the sunset sherbert from citizen stash came in with a thc total of 21.9 percent thc a cbd total of 0.19 cbd and it was packaged on the 4th of august 2020 so it is relatively fresh bud uh we've got the citizen stash website pulled up that's going to give us all the information for the strain so it is going to be a 60 40 indica dominant split so it's closer to that hybrid strain the sunset sorbet or sorbet sunset sherbert is a scrumptious and fruity strained tasting of sherbet bubblegum and berries and has notes of force like freshness this is an indica dominant hybrid 85 percent that is potent cross between the hugely popular girl scout cookies and pink panties strain this dank bud boasts a mellow thc level sunset sherbet buds have enormous oversized dense christmas tree shaped nugs colored a lightly minty green and covered with long twisty fiery orange hairs these nugs are caked with a thick layer of frosty white trichomes that are sticky with delicious resin as with all citizen stash products these buds are pesticide free hand harvested and hand trimmed they also have the total terpenes which are going to range from 8 to 11 milligrams per gram you've got 28 percent of that being lemonine 23 being beta carefully 11 being linen all and nine percent being beta meristem and then the rest of the 29 percent that's going to be in there are going to be a combination of other strains or not strains but terpenes so the uh the lemonade beta caroline and the linolol have me interested to see how this combination is going to uh work well together you guys but the only way we're really going to find which terpene is dominant and uh find which terpene we like the most out of this drain is by cracking in and trying it out you guys so uh we're gonna get that urban scale intro in here right now and we're gonna tap into this bud see you guys on the other side when we got this container cracked open and we're taking our first looks and smells of this string cheers i'll see you over there okay guys so we got that seal there and it's gown ooh very very big packed buds nice and massive size let's just dump this whole eight though very very big bugs throughout definitely getting oh it's got a sweetness to it it's not really overpowering it i do get like the hints of that kind of sweet bubble gum flavor kind of a berry aroma too it does have kind of a an earthy touch peppery touch to it as well that beta carefully pushing through that i enjoy it's got really dark almost purple coatings on some of the nugs and then that deep green the orange pistols are shooting out like these are very beautiful looking nugs you guys here let's bring this one in so you guys can try and get a look at it come on you're not gonna focus for me on the nug very very beautiful looking dogs very nice color transition through i am thoroughly thoroughly impressed at how nice these buds smell and um how well they're taken care of just because the aroma isn't overwhelming and really isn't pushing through that much i can't give it higher than a nine um if it was extra stain sticky extra dank the aroma i think would have more of an appeal for me but that there's too many little hints of flavor that i can't really get my thumb on for me to thoroughly enjoy this strain the way that that i think at its top echelon top quality i think would get it but just that little bit of drying out and uh effect it's had sitting on the shelf had a little bit of a downward spiral for me you guys but we're busting up in the hippie butler grinder i'm gonna see on the other side we've got the joint rolled up the bongs packed the vaporizer ready to go and we're smoking it through the pipe i will see you guys on the other side of this urban review when uh we're actually getting into this shisha hey guys so we're gonna start out with the vaporizer we're gonna turn this sucker on and we're going to start out at 175 degrees celsius at the 175 degrees we're going to primarily be boiling off not burning off but boiling off the limonene and the marisonine terpene so we're going to be getting that lemon and mango primarily through the 175 temp before we bump up to the 205 and at that level we start to get the rest of the terpenes playing in and boiling off so when you get to that 205 range you get a lot more of the rich flavors the chocolate the cheese the cushy flavors you start to get all of those other terpenes playing a factor and affecting the way the bud tastes after that we bump up to the 220 which is primarily where the beta-carotene and the thc are going to be bowling boiling off at their highest levels so you're going to feel the heaviest effect you're going to have the beta carefully which gives you a woody peppery kind of taste i've been finding through this vaporizer and that's really what you're gonna expect to experience through these three temperatures we've got the 175 ready to go we got the sunset sherbet loaded in here and uh warming up let's see what the terpenes boil off at the 175 before we bump up to the 205 and the 220 to finish it off you guys cheers and let's get into this very dewey i can definitely get hints of that lemon but there's kind of a doughy taste too i don't know if doughy's the right yeah doughy's right word for it it's kind of that cookie taste that lemon cookie taste that i'm not actually mining at all right now you guys it's it's quite tasty we got the 205 ready to go let's take our first haul through here and see how uh tasted this time wow that beta carefully is already playing a factor in this 205. so still getting that really rich cookie doughy flavor like cookie dough flavor the lemon's balancing in there but it's more of an undertone instead of the overwhelming flavors that i was getting at the 175. the sherbet's got kind of a cushy tone to it that i'm liking a really light hint to it with that dough being a balanced off kind of a flavor now we've got a bump at the 220 you guys and uh let's see if we get that woody peppery combo that i'm starting to get a little bit and then i was getting actually a little bit of at the 205. yeah i went to a raw pepper flavor but at the same time it lets that lemon cookie that cookie dough even the cushy cookie dough kind of taste come in after and and kind of push the pepper out it's very well balanced for the terpenes on this you guys like you get that spice in that pepper kick right off the bat and then it just melds melts and mends and molts into this really sweet lemon cookie dough kind of a flavor and it's rich it is very rich flavor but it's not overwhelming you guys i think a 9 is the best i'm gonna be able to give this strain just because it bounces around a little bit too much for my liking but saying that if that's all i've got that the flavor bounces around a little bit too much from one to the next to the next i can't really say that's a bad thing honestly if it's if it's like that where bounces and bounds from one flavor to the next to the next to the next i enjoy strains like that quite a bit you guys and this one just had too much bounding in it too much change from one flavor to the next too quickly so that you don't really get to enjoy and dig in to the flavors that you were first experiencing and that's honestly where that point's getting docked but i think it's a fair reason to dock that point you guys we're gonna move on over into the bongs now we're gonna start smoking out of some glass the way we do our bongs is we started out with hemp wick then we move to a straight clipper lighter and we finish it off finally with a torch lighter the reason we do this is that lets us ignite the bud at three different temperatures really taste the three different flavors that you can get from the different ignition sources and temperatures as well as the different size glass is going to give us all different um what's a good word for it just not display but um different personalities that's the word we're going to use today different personalities that these buds have with the different ignition source and size of glasses smoking it through as well as the intensity of the bud bigger balls bigger bones but we're going to light up the hemp wick we're going to take our first taste through our cheat rig here i love smoking out this little bubble cheap drink and uh yeah i'll see you guys after three hoots uh when we're marking up and scoring the taste for mobile y'all cheers and with two nines already i'm expecting this budget to do incredibly well see you guys on the other side of these do good we're back y'all so we had a little bit of an interruption halfway through this review after the three bomb rip so i'm gonna smoke one more fat one with you and then uh i'll end up giving you guys the score and the reasoning why we're giving it a nine out of a ten today y'all so let's smoke this bowl and we'll chat about it afterwards cheers so oh it's delicious you guys ooh and hempwick definitely has to be my favorite way to light it up so as i said before that rip we are giving it a 9 out of a 10 for the taste from a bong i found let's start with the smallest and work our way to the biggest if i want the smaller rig it had kind of a spicy sweet undertone to it but overall it wasn't that flavorful and uh we lit that one up with the hemp wick when we moved over to the we moved over to the nice glass beaker bong and we lit it with uh just a clipper i found the sweet smoke transitioned into a really heavily cushy cookie flavor like that cookie dough flavor was extremely present in the last two rips especially um the last one okay let's get a little water and help this out better much better so the last one had kind of a sweet woody smoke to start off with and then it transitioned into a really really sweet cookie dough flavor like the the girl scout cookies side of this sunset sherbet strain is really coming on dominant through the bongs and i'm absolutely enjoying it so we're gonna move on over into the pipe now we've got the crave straight pipe here packed up we're gonna light this sucker up with actually let's do the hemp work again today let's um light this pipe up before we move on into the joint you guys so uh cheers and let's see how tasty this strain is through this crave straight pipe y'all cheers eight out of a ten for the taste for my pipe it went a lot stronger in that woody dominant flavor i didn't get as much of the rich cookie and that kind of cushy tone that we've been getting through the bongs and a little bit through the vaporizer and a little bit disappointing but that sweet kind of woody flavor that i got at the beginning of the cyclone bong rep was definitely present through that pipe the entire time you guys and uh i didn't mind it but it's not the same as what we were tasting through the bongs that i really enjoyed but we've got our elements paper rolled up here we're going to take a couple of dry holes off of this see how it tastes before we move on into lighten it up and smoking it you guys really rich like it's got that lemon meringue pie flavor to it almost and that my friends is quite quite interesting to check out but got the joint ready to go let's light it up and see how it tastes y'all see about halfway through hey guys so we're going to give this a 10 out of a 10 for the taste from a droid this is honestly one of the best tasting fruity indicas i have had to smoke in a while at the beginning of the joint i got a huge dump of just a very raw and rich citrus flavor like it wasn't by any means like a super lemon haze where you're tasting lemon candies but it was a very airy like where you can search for the flavor and find it where you have to go searching for that flavor then you get about halfway and you start to get this really well blended um cookied not quite earthy but rich cookie not not even that that chocolate side but just just a raw rich flavor that ends up leaning towards that cookie dough flavor blending with that citrus to get a really i found lemon meringue pie taste to it and then eventually transitioning into just that raw of cookie dough flavor that i'm loving right now 10 out of 10 for the joint absolutely and then for the high you guys i'm gonna give it a 10 as well very clear-headed but incredibly relaxing like it's a huge body relaxation body ease even mental tension kind of an ease doesn't give you that mental drift so much as just the whoo like just chilling out you guys for your body and i'm finding the mental clarity with this high is really really enjoyable i could get into video games i could get into something like that um like a long distance run even this the strain seems interesting like i absolutely loved smoking up that joint you guys but uh yeah it was incredible how much the overall high balances out with that flavor and it gives you that nice uplifting cerebral clarity that i find with heavy limonene strains has and that nice body relaxation and ease at the beta carefully has especially when those two are the top two um terpenes i find this really well balanced high you guys but we're going to wrap this sucker up it got a 55 out of 60 for it's overall easily easily beautiful herbage it tastes incredible only five points stocked overall wow citizen stash you have been knocking me on my ass every time i pick up one of your strains i have been thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed the sage and sauer really is the only one that i can't say is in a top tier list for me after i smoked it but

that being and i will be back later with some more content you", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it

smokes and I'm all peace oh it's real merry smokes real merry smokes ok don't forget some real medicine", "nxlld7RYbgk": "hi welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing the buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge strain on this one is sherbert or sherbet i don't i don't know not really sure if they spelled that wrong or what but buddies liquid diamonds live resins are pretty much my go-to card as of right now they're very good quality i would say like gold standard of quality for their price um you can get slightly better stuff but you're gonna end up paying part uh prices that i i wouldn't consider worth it anymore so these are a very good cartridge itself very good oil inside it's very consistent it's very terpy and has a good effect every single time so you know what you're getting so let's get into the packaging and then i will open it up try it out and we'll see what i think all right so here's the packaging up close as you can see i buy a lot of these they even give me a bulk buff for them um let's grab one of these out here i've taken the sticker off so you can see they put the price sticker over these so not too much being missed on these sides luckily so i'll toss that aside here so we got what are we looking at here it's 72.27 percent thc one point zero seven percent cannabidiol um seventy eight point five percent total cannabinoids in indica but um if you ask me straight names or indica steve doesn't need anything anymore with cross breeding we'll get the side information let you pause that and read it if you want to and then you have nothing on that side nothing on the bottom buddies logo on the top and then i love about these is you got the terp profile well at least top three so you can kind of know what you're going to be getting into some more info there the verification that rc number um i got this one because it has humulene in it i've been really looking for that but you'll find a lot of these that's not a good example but a lot of these are much more terpy let's see if i can find i've had these come up to 16 turks and it was just like ridiculous okay it's funny now i can't even find them so maybe they are average i would say six to nine percent terpenes for the distillates closer to uh like one to four percent there we go there's those are two so yeah this stuff's pretty terpy it's good stuff though i'll get to open it now all right let's get into it my vessel rolling around here pop it open here i don't remember what that says when i focus then you got that which just fell out but that's all right um you got the tube that it always comes in pretty sure it's upside down which will list a thc enabled cbd instead of cbg then card itself it's a very nice looking liquid live resin i found this stuff which i think is usual for live resin can occasionally be even like a little bit liquid at room temp flowing somewhat freely and stuff but i believe that just um was with the two that were extremely derpy like 12 to 14 percent so i always take the stickers off here i'll finish up later now let's pop it in excited to see what sherbet sherbet is like and right away that's just such a smooth hit the pool has like some nice resistance you get amazing vapor from it so i love that draw tip it's really pretty slick all right so i mean taste wise the last couple i had were about almost like double the terpene yeah terpene content so this one's kind of weak for me but really hard to pin down actually it's very neutral but um i would just say it's like it's it's vaguely vaguely sweet vaguely herbal that humiliating adds something i'm trying to describe it because humulin is what is in hops and beer so if you know that flavor that's what i'm getting from this you'll see a lot of this stuff you'll probably um if you want to look into terpenes ever you'll know that a lot of other foods and stuff have these terpenes so you can get an idea of what you're going to taste which is what i love about these carts they show you so yeah we're getting um cardio filling which is like kind of peppery it's almost the same amount with limonene so those are matching up with a kind of citrusy taste and then it's kind of complemented by like a a hoppy taste which i'm not a beer drinker and especially whenever i was it was nothing hoppy at all i do not like ips or anything so i'm not familiar with that i can't really like explain it well but that's what it would taste like if you know that so really really a good cart for thirty dollars i paid um thirty six dollars for recreational users i have my med card definitely recommend that i recommend at least trying it if you usually go for a distillate card or any other ones this is like my go-to so hope you enjoyed the video i'm going to be trying to get another one here because i picked up some distillate syringes and i'll be getting those once my ceramic cartridges come in so hope to see you then thanks for watching", "wRJsIeo7JH4": "so which mc1r le gonna set back sleepers rave CDJs Oh [ __ ] ed want that I bought the ten ten pack I was back in the day [Music] so yeah that's a most terrible things but this is this is UK sunset from Africa flavors they could say the following if so many tickets as well so need is show me the Mac is well actually so big replay was forming the pain yes yes no yes therefore I will play this pick up yourself cause yeah so May Monday really brought obviously the maximum is this organizations that share the UK person said they'd seen the sherbert was originally grew by [ __ ] skis you've gotta do [ __ ] excuse back to the back there originally Grande much spin skis it's a cross of Gill scrap cookies obviously really famous parentage crossed with pink panties which is an illustrator I believe students keeps make themselves but if someone said sure but it's really well with well-known a lot France do their own sunset sugar and sunset sherbet is part of the parent genetics of gelato which of course is one of the most famous trains from these last few years or whatever they're really coming out in a giant slot it's a really big thing now so yeah this is sort of the parent of July on Black Sea originally grown by Pinsky's this strain itself has played a huge role in the kind of if seen sunset Sherbourne and be sort of the way the flowers have gone the way stars right nowadays but yeah I'm not saying this is a fully sample of it you can't go in before she I don't know the actual grammar of this book I wish it did I wish would have tell you through exactly through this because series props to that grabber but yeah so really swimming sample so what we'll do is I'll show you the convinced from one you know I've got chance to touch record the board I'll get to some things that you wanna think about the book once you've seen it few Souls okay so this is the last room I'm gonna show you I don't know if I'm gonna do a review on this I think I'm going to I haven't gotten those of it but I think [ __ ] you I'm gonna make sure I get reviewed on it because this is some UK drone sunset sure but some UK going sunset sure but I've got to say it's blown me away I'll Schmitz a little bit of this well for UK math flavours sort of you this normal UK private sort of three five I smoked a little bit of it as another little knob that smokes off let me get this open and we'll show you properly because for UK this is some seriously seriously impressive just got that poured out like to say this is the UK grown Somersetshire but look at the colors look at the TRICARE coverage you know I've just shown on to probably two separate videos the Mac one and the white cherry gelato Bev had a really good try clean coverage but look at this you know it's keeping up with the baby it's not quite so eleven Mack these are nice dense foods you know and if you're going to hear that a narcotic nice and dense pods have all come really consistent these are the two sort of smaller ones as well already nice and dense Corbin in trichomes actually I've smoked one of these as well and it spoke really nicely really nice and set sherbert lever yeah sort of sherbety but clean smoking flavor I've got to say I've never seen a UK batch of sunset sherbet quite to this standard it's one I've smoked before from Cali and from UK I'm not sure I've ever even had a Cali batch this standard you know whoever grew this serious props serious serious props really is schooling board and you know lacks a standard UK prices this wasn't expensive it wasn't anything like that it was just [ __ ] with good board good price shout out to my flavors who sought me this in the Mac see those Purple's as well man you know it's not all green it's a certainty lots of purple puss in there quite carefully or sort of read as a Mac this one definitely has some impressive looks to it I think just it's almost more like an archive very similar very similar smash a tile you can tell the sea jalaja has this in it if that makes sense yeah well sick event I really enjoyed that really nice ball pit talk from the UK and from Cali let's get the smoking it want to go back to a four of you so as you can see really fire you know for a UK grown sample this has got bag appeal for absolute days when I saw this you know I only paid UK prices versus you know one syringe some all the UK flavors my pad and they all look really nice when I saw this I fought it down that is looking something special I open the pack smell it before damn it it's got some really nasty if anyone hasn't really felt clean to its it so I thought [ __ ] it I'm gonna I'm gonna cop it and I'm so glad I did like say I'm just after this last note now or you're crazy I mean the back appeal on this really is crazy it's got basically mainly green but it has these purples that ruled from it as well and that do certainly give it quite a schooling sort of look to it it's got really really high densities a really really nice and dense board really good put structure as well you know it looks sort of like you know that so what you see you know that someone's dreaming in a few credit or pipes how you want you want to be structured it will probably look something like that's if a back appeal I've got to say this is winning you know all days on some UK boards I mean really and truthfully someone could have repackage this and sold it is coming it's that nice it smokes that nicely it's got those sort of tips that remind a lot people of sort of caddy meat they're sort of sherbet eat gelato sort terms and me personally I enjoy smoking when I can smoke that back your strength and then example I've smoked skittles we all have an ass make grapefruit as well I think it's quite interesting Sun has been snowed up straight in the smokers parent and see how the speeds are different and I quite find it this quite interesting with the Sun so sure but I'm chef smoked a large alato smoked sausage over the fall but this is a particularly fire back I do you think it's interesting to see you know turn wise the character characteristics of gelato tape took away from this you can see where the sweetness of the July comes from you can see where that almost should be terms of July and do you sort of share coming from and when you consider that you know each crossed with like Thin Mint cookies or Girl Scout cookies or whatever you know you're like that cross might be to make your gelato you can see how those two different ones work together to me that final product if that makes sense anyway that's what I personally think without that smoke some of these strains that sunset sure but I'm gonna go back and smooth these over got a parent strains I find it quite interesting to see how the characteristics are the same I'll have a different this one though like I say it's got those nice sweet sugary Terps it's got this always sort of like candy sort of berry sort of fruity sort of taste it's not overly fruity but it's more like that just sweet all those sugary salt sugar that candy sure that terms which is just a really impressive general I mean it's a really really nice smoke it's burning white again if you can see that I'm probably the back camera so I'll show you that but it's been reading back nice and cleanly maybe not quite the same level looking Eunice's like the Mac for example that I've got the next review coming up but about comparing this for the white rose right over the white chair which it is but in pretty nice and wide and clean this is very close to that maybe not quite the same level certainly very close I mean for a UK board like to say the price of paying for it you know this this cost exactly half the pack half the price of the of the white cherry gelato and this isn't half as good put it that way this is far better than half as good as that white coat alone and it costs half the price so you've got to add all this sort of factors up and see it's you know redeeming qualities but it might not have for example the most heavy sort of hitting effect well it doesn't last effect it's an indica dominant hybrid by the way there's it does have mass spect but it's not the heaviest you know straightness may be factor Y Trevor's live certainly a heavier smoke than this and but like to say for a UK grown good fire absolutely fire a really really nice example of sunsets sure but I'm glad I got this as well this is straining that white stuff on the channel and there's a strain that a lot of people smoked or what to smoke so I'm glad to have this really nice batch of sunset sugar off the channel you know I've seen other cutting producers and some of that sunset sugar smoke so we can be producing some set sherbet and I've not necessarily have enough to quite make this statement but I'm gonna say it right I'm a [ __ ] I would say anyway I think this is probably better than certain Cuddy producers sunset sure but [ __ ] I would say jungle boys I've seen two little boys that share better smoke monsters bed and it was fire don't get me wrong but in my opinion this [ __ ] looks bad and this [ __ ] tastes just as good and this [ __ ] is gonna cost there's someone like me half the price so certainly a little bitty of factors there and I think if I do get down to giving this what a Radian I am gonna give it a nine point five out of ten it's certainly got or the back appeal the wampum it's coming in trichomes nice colors lovely structure certainly got really nice tips to it as well but for me to give it sort of a high mark I'd want maybe a stronger smoke but also tips are maybe prefer you not to mean like this - it's really nice it's really clean you know example of the third but these sort of sherbet herbs don't quite do it between the same way that a well-executed July some cleaning turtle doing if that makes sense so for that reason I'm giving 9.5 still though absolute fire you know I mean nine foot 5 a really good score if you don't want some over videos put into context are some really five words a lot did it make nine point five to stuff like that and so now I'm 25 I'm going to give an attempt I've been super impressed a bit again another five you cable of the channel they got my flavors people everyone of the season obsession yeah blacks a was a forty six eight Saturday there's one of the little sort of spoils that I've come in with it's a ucation set sherbet now for five ten will give that and like to say the next review that's going to be coming at you will be be the Mac one by in real high og am I going to say you know anything them now but yeah that's that's something special if you haven't seen them Instagram I mean certainly something special certainly gonna be a high scoring board well yeah I'll leave that to that review that state you've enjoyed this video give us a comment it was like you know subscribe water that could have stuff just makes onset sure you thought this and if you smoke someone said sure but and maybe your back wasn't looking quite as good as this no be honest I mean it might be smoking dog lately maybe no I was telling you buddy in smoking ugly but if you're bad for looking quartz but is this maybe you're smoking on the cutting producer let us know agent I mean that let's have a chat about it but I could say I've been impressed by this by this exact bachelor Versalles a sherbert it's family this was grown in the UK yeah someone's done bits of this I wish I knew who had some give the proper props but yeah me got mouth for a mouthful and as a sort of in his pack and I'm saying we'll be back a year again with another review real soon", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway

Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for

sherbert from purple City genetics and I just wanted to give you an update you've been really busy around here so haven't had a chance to show you much but I be ceiling look at how beautiful and frosty she's looking I want to show you the difference here this little guy over here to the right that I'm zooming in on right there this one was stuck underneath some leaves and as you see to get any frost and compared to some of the ones that have been getting the light it's incredible the difference so I went ahead and cut the leaves off a bit exposed it and brought her around but I just wanted to give you kind of an update she did take a little bit of a nutrient burn I overfed her but I dialed that back with a be 16 minutes and I started using that turbinator this past week so we'll see how that helps and all I can say is this is probably the most fragrant most beautiful plant I've ever ever brought I mean it is just out of control the lower bud sides here as you can see just

all these cookie smells beautiful take care you guys bye", "OM5r3zFdvPg": "so real quick before I even start the video I figured the reason you clicked on it was to find out how to see if a Wankel oil card is fake so let's just go over that really quickly first up the Wonka oil label will be raised but every individual letter will be embossed into the packaging as you can see this is raised but every letter is like the same texture so that's not a good sign secondly up here it should say Wonka's Cecil not Wonka ceramic and thirdly there should be a sticker in every package that was your quick thirty second guide on how to tell a real Wonka oil cart now let's get into the video [Music] all right hey guys what's up it's you boy mr. bling seat back again with another video today I'm gonna be doing a little rapid-fire review of these Wonka oil carts I am 99% sure these are fakes but as I'm unboxing them I'm gonna actually like look at them very closely and confirm whether or not my suspicions are correct um so yeah let's get into it I'm gonna start by looking at this trainwreck Wonka oil cart the reason I think that these are fake are the boxart for starters it's a lot more faded than the actual box art you'll get from Wonka loyal carts 'as it has the same writing on the back as the normal packages from what I can find online but the thing is when you open a true Wonka oil cart and you pull it out there should be a stick I don't have a sticker they come with a little Wonka oil sticker so you can like put it places and I guess the fakes they didn't decide to like recreate the sticker that long ago oil gives the cart feels heavy the wax looks a nice color and let's see if it moves at all it looks like it's barely moving so that's a good sign for this being a fake cart but that being said even that TKO cart I looked at uh moves really slowly also there's a white ring on the inside of the cecil atomizer and a lot of you guys in the comments have been telling me that the white ring means that it's a fake sea salt atomizer so that also is discouraging considering the fact that like you know you're buying these carts you want to have good atomizers with them the wax is still barely moving but that just could be because they mix it with something hella thick so I won't be able to know the quality of the distillate until I actually get to vape on them so imma go ahead and open the other box for you guys just so you can see that one maybe that one's like a real cart um but yeah I'm open the other box and then we'll go ahead and take our first puffs okay so next up we're gonna be opening the savage easel Wonka this one looks like it's already been looking a little bit before that's discouraging I don't think whoo I got these from would take out the stickers but like they're still out there here's the card let's check the wax quality same as with the last card it moves barely at all like that I'm really happy with it and I'm really hoping that these end up being decent because like I'm tired of buying really crappy fake carts it's got the white ring which means that it's a fake see cell atomizer so just like the other current I'm pretty sure this one's a fake so let's go ahead and puff on them see if they taste good at lease or if they hit hard and then hold you take a day to review them like usual and I'll come back at y'all tomorrow all right so to cut down on time I already loaded my vapes with the carts this is the train wreck and this is the Sour Diesel oh these are DAB cap compatible so I'm going to be hitting them through the deaf cap as well as hitting them just through the vape so first off we're gonna go with the sour diesel off the seesaw silo just to hit it see how it tastes and see how it rips so cheers guys okay it's not hitting like immediately and I don't know if I've like screwed on my vape thing too tight so let's see if that was the case okay so no it wasn't the fact that I screwed on my date base too hard it's just not hitting this is gonna be really disappointing I'm unscrewing it and it smells like how these discipline cards usually smell like so I doubt that it's like fake fake fake fake like a bad fake so let's just try it one more time I'm not even getting a draw on it I don't understand what's going on okay I might be experiencing technical difficulties with my silo so I'm gonna see if it hits off the m3 so cheers on that hopefully oh that tastes really good that actually tastes amazing there wasn't that much draw resistance on it at all after hating it off of this battery um the taste was amazing and it felt really smooth if you notice I didn't even call and I'm pretty sure I got a good vapor cloud so I'm gonna hit it off the dab cap real quick just to show you like how it will rip through a piece so cheers on that [Music] [Music] it really does taste very good so like I'm a fan of that that's the train wreck so after trying nated the Sour Diesel off of the Cecil m3 I noticed that it didn't even work either I'll show you guys real quick it's not hitting so I'm gonna have to transfer the distillate from this car to another atomizer and hope it works then so I'm very happy I ended up buying an actual Cecil atomizer so before I get to the other half of the video I'm just going to take one more rip of this trainwreck through the dab cap through this guy cactus right from pepper and then we'll get to the other half so I will see y'all tomorrow Cheers [Music] and that really does taste amazing I'm very happy about this train wreck at least so yep see you tomorrow guys all right so rapid-fire review on both of these carts first off the Sour Diesel after changing it to a sea salt atomizer easily my favorite out of both of these this cart hits right up with the grates of this channel like the dab woods carts and the dank vape I'm going to show you it through the dab cap real quick and then I'll talk about it a little bit so Cheers alright so the sour D it's like a tank three rips out of a dab cap is amazing with this cart it's easily enough to get you a good buzz and even sometimes get you high depending on how long your hits are five hits and I am fried for a good two and a half to three hours I would highly recommend getting these carts but if they're fakes switching them to better atomizers because I'm sure they would hit better that being said the train wreck it hits alright just not nearly as well as the Sour Diesel out of that new atomizer that being said this one worked from the box versus the other one where I had to actually transfer it thoughts on this cart the highs are okay but they take forever to get I think six rips from this cart or what gets me high and I have to like keep smoking just to keep the high going um the high off of this cart can best be described as just feeling tired and kind of heavy headed but also relaxed so that was a good thing um the high on the Sour Diesel though was very energetic it helped me focus a bit so I was very excited about that but yeah let me go ahead and take a rip out of this through the dab cap just to show y'all and then we'll go ahead and wrap up [Music] so as you can see the cloud wasn't as good but it was still pretty smooth um but it's not really gonna get me high it takes quite a few rips out of this atomizer to get me high overall I would give the Sour Diesel in this new atomizer an 8 out of 10 and I would give the trainwreck in the regular atomizer a 6 out of 10 that being said they both got overall positive reviews so I have something special planned for our final hit we'll be right back so this is something I usually do for my friends on snapchat but uh I've hooked both of these carts up to the dually from hemp er and a dab cap so I'm gonna hit them both at the same time through a rig I'm gonna try to do a blinker so uh stay tuned for that let's go so you know nothing can mentally prepare me for doing this but anyways if y'all made it to you into this video thank you so much please like and subscribe and leave in the comments some ideas for other upcoming videos I have a few ideas but I'm always looking to like see what y'all want to see on the channel I plan on doing a timebomb for a thousand subs cuz we're about to hit that I'm so excited and thank you all for 500 like I think that time I'm uploading this out be at 600 but like I'm blown away by the support I'm receiving thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart and there's blinkers for y'all so let's go cheers guys [Music] compilation' bees", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration breaks video and you'll be chillin just fine so god I feel like I have to Kaufman try get it out there we go ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to start just off the taste potency I'm feeling it for sure I'm feeling like really loose just chill just you know a good vibe just feeling myself I send it real weird I don't know I just feel like some popping out some good music after this hydration break just chillin y'all having a real x19 place me game that I do not know but let's do one more and then we'll call it there and I'll let you guys do something else with your life and not waste it you know I'm saying I feel like I'm

honest I've been cabin driving on some catch it like I have honestly had maybe this would be my third raw garden cartridge that I uh that I cop ever and I haven't reviewed a single one with you guys yeah I know I'm a [ __ ] my bad yeah go ahead and on me I deserve it but guess what we're reviewing one today and out of all three I'm not gonna lie out of all three it's weird because I've had - I had kaleidoscope cookies and I had the Girl Scout cookie pie that's right and then the one that I just got yesterday is lime mojito and that one it's the I want to say out of all three that one's the darkest one out of all three it's a little well they're all very light but you guys know that when you see raw garden you expect like super clear but yeah I know this shit's good it's some good oh shut up all I have all I present raw garden carts are [ __ ] bomb but don't like color uh you know like fool you just because they're not like that's stupid stupid clear don't mean this fire I got that [ __ ] lime mojito bro it's my favorite flavor I'm not gonna lie it tastes like a legit dad brought like honestly it reminds me of some field if you guys go on my videos down in my channel I actually did a review on some field or is it turn oval and that's exactly what it reminds me of tastes so good no lie bruh but anyway enough of me talking about it how about I show it to you then we take some dabs from the dab cap hit the pen a few times you know how we're supposed to hit it and then we'll take the crazy dab let's go so as you can see this is the half gram one lime mojito total Casey eight milligrams it didn't see the percentages in percentage oh yeah right there eighty 1.95 sativa honestly bro this is why I love it it has that straight sativa tape I love it I love it I love it I love it lab results alright and here's the cartridge itself yeah yes sir the raw guard easy yes sir honestly y'all obviously you can see chill out on my bed not catchable might again yes eat that oh yes sir do it we're gonna take a few ribs like this and then we'll get to it you know the usual routine that we're starting to do on this channel and get down by the car once again if you're new to this channel no we're not going to open the car like a dumb idiot that's some childish that sounds like some high school [ __ ] we are not gonna open it and take a dive out of it don't act like you haven't tried to eat it don't lie to yourself don't play yourself stop lying don't do that just got yourself a dead cat bro future boo review on the day I've kept coming soon I promise next video will be the dad cat video other than that we will now be ripping this and then we will take a dive out of the deck so without further ado let's hit it and I can't wait I haven't added a cigar work so you would not mine my bad y'all I just I think I'm gonna get canned Oh Cheers cuz this [ __ ] kills me and if you guys are familiar with my channel you know I'd be caught in a storm alright Cheers [Music] best parts in the game hold on before anybody hate for me raw garden are the best cards in the game next these infield cards no cap on the field cards to field sauce cards are more expensive for a whole gram $55 well Sarge bubs you know some if you're lucky you'll get a club that has raw gardens for 55 a program some will be more expensive I've seen clever they got full grant overall garden for 70 but anyway best my opinion best carts in the game would have to be raw garden field and bezel they got it Moxie got some good cards but these live resident regarding cards literally tastes like the sauce and live resin and that they serve in grams for you to dab no cap this should just look giddy do you not see me I'm I'm late bro I feel like I took a DAB and when you hit this [ __ ] with a DAB cabro oh my god it defeats the purpose of a DAB that's what's amazing about these raw gardens and like you know good quality cartridges on this honestly I do not smell gardeners I don't so you'll only see studies for you guys content purposes I don't talk cards I don't cough distilled wax I don't cop that and if you seen the cards it's gonna be a live resin car or a sauce car I don't cop distill or disel it clear I don't cop that I'm honestly honest to god I'm scared of it you guys see this scar right here I'm kind of like I only smoke you know cannabis dabs carts very rare but you're starting to see them now on this channel he's got a point because of the content and because that's what you guys are all on and you know we're trying to provide education on all cannabis products but I don't really to play on the safe side I don't like carts but bro brah Gardens are safer you can't go wrong with them 1:7 Tenri releases their [ __ ] cards because i heard their cars were damaged last day we release their carts because some of them were defective leaking and stuff it's game over they're gonna be number one they already have live resin pods I don't think anyone's done it except for packs with the liquid or diamonds or the sauce pods or pecs but yeah those are the ones anyway let's take another look [Music] all right when it comes to like flavor okay here's here's a better analysis when it comes the cartridges that tastes more like their wax or the brands wax sold in individual grams that's when you know it's good this tastes like if you bought a [ __ ] cart or I mean I'm sorry if you bought a gram of sauce from this exact same flavor and you just melted it and put it in the cart that's what it tastes like filled their sauce pens same thing it tastes like you just grabbed some sauce and you [ __ ] injected some [ __ ] on some oil in here some of the sauce in here that's what it tastes like if they if you have a part and you've tried that brands you know concentrate like dabbing it and then that brand has cartridges and their cartridges taste like the individual grams that you can dab you're winning you're winning but because that's what this is doing right here these cartridges taste exactly like their individual librarians sauces and diamonds so you guys can go wrong with the Royal Guards bro all right unloaded don't feel much it what do you say we you know take things a step beyond and dab with the raw garden let's go all right y'all so I'm back at the damn station restaurant Depot anyway back to the video so right here we got the raw garden the raw guard easy with the attachment the dab cap the dead cat all right now let's get do doing do all right y'all I decided to get back on my bed cuz to be honest I wasn't running accountable like comment subscribe you enjoy this video yarder with you leave a comment with any suggestions on the new reviews you guys would like to see I'm calling it with this laughs it don't know what to do wake the [ __

their cartridges and programs on their concentrate right and you know just let it you know the cartridges are going to be very very raw oil it's not going to have any kind of reintroduction to any kind of like cannabinoids or terpenes so just be very aware of that when purchasing it it gets you high it does the job definitely and like we talked about earlier remember the terpenes mm mm and strains so just pay attention to the screen and what high you're looking for also blackberry clutch strain in Jack Herer so sour tangi and we just sold out of the Zittel z-- however the indica is going to be the blackberry clutch so we do have still have indica hybrid and sativa to offer remember you're terpenes it's gonna have kind of a little bit of those flavors in the background of it cuz it's very raw like she said I'm so you're gonna taste those more relevant than you bud and the other ones that are a lot more flavorful you know right and then they're dabs I've actually I have some of their blue dream at home this one's really good yeah I like that one lock this one is their cherry cordial the color on this is just a little darker than what you would expect for like a sauce or something these are $35 out the door well you do have other ones as well I think we believe we have five Oh different strains or maybe even sex we do have a good amount so come check that out like we

"O7_axXISqn0": "hey guys how you doing today we're going to be harvesting the other tenth of the sunset sherbert this is one of the nugs branches that came off we're gonna talk to you a little bit about the harvesting a little bit about the sherbert I'm gonna get faded we're gonna also then move on into the tent and kind of show you as harvesting it a little you can see the purple in the leaves and a super frosty hard to focus we think run for a while harvesting is not as exciting as it used to be but it is definitely a necessity we grow because it's hard to get the quality of nugs that we want so it's not like we're ever gonna stop but it definitely is not as fun as it used to be when you first started harvesting your first cup of grass really time-consuming you know we got it we got we separate it we separate trem from just families and then we got a you know hang it and dry it and get it Road trimmed up hung up and [ __ ] like that real sticky real stinky really clogs up our nose yeah we'll go to the tent what kind of show you guys cutting it down we already cut down some brush pros and a lot of the large the lower smaller nose yeah the stuff that just really you can do a lot with those types of knives we're gonna probably wash it down the road yeah those spices you can freeze it and just kind of forget about it for a while as long as the freezer doesn't go out you're fine yeah you don't also when you do a fresh frozen or any kind of like where you're gonna freeze it right away you want to make sure why you're chopping it down you don't waste a lot of time get it into the bag get it frozen as quick as possible the longer it takes from you cutting it down to getting it put in the bag of frozen really can affect your phone all come of your turks we even set a timer like ten minutes from the time we start cutting it to the time we bag it and freeze it who this seems to be hate you harder when you need a bit of lower tone a lot of people's gonna probably ask um we obviously don't go wet trim we just take off all the big families that have no no that might have some dry come but not a lot we'll put those usually in a separate trim bag but then in general we leave a lot of the clothes trim with the frosting this long yeah yeah yeah you talk about her drying and carrying dresses yeah like you said fresh frozen we kind of we set a 10-minute timer and we just don't make sure you don't get huge bags left just a bit bag big enough to fill up in that five minute period or a ten minute period drying drying we just take off the anything it doesn't have resin on it will even trip the tips of some leaves that have resin on it but really close to the now gamete buried into the dog is a little bit so we'll just trim the leaves off of that that's awful sorry hang it for about two weeks at least minimum at around 65 to 70 degrees doesn't ever go over that and it stays dark the whole time you want to make sure the air is being circulated and whatever room its drying in but you don't want any direct contact with like the wind and the nug so you don't want to drown too quick yeah yeah three weeks is ideal if you want to be doing dry Civ so you can go that route but yeah three weeks is it'll start to break off when the buds are snapping on us just when you think it's dry enough it's usually about three four more days after that then you take it down trim it you are it and it's pretty much ready to smoke and every week after that or to get a little smoother a little better cure wait a long time on this that was a minute now distillate flavors [Music] well yeah he gets really redundant it's really boring that's why we have to do it freely at night when I'm trying to go to bed at a certain point so this doesn't help it helps in the fact that after you know next month and everything you're not gonna be stressing about weed yeah that's always a bliss um you think it are growing heavy 16 is great we've been using it for a while Coco go back on some of our older videos botanic air a couple of data care products advance nutrients all we use is usually might use the big button overdrive yeah we're gonna probably to get ready we'll cut off and give you guys a little tour of us starting to do some of this trimming of the harvesting of the plant you guys they done all right we're back here rid of the harvesting the sugar ten all right okay can we cut this down guys we want to make sure we're leaving it we're gonna get rid of any kind some strings are really heavy trim screams we're gonna actually get a separate trim container these don't run a lot so we're gonna actually maybe trim up the tips and summer frosty completely so he get some time like that now again like we send that video earlier minimum ten ten to ten days two weeks could take you as long as you have not revealed fifty-five or sixty these days again you can get airflow don't get right here we're getting good weight again we took this about five things now Caitlin says we know so you also want to chop every they all want to be relatively the that way you know that you want some drying faster than other to take a longer period even everything yeah we got stuff that might have been your stems and others I want to not have driving process is already at the table while [Music] unwanted time humans before you harvest stop watering trying to dry out your room that was enough if you shut it down right after you water it they're not going to show you the entire harvest we could take us probably an hour for anyone experience rewarding your first year harvest we'll do one hangar I said beautiful bugs get on our IQ higher standard CA and make four to Lussier could barely see some close up any other purpose so we're really learning to the enmity starts his fate here or I didn't really that's kind of what you're looking two more of these or problems or over rather compromising the plants No a lot of soil growers really flush everything out they have a nice beat watch the plant starts to cannibalize drop really shark in the winter yeah some people like to do that this is not we found them less stress the plant goes theory flushing as well man come we've learned that you've actually got better aromas he's been thinking and we also got completely why not stuff that was falling off yes make people leave anywhere that might ask now we're pretty solid on the back down the white ass just means that Moisture is moisture content or moisture that's you know as growers you start to hit buttons c-bro flush women that drives with the weird foliar spray which I'm not lazy but I guess that you know I'm sure there's examples of why right now but in general just business way got sprayed on it went up assume that there's gonna for everything maybe put support save the Ox the hanger will look grill what was that calculation begin those the og some shirts see how they're all now what will happen is a lot of these extra families kind of Cocoon on the blood start the curing process we kind of rocket all right guys you can check out our chief apartment Victoire 20cm we're going keep out", "lEWqmRfuw_E": "if you want a canvas

gonna be looking at some of this right here some moxie so I've been hearing a lot of good things about maxime and I heard this [ __ ] is like something fire I heard it's like some legit it's like the concentrate is a lot different than regular oil wax pens so let's see a little bit about this so I'm actually got this recommend until it's liquid moxie they said it's like live resin in a in a cartridge so I'm just like oh okay so that's kind of dope you know everything in the back oh by the way everybody this is Maui wowie I had again I had to get a crazy flavor I had to get a crazy player for you guys some guys somebody said to get these Moxie cartridges I I guess these are really good so we got a 5-10 thread bate cartridge okay that's usually the universal the regular you got the warning signs all that stuff could cause chemicals all that [ __ ] just so you guys know you guys gotta be careful man we got our smoky and these cartridges man you guys got to be careful alright so a little bit a little bit about it here this is some information about it it's a hybrid and all I know this should as far as 80% I'm not gonna lie when I cop this off the club I was just like okay this is kind of safe this looks already kind of cool so you can pop it off just like down boom you guys know me man I'm like trying all the cartridges and stuff like that so we have to do is you have to kind of hold it so we have to do is all right look at this just a little bit like this comes in a little container isn't that dope comes I got a little container so you just kind of pop it you push it that's kind of I guess to push it right there well well you have to kind of grab it push it just a little push right there you see that are you see that you gotta kind of have to push it you see that kind of push it by hand look at that that's sick huh oh that's sick but yeah this is no ordinary wax cartridge you guys this [ __ ] is gonna be some [ __ ] largest oh [ __ ] that would be actually really nice no no thumbnail look at that oh actually I got a good idea for the thumb no this is gonna be sick for the donor I'm gonna be like this I'm gonna be like that Moxie can you see it me up mark see just like that right there boom we got the thumb now you guys make sure you guys makes you guys drop a like makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe you guys you know this is a pocket we kick them back just talking about random stuff just really kicking back but today it's more of like a little review so let's pop this [ __ ] open you guys already know me we got a check we got a check you guys see that right there so by the looks of it it just looks like your ordinary wax cartridge look at that life gets better oh definitely does if you guys are right now man if you guys are feeling down anything like that just no nightmares do not last you wake up eventually I'm trying to find if there's like a little bit of information about it but I guess doesn't really tell me much but yeah it's definitely some white resin inside this wax cartridge it I mean it looks the same you know the color and all that stuff it looks the same but [ __ ] let's try it out you guys Maui wowie oh that straight-up tastes like a candy like let me see if there's a way if there's anything that I could like um anything that kind of tastes like this it tastes like a fruit loop kind of like fruit loops yeah it's like oh it tastes like a grape like if you're eating a fruit loop not approve of fruit rolls my fault a fruit roll is a candy I think I sort of toss fruit roll let me answer this call okay it tastes exactly like it smells it definitely has a little punch to it the taste is great like I feel like the taste is really good in this and like I'm telling us it tastes like a grape fruit roll-up like it has like a really distinct taste definitely definitely we're gonna have to get another flavor like it again there's no matter I'll be right there I guess this makes a lots of clouds and Moxie is I guess one of the most popular wax cartridges around I guess at that club but I mean I feel like so far rock garden rock garden and heavy hitters is kind of like the way to go I mean that's how I see you know the rock garden and the heavy hitters is so far but Moxie this is like the first time you know it's funny I just hurdled I literally just heard about mossy just this morning like I was just going through the dudes entirely because I wrote it thoroughly I go to thoroughly the club here in the Bay Area and we I usually just go on the internet I check out you know like the menus and stuff try to see if there's any deals any good stuff and I seen this I was like at oh by the way this is $25.00 half gram $25.00 so you cannot go wrong with this [ __ ] man the flavor is great I literally took took I took two hits and I already can't talked and technically I mean if you guys look at my face it's my eyes I'm looking a little bit late let's take another yeah there's some spire like this one it's good it's the Maui Wowi - there was only like four flavors that were at the club at that time but it definitely does have a great taste telling you tastes like like a fruit roll-up with a little bit of grape with a little bit of grape but that's just me though I got some sometimes I'll be having some like weird as like taste bud you know sometimes I'll taste [ __ ] I'm back I'll smoke something and I'll be like you know what probably this tastes a little like weird like it tastes like for example I'll be like dude this tastes like a burger this tastes like spaghetti like my mind is so weird it's sometimes like the taste buds I'll smoke something I think a bloody stump I'll take a hit Oh black little blind on she's like but why does this taste like candy why does this taste like this but it's like the trees like I know it's something on my brain but Moxie this past weekend I didn't really make a video but I went to Lake Tahoe so if you guys follow go follow me on snapchat go down at the description I got my snapchat down there so I posted a lot of my snapchat you know for everyone to see so you guys could even if you guys want to ask me something or anything like that a question you guys could hit me up on snapchat to my my snap is open so you guys are able to you know watch my story you guys could DME anything like that but yeah this past weekend we went to me and a couple of my boys and [ __ ] we went to a we went to Lake Tahoe and I'm an eye shadow I should have logged the boat went to Lake Tahoe and one of my boys had a gram of frog garden Robert and something it was a it was a wax cartridge boat but it was so clear and I kid you guys not man this you took one single rib and it made a produced a fatass cloud it was so crazy 1 2 3 it was crazy I was like dude why and one hate was just that probably like what $55 Graham again you guys I still got to make a video and talk about these wax cartridges cuz man I'm not I smoked the by one or two wax tortured baked cartridges when I don't even know and I found out to like kind of like you could say recently maybe like a month or two ago when I was like dude man there's a lot of fake cartridges going out there so it makes you guys get your stuff from the club dispensaries all that stuff and meets the same [ __ ] but still alright we up that a match and this is honest reviews these are honest reviews like I literally everything I cop is something that I'm gonna enjoy you know if I look at something I'm like I'm not gonna enjoy this I don't even cop it so I like to review stuff that it's just like I find appealing you know I looked at I'm like it looks kind of the same but at the same time I'm not like a crazy ass like fanatic though I can tell you know every what what it is by the look of it you know it's like there's so many concentrates out there you guys are so many [ __ ] out there that's why I feel like you guys gonna be like smoking on like stuff from like the club dispensary man because your local drug bluesman they got the plug I know they got the plug man you know they got the cheap [ __ ] all that I mean not cheap [ __ ] you know they got the they got the good stuff but it's cheap but sometimes man I feel like me like I mean I could trust them depending who they are but if it's just something like some random dude you know like just selling to like random people then I'm just like [ __ ] bro I don't know but let's see if we can make up that cloud Oh wasn't like the fattest but for me that was pretty big [ __ ] oh damn [ __ ] loaded I stay getting loaded in all the videos oh wow I just looked at the boxes at the bottom it says you guys want to go check them out information about them or anything like that it's mmm Moxie 7/10 calm oh [ __ ] 710 710 labs yo you know what I wonder who actually made these come on I really got to do that research I want to see exactly who made these Moxie cards at moxie we think of ourselves as something far more than simply that the leading producer superior quality extracts what we do is a service of a much larger and critical mission driving the research and education critical to ensuring that the valley cannabis is in society is respected and the rights of those who need us we need as most aren't protected and all that stuff I want to see what's like inside this stuff man I want to know what's in this um like I want to know exactly because they're telling me it's like rosin or light resin or some [ __ ] there's different oh I got the Maui Wowi Strawberry Fields liquid moxie we got Mel Mellon rec liquid moxie oh wow these those ones about better ratings the Strawberry Fields actually got a four point nine the melon drank liquid moxie cartridge got a four point five and then the malware we got a three point five so out of all of them oh and then we got Black Diamond og Oh so let's see what they say about this this card should let's see what the online world has to say now I was a classic sativa whose tropical flavors and stress relieving qualities will float you straight to the shores of Hawaii where the string was originally born and raised you know yeah hell yeah that's how I'm feelin I'm [ __ ] chillin bro I'm on a boat I'm just chillin I'm just I feel like I'm floating like like I'm awake you know like I'm looking down like - I got two monitors are hearing I'm just looking at us I'm looking both the stuff you know makes you guys go subscribe to him cut you one down the description that's my logging channel I'm looking at this pronto I'm just like I'm [ __ ] late and I'm super relaxed like I'm not mad I'm not stressed no nothing let's look at the reviews bro I purchase from Mission PA for $40 they got different $40 you know what I don't know if it's I don't know if this is a I don't know if they got a full grammar I love this train back in the 90s nice fruity flavor it tastes tropic yeah that's what it is it has like a tropical taste very uplifting I recommend in early morning we can bake with this do not to try this for the we can make oh somebody left the two stars this did not taste like cannabis to me effects are very nice though so don't write it off I baked it always expecting something that I tasted like great cannabis I try to find out what exactly Dan what the [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] like I got a chill my guess is that my Wow there my farm ghost in puberty my guess is that the product is built from THC natural okay to me it tasted like almond D slightly floral handsome huh the one thing you get in the gas station restroom oh [ __ ] I nobody's talking about I should say that [ __ ] smells great what I don't know what he's talking about that gas station soap is fired I mean yeah the gas station soap it's not that bad it's like the pink one you know that what smells break that [ __ ] smells good alright one two three all right let's get to the highest sensitivity everybody again this is some Maui I hope you guys enjoy these podcasts you know they're just little reviews honestly they're just kind of my review you know my honest opinion of this again everybody I usually have good of good good reviews and and all that stuff for almost all the products that I have here on this channel but it's just because I'm not again I'm not gonna buy a product I'm not gonna enjoy you know I'm gonna look it I'm gonna I'm gonna read about it you know I'm gonna look at it you know I'm gonna read it I'm gonna see if it's like a sativa hybrid indica I'm gonna see if it's like some fire you know maybe it's a wax cartridge I really get wax cartridges the ones that you guys you know [ __ ] offer me if you guys notice it's only been like heavy-hitters [ __ ] king pen and rock art and this like and probably like what like the newest one that we tried or maybe we tried different ones I'm not sure but it's we tried like known cartridges so copies obviously they're gonna be good you know because I try to go for like good flavors so cheers you guys damn I took like a little hit and I made a [ __ ] pretty nice cloud wow it's nice verdict because I think that's what you said or in conclusion in conclusion you guys the way the way you guys open this it's pretty shitty Megan I like you guys could see that right there right I was like little like a little pattern in the back yeah this goes in here this is pretty sick but I'm not gonna lie this definitely will make your cartridge now break or anything like that and it's not gonna get dirty or anything like that it's just perfect I think that this thing it just looks sick you know looks cool like oh I got a wax cartridge looked at on my huh very interesting but down for $25 half gram I give it a thumbs up man and I got anyway I mean I had to take by like a couple heads six seven heads but if it's like you know it's if it's if you guys are 18 or 21 and over and if it's legal you're safe to smoke these wax cartridges these ones 25 dollars you cannot go wrong you know what that was nice little hit gas station soap nap that's all in his head that [ __ ] i get i get a tropical taste like it's if i if i would have oh if it was a drop okay the tropical fruit loops the tropical the the tropical fruit roll-ups that is exactly what it tastes like a tropical fruit roll-up I don't even know if that exists but I can already just like taste it you know cuz I got you know I got some fruit roll-ups in the kitchen you know and I've been eating those I've been grabbing on those for like the past like I the past two days I grew up like a total of like three and I'm just like dandies are good at somehow smoking this [ __ ] I'm just like probably this kind of tastes like thank candy I'll leave you know and like let's take one last shirt make sure you guys

she does not like green to kind of like screen in the [ __ ] [ __ ] when it's not green anyways you guys he shares it up like a comment subscribe I'll catch you guys in the next video if you guys

like what like the 20th rift that I take and I took I'm dead Moxie you guys if you guys want a cop fire", "g7jPk1Gb4u4": "fake cards in real part of TKO I'm standing on start with destiny honky [ __ ] this one right here just off the bat extra-strength get the [ __ ] out of here so that that oil is just going up faster and this one and also on the bottom does not say TK on the bottom but it says so this one is a real ticket saw source at that source kid which you'll know about it all right now this one has more of a matte mouth to graduate and the oil is so thick super thick like super thick man bottom is black pop the rubber TKO official baby and this just tastes so much bud like more like bud more like actual premium oil this [ __ ] thing if you just pull it it just tastes like [ __ ] pine needles and just trash so what were you buying for cards joint and this is childproof - so because we know you're smoking oh please", "Sd9C8t5KPiw": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another product review this one is midnight express you know so MKX card I've had this kind once before it was a real long time ago but it's a Suns sunset sherbert I remember it being pretty good it's an indica hybrid I didn't do the test results still haven't figured out my QR reader I figure that out within the next like day or two so I can just get all the information up front for you guys you can see it moving but once again it's not moving very quickly this is one of the CCL ones that says Jupiter I can't really see it but it says it right there and then as I said before in one of my videos that it says it on here so see cell battery battery for a see cell cart Jupiter is just I don't understand they put on it to let you know that they work hand in hand I guess so this is more of like a slightly darker goldish color compared to the the platinum bates I've been getting what do I I don't know if this is going to work as well but you know a little bit darker and say the you know the purple champagne that I have from the Platinum so we'll see what this one's about the guy I got it from was showing three different flavors so I was gonna choose between tangi orange cream I think Bowen was and sunset sherbert so he was talking about this this logo on one of the three is different than all the rest and it doesn't have the reflective piece across it so I chose not to go with that one because you know obviously with all the fakes out there I'm assuming that that one's the fake because all the ones I've gotten you know I got pretty shorts right next to me all the other flavors I've gotten all have the you know shiny logo piece so the one that didn't is the one I'm going to assume is the you know fake if there's gonna be one so got the magnet on it I'm gonna drop it in the palm give it a couple ribs I should have probably pulled it up on Leafly so I could just give you all the information about it right off the get-go what's going on with my stuff forget it here we go that's a good taste but it's not real sweet it's definitely not earthy in my opinion it's got actually it's got a very earthy undertones like right at the end of it like it's like the final taste you get in the back here throat but it starts off almost sweet like let me see if I can pull this up real quick without it taking too long just so I can give you know at least some but uh yeah I would definitely recommend this to people on here it says it's just a hybrid on this one it says indica hybrid and so I'm going to assume that it's just an indica dominant hybrid heir to the Girl Scout cookies throne is sherbert also known as sherbert or sunset sherbert and indica leaning hybrids with intoxicatingly potent effects read by mr. Schurr Ben ski sherbert inherits the genetic lineage of its GSC parent whose ancestors include the famed OG Kush cherry pie and Durbin poison I've had Durbin poison in the flower I've had it in oils I've had it in good oils and shitty oils other than shitty oils Durbin poisons always been you know good never had an issue with it oh gee cush I've had that from many different people ranging from [ __ ] that looked almost brown poundage to some [ __ ] street fighter a snogs cherry pie I may have tried it at one point time but I can't remember right off the top of my head I've smoked so much [ __ ] but uh then it says crossed with an indica known as pink panties server exhibits powerful full-body effects elevated by a jolt of cerebral energy complex aroma colors aroma colors sherbert with notes of skunky citrus sweet and berry as I said at the end of this it seems like it's a little more earthy to me that might be part of the skunky part of it but you definitely when you first hit it you get on the sweet I can't say really the citrus maybe a little bit of the berry says it's real good for stress tension and sour moods not away with the carefree mindset and physical reacts relaxation that comes with this rich hybrid as I said I've had this before I liked it the first time around hitting it again after I want to say like eight nine months I still dig it I will review more of the MKX I'm gonna try to some of the K fire pods also that will go in my claw battery I want to get some more claws to do some more reviews on those because everything I've gotten from them has been fired one of my favorites in the claw was the blueberry yum yum indica ghost train haze and I think it was just ghost og yeah ghost train haze was a real nice to TiVo you can still see I got a little bit in it you know when I seen the one meme talking about you know then the new wave of [ __ ] that these are basically roaches now like it can I hit your road she let pop this in get maybe like one or two decent rips off of it before you start tasting on all the coil I just got a box full of this [ __ ] oh yeah so this was my review on the MKX sunset sherbert one gram distill it cart as I said I didn't do the test results I don't know if any of you can actually use that on your phone and have it pop up if you can a sweet let me know what it says but once again I appreciate you guys thanks for watching if one of your local dispos or running these for 4:10 go ahead pick them up give them a go you might like them or you might already like them I liked a lot of the MKX stuff I've gotten but obviously I love to plant them babes I love to claw I would say those are my my top 3 at the moment if you disagree tell me what yours are tell me all about your favorites and we have a conversation in the comments other than that you guys have a great night smash that subscribe button hit that like button I really appreciate it you guys have a great night", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "DTNn0RYM20g": "we got a week for going on right now week four we vision I just transplanted to the seven gallon pots I'm expecting to get sixteen ounces from both plants", "P9gDUYwQYc8": "these THC shenanigans are for stoners ages 18 and up the [ __ ] is this [Music] yo yo yo what's up guys this is nugget fresh and California clouds this is stoner shenanigans and today working parents and pens let's get before we begin we just wanted to let you know that all products have been purchased lately from mankind dispensary to ensure authenticity alright guys we are back we got five you fate pens from five new companies if you haven't yet seen it check out our previous video where we compare five eighths from the top brands in California so what are you most excited about well today well actually if you guys watch any of our past videos you guys know I'm all about the canvas terms so today I'm really excited to try something new something I never tried guys and that is this guy right here this is some friendly farms guys I have never tried actual live resin full-spectrum live rather than in a pen this is no discipline this is just 100% live residents tucked in this pen that you don't add any extra turkeys with nothing guys nothing so this is going to be I think 68 percent THC yes it does you know it is somewhat low but you guys remember it's not his lip this has a full spectrum high so you know this high is gonna feel and be a lot different than any high you're gonna get a pen so waiting but I'm really excited just the first time I've heard of a pen this way I've always heard where you get your distillate you add your terpenes and then maybe once in a while other companies toss them the other things might be talking about that later but I'm just excited to be honest I'm a little curious about how it's gonna taste since they didn't have the trick things back in there but nevertheless let's get to it yeah that's good to it alright get over it I'm gonna try so as you know all these to be pens are supposed to be childproof tamper proof people true that sticker on it with a sticker Sarah oh yeah guys so we're trying this trade but its flavor I guess you could say it's called Chewbacca Chewbacca sure I don't know you guys can you guys can you put up that heavy suit you guys think it is but it's a hybrid and it's looking pretty good honestly oh also what is special about this mean this is a collab right with easioyya these farm stuff I think it's gonna be cool out stuff I do have stuff that the feds just took the straight line that's just from other farms and stuff like that so yeah we'll take a look at this one right now you know and I will plug you know close to three guys as always suggest and see how dark this stuff is and when I say dark I don't mean like bad door can I just mean it's big it's not it's not desolate rise it in take all you know the camp going turkey new tripping out of there and take all the bats what is and you know this is it guys this is your lever isn't just straight stuff doing then I am so excited right now of course we got our battery from the court officials perfect for this a 5-10 thread leaves ok so just making sure okay so we're at three point four guys and I think I'm gonna keep it back to repent for usually I'll go to point eight but since this is not dis lit and this does have like you know more of that's enough plant matter in it I I do want to burn out a higher temperature so if it doesn't taste like you know all that goes up into a point in yeah [Music] I've also heard before people say that they always wanted on a lower battery setting or so you can might taste the turkeys better and so this doesn't have champions that definitely makes sense yes yeah yeah yeah I like that it is so totally different at the lane that like that taste is like so natural wax doesn't say it smells kind of like the smell of like a for your job or like a bird but yeah that's awesome awesome awesome I could smoke on that all day long that's like up there with raw cardoons flavor honestly even though Gardens like almost taste like something that's not quite hitting that that's you know 100% locked and add flavor but it's the closest thing in the market right now and tell me right now until right now alright I don't think this you know actually does take precedence in flavors over anything I've ever tasted I mean it makes sense it's not you're not tampering yeah yeah it does remind me a little bit broader is I will say that I like the Terps yeah the terms relate to motors in this rail there no no no Rihanna trips because there's Turks nothing oh okay I'm sorry that's my bad it's just it that's crazy that's that's nuts so I'm going away so I don't know if you were to write this you know oh yeah one to tattoo the same all right guys so late personally I'm a bit I need to see you know raiding stuff like that just like total enjoyability and smoke and like just the way it made me feel the way that hey like actually went in like when I held it I guess it's like maybe it's just the distillate you know that like makes my nose like I like her a little bit like you feel it is - no not at all not one bit so I said that I'd be like perfect Penn High like I just feel like you should he give something in 10 just because looks like a hundred percent the best of the best but like I'll give it a nine point seven I mean like the flavor is ridiculous hi I will take that anger or anything else stick back flavor is just not late and then also you know feel like you know years old again you know or closest to a nice know or something you know I don't like that straight in your face I you think when you think of full spectrum highlight what do you think of like that body high like where it's like you for it and it washes over you or like I feel yeah it's more relaxing it's more calming it's more like a wave you know what I'm saying it's more of like it's you and then like a colic you ride it out you know what I'm saying whereas those wax and I feel like can you smoke it you know what I'm saying and then you get high for about 30 45 minutes and it really okay and then like you just boom I don't know yes there I just feel like you just you know you'll have a lot more enjoyable time with that miswak and I'm excited to take a date and literally just smoke this and just see how I feel like we actually got this from place box and then you were nice enough to include a DAB cap so make sure you guys check them out this dab cap will literally turn like almost any one of your vape pens like into a hittable like okay well actually we have figured that some bakers are more are better than others of lechery actually look at the tip of this this is let's hit similar to the tip that rock artists on it these tips will go really well fit the nasty sound so why not getting show [Music] [Music] so I just need to have my wits about me or I'm not gonna do this video so all right so no I think it's your turn to pick I know you're coughing dying right now just point and we got it for you I'm really excited to try this one I definitely can't wait to hear her opinions but yeah I think sighs this to me is just like you know on time coming I just I've heard a lot about them but I've never actually sat down and over the package of platinum bait and I just looking so you know it's a great price point fifty dollars for one gram that's [Music] that's pretty good a and honestly is right now I got from the farm sixty two dollars at for a half is a half way like I just said this my number one pen right now it's just beats it I'll be hard-pressed okay let me see if I can always struggle with the fast ones I do like the design those boxes no chopper just tells me I just taped over the chocolate you know and then [Applause] yeah they still put the they said with a little less of things on the I like that I especially like the talk please like if I put my all right I want to see you take the fattest rib out of that piece all right now see what flavor do we got white buffalo interesting have you ever heard it's gonna say I really like this packaging because there's the state of California in it I think that's pretty California and all right what do you think flavor-wise white buffalo I don't know what it tastes like but like like like a peach orange a little harsh which is crazy because you would think that yellow slime present would be streaming I get news okay you got this all right real quick rating Platinum v what do you think all right well as you guys can see it's it was a little harsh definitely $50 you know it's still it's great you know already but I don't know the flavor was definitely like reminiscing yeah of orange and if you had a baby I don't know if a white buffalo taste like that I wouldn't imagine but you know so I can't really speak on like what the flavor like you resembles but like did taste it yet he's good but it didn't taste like so so so yeah so yeah so these guys I'm actually kind of excited to try these guys kids these trying to think that via song they have you know cannabis terpenes cannabis oil you know Italy Italy also had some secret ball taxes yeah with like like a turkey I think yeah this is definitely a weird design guys and just like look at this right now there's like a little like swirl in the center of it which is kind of weird I beautiful is that and then there's also you know I mean this thing it's just one of the ones like right like the other side look at the comparison I'm already like really big so yeah okay sorry just be like all right all right enough talk about it this is Bubba a ping guys she's a bad beginning but I know sorry I'm okay go for it I'll tell you what everyone what I think it's definitely interesting when they see like floor equipment and cool I do get that little like maybe perfumey taste just a little bit and remind me a little bit of cheesy just a little bit like the taste so it's just I don't know go back and is business sweet if this is the kind of speech it's like really light though like it makes a good vapor it seems like you know you're like you're like there's like oh my god there's like an insane amount of like space like in this closed like it's closing [Music] it's not like I can't is maybe I'm just like I don't know I know it's just it's just not my favorite like this one TC if I don't be it and video tasted a little bit better later not like a little bit better definitely a lot bit better I think than that one but I'm still loving the friendly friends right now okay so well I I don't like everything I don't like a sugary taste too much so like that was like a light that's almost like a lemon is just a tight yeah really right so I was gonna do one but personally I wanted to be that wasn't taste in the campus but you have this week I believe this I can think [Music] like I love candy and so I think that's why I like containing our yeah that's that's why okay what we stopped to mourn we still got some competitors here you guys alright what's up next I don't I think I'm excited I kind of let me say about this one absolute extracts it's called dawn water oh gee so definitely wanted to try that when we saw it early yes like this is interesting okay and also if it's you art so I'm pretty excited about that yeah let's do it this is very interesting very cool that Conner Lake looks like like the top that you put on the pill bottle yeah I like it it's like yeah alright let's get into this push [Music] and so this is kind of cool right that we have Moxie tart and this is like straight-up kbx but it's for the dart system so it can just go into the dark absolutely we're told so since they even if you're taking an open eye they probably can't get there they do okay evaluate what they were doing eat you've had this very well here baby I don't even know why I'm Cheers [Music] oh yeah guys um but yeah I know that definitely tasted pretty good I kind of like want to just like puff on that a few times to like see how high that gets me exactly like it would get me like really live yeah it was interesting like you said though like definitely like painters thing it was like to me it tasted more of like - it's like that or - or something like it was good I liked it no like teeny like I feel like they didn't like a look at much of chirps in there anything like yeah yeah I think I'm probably had an eight with that one okay yeah I'm nerdy Nate - it's like eight like seven point five eight like yeah Joey it's just like the way the battery hit so like to meet I like fat hits I guess by the way is some healing effects like like doing if I could hit this three times I do it and just wing it didn't spark up that much and so I don't know me hey yeah okay yeah I think I'm at like seven point five I think like it's definitely like up there with your friendly farms oh yeah yeah yeah I know I won't lie it's good yeah yeah all right doesn't want you favorite so far I think yeah all right we got one left Alpine I just see these people on Instagram I've definitely been really curious I don't think it's chemistry so I'm still down I'm still excited the link I just you know can't determine easy okay oh I hope it's one of those tops so that you can finally use that that damn cat I think they give you like a we were looking for a pamphlet when we open the Rope so you know like they're telling me how to lie which is every car should use service for sighs my oil box the pathway kinda hard to shut

couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful [Music] what the [ __ ] is crooked that [ __ ] ben [ __ ] that i think this plug i mean [Music] i'm still recovering from those hits anyone ever heard of gg organics i have not no no that's a big cartridge wow when the phones are obviously happy to see it ff is active on here so i hope you know comment to let me know crossing my fingers that is real since i live in south carolina and simply can't go to the store to buy one south carolina is that south carolina i don't know that's a my family don't look like that but they're also bought on the street most definitely fake like most wait so yours is fakes but you're still hitting it appears to be fake i can't bear 500 but it doesn't look like any friendly farms car ipad and the liquid is way too light for care resin plus 90 percent would be extremely high for pure aggressiveness face paint hopefully she's okay i live in south carolina and that part has a rod that's way too big to do this sorry we didn't lose yeah that [ __ ] damn man be careful [ __ ] you doing they doing family friendly farms like that now appears to be fake what do you think about buddha bear look at them i've seen a video about the boxes but these backfire will last me up to two weeks what the [ __ ] who the bear [ __ ] don't know i don't know this one took a picture of it on a door handle that's funny

which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm saying but pretty I hear guys I'm I'm pretty hungry too Oh guys bro I just parked outside Chipotle when I say something that was why I party bro bro that's some great news since I just got some great news I'm gonna give you awesome green news we're gonna do number four might as well write Cheers oh no Jason brake [ __ ] send help I'm dying all right guys my conclusion with this cart for this quick little sesh this for hit sesh right before school right it's a [ __ ] Cenac or there's no other way to put it I'm on four hits and I'm I'm pretty high I'm I'm not like slow like to level right but [ __ ] I'm in like I don't even know what kind of hide this is well guys I'm gonna end the video there this will probably be up on Saturday so you know maybe maybe Friday maybe Friday depending what time or how school goes and [ __ ] hey there's a person a problem would be Saturday it'll probably set solo [ __ ] I just want to say thank you guys very much for watching let me put down this water I don't know why I'm in the water thank you guys so much for watching the supports been awesome let me know what other kind of reviews you guys want to see or if there's a certain length like strain of carts you want to see a certain brand just let me know uh if you guys do want to see like a whole gram or like a half gram cart challenge or me smoking with a home year whatever it is I got some homies at school I can smoke with two uh just let me know it would be super dope yeah that's all I got to say so make sure if you can you don't have to be super dope though like subscribe you know don't share that's weird you'll lose friends that way it just goes to like and subscribe you don't got to ring that Bell because nobody likes [ __ ] notifications anyway especially for YouTube anyway later guys I'll see you all in the next one deuces", "8gLu6aKZtmE": "[Music] damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "yNLNb7WJE_k": "hello everybody so I was in Woodman's which is like the grocery of food though I mean no it's like the Walmart of food if you want food you gotta go to Woodman's if they don't have that Woodman's you don't need it no it's like the size of your like oh decent Walmart you know but it's like 90% food it's amazing so I got a few things from there this is one of them this is hemp too old never had this before sunset sherbert it's a habit beverage now this what I'm holding right here this this stuff right here is why weed was illegal in the first place because it's so awesome it's like towels are supposed to be like one of the most useful things ever well hemp cannabis is like nature's towel it's like the most useful plant imaginal not only can you because they have the health benefits but it also make it a drink turn into rope cloth paper paper that's the main thing that got it off yeah Hearst they just invested a bunch of money and paper and then like they started making like the superior him so I was like oh no gently a bunch of money so he started spreading fake news yeah so anyways let's try this and they had some other flavors but they're all some kind of regular you know like coconut lime or something you know more mundane but sunset sherbert I mean it looks like it's got some great food and look there's some sherbert on its deathbed taking its last breaths of life so alright let's read a little bit oops hemp seeds contain omegas essential fatty acids they have heart and health benefits that have hearts health benefits that sounds a little off to me but hemp seeds are nutty in flavor and breathe life into many products today like hemp - Oh empty row has 100 milligrams of omegas in each bottle did you know hemp plants thrive without pesticides well purifying the soil around it another benefit of cannabis hemp jewel is a functional beverage that is great tasting and provides excellent hydrating benefits enjoy one goal right now that's what I'm gonna do it smells of something my god artificial cotton candy or bubblegum or something or I don't that's right it smells like fruit but not a particular fruit it smells like fruit that's a bit of a diet drink taste to it that might be that him and kind of a this has a nutty flavor that might be what I'm tasting that died flavor might be the so called nutty flavor of the hemp he's kind of like a punch like a weird kind of punch flavored drink like a punch not necessarily I see you're no a horny punch or Candida dry but something a little different just kind of tastes like fruit and past the 4/20 mark this isn't terrible I was hoping it was gonna be a little bit younger it's you know it's like a so be kind of thing you know if you like so be like the like the strawberry daiquiri flavor or something then yeah this will probably be right up your alley which of course means it's definitely not bad I'm just hoping for something a little bit more I don't know yummier but it's about what you should expect I suppose so I can't fold it too much all right well that's about it for this one catch me on bit shoot and sometimes minds sometimes Stardust like description all those below I'll see you in the next one take care of your buddy", "aVqzSmpitGE": "yo what's up people back at it again bud legend is the name and just doing some cannabis reviews for all my cannabis people out there I'm a budtender in Los Angeles so you know I feel like a good opportunity to sample and see a lot of new items in the cannabis market whether it be vague actual we edibles tincture I got a lot of these reviews planned guys so just keep tuning in and you know I'm gonna keep with the best stuff you know imma let you know maybe to something that's it's maybe overrated or something as well I'll definitely you know have a review maybe on things and not always have a positive thing to say well hey who knows maybe I'll just be positive and only have positive things to say about the stuff I'm like anyway yo don't forget about that it's bud legend today as you can see right here I'm reviewing the pink sherbert ass in cartridge from carvanha okay this is the half gram pink sherbert it is a hybrid like I said if you don't know about ascend ascend is a special company that has you know they create dynamic quality product is super clean okay they can analyze down to a trillionth to detect pesticides when most other they you know companies they can only analyze down to the millions particle when they are analyzing for pesticides so this is a high end shelf-like premier supreme brand right okay cost a little more all right usually but it's very it's very much worth it all right guys this is the this is a clean product you wanna you don't have to worry about you know feeling like a burning sensation in your chest ever you know this this companies really knocking it out of the park so let's look into it a little bit more you say pink sherbert right what is that what is that sort of what type of vibe does that let me taste it let me unbox this 85 almost 86 percent THC in this bad boy so another thing with the ascend line is that it's super powerful potent stuff right so it'll definitely get you get you high which is suited have your medicine kick in you know like definitely take care of something feeling better I love hybrids okay a hybrid is very versatile you can do it in the daytime you can do a hybrid any time all right it's not gonna be too low it's not gonna be too high it's a hybrid a right a hybrid of fusion all right you're gonna bring both to the middle should be very well balanced of a high look this pay nice you know great reviews online let me taste it right here you got a obviously I got Mike Ravana pin you gotta have the ascend pin to really you know have the proper charge for this for the carvanha for the ascend cartridge you got it you know how the matching battery most of the time okay so grab one of these but you can tell man it's got the good good color here very clean oil similar to live resin although I don't think it is live resin remember guys when you when you screw on your Kathy when you screw on the cartridge into the battery don't make it too tight all right in the gym you're working out he's strong you know but don't do it too tight you excited I know you don't want it to go anywhere you know what you're doing whatever you're doing but come on just just snug but not tight all right snug but don't don't squeeze it too tight you want to get a good hit you want to you know be a smooth thing here but if you do tight it causes problems could mess up the stripping on the on the thread you know what I mean you got it you guys got it so hey let me take a hit right here allegedly it's supposed to be sweet give a little taste of citrus and also be a little earthy so let's do this hey oh yeah once against bud legend you know I'm giving you that exclusive review a sin cartridge this is cannabis oil top-notch premium Canon soil oh that's delicious oh my god I don't know what paint tastes like but this tastes like what pink should taste like it's almost like a human a grapefruit or something but not really a piney I guess that's the earthiness yeah Wow sweet I don't know sweet yeah I guess so perhaps but don't get it confused it's not a sweet that you would like you know correlate was sweet okay it's not like any sour apple or pink like no it's this sherbert but you know come on it's it's not that wild like that but it's extremely smooth you saw the hit you don't have to hit it hard to really benefit and get a nice of eight from it okay once again guys it can analyze down to the trillions to analyze the check for pesticides this company right here alright so you guys need to check it out this one's pink sherbert they have a whole slew of options right the whole gamut sativa sativa dominant hybrid you got the hybrids indica dominant hybrid and the indica beautiful indicates as well I'll be back right I'm gonna get a couple more of these I'll be back to give you my review on the other ones okay I'm gonna try to get you know as many as I can here let me hit it again real quick just get a little better taste yeah but it works oh man it's gonna be my favorite setup pin setup right here it's potent yikes it is subdued I got excited it is subdued but I'm catching to know the grapefruit you may catch something else you can see they got the cool little box right here comes with the plastic you want I mean look on the pin you don't have to turn it off you just unscrew it ever so slightly okay put the oil in the little box go right there put it in set it up they tell you to leave it up right okay so you want to leave it upright you guys a lot of a lot of people right like vaping in the cannabis oil is super popular right now understandably so but a lot of people having some issues with their you know their equipment so that's why I'm telling you to you know be aware of you conscious of how tight you screwing the cartridge into your battery and everything like that even when you screw the battery into the actual charger right you just got to be aware that you don't do it too tight okay it can mess everything up and look I want you to enjoy your fate this is premium vape so you you ought to take care of you know every aspect of it doesn't have to be too high maintenance or anything but I was trying to look for the battery right here you guys caught me trying to look at the battery you know but definitely check out ass in definitely check that out y'all alright you know what I got made a boo-boo I don't have it on me this time hey but you can figure it out I figured out just just need the little USB charger or screw it in I'll have that next time yo so anyway hey it's but legend like I said I'm reviewing the carbonyl I saying cartridge Hey and you've done close it up you don't know me tucked it away whatever you like to do boom like that sturdy little box things of this nature look I'm excited about this

"nPK-_hqhWA4": "let me sit down in my throne what's up you guys welcome back to my channel kawaii aka coco back it again with another [ __ ] video and today's video we are trying out something new i should tell by the title i am going to be trying out this delta a cartridge for the first time if you go back like two videos then you'll see that i did a goody kind unboxing and they sent me this delta a cartridge it's actually a new product on their line their store link will be pinned in the comments or in the description down below i didn't even have a battery for this and they went ahead and sent me a battery so i was like [ __ ] yes this company is so generous yeah i'm just so grateful that they sent me this and i get to try it but yeah um before we get into this i want to explain what delta a is because i actually just now started to hear about it so i'll try my best to explain what it is but basically delta 8 is a cannabinoid everybody's heard of delta 9 but if you don't know what delta 9 is it's like the main cannabinoid and thc that gives you that high effect but delta 8 is basically just like the reduced version of that you know it doesn't get you like high like delta 9 does it still gets you medicated you know but it's not going to get you like so medicated where you're just like i'm so strong bro no it's not going to be like that but yeah that's basically it when they sent me this i was like are they allowed to send me this but it turns out that delta a is actually federally legal and the reason that it's federally legal is because it is extracted from a hemp plant and that's super duper dope and i can't wait to try this i did smoke a bowl this morning but i waited until my high wore off so i could be completely sober for this to give you guys like a nice review on how i feel and things like that as you guys know i don't usually vape i bought a couple of thc cards in my lifetime before but they were never any good but this one's like legit it came it came in a whole [ __ ] box but i don't i don't mind vaping it's a discreet way to get even though this isn't like delta 9 thc it's a discreet way to get high to get stoney and you can't smell it maybe i should do like a video on how to be like a discreet stoner if you guys want to see that video comment down below let me know what you want to see from me but yeah um this is what the packaging looks like i don't know if it's pronounced goody kind or good kind but it is a delta eight thc vape card trick with 92 percent delta 8 thc organically grown pesticide free lead free co2 extracted no thickenings no flavorings third party test it and it gives like a warning on the package and tells you that it was tested and all that good stuff also they donate 1 8 to the navajo water project so go ahead and check them out they're very affordable focus beach they're very affordable and they're super duper nice company so please go check them out and i'm just very excited to get into this i'm gonna turn it on green there we go we got a flashing green and see if that does me well but um this is what it looks like you guys it's like almost clear i'ma go ahead and puff on this for you guys hold on it's flashing but i don't know what that means see i don't even know how to work i don't even know how to work vape pins y'all am i doing this right why is it flashing does it need to be charged oh my gosh y'all i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'm just trying to do a nice review but my ass does not know how to work vape pins it's like flashing and i don't think it's supposed to be flashing so i'm gonna charge it um brb okay so while this is charging what's up i apologize my ass was not prepared today you guys oh know man this pen didn't come with any instructions so i just don't have to figure it out myself okay so while we wait i'm gonna play some among us i wish we could smoke a bow i don't know how long this is gonna take [ __ ] yes this battery charged in like 15 minutes you guys that's [ __ ] dope but it finished charging right when i finished the round of a mangas we get to try this [ __ ] let's try this distill it out i'm do it on green we got it on free flashy flashy flashy i'm excited i'm excited [Music] oh whoa i'm in pain holy [ __ ] my ass was not expecting that this [ __ ] rips honey hold on do over do over do over cut take two my chest is a heaven then this [ __ ] knocked me out damn i should have started slow hold him a [ __ ] needs some h2o okay now we know that this pin rips well let's let's see how the [ __ ] delta eight tastes man i'm crying [Music] oh [ __ ] this actually does not have a taste it says no flavoring i said that from the beginning oh [ __ ] it says no flavoring but it hits so smooth you guys it's like airy you can't even feel it in your mouth that's how it took too big of a rip you can't even feel it in your mouth holy [ __ ] it smells like like a burnt coil to be honest like what you usually get from vapes that's also one thing that i didn't really like [ __ ] with with vapes is that like it gave like a a a metal taste and like a burnt smell but this one doesn't taste like metal it doesn't taste like anything it just smells like like a hot coil because that's what's happening right here you know this is nice uh this is nice what i read is that it gives you a head and and a body high so we'll see i don't know man i feel in a head rush right now but it's probably because i uh almost had a near-death experience this rips y'all and this is only on green how long maybe if i put it on blue it would have less of a smell unless you like sniff on it you can't smell it it still has like a slight smell but i just feel like that's just gonna come with any vape but enough about the the vape pen let's talk about the delta a i'm liking it so far you guys um it's very light it's not harsh on the throat unless you take too big of a hit like i did it's pretty most definitely it's so [ __ ] gorgeous it doesn't really have a smell just the pen has a smell it doesn't have a taste if you want something like really light and mellow like with like the effects and the taste and the the handling of it this will be perfect for you dude delta a is also said to help a lot with anxiety and i [ __ ] struggle with anxiety i've struggled with social anxiety most of my life and i know when i go outside i get all [ __ ] anxious and now i can have like something very discreet because i can't just like smoke like a cbd joint outside because people are going to be like the [ __ ] is that but nowadays people vape thc so they're probably gonna know what the [ __ ] this is especially if it's in a pen then they're gonna know something's up but you know no cop is gonna stop me like is it a vape pen and it has no smell you guys oh and plus it's federally legal even if the cop did stop me it is federally legal nice i'm actually starting to feel it in my arms and my feet i started working out lately you guys and my legs have been killing me my legs feel better oh wow this is nice i'm actually feeling a body high i don't know if i'm going to feel a head high i only feel like i feel like a head rush is because i cough so hard and you know once you when you cough so hard yeah your brain gets to like posting and [ __ ] like that but i'm definitely feeling like a body calm right now like i'm being medicated it definitely helped with my muscle pain that i was having earlier today in the past couple of days dude and i'm only taking a few puffs [Music] [Music] a lot of people like to use thc to help with like headaches and pains like that i have never felt those effects from thc i've had headaches and tried to just use thc without any ibuprofen but it never it never worked for me i feel that like cbd works a lot better for pain and things like that instead of thc but i heard that a lot of people use thc to help with pain but this has actually helped with pain it's weird it's so weird how this plant works dude it's like absolutely amazing and the fact that it's not accepted by most people that could probably benefit off of it is so mind-blowing to me i feel like this would be really good for somebody that has like a really low tolerance or somebody starting off like a newbie i feel like this would be really good for them i'm not talking way too much when i'm in a good mood i talk way too much this is nice y'all man i like this a lot i feel like my eyes got lower i don't know does like all cannabinoids do that or does like just delta nine make your eyes lower because delta a probably also make your eyes lower hold on we have a phone we have um wi-fi we can google it are my eyes red yes delta eight makes your eyes hella droopy and glazed over so if you do smoke delta eight then you will also have like the same effects in your eyes because i legit feel my eyes lower yeah i'm feeling good this is like literally just like a mild not even a mild high it's just like a little lower than that bro bro i don't know i feel like i feel like i'm feeling a high to be honest i feel like i'm feeling behind i think i took a lot of puffs and it's still it's still to the tippy top [Music] yeah i like this a lot goodie kind thank you i never knew my limit and i didn't know there was like a limit when i first started smoking cannabis and i would like green out i greened out like about two to three times before and i didn't know anything about cbd or delta eight and delta a is really good for nausea so if you're prone to green and out if you don't know what green and now means it's like basically overdosing on thc but you get sick like you your stomach feels sick you get nauseous i feel like if you were to smoke this like in between hits or just like smoke a few puffs before you smoke thc then it will help a lot with um that nausea feeling oh no i'm not trying to sound like a scientist but these are just conclusions theories conclusions and theories no i just had a [ __ ] idea do a science project while high how fun would that be how fun would that be but anyway yeah if you had if you struggle with anxiety or if you struggle with like the effects of thc or you just simply don't like the effects of thc then i would recommend this to you to be honest i do feel a little high and if you just do not like that high feeling then you it's probably best for you to just stick to cbd you know man i feel good my body feels good my shoulders feel relaxed this is so good and i'm so grateful that i was able to try this out and able to keep this product as my own thank you so much goody kind thank you everybody and thank you just like you know just thanks but um yeah i think that's it i feel a little stoned to be honest i'm not gonna lie i feel a little stoned

patio kick it into nice weather plays a fat Dube maybe jams from tunes probably end up just kicking inside my cell my xbox but that there'd be a nice type of day doesn't specifically have to have a bonfire involve just no mosquitoes if possible those things [ __ ] love me can't stand it even alive more than anyone in my vicinity it seems like and then I get like the welts on my body where they look like mini tumors my son's got it he got bit in the forehead like three times in his whole entire face swelled up we were worried so I had to take him to a hospital get some mom it was like cortisone shot or something to help so anyone that's allergic to mosquitoes more so than the average person hey I feel for you Michigan is not a great state for that especially if you're in a disc golf going to river buns during the dead part of the summer at the beginning part sucks too many mosquitoes I won't even play it unless it's the fall and there's a couple other courses that I prefer to play in the fall it makes it a little harder to find your disc but no mosquitoes throw on a hoodie goddamn blazed down [ __ ] throw some disc anyone in this video plays disc a comment below with

for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] follow me on my Instagram at all money read please I'm not the hit 10,000 subscribers really really want to hit 10k you don't have to do but it'd be [ __ ] greatly

not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below in the comments and I'll get a review out for that and then they just got some new fire ass card set the dispensary right down the road for me someone pick a couple of those up if you guys want to see some more these videos um if you guys enjoyed these like car reviews or if you guys want to see some more like maybe like wax wax video is like actually like shatter or like need Davin instead of just

those look but just whatever you guys want to see time go down below in the comments and we're actually about the record some more ground more reacts right now so those should be up so uh those should be up soon um besides for that if you guys like this video get a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it's been around here a peace out", "cVoQG7IDVD0": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "u8eHcQlPC6E": "all righty what is up guys welcome back Chris Kyle's TV this 21 / channel dedicated people of marijuana music sports gaming very much more so today's episode of kids TV you're gonna be doing a strand view of some sherbert so hope you guys are home I was smoking The Bachelor be joining cannabis related parts dog for a long girl 21 or over and as always they hit for a challenge guys up now Bowl loaded up but what a heartache every time you can take it as a merger or not what you guys are home do the same and smoke along with me so it's been a while since we do is we have done a strain review here and I just wanna let you guys know about the 15th or 16th of November we'll get back into our regularly scheduled string reviews will either be doing one a week or will be doing two a month guaranteed so be on the lookout for that like I said we'll get back to it about 15 for 16 but as of right now today like I said when you're starting to hear some sherbert picked it up at the pot chopped 8 bucks for a half gram I should say I was gonna get a gram of some reggae gold but it did not have it so I had to pick up some sherbert here and real quickly before we get into the strand review I just want to read you guys off what it says here on the package like I said it got some sherbert the thca is 32.5% cv DS are 0.1% and thct which is total THC is 29.6% so very high on the TV very low on the CBD it says Tahoma flavors in that this is an indica which is very wrong because by the stats here it looks like it happens to be a sativa dominant hybrid let's see though indica and then there's the stats right there so I don't know just by looking at it it looks like a sativa dominant hybrid but wants to smoke it to find out and like I said this is done by alias true premiums cannabis processor and it also says to Houma flavors then it got all the other [ __ ] on it so if you guys don't know about the pre-roll you don't really judge the smell because you can't really get a small off the pre-roll but we do judge the taste we do the pre lit taste what it tastes like before the before we light it and then we do the after lit taste sit there take about four five bucks see what it tastes like then and also we're gonna be doing the high so there we go guys I'm gonna go ahead and pop this sucker open let's go ahead and right now right now let's go ahead and do the pre lit test see what it tastes like before we get super-strong skunk a good strong taste of sweet time with the skunk Alcon almost overpowers that fine there but a five out of five for the greens taste test very strong on the palate very long-lasting on the palate - I'm very very tasty like it says super strong skunk taste with that super I wouldn't say super storm but a very good powerful taste of some sweet pine but the skunk is definitely a lot stronger than the pine but regardless definitely a good mix and don't be some dank tasting stuff just before the pre-lit so a five out of five for the feet let test and we'll get it back to you guys here in a second with that after greens or the after lit test let's get into that after it was lit taste test so after is lit the taste I get is some sweet skunk and some sweet pine and they're very strong too but they're about the same and also I do get an actually good strong case of some sweet lavender no no I normally I am NOT a big fan of sweet lavender or I should say not a fan of lavender taste but it's like it's not very strong but it is like you could definitely better taste it it's dumping odds of power but the very sweet lavender like I said very strong sweet skunk and sweet pied with a good taste and not a strong but a good taste of sweet lavender it's basically on the aftertaste when you ex help get a little aftertaste of that sweet lavender in there so the after Gries taste n so the after it was lit taste test it 5 out of 5 very strong in the palate and very tasty stuff name's 5 out of 5 very very very potent [ __ ] top 3 most potent should I've ever smoked in my life it really really hit your head hard like just no one else coughing right there that is probably the highest I've been in right now is the highest I've been in a long time I'm talking about northern blueberry blueberry are whoo yeah was it blueberry Northern Lights that's what it is blueberry nor like last time I smoked that that's about as high as I got right now and this [ __ ] here is super super potent a delight and the kabadi high very manageable but definitely a very heady heady in the car hey don't be a mix of some good strong sativa in there too but it's like a power punch of sativa and some indica but my head feels heavy I feel like if I lean a little bit to the left a little bit to the right too much that [ __ ] I'm gonna end up falling over so definitely a 5 out of 5 for the high definitely some [ __ ] strong potent [ __ ] good life in the kabadi high but a very strong indica and sativa wall balanced mix head high I'd say actually I'd say about a 60/40 and it gets a little bit more into control as it's starting to kick more on the ear so five out of five for the high so my official review here of this sherbert as you guys can tell it it got me [ __ ] up it tastes amazing and it gets you stoned like a [ __ ] and that's all you need in some weed and just need some [ __ ] that tastes good and get you stoned and this here does the job especially with just a couple hits so my official review of the sugar here is a 5 out of 5 this is some awesome [ __ ] [ __ ] right here like I said very very potent so if you want to save some money or you know [ __ ] you know get make your dollar stretch or anything like that sound of getting uh you know gram or two of some mid grade or getting the eighth of some mid grade go ahead and just go get you some of this sure bro right here I guarantee you man this [ __ ] right here is very potent you can sit there smoke a bowl and be good for half a day easy two balls be stoned all day all day no problem alright so some super strong [ __ ] here I know you want to smoke this whole Dre this is just a hop grab here and I've spoke just about most of it I say this is about a point was left so a little point for here Gavi feel like I already spoke to one point two maybe even [ __ ] it like a one and a half grab joy I said some super strong [ __ ] I definitely recommend you guys go to your block market your recreational medical where the [ __ ] you get your cannabis at let's go get you some [ __ ] sherbert you guys saw the size if you guys can get the same batch that I got right here I guarantee you you're gonna love this [ __ ] like I said if you're not big head of a lavender this here is actually gonna be good cuz I've told you just has that good aftertaste I've just saw some sweet lavender it's not too strong but it's not too light and [ __ ] it just tastes great it just tastes great especially with that strong [ __ ] skunk and that's strong sweet pine air should say sweet skunk and sweet pine did he finish it off there with that sweet lavender its abduct Lee good [ __ ] definitely a very enjoyable [ __ ] smoking experience with your smoker with some sherbert here so hope you guys enjoyed this [ __ ] if you did go ahead and hit the thumbs up like I said we'll be back with our regular schedule strain reviews about 1516 so if you guys have any suggestions or strain reviews that I've might are you guys want to see any suggestions that are and you know any friend of you guys want to say you know I'm saying then drop down in the comments this [ __ ] here man it get you in throat and it hit you in the head heart it's just a doc out punch to that definitely some stodie [ __ ] smoke at this [ __ ] here every hit I take is like probably like maybe a point for [ __ ] you know of a dab like almost a half gram down I get just really [ __ ] hit you there's somebody who dabs a lot I guarantee if you smoke this flower you'd be able to smoke this [ __ ] straight up and still get [ __ ] up cuz this here I feel stronger than to death you take a point to dab compared to a hit a hit off this joint right here of the sherbert this sherbert [ __ ] way stronger than adapt it's stronger than any dab I've ever took him now took an eighty percent THC Depp's this here is stronger some amazing [ __ ] so I already said hope you guys have a great day or night oh it's pretty far I'm just a eyes didn't get sealants and always do your PC guys next time with couch couch TV

stay lady zero for 20 what is up guys today we've got some mini money pickups as in small pickup we up we picked these up Apollo grown this was in the last video so we're not gonna talk about um these carriages today cuz we never had these trains before the first one is black mamba and the second was a polyp I think we tried a polyp I so sorry I'm sorry for the lighting guy is really important in a car cuz there's another end car review we just wanted to make this quick little video for you guys before we forget and throw away the boxes and if you guys ever like come through with these carriages we're gonna give you guys a little review on them but this is the cartridge that I'll show you guys for your eyepiece hi chicks right there supreme this is not the courage and here this is the Apollo grown cartridge but we have it plugged into our mods already this is what it looks like as a clear tip oh so apparently they're from the car we just are from so we're apparently when we're in Cali we're supposed to buy these cartridges from my homie that we matter and beyond wonder man yeah that's what don't go out raves to meet homies from now you stay with forever cuz social media you always see what what they're doing in life updates on them and yeah we were supposed to buy these from my home in Cali 35 bucks for gram Courage's but you got them as half grams of course why is there a little bit more they made you got them for $30 so it's not that bad usually they're around 40 or 50 bucks here I'm pretty sure if you get this in the mainland it's probably 15 bucks for their half grams but the first one I got here is al canvas old G it's indica dominant and Adrian God huh tangy haze it's Teva I'm pretty sure that's what we got at the dispensary yeah we got the 710 one oh yeah I'm gonna try test tasted Adrian you wanna go first [Music] Chavez sample sample that kind of burnish but not really this reminds of all-first Graham Tories I think these kind of remind me of no one dispensaries on the cartridge yeah I'm pretty sure do you have these cards in the mainland so well I know there's a lot of Hawaii guys people peeps tolling birds out there that's following us and I know it's very very limited here in Hawaii so I just want to show you guys these Courage's and give you guys a review because we're pretty sure they had this a lot in the mainland and count yeah do they are do they feel like cheap cartridges or yeah they definitely do they do yeah you can honestly kind of difference between when you buy high-end versus like black market I don't know if we're black market like that should burn smoke the rope like really bad and it as a dispensary like that shit's super smooth oh yeah yeah I think right now my throat is like Bernie but the brass knuckles smooth again but I really like eight out of ten not that bad yeah it do a lot of smoke yeah we got a long car down in the past that oh my god yeah the one I have actually [ __ ] up on me because I was so bad dude I was saying at work and I have my courage it was me working like I literally had Google I was like Hawaiians a microchip battery where key are like the pen and I look at YouTube it and

hey you enjoy your evening papal Jetta", "7zZIrXqwXS8": "[Music] when I got here this is a little micro bud of something called sunset sherbert and if you can imagine this was the biggest bud in the whole bag though all the buds were little tiny buttons in all my days I never saw so many little buds with something like this being the big one and what willing to take it if it's the best but I know in lots of places this would not be considered to be a bud that's good enough for an eighth they would put this in an ounce of mini buds or something like that and I make that comment cuz I just never saw a whole bag and here let me show you you can see look at this if you can see in there but you can see there they're all tiny tiny tiny little buds and anyway this flower has 26 percent THC and it's got the screaming skull on the front and let's see if sunset sherbert can make that feeling being us you can see I bet the vapor Cup set to 335 so let's check out sunset sherbert and then the vapor Cup look at all that babe oh my god I filled up my hole in inter Gabi that's a unbelievable wha oh my goodness so this flower it's super smooth or I couldn't get that much vaping I can't take that much vape into my lungs and really vapor Cup really is a game changer since I started using this item I would say I just feel and every way that I can use more flour I can use it more responsibly I can use it whenever I want to I don't have to sneak around I never sneak around I just take a walk around the block wherever I am I could be it at Grandma's house it's true and take a walk around the block and I come back don't stain nothing stinks I love vapor cup can you believe that so this flower it makes great faith very sweet but it's not about either of those things this is all about the something-something finding the one that gives you that perma-grin smile and what did I think of a sunset sherbert so I tried this one I tried it over and over again and I think I'm giving this flower made fun it's a good flower if you got this flower you are happy there's no issue but it's not as good or your fork as some of the other flowers it just is what it is this is the doctor for wheat entertainment thanks for watching the videos we enjoy looking for the best and we are going to find it if you like the videos please subscribe if you want to see vapour cup you can see it at bay perk up calm I know they have some Black Friday specials going on this item you will not be disappointed it is through to roof good this is the doctor for weed entertainment party on my friend [Music] you [Music]", "BMSHUp-OMew": "what up guys it's my clear three back here in another cartridge review I know it's been a minute but hey better better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "Fj5PoNrZ3OI": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "WwCPV68P4a0": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplicity here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another wax video some diamonds today actually and what a coincidence you guys have been mentioning about west coast companies and stuff and i mentioned you know there's like a west coast company coming out every month um this one is west coast skier and this is actually a company i've tried before their cartridge so uh this has been around this guy these guys have been around and uh this was 27 out the door i will be playing a video of it right now but as with diamonds it's running with a high percentage of thc uh total cannabinoid is 95.4 percent um thc 82.5 and the strain is papaya cake and papaya to me is very familiar in tasting with guava so uh that's what i i'm assuming i think i think i've had a papaya before and i'll just like guava so uh but yes i already opened it it looks good smells good 27 out the door and it goes to say with all their stuff west coast gear had their diamonds live resin butter or whatever they were all the same price i believe at authentic and the smell is there you know i'm saying which is surprising because with diamonds there's not really too much smell or taste um so i'm i'm hoping that these taste as good as they smell but it's definitely gonna get me smacked up we got the dip no i'm saying oh i just turned it off but let's just turn that on leave this cap over here and get a big diamond for the people [ __ ] people are always saying like i take small dabs i'm like well it's not a competition i take enough for me to get high you know i'm saying it's not a race it's not a competition you know since when was smoking weed and relaxing a competition you know i'm saying like it's really crazy what like people trip over especially on a video on youtube someone you don't even know you know i'm saying like so what if i'm taking small dabs it's like that's so that's so weird you know the bigger dabs you take the higher tolerance you have you know and in turn just that's a lot of money cheers uh there's no taste i don't think yeah there's no days so i would suggest you get like a very flavorful wax like raw garden or something and then mix a little bit of that sauce with this kind of like what i was doing with the delta eight you know put more of the delta eight and then some of the wax that you've been trying to save and uh it'll basically just take over the wax taste will take over the distillate or in this case the diamonds so uh you can actually get like fat hits and actually make use of shittier lower like not lower quality but like lower potency wax you know mix it with this i can definitely see me using that like that but as far as like taste goes maybe maybe i just got it wrong [Music] so i'm gonna pack that one more time for this video but as far as the taste goes there is none it smells good though or maybe a that's the thing with diamonds guys i don't know if you guys know but like if you're gonna get diamonds try to get like the saucy diamonds you know with like 50 50 sauce and 50 diamonds but cheers guys might i say i am [ __ ] stoned i'll tell you that right now the other video i did of the cali blaze was like an hour ago i'm continuing the ride i wonder if since this doesn't smell or tastes like any air doesn't taste like anything if it smells right all right guys so for its price 27 it's not bad i probably should have purchased um alongside another one of their their cartridge uh they're i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned guys i purchased another one of their wax concentrates like maybe the live resin instead of the diet or not uh purchase the live resin and the diamonds and just mix them when i take hits that would have been dope but yeah as far as like if it gets you high it definitely does but i knew this coming in buying diamonds most likely not going to be like any taste if so minimal um so i i knew what i was going into just kind of sucks that the kelly blaze kind of tastes like all right so if i were to be mixing any wax it'd be those two and it's like damn i could have had another west coast cure or a raw garden you know but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this wax video check out west coast cure if you're looking for some affordable diamonds with no taste but it doesn't matter if it doesn't have no taste you can just mix it with some other stuff but i can see some people saying that you know like what the [ __ ] no taste [ __ ] that [ __ ] but it is cheap diamonds are usually i would say 35 and up so um for at 27 is a eye catcher to say the least you know but other than that hopefully you didn't enjoy this video i would do like i would do i i would like to mention that i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned right now so i haven't started like this in in a while in a video so that definitely means something but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] you", "Lv_XjF2cbfo": "good morning beautiful people of the interwebs puffin pete coming at you with something different um i don't normally do these moxie reviews and it's not because i don't like moxie products it's because i think they are grossly overpriced um fifty three dollars or fifty dollars for a half a gram hundred dollars a gram come on guys it ain't gold it shouldn't be charged more than gold just saying to that end i did go last night to the dispensary i picked up this for today the uhp sunset sherbert shatter ultra high potency shatter uhp shatter i also picked up my first ever moxie flower we're gonna review that this afternoon um i have the dr dabber switch we'll pull it out i've heard good things we'll see um price was right but sour grape guys so this is what we're here for it is saturday saturday guys and like i said i got this uhp shatter from moxie it is packaged january 29th thc with a 39.26 thc a with a 58.9 thcv with a .27 cbd 0 cbga 0.62 cbda cbdv and cbn are zeros with a cbg of 0.71 for total cannabinoids of 99.76 it's reading more like sand numbers um this uhp shattered now full disclosure on this this was kind of cool let me tell you a quick story about this last night at the dispensary i picked this up because before any points or discount it was only 45 doll hairs for the half a gram of shatter again still overpriced but i was willing to pop on it i get down there and the bud tender says to me hey pete um listen before you get to doing your review she said uh moxie put their shatter in their jars instead of wax paper she goes so it's sticking to the bottom some of it's sticking to the bottom it's kind of hard to get out so we're just automatically discounting them an extra five dollars out the door i should have bought two but anyway i did get hey save me an extra five bucks um i also picked up some more stuff for the weekend some grassroots lemon grenades live sugar i got a grass roots garlic cookies live butter oh garlic cookies live sugar lemon grenades live butter so i got those to review as well as also the prime you guys saw yesterday so yep all right let's crack her open this is a sealed box [Music] it's got that side sticker on it it's completely sealed right here let's break it together oh that rip can be so satisfying sometimes okay so let me show you the shatter right off the bat here computer lights on okay ooh i got bright so you can see right there in the bottom of the jar it's orange it's clear golden and it's in the bottom of the jar just so you see it now i don't i've heard this is gonna make a mess when i try to get it out but yeah i can see that okay guys there is some stuck up on the jar lid i don't know if you can see that in this light probably not but there is there it is right there by the pinky there's some on the jar that looks like a shadow it's not a shadow and they warned me about that there was going to be some shatters stuck up on the lid and it's almost like they dripped the shatter into here um you can see the pieces uh there's like a drip down the side of the inside of the jar i don't know that's strange so it is what it is i'm gonna clean out my banger real quick i forgot to do that a little sticky from last night and that'll [ __ ] up my flavor and chase it that's gross i passed out i'm not gonna lie i was tired all right let's get a handy dandy turquoise it's not every day i have to start with a clean but my bad hopefully you guys are puffing on something good this weekend i'm i'm not having the greatest of mornings yet it's just one of those days one of those days i'm just not ready to start yet [Applause] i was dabbing on that uh cresco outer space last night not too shabby guys not too shabby at all all right we got the banger let's see let me get that tool out my gimbal went crazy my phone was freaking out my camera was freaking out i shouldn't say the phone the gimbal camera was freaking out that's kind of strange okay and see what my buddy meant when he said getting out made a mess because that is literally shatter it it crumbles i broke apart the one big piece i can pull it out for you guys boy this is going to be a mess i can see why they discounted it to avoid complaints there it goes under my lap okay [Music] there we are so i mean it's nice looking shattered it's not shabby it's just why the hell you would ever put it in those jars i just [Music] it's shatter it makes no sense to me um i personally just think you know leave it alone put it in the wax paper parchment paper whatever you want to call it just don't oh let's see how it turns out shall we smokey the turt turtle on his back just chilling um i'm looking forward to my waking big there we go cheers [Music] that's definitely sunset sherbert i need a little reheat on that god damn the taste is nice we'll see about the ultra high potency here in a minute this one makes me cough a bit wow oh no burn but it does have a tickle wow damn not too shabby i'm feeling pretty good already wow that one hits you in the face [Music] damn i got that tingling through my hair that warm i got that warm feeling from right right in my forehead straight on back and then the tingling started right working our way back to the back of my head that was wild oh wow i feel good that's a whole body got that warmth got that just smooth chill feeling yeah nice that's what i like the flavor is not the best i mean it's very mild there's almost minimal flavor but it's there you can definitely taste the sunset sherbet it's fairly clean it doesn't destroy my q-tip so that's good wow i don't know if i'm gonna want to fight another dab of this right now to get it into the banger um i want to break my glass dab tool for sure that's my dad's shoes original man yeah it's definitely stuck to the jar but if you'd be careful with it all right i'm making my nose run clearing my sinuses out okay so because of the the mess in the jar i'm going to just scoop some of the shattered pieces into the banger here [Music] see nice okay yeah it sucks it's only half a gram that's uh that's unfortunate um again that's a moxie thing and a frx thing that i don't like is that half gram [ __ ] uh but this uhp shatter is nice i'm gonna tell you right now it's kind of special now with the discount they're offering it's only forty dollars a half gram which makes it eighty dollars a gram it's cheaper than prime and it's moxie uhp shatter now for that price and that's before any discounts or any rewards points so now that price i think i'm going to have to i think i'm gonna have to make a trip down and grab another one or two of these how much they don't want to i probably should this is good i'm feeling it i mean i got that full face high like back in the day when you first smoke weed type of feeling it's hitting me right in the eyes the face oh yeah cheers me oh yeah this is a good saturday saturday a drink oh yep i'm good wow wow i'm gonna say this i don't like to uh i don't like to be a jerk i also like to be honest so [Music] while i said and i quote i think moxie's prices are [ __ ] i 100 stand by that they're overpriced and i don't like half grams however the quality's outstanding wow i got the sweats guys i mean holy [ __ ] i'm this is gross i'm like i'm sweaty though that's impressive guys this this moxie sunset sherbert uhp shatters it's something special if they can get their prices closer to what they're offering at this this discount on my dispensary all the time like this 80 a gram

good buzz on and get some awesome pain relief wow i'm feeling no pain my [ __ ] up knee my back my neck none of it i am feeling no pain and i am so relaxed even though i'm getting ready to go to work

card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye", "8qbsXkutRrE": "what's up YouTube this is I style images back with another review this one is the last of the MKX I picked up Jack area because it's a sativa hybrid and on the back of the box it reads Jack Harry is a sativa dominant hybrid that typically leaves users feeling stimulated but in cold lucid control of their actions this mellow high is great for alleviating low-grade stress anxiety and depression jack harries also known to be beneficial for chronic aches and pains I know I'm a laptop at the moment otherwise I would do the delete flee and read exactly everything that they say about it Pat Jack here before in this brand and in flavor acts I don't think in Platte I think in Platte I had King Louie I don't think I had a jack area so hopefully everyone had a fantastic Monday mine was a little eventful coworker almost chopped his fingers off with with the belt on top of the moment he's okay crushed part of the tip of his finger thank God I was backing up a trailer clipped back into the car shattered a taillight thank god that's all that was so all in all it was oh and I was late for work so there was the three bad things that happened to me today all in all great outcomes he's okay and lose a finger me no police were involved none of that we're just gonna replace the dudes taillight since that's the only damage that was done was on a 98 Camry so I can't imagine it's gonna be too expensive we're gonna get that taken care of as soon as possible oh that my day was good easy was that Monday's pretty easy for us it's just riddled with a couple of bad events we're gonna get back to this does the subject area MKX made Michigan powered by weed naps still can't get my QR reader to work on these yeah nothing predominant out of this cart from the dry hit at least if I had to guess just based on a little bit of the aroma I get from it which is a really taste it seems like just normal oil is like the earthy more of like an earthy taste I guess if I had to point a finger at it that's a that's kind of a woodsy taste not to Piney almost campfires yeah it's pretty much the only way I can describe that it's definitely not sweet no no citrus taste no don't like strong thick smoke that lingers in the back here throat when you hit it you know like you do with it's a really strong flour and some of these pungent ones all in all I like I still like this way better than the Blue Dream yeah I've smoked on this one I think so far my favorite out of all of them was the forbidden fruit even though online it says it's an indica on this box it says the sativa I don't off at the top of my head I can't remember if they said it was a hybrid in the comment section of the leafy thing strictly right at the top it says it's in purple and says indica this one says sativa but I like the flavor the flavoring of that one is really good tg4 was pretty good gelato was alright who dream was my worst in my opinion yeah carrier good I would recommend it to somebody hopefully everyone had a better day than I did I still got to try to figure out like topics to talk about so that I can engage my viewers a little more make a little more interesting for you guys it's a real nice night here in Michigan nice cool finally it was like 89 degrees here earlier today pretty pretty warm while I was out there cutting anytime the Sun was out not behind any clouds it definitely kicked it up a notch so if you're outside working in this a more power to you man women who ever you know just stay hydrated drink a lot of water yeah make that money whatever you do make that money people say it's not everything but unfortunately you need it for almost everything maybe not good memories and all that stuff a lot of times if you want to go do something unless this I got a beach or something where you can just take some towels or whatever you know pretty much everything cost money these days haha as a job that you yeah hopefully you all enjoy your job said like I don't mind my job to drive a truck I Drive a mower you know at the beginning of the year when the grass is growing like crazy when people just start fertilizing you know you work in anywhere from the 10th worst case scenario 14-hour day doesn't happen very often like that but we do get a lot of 12 and 13 this is the time of year where you know the sums bacon all the grass people aren't watering enough because their water bills are up like crazy so grass isn't growing as much so we're able to blow through these lawns considerably quicker a lot of these people need to turn their water on though you know your grass is looking brown and dead like every time you come on to her house there's no way you can enjoy looking into grass that way I don't enjoy cutting it you know it doesn't look like it needs it doesn't look like meanza but that's not the way this industry works unless they call for a skip you gotta cut it that's just the way it is if they come out and ask for a skip yeah hey no problem yeah stop up and leave but in their contracted state said they've got a call in with him I think 24 hours you know it can't be like the hour before or we're halfway and cut it we're halfway done cutting your lawn and you call back say hey I asked for a skip you know that's not how things work that's just work [ __ ] so as I said I'm in the Xbox so I'm pretty excited about this whole project scarlet stuff with the new Xbox show a bunch of you air PlayStation fans which is which is straight especially with all this cross-platform [ __ ] that everyone's doing nowadays hopefully some of the bigger games that I enjoy playing become cross-platform like some of the Call of Duty games things like that next one I'm getting in is modern warfare the newest Call of Duty oh it's got a streaming man so all in all hopefully everything is Koshien just someone I know remembering it other than that that's just me bullshitting Jack Harrier MKX definitely recommend it not a bad flavor as I said more woodsy I'll be back with another review as soon as I can get my hands on some more stuff but until then I'll do music reviews and stuff like that maybe talk about anime shows and [ __ ] that I watch new movies coming out things like that smash that subscribe button hit that like alright the subscribe button smash that like button comment below you guys have a great night and a better Tuesday", "3qqP7SXaAVE": "hi tim here i just wanted to talk about one of the new cartridge products that we got called core pods this is the core pod hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "4T3xo27vhNk": "if you're not a canvas patient or of age please cycle for this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be smoking on some maddie labs cart so here is the card itself it is in a pocket vape like cartridge so it is um good hardware battery so that is the cartridge on my environment so you guys can get a better view and then here's a box it got freaking squished so that's pretty much all i can show you oh and then there's front and then there is top but yeah there's all that so i know it's a bm brand but from what i heard the oil is pretty good so that's why i want to go ahead and give it a try so let's go ahead and take it so it does taste like a regular distillate do you eat the little lemony taste let's go ahead and take another so i'm hitting this off of the toki 510 thread battery and like i said the lemon haze not elapsed cart so i'm probably going to be doing a couple videos i think i have four other flavors so i'm going to be trying a couple other ones but yeah make sure you guys like leave a like on the video because it really helps me out so when i'm not uploading make

Oh everything went well coming into the new year with 2017 folks just we do big things big things this year guys I'm just kidding hopefully though yeah but anyways if you guys remember in my last series we only ran two plants they were sunset sherbert by dark art nursery however they were the lab lit so when I say lab let's basically I'm saying there is a scraping as a tissue culture so it is just scraping I believe of the sherbert plant itself and then they then grow a tissue culture and then make a plant from there however these are not the lab lit so these are considered harlots from dark heart nursery so now the Heartless are your premium clones but again basically they're not from tissue cultures so I'm not sure how they're gonna come out I'm hoping they come out like my last run cuz I really like that stuff however my last run folks came I did find a couple seeds in it I was actually very happy about it it was my best crop yet and you know I'm pretty excited to put them I just popped some in the dirt they popped up so I don't know they're be male or female or what but um I'm pretty excited I'll definitely let you guys know what's going on with that but again anyways we got four of these bad girls right here they are on let me see day six of veg now when I say day 6 of beds I picked them up on the 29th and I gave them a week to take on their transplant but anyways I'll be giving you all up day keep you posted please like and subscribe if you haven't done so alright peace bail out", "XSFrzkVRPNY": "[Music] what's up guys simplisec here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another reaction video but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the

of\nConnoisseur Concentrates, and I am back to do another Terpene Profile Breakdown\nVideo. Today I am joined by my Chief Lab Technician; Professor Matsumoto (Hey what's up), and my Media Director; Audrey (Hi), and today we're gonna be doing a breakdown\nof the Runtz terpene profile that we've created, okay? So the Runtz strain itself\nis a pure sativa. Everybody always asks us for sativa profiles, here you go.\nThis is it. Now, the strain itself actually smells exactly like the candy.\nAnd I picked this up I believe that the Cookie Store down in LA. And because it\nsmelled so much like the candy I really wanted to make it. It was an interesting\nchallenge. One of the first things that you're going to notice is that it is a\nclear bottle, which means that it is a pure organic strain. All of the\ningredients in it are organic terpenes. There is nothing synthetic and nothing\nartificial in this blend. One of the first things you're going to do when\nyou're purchasing the strain, is pick it up and smell it. So I'm gonna do that for\nyou, let you know what it smells like. Now this is a really interesting one. All\nthe new stuff that we've been coming out with, it's all vastly different from each\nother. Now a lot of people complain about terpenes smelling like each other,\nthroughout the companies, this is definitely a different one. So, what I\nsmell right off the bat is an earthy candy and as I've mentioned before; this\nreminds me of childhood. And I don't know why but I think we can all remember\nbeing kids, and playing outside, and eating candy, and eating things like\nRuntz, and the first thing that this brings me back to is just being a kid. So,\nthat's definitely one of my favorites because we all need those things in life.\nHaving said that, even though it smells amazing, I tell everyone all the time\nthat you cannot buy terpenes based on what the bottle smells like. The bottle\nis gonna smell like, regardless of how many ingredients in it, whichever few of\nthose ingredients happen to evaporate off at room temperature, that's what it's\ngonna smell like. The rest of them may not be evaporating at all. So you're not\ngetting the full profile there. Audrey's gonna explain a little bit more about\nthat for you. Right, so when you're purchasing your terpenes, like Drew\ntouched base on, a little bit; you have to keep in mind that the bottle and the pen\nwill almost never taste and smell exactly alike. You have to keep this in\nmind because at the end of the day, your client is gonna be tasting a pen, not\nsmelling your bottle. This is what makes our product better. We formulate these\nstrains and these lines for the end-user and the end-taste, rather than smelling\nthe bottle at the counter. As I've said: you may get a couple ingredients that\nevaporate off at room temperature, but your goal is to have all the ingredients\nevaporating off at the temperature of that pen when you're hitting it, which is\nprobably around 400 degrees. That's the way we formulate our stuff. So Cam, can\nyou explain to people what this actually tastes like when everything's working\nright? Oh for sure, I actually made up a pen in the Runtz right here and I'm gonna\ntell you exactly what it tastes like. Wow, that's good. So, initially I get a\nsweet candy flavor, mixed in with mild citrus, and I also tasted a little bit of\na light earth aftertaste onto it. Imagine kind of like Grape Ape but on like this\nsweeter end of it. It's really really just imagine being a kid man. Yeah, how's\nthe cannabis level? The cannabis level on this, the the Runtz I would say it's more on the mild side. You're getting a lot of that candy, that\nslight amount of citrus, and that fairly faint earth, but it all comes together\nreally just. Yeah and you know I personally made this to taste exactly\nlike that cannabis smells, and that cannabis smells a lot like the candy, so\nwe made it taste a lot like the candy. Not everything actually tastes exactly\nlike weed. So it's pretty dead-on. I'm really proud of this one. So, the way that-\none of the other ways that we designate our terpene profiles is based on whether\nit is a blended profile or a separated profile. Separated profiles; first you're\ngoing to taste something, then you're gonna taste something different, maybe\nsomething different on the exhale. In a blended profile; all of those flavors\ncombine and you taste the same thing, all the way through the inhale, all the way\nthrough the exhale. Where does this one fall Professor? The Runtz falls under a\nvery well blended profile. You're gonna be able to get that sweetness, that\nreally sweet candy taste, and that light earth, and that light citrus, from start to finish. It's cool, so, regardless of where the cannabis level of the profile lies,\nthere is a difference between the cannabis level in the profile and the\nstrength of the overall profile, compared to a different profile. Audrey can\nexplain that to you. So every terpene profile varies on how strong the\nactual strength is. This terpene profile is categorized into our medium\nstrengths. We designed it to be an enhancing agent, rather than a masking agent. So on that exhale you'll get sweet cannabis aroma, and tones coming out, rather than\nbeing completely covered, like it would with Banana or Bubblegum. I definitely\nrecommend that you try the strain. If you'd like to try it, we have sample\npacks on MrExtractor.com. If you're interested in purchasing it; you can get\nit from Mr.Extractor.com. If you want to see it in person you can stop by any\nof the Terpene Labs we have across the country. Our largest Terpene Lab is in\ndowntown Los Angeles. You can go in there, you can smell the bottle, you can try a\npen, and you can leave with some that day. By the way, if you're interested in\nopening up your own Terpene Lab; right now is the time. We are opening up\nTerpene Labs all across the country; Canada, Mexico, New York, Florida, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, Arizona, Los Angeles, to name a few. That's what we've already got\nin the works, who knows where it's at it by the time you're watching this video, right? Hit me up directly. If your company purchases in bulk;\nanything over 800 grams, my name is Drew, contact me directly. I'm slashing the\nprices on bulk products. We are a manufacturer of bulk terpenes, and we\nwant to put that in your store. So hit me up, tell us what you need, tell us the\nprice points you need, I will make that happen, okay? Free stuff. We love giving\naway free things, Audrey is gonna explain how to get some free things. Everybody\nloves free stuff, so in person go to any of the Terpene Lab locations. Drew\nmentioned earlier across the country to get your free grams, and online go to\nwww.MrExtractor.com to follow our social media, that's where we give away the BOGO,\n50% off, and all of our good deals. Did I mention that all of the Terpene Labs, I\nhave designed to where they all give away free things mandatory. Everybody has to\ngive away free things at every Terpene Lab in the country. It's what we do, okay?\nSo, stop by there. Cam? And I say check out our other Terpene Breakdown Videos. We have so many new profiles for you guys man, it's exciting stuff. Yeah\ndefinitely. Hey so thanks for watching the video, I really appreciate it.\nHey, go check out another video. We'll see you in the next video, take it easy. Later. Bye.", "vjKKFeBvBuU": "hey my name is vero i am vendor educator for item 9 labs i've been getting lots of questions lots of emails about delta 8 and i thought instead of responding to them all individually i'll just create a 5 minute video talking about everything delta 8 hopefully this answers all of your questions and then some so first of all let's get right into it what is delta nine i assure you that you do know delta nine also known as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is thc thc that cannabinoid responsible for the psychoactive effect of cannabis so what is delta 8 well delta 8 is another of the 150 cannabinoids found inside of the plant it is native to the cannabis flower but it is made in fractions of a percentage it is not as abundant as delta 9 thc when you look at the molecular structure of delta 8 and delta 9 you will see that they are very very similar however when you consume them you realize that they're different for one thing delta 8 has a much lower psychotropic potency than delta 9. now notice i did not say it's not psychoactive when you give this to a patient it is very likely that they will feel a change it will feel an effect so we like to say that delta h has its own unique feeling it feels like what delta eight feels like it's hard to compare it to delta nine but patients wanna know what does it feel like so how can we describe that feeling of delta eight this is how i talk about it when i consume delta 8 i feel clear-headed i am lucid thinking i can concentrate i am focused and in the sound i am not foggy i don't have any paranoid thoughts i'm not impaired however i still have that general feeling of wellness that i have when i use cannabis i feel calm at peace content i might feel it from the ice down depending on how much of it i take but i just have all the benefits without that mental impairments right so who likes delta eight when i worked at the shop i remember golfers love delta aids cyclists hikers caregivers people who need to be productive for part of their day which is a lot of people it's important to realize that people who like delta 9 and people who like delta 8 can be the same person the what your patient is looking for on a friday night is not necessarily the same thing he or she is looking for on a wednesday morning to get ready for finals or to get ready for work so it's really a great tool for everybody's belt what are some of the medicinal benefits that you may experience when you use delta eight for one thing you may feel a release intention and anxiety it could be a sleep aid it could even protect your brain cells but one thing i hear overwhelmingly from butt tenders and patients alike is that it is great for nausea anytime you hear a patient talk about nausea not being able to eat think delta eight grab that delta eight for that you could be changing somebody's quality of life i'm not gonna get into it here but i really encourage you to check out a study from hebrew university in jerusalem israel where they studied the effects of delta 8 on pediatric patients who were suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy now let's talk about the item 9 labs delta 8 line we have cartridges and capsules the capsules are 14 milligrams and they come in a pack of 10 so that's 140 milligrams of delta 8. the cartridges come in c cell half gram or 500 milligram cartridges they're about 80 to 85 percent delta eight thc and they come in a wide variety of flavors we just released three new flavors that's cool breeze strawberry fields and lychee lychee is my favorite but they're all really really great these are complex flavors that taste really well you don't get tired of them they don't make they're not like overly sweet they have a lot of depth to them i'm really impressed with them if you have tried delta a talk about it with your peers um remember just really remember delta eight and nausea that is such an important thing all right well that's all i'm close to the five minutes so i'm gonna leave it at that keep sending me your emails keep sending me your questions i will post my email at the end of this video you guys have a great day okay bye bye", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for

time man marijuana mystery supper out Hey", "-RQWkGvmUpA": "hey y'all trevor here with reddit leaf and i am back for part two of the 50th episode today we're going to be tapping into a little citizen stash stonewall this is citizen stash's version of the mimosa strain i can't wait to tap into this you guys with yesterday having a 23 out of 25 stone while we gotta pack some punches with you all today [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back you guys and as i said right before we had that intro we are tapping into the stonewall strain from citizen stash it's a mimosa strain we've got the lift and co website pulled up for the mimosa from citizen stash um alberta the agelcs alberta gaming liquor and cannabis commission i believe is the whole abbreviation aglc um mimosa alcoholic drink can't have alcohol it's just like you won't see um god's green crack on their green crack on there they they just won't you won't see any sort of association with other drugs or alcohol products at all so citizen stash had to change the name to stonewall it is still the mimosa strain it's just different name for alberta so mimosa is a sativa dominant hybrid with hybrid with aromas of orange and earthy tones handcrafted in small batch conditions without the use of pesticides ensures quality experience so that's all the information that lift and go has for the citizen stash mimosa strain we're not going to wait any longer you guys we're going to dive right into the herbage scale if you want more information on the mimosa go and check out part one of this video [Music] [Music] and we're back with the look and aroma you guys holy crap this bud is gonna get a five out of a five for look and aroma just based on so this is actually two nugs here but i'll let you guys take a look at that big main nugget there and it is just exploding with aroma you get a huge tangerine clementine very sweet orange smell you don't get much of the earthy tones i've been finding it is just a very sweet smelling bud and it's not dry like you it's dense but it's not dry by any means i'm giving this a 5 out of 5. and i'm very excited to try this out you guys i should probably give you the information on the actual strain too i knew i was missing something i'm just so excited to try it so 505 for looking aroma but the information for the stonewall is gonna be 22.7 percent thc zero percent cbd and it was packaged on march 2nd and it's sativa you guys mostly sativa oh this smells absolutely just amazing and i can't wait to see what it what it has to offer when you bust it up and we're gonna take it through boundless vaporizer first so see you guys over there so once this bud is busted up you get a lot more of that earth earthy tone but the sweetness aspect of the bud is played down quite a bit so i don't know if there's maybe just one bud in that container that's really sweet in comparison to the others or if it just loses some of that when you bust it up we're gonna pack up the boundless vaporizer and start out at the 175 temperature and uh see how uh how citizen stash puts their mimosa out so we've got the boundless own we've got it set to the 175 and now we're just waiting on it to warm up we're at 100 degrees right now and climbing so the mimosa had a really strong and potent flavor throughout i'm hoping that the stonewall does as well let's tap into it you guys hmm you do get a very citrusy flavor definitely more orange very clementine sweet sweet citrus it's it's an enjoyable little flavor i'm quite impressed with how sweet the presentation is at that 175. we've got to bump it up to the 205 and see if it continues with the sweeter profile you get a little bit of earth but it definitely has more that sweet orange flavor this is surprisingly enjoyable we're gonna bump up to 220 now that sticks with that really sweet flavor it adds a little bit of an herbal tone to it but nothing nothing unenjoyable it's nice now at the 220 let's see if we get more flavor with that along those lines you get a little more of that earth a little more that musk it's still very sweet surprisingly sweet and strong through the vaporizer you guys might have to give this a 5. i mean i end up giving this a 5 you guys it's consistent potent flavor throughout is extremely enjoyable and it's uh definitely allowing for more exploration along those higher temps and with a still very enjoyable flavor i'm quite surprised at how well that that played out and it earned that five out of a five with with ease i'm gonna say but we've got the first bong getting packed right now we're going into my favorite part of the review i love smoking these rigs let's light up our hemp wick and take the first rip through the bong and see if the flavor profile pushes all the way through to here as well see you guys on the other end cheers [Music] hey guys so i'm gonna give this a four out of a five for the taste from a bong it had a really pleasant and enjoyable flavor all the way through it just didn't have the punch that i was looking for especially in comparison to um the mimosa from yesterday that best buds that one had although it was a little bit drier it had a little bit harsher of a cough the flavor was way more of a push through so although this one was a lighter more enjoyable not quite as much of a cough to it it it sacrificed some of the flavor there too so the 4 to a 5 is strong and respectable but just doesn't quite have what it needs to get that five um we're gonna continue smoking out of pickle rick let's light him up and see how uh see how the stonewall produces flavor through there cheers you guys didn't get much flavor on that first one you guys so i'm gonna pack up a second pipe and see if it's gonna match up i've got the crave straight pipe this time let's see if a little more glass helps it out hey guys so this bud is going to be a big disappointment it's only going to get a three out of a five for the case from a pipe it has just a very neutral bland burnt kind of burning like a burning citrus field like an orange field like a feel that's that's the flavor i'm getting without much of the orange pusher just the leave and woody kind of burned and it's disappointing there the the bongs definitely seem to be the the more consistent flavor and the vaporizer seems to be more flavor um it was enjoyable but didn't really have anything that spiked my interest so three out of five is the best that's gonna get you guys hey guys so i'm gonna give this strain a four out of a five for a tie and this is more of a personal preference type of a decision than anything else this is this stonewall is a very nice hitting mimosa strain it leans more to the euphoric side than it does the energy side which is why i'm knocking it down just a little bit i still really enjoy it i'm personally just more of a clear-headed sativa person i like more the energy than i do the euphoria uplift the euphoria uplift i find is more beneficial for me at night and this with kind of that little bit of energy just kind of can can send me down some mental spirals that i just i they aren't as enjoyable for me so this is a strain that i would have more in the evening where i'm going to have a heavy hitting indica to go with it where it's like okay let's uh let's get my mind in a nice creative venture so i can watch something and and and like dive off into it and have a very good heavy hitting indica that'll uh that'll have my body relaxed and comfy in bed or cuddled up or wherever i'm being watching that movie i uh i think that might be the best way to describe that high it it did well you guys it did very well i'm i'm impressed to say the least but we're going to slide over over into the high and i'll smoke one more bowl with you before we wrap this video up so you guys this strain is going to end up getting a 21 out of 25 for its total so it doesn't quite hold up to the 23 out of 25 that the best buds mimosa put out there which i want to congratulate to those guys for having the better of the strain but by no means does this me make this citizen stash stonewall or citizen stash mimosa bad bud at all i thoroughly enjoyed smoking it the look and aroma i'll let you guys take another look at it you guys and oh this bud smells amazing and we lost an ugg there but you can see it looks absolutely amazing and there's that nug that fell down like just great looking cannabis pack into the vaporizer you get a very sweet flavor throughout it reminds me of the orange tangerine clementine kind of flavor and extremely enjoyable throughout you go into the taste from a bong and it they all have a very mild flavor that i just wish was more predominant through and if it was it's an easy five out of five you guys but that's the only thing i was lacking was just power of that citrus flavor and then you go into the taste of a pipe and it just ends up being bland with a hint just very fine hints of a citrus zest and it's disappointing along there and the high the euphoric side that honestly i can honestly feel start starting to lean towards more of a headache side which is one of the reasons why i don't like smoking high euphoria type strains that often unless i'm going to bed where i've got an indica matched up but still citizen stash well done i enjoyed smoking this bud thoroughly and i'll enjoy smoking those last three fat dogs that are in there this is it you guys this is the 50th episode we've wrapped up i can't believe it i want to thank you guys so much so much to everyone who who's come

some notes i took from dr vessel van kalk hey if there's a living dude alive that i would like to hang out with it's you dr russell you just get it like i was cool stop i was like crying last night just like releasing trauma but also because he's so on point he wrote a book called um i really want to get it it's called the body keeps the score okay but first i'm gonna put this in this friend one really interesting thing look at my neck sit down with what look at your neck okay so you know a lot of people have muscles here that you'll see when you when you turn you can see mine like that part and moi so let me sit normal so you can see i'm missing them they're absent those are called the curiosity muscles see and traumatized people don't have time to have them like you can literally tell people that are traumatized or not traumatized if they have this part of the muscle sticking out it made a lot of sense to me because we're like this all the time like unconsciously a huge thing he said whether i've heard this before or not and that's the thing about healing like [ __ ] will hit i don't want to sound like you know woke [ __ ] will hit different he's like and maybe it's just because i've had an ex had experience with people who don't understand and i'm learning it as i'm healing so i don't totally understand but for anybody that's that loves somebody that has trauma or has been through trauma and has somebody that they trust and love to explain this is the easiest freaking way it's vessel van cock's way of explaining that people don't understand trauma is not a story that happened to someone that's not trauma isn't memories i have it's not stories it's a rewiring of the brain so i've made that joke like trauma brain before because i read that in a book somewhere basically i love him i want to marry him you guys um he did the first study on uh yoga and trauma and found that trauma was more the most successful john was the most successful at healing yoga yoga is more successful than any medicine at healing yoga um where are my notes though my proper ones the rewiring of the limbic system um you said something funny it's like traumatized people aren't like usually very popular people because they're awkward and we are awkward i guess and i was thinking about like how lucky i am to have like at least a few people that i know love me even though i'm so quirky and awkward but um yeah i'll always be standing here strong for anybody that's not strong enough yet because i remember that okay okay um i mean i remember what it felt like to be completely alone and it wasn't the world's not fair toss that you know like forget the world being fair there's just like there's a lot of grace to be had for giving people that are not sorry and also continue to orchestrate duress in your life okay so one big thing okay so the difference between trauma being a story like this that happened to somebody like somebody that had been through trauma might i could i guess i could understand this when he was saying it last night why do they keep talking about that story like if somebody i would imagine like and i did see this actually i did see this actually in some way that i was seeing after like somebody that i was dating after my father passed away he hadn't experienced really any loss like his parents or anything and like i could tell like at some point it's like just get over it your dad died you know what i mean like and like depending on the relationship you have with your parents um i mean for me that was the one i always knew my whole life it would be the event that would knock me down that i would not survive and i still have a daily relationship with the fact that it has not here but just to like even have those feelings i think is i don't know i think it just makes people different like i remember i dated a guy in high school and his mother passed away like before we were together like his mom passed away when he was eight and we were like in high school we did it all through high school and he used to cry about his mom i'm like i had both my parents they were freaking happy healthy like very amazing but like i remember like it would scare the crap out of me and like i would go and be like that i love you you know but i guess everyone's different for a person that's experienced trauma that changed their brain it's not just a story that they're repeating it's physiological responses that they're basically um of it's um your being state is constantly compromise and then at the whim of like for example i made a video the other day my dog jumped out of the bed funny and like hit my elbow and like my body that's why i love the title of this guy's book the body keeps the score my body like shot into i was like hyperventilating and crying and like i was in some kind of trauma that had been triggered by telling my body remember but my mind was successful in in shoving away so it's a huge huge milestone um marker of like badassery for healing to be able to say that this happened to me and it was bad but today is march 24th it's over i can actually do that um body keeps the score mindfulness uh rewiring the brain resetting the limbic system and trauma therapy so like the curiosity muscle like people trauma don't have time to be curious we also put to the brain are shut off like the parts for creativity for imagination so it's very important for us to be in safe places where we can be creative and imaginative yeah curiosity muscle is uh absent in traumatized people ah okay so every other day um this is called everyday mimosa one gram for use with 510 thread only okay so this is one i've not tried before i skew that part down wah everyday it's an indica look how bossy it is on the back five ten thread only okay i'm gonna get my egg rolls before they burn i'm wondering it's a sativa i thought it was an indica it's a sativa i'm wondering where they're going to give me the info on the thc hey boys these are the boys that brunch juventus poised up brunch on sundays too yeah i told them about that okay so it comes in this cute little thing [Applause] okay show no info on the ttc content i guess it's just gonna be a surprise so everyone knows 510 thread it's like silly did you even fire he needs to get to the bathroom it's like a silly thing because it wouldn't fit in anything else so it's like 5 10 10 only like not say thank you for buying my product it's i i'm just kidding let's see oh there's the information 89 thc 10 milligrams of cbd i'm liking that package

online i've seen other people review it and talk about it um and they never they didn't send me this like i paid for this with my own money uh and i gotta say it's definitely uh blowing my expectations away i would say that i'm pretty picky when it comes to like uh delta you know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i definitely wish them the best obviously but cheers boys we're going to take off this i have to be careful not to hit this too much too big because um delta really makes me cough i don't know if that happens to you guys but it makes me cough my [ __ ] head off um do let me know what you guys are dabbing on eating on smoking on whether it's delta a delta nine uh definitely smoke along with me man i don't wanna smoke by myself and i just wanna go ahead and get this out of the way make sure to like comment subscribe all the good youtube stuff if you're new here man welcome aboard uh we just hit 2000 subs man it's [ __

man i don't get paid to do this so that's all i'm asking you to do okay cheers boys we're gonna take another good hit okay okay so it's lemon cush it's an indica 940 milligrams so it's not fully a grain technically um anyway so it's um my phone's blowing up total thc is says zero percent total cbd can total total connect total cannabinoids is 93 um it has the legal amount of technically thc in it 0.3 um has delta a and flavored terpenes like i said the box is very nice you can scan here to see like all the [ __ ] that you need to know like i said i really love the packaging i love what they did here like i just think they did a really good job and it like i said it's lemon kush it definitely tastes like lemon man and with just a little bit of like kush terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor man um if this video you know let's try to get 40 likes man if this video gets 40 likes i'll that'll let me know that you guys still want to see more delta videos more delta reviews um yeah i'm already getting kind of high off this man it's not like obviously like a delta 900 it's not like super psychoactive uh but it is very calming and very relaxing and my body feels really like just chill my eyes feel really good it is an indica so i mean but let's go ahead and keep taking some hits man let's get [ __ ] high [ __ ] on this okay [Music] and let me know in the comments man um me and my girlfriend do a lot of hikes and stuff during um the summer let me know if you guys want to see any like delta nature sessions you know just like hiking matrix sessions in general so yeah definitely in the comments if you guys would ever want to see that man and definitely shoot any dozer uh products that you think that i would maybe like or that maybe you'd want to see me try maybe i could pick it up with somebody or you know we'll see but uh let's just keep it in this man [Music] so seriously though i mean this disposable actually does get me high compared to where the other one i had was not really that good and i'm a big fan i'm a sucker for disposable stuff like i said um so i definitely would say this is the best disposable delta a pod or delta pen that i've had disposable um love the packaging love everything about it love the taste my girlfriend really likes this she even has been spoken on this a lot and says it really gets her to the you know that right high that she wants so yeah i mean i'm not sponsored i'm not telling you to buy it i'm just telling you that this is a good brand if you are looking for disposable pots it has a light down here to let you know like uh that you're hitting it i don't know if you could take a blinker on it i tried it when i first got it in the other video and i literally coughed for 10 minutes so i'm not really trying to do that again it also has a k right here i don't
