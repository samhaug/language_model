{"jLJWAM_L4_c": "[Music] I've known always I know oh boy what's up guys simplistic here back with another video as you could see wonderful day outside you know I'm saying we're at Ben's house in his backyard and I I bought these pre-rolls like on Friday last week and I I'm already saying I already opened it I already used five there's seven of them and I saved two for this video one for me and one for Ben and as you can see the brand is called hervana it says 20% THC and the only thing I have a fault with this back packaging is look at it I don't even know if it was like airtight at all you know like this is not like yeah so it doesn't keep the joints fresh that's my only neck and it was a bit dry I'm not gonna say it you know I'm not gonna lie and uh I don't it's just pretty much all I can say about that but you have the lighter thing right here and you can open it well packaged not gonna lie for every ounce they buy they plant a tree or for every ounce that's bought from them they buy a tree or plant a tree that's pretty dope yeah so they definitely aren't giving back to the planet you know says a lot about a company that whether they're willing to you know do that so here's Ben's oh yeah and the packaging is biodegradable or some [ __ ] I don't know so they also gave you some matches tied to a hemp wick yeah so [Music] oh I'm running independent no I mean coming in my feeling [Music] so these are point fives each seven joints and these are for mostly the people that can't roll or in a rush and yeah those are basically lonely like from from a stoners perspective always try to get an eight and just roll your own because you don't know what they actually put in these I'm not gonna just spend money and then empty one and see what it is because I spent money on it but people some people do and sometimes it's just shaking these pre rolls so you just got to be aware and like I said the the airtight packaging was not there so it definitely does not keep the joint as fresh I mean what do you guys say about the joint it's smooth though right yeah oh it strain is this that's another thing I don't really like about is that they just call it hybrid which is a hybrid blend so it's a blend of all this stuff and usually when I hear blend I just think that they just blended all the remaining shake together their hybrid [ __ ] hopefully it's not the case but in the end I can't really tell but you could follow them and see it there I mean who knows you know good and it's definitely not bad you know I've tasted four screw holes right and this is like a little point fiber so it's like for those of you who are tweeting cigarettes but smoke weed like cigarette besides this you know I don't think ban was expecting the smoke all joined by himself today I just came through with it but luckily it's a point five so I feel like anyone can handle 0.5 yeah I'm gonna that's one good quick and like so when you smoke things quick especially when you only want smoking it it's still gonna be slow smoke like the other ones the other five when I first opened out that Blake's house mean and just had one were just smoking it yeah then when money came I gave him one to avert itself and then a half me and Blake shared half and then you came and I was just like you know just save this for what my do a video I played salsa [Music] but also seen a video recently of owl owl smokes which is basically the same kind of packaging just colored differently so I'm guessing that this this is a generic freewill pre-roll package that companies can buy okay I don't know if I mentioned it but the percentage was about 20% THC solders be like it's pretty good and this was running in about to pull 8th buys 25 bucks for the whole pack which is not bad right I mean I've seen worse or worse for price more you know [Music] look at it but yeah as you can see most good none of them ran at all so that is a plus in my book because sometimes you buy pre-rolls sometimes you buy single pre-rolls and then they run and it's just the [ __ ] ten bucks on this single pre-roll and like I said pre rules are for people that really are in a rush or can't roll or they just yeah basically on a rush or can't roll but if you can just always try to get the flower I for one was in a rush and I just wanted to like just pull one out and smoke it whenever I wanted instead of getting my fingers all sticky because I've somehow lost my grinder so I would have to break that out with my hands though you froze lost your grinder yeah I find it but it's like no I'm saying but yeah check out the coming company hervana let me know if you guys guys have tried their pre rolls in let me know if you thought it was pretty good you know so far I'm liking it like I had I really smoked like three before this so it was a pretty good smoke not gonna lie but it's not like the greatest pre-roll in the [ __ ] game you know yeah oh yeah well I also was uploading a video today and it said the gave you mute gave me an option to say is this video allowed or washable for kids or is it not this is like an option they added on YouTube like recently so I just click no this is not for children on all my videos so hopefully this is like a better chance of me not getting deleted they just added that so I'm guessing they're kind of like you know compensate for I don't know you know I don't they don't know but hopefully I checked the all of them I checked no they're not made for children hopefully I don't get deleted again that's dumb that they just delete your account for [ __ ] that in here twice twice how do you feel you feel high a little bit a little bit yeah so uh maybe the strength isn't as what it's advertised cuz 20% on a joint is pretty hot should ya be getting me pretty lifted that goes to say back to the the shake in the blend that's probably what what the case is mm-hmm but I mean I don't know I don't know what to say to take after this new it's a kick creeper yeah you gotta expect that with payrolls as you know you can't really expect to get too high because you can't expect the quality to be too high that's the first time smoking I didn't know nirmaia took a very there yeah so if you're like everyday smokers you know by your payroll is pointy not the way to go either that's true but like I said I was in a rush you know I'm saying that could roll guys yeah I can't roll good but good enough to smoke you know I'm not saying I'm like it's master roller over here but guess the job done but other than that the joints both of our joints are pretty much done hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I will see you guys in the next one peace out [Music]", "mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done I'm super afraid of my life right now but this is nice you know what this would be great for like people that are having bachelor parties or bachelorette parties New Year's Christmas you can get them the people if you live in a legal state oh I can't move to this come to the East Coast Jesus [Music] Oh also Packwood's shout-out to y'all have made a collaboration with cocoanuts which some of the celebrities have teamed up to make these into like chocolate edibles kind of thing so check out backwoods la calm because they got a lot of interesting collaborations like they did a collaboration with planted 13 they're doing it with celebrities so shout out to them definitely gonna go to pack once when I go to LA cuz this is pretty cool in the light so stoned and how many puffs that I take I don't even know if somebody keep it count I wish somebody was here to play this is what they do to me pop beats they just leave me in a room with filming and just tell me to go for my own okay I'm really high seriously you don't think it too high he's just like alright I'm over it I'm like hi okay I think I hit this at least maybe 10 times which is extreme okay this is my review of a Little J first of all I'm high I'm really high and I just don't even know this hormone right now seriously I don't even I don't even know what to say I mean for once I am truly I think it's strong I for what a high grade us I feel like my body is just like somebody else came and took off really nice somebody named Adele a no Gina so somebody can come take over your body if you did a little G because I don't feel I don't know oh I probably wish I had a friend this year went that way I can have somebody to give me feedback and I know Papeete y'all wish to do that but you're not here right right here matter of fact you try it exactly it's like a calming effect but you just feel like hmm maybe I should take it slow like I feel like I can do things but I should probably take it slow I feel like if you were sharing with this this was someone you don't have to worry about them soggy enough to tip its glass so it's really like one stay sturdy you're not sometimes you you roll a blunt and then they get all saggy at the tip of it and you gotta pull it back together they've already solved that issue so this is a great cheerful I would suggest you buy it this holiday season share it with your friends you can put it out as you see I'm probably one hit just another day so this is definitely a two day if you buy yourself this is a two day situation it's no way this is no way it's just no way like I'm cool put old day I feel great about this situation would I buy it hell yeah yeah I like the alien og I do I really do and this key thing is fascinating it really is because it's not like coming off on my hands or anything Frank it don't come on that's just like amazing oh my burn my nose oh [ __ ] I feel cool this out oh I'd say that like I got a young Stoli if I put it alright guys here's my Beulah spec would if I had to give five stars I would definitely get them five pot leaves on these these is they they're the way you hold them they strung in your hand they burn slowly not burning fast I've been at this for about an hour or so 35 minutes it's a good burn if you were smoking a regular blunt you're [ __ ] we've been done so backwards y'all got pop moms 5 leaves I'm gonna try these other two catch me on instagram to see how these to turn out guys but I wanted to make sure that I share with all my pop peeps the alien og which was exclusive to Nevada packwood's family out of LA welcome to nevada planet shock planet 13 thank you for making sure that i got one of these in my hands and just to the new pack with family that's coming to Nevada I think you guys are gonna do beyond well you're really artists really makes a whole lot of sense you know I feel real bossy I feel like Rick Ross huh you know I feel like snooping them yeah shout out to the little cocoanuts and I'm should be one anyway come on pack with said pop mob some stuff Papa mama tackle is can we do something can we do something pack with come on pack would you want pop mom this is a perfect blue how much do some music coming down my head cuz I feel so good all right pop peeps make sure you watch me subscribe no put that notification belt in a like button and check out my next video next week I appreciate you Papi's check me out on IG [Music]", "NCqs6zaclUE": "hello everyone it's me again

with me oh yeah nice full pot full of sativa should be in take a yeah hello hey there you go clean full of goodness hippy Bob me we started my lighter smoke with me with me and as well as I say before I used I've done the review of this one sugar cane and the brown it's nice on these take a long time to I said we've indicated has been in the department insignia and you never quite sure and do pac-12 this is when the - you know you don't buy the hand anyway and therefore people will don't know how we're all perfect this one I think it's for more more in the fun factor look so good we can show people with this one hey Te'o commies this is my stuff if you see you know I doubt that way yeah for that way yeah I think it's it's good every day you see I don't each other I still much prefer this in my class and you do not Glasser wrote all papers here I mean can be wrong that ah I'd be doing anyway and they review some papers as well you know we'll be checking the row and the elements Rizla zig zags whatever Bob Marley you name it well I saw throughout cover and we see we see well which one is good and not I know and classic one yes it's perfect organic one mmm not really I have problem and like the peanuts you know stick well is not an is no group that classic is organic not only anyway we not on the du Liban a van der Rohe paper with a review and that transponder point clear one that I say fun factor yeah why not for everyday use mmm I don't think so I used to have normal papers that way you know clear papers and one - of these papers its don't like stick to that and you know you smoke and just an unwrapped and anyway I think in this one have the same tendency something or maybe not I know it's quite good row slowly on the ban I'll be ball bear with me smoke with me smoke all day long you know I mean we bless and then we have ours goodness people we bless and no one no one can take off from us no law on this world simply is that this is always freedom

smoking they're constantly saying it's not good more posts as well we talked about what you like use and the lighter is torch and them or whatever or hand wakes or you know habitat do David well a people this is quick review of clear coins for me that I say fun fact or sometimes show your friends what you smoke yeah we don't need cutting we do your car no here you go this is this nice one maybe some keep around as well you know fun fun for daily use I don't think so that people please leave some comments what do you think about this cyclone it's good or not you like use if you like use which

where i'm at somewhere in the country but here at valley pier and farmersville they carry some of the best cannabis in california the team tony heather richard look at this sea junkie genetics from cookies the cryptochronic from alien labs and the biscotti from connected so i'm gonna review one of these today i'm gonna do the biscotti we're gonna do the connected biscotti because we've reviewed this in years past one of the most searched strains on our website all the time every day the biscotti joint pre-roll let's check it out shall we so one thing you guys got to know is connected is well known for premium cannabis all throughout california elite genetics there's a unique history between them and cookies and the you know the whole history of who created the genetics and all this stuff it's just it's really interesting so this biscotti pre-roll one gram total thc 20.17 percent cbd .05 percent there is thca for this 21.9 their delta 9.96 packaged on july 15 2020 so not too bad packaged by leaflets incorporated connected cali here we go all right let's check it out there's a smell outside of the pre-roll this should be good here we go oh there's a nice gassy funk we've got a raw paper here check that out a nice raw paper it does ah the smell is super pungent here we go i'm excited hopefully it's not packed too tight oh damn it you squeeze it and there was a stem that poked through it there's always something with these p-rolls i swear i swear i swear look at this right there all right here we go there we go here we go here we go here we go all right all right all right one hit talk about it two hits and a score you guys know the [ __ ] rules no games no fakes here we go let's get a nice even light for this first hit best we can all right here we go y'all oh here we go here we go [Music] the terpenes extremely notable a nice healthy looking white ash on the tip there no seeds yet [Music] the smoke is smooth the turps get even better on the second hit the more it burns it's burning a tiny bit uneven but that could be from the light you know one hit review very much impressed this was an 18 gram joint grand price point for me still a little excessive yes weed is legal in california yes this is designer weed i'll cut it a little slap because they are well known for this you know the elite of the elite but 18 to 20 gram joint just a little high sell a lot more if we get it down a little bit um score out of 10 for the joint effort pre-roll reviews i'm gonna give this joint it does have a massive stem poking through it so i got to give it you know i can i can't give it any higher than a 9.5 that stem is going to burn funny 9.25 is my score for that out of 100 you guys got to read the full review on respectmyregion.com see what that kind of averages out to 10 categories 100 points 9.25 is where i'm at for this joint effort west coast bluetooth review the stem is right there in the middle of it right there so it's tough man it's hard to have high expectations in the pre-roll space but valley pure delivers as always really appreciate you guys check them out i'm here in farmersville california we're right next to the 110 exit here

changed in this quad like different flight controller but it's still running kiss different esc vista versus the mystery steel uh camera latency is gonna be different weight's gonna be a little different oh and these aren't mr seals pids either these are the crunked crunch is a tuner he uh he works with mark spatz and everybody says he's an amazing amazing tuner he actually has a tuning service where you send him your quad and he'll tune it for you he has a preset for kiss called the kiss golden starting point preset which is supposed to be a great place to start with kiss i didn't feel safe using mr steel's pids because his pits are so on the edge that if you change like anything about the build they may not work well so a little more conservative a lot has changed but it's still kiss under the hood so let's put it in the air and see how it flies before i fly it let me show you how to build it yeah the flight's going to be at the end of the video of course this is my mystery steel apex build i bought this quadcopter a while back when i did a review of a 900 ready-to-fly quadcopter versus a 200 iflight sedora i'll put a link to that video down in the video description if you want to see the result the 900 quad was pretty freaking good but for the price the 200 quad was also pretty freaking good but if you watch that video you will see that one of the things that happened is the kiss esc blew up so i bought a new fetech 45 amp esc fat tech is basically the next evolution of kiss it's like a new company and a new hardware and it was new and better um and that fat tech esc i figured as long as i'm doing that i'll also update the flight controller i'm going to put a fetech f7 flight controller in here and as long as i'm at it i'm also going to put a catexista in here why not let's just update this thing to all the modern stuff that's what i'm going to do in this video come along with me i'm joshua bardwell you're going to learn something today now if you're paying attention you may be thinking wait a minute joshua it looks like there's already a fat tech f7 in here and it looks like you've already finished this whole thing that is that is true um some footage was lost from the very beginning of this build and so instead of showing you me doing the very first few steps i'm going to take this quadcopter apart and show you retroactively what i did but it don't worry it was it was very basic stuff like like soldering up a capacitor um but i'm gonna just take it apart and talk you through it the most likely scenario is that i just forgot to hit record okay yes i am now recording now there's not a lot to say about this esc uh compared to any other four in one esc the motors solder up just like any other the one thing that does stand out about this esc is that they have given you additional solder pads at each corner one two three and four these are the ones that are easiest to see here on this side and those solder pads are for soldering capacitors capacitors help smooth out voltage dips and spikes and help protect the esc from voltage spikes that could destroy it if you're running this esc on 6s a capacitor is mandatory if you're running it on 4s it's still a good idea the type of capacitor that i'm using for 6s is a 35 volt 470 microfarad capacitor you're going to want to be either 35 or 50 volts if you're running on 6s 50 volts is better but they're also bigger and you want to be between about 470 and 1000 microfarads that is a electrolytic capacitor and the capacitor is attached here to this little device which is a phet tech spike absorber so a capacitor is good at smoothing out hills and valleys in the voltage but you can get these great big voltage spikes and the capacitor kind of smooths it out but it's still a big enough spike that it can damage things a spike absorber contains an electronic component called a tvs diode and a tvs diode specifically just slices off the top of those spikes and is just additional protection for the esc against frying the tvs diode is not mandatory but it certainly will help and after frying my last kcsc i'm not taking any chances so i've just soldered these guys together here the tvs diode has solder pads that i've soldered the capacitor to and i couldn't find any way to fit it back here so i've just got some wires running off of it and soldered them to the positive and the negative pads here on the esc in general the shorter those wires are the better that the esc the capacitor is going to perform so maybe i would have done better to solder them up here but i didn't really know where the capacitor was going to go at the time anyway that's how i've done that connecting the esc and the flight controller together couldn't be simpler there is just a plug here and you have a standard sh cable harness and it comes through just straight through no rewiring or re-pinning or anything required and it plugs straight in to the equivalent plug on the flight controller and then we're going to set the flight controller down here facing forward and basically that's what i did in all of the footage that was lost except somehow it took like 25 minutes and i just did it in like four minutes and i'm not gonna think too hard about what that says about me as a person or a youtube creator or an editor we're just going to move on with the build and here we are we got that cable installed and we'll go ahead and mount the flight controller with the correct side facing up and the front facing arrow facing the front of the quad perfect these pads right here are where the receiver installs uh exactly how you solder it up is going to depend on what kind of receiver you've got but they can be used with any kind of receiver uh freesky crossfire etc we'll be using crossfire and it's going to wire up like so now if you've wired up crossfire to a betaflight flight controller before the way that kiss is doing it is going to at least to me it feels kind of weird but we're just going to do it how we're told and it'll presumably work the way it's usually done is you've got ground and 5 volts and then this pad is the tx pad of the receiver which goes to the rx pad on the flight controller and this pad is the rx pad of the of the receiver which goes to the tx pad on the flight controller but in this case the tx pad is going to go to this pad labeled yupert which is also labeled tx2 so you've got tx to tx which is kind of weird and this rx pad here is going to go to rx tlm which is so we're just going to wire it up exactly how we're told to do it and again presumably it'll work i do want to say while we're here these two pads the rx tlm and the yupert they have little vias in them i don't know why they have there's these little holes perforations almost in the pad and it made it really hard to get solder to kind of stick um it was a pain in the butt to solder to i don't know why they did that but if you have the same trouble you're not alone now unlike an analog build where there would be a whole bunch more soldering to do to hook up the video transmitter and the camera since we're going to be doing a cadex vista it's actually way simpler there's only one more thing we really need to solder up well we're going to need to solder up power for the vista sure but that's just going to be v-bat it's going to be totally easy the other thing we need to hook up is the osd connection the msp protocol is used to communicate between the flight controller and the vista and it's used to draw the osd and communicate vbat and other information that you want to see in your goggles and here's how we're going to do that the msp protocol is communicated via a uart on the flight controller and so my first thought was to solder to the rx1 and tx1 pads right here they look very convenient and in fact they're the only other tx and rx pads i could find broken out on this flight controller yes not to say that the flight controller doesn't have a bunch of uarts just that they're not broken out to individual pads that are easy to solder to but all the other tutorials i saw said that you need to put the vista on uart3 and so that is going to be in this plug which is on the underside of the flight controller and we're going to need to make a custom plug with these two pins in it uh so that we can solder it to not to a gps as shown here but to our vista and although this isn't a review of the flight controller per se i got to say this is something that has always frustrated me about kiss because they say that they're making it simple and the way that they make it simple is to make it so there's only one way to do it which i guess it is simpler but it always rubs me the wrong way because i would rather just do it however i want but that is based on the premise that i know what i want to do and what you should do and maybe as a beginner it's just better for someone to say shut up and do it this way and simpler but like in here i would like to solder these wires nah i can't do that you got to make a plug i don't want to plug i'm going to solder them sorry out of luck just rubs me the wrong way so we're going to take our flight controller and we're going to flip it over this is the underside of the flight controller not the top which we were working with we're going to flip it over and the plug we're going to be working with is this one here with the two big round holes next to it and the pins we want are the lower most two pins right here can't have a solder pad no i didn't want you to solder to that oh lord knows what would happen if we let you solder to that by the way what i'm working with here is this plug set uh it comes with a whole bunch of these empty housings and then a whole bunch of pre-crimped wires with the connectors already on them and it lets you make custom housings i'll put a link to that down in the video description as well i highly recommend you pick it up for situations just like this where you don't have the exact plug that you need and you have to make one yourself take two wires of the same length sure i'm gonna keep it right side up okay that's how it plugs in let me take two wires we need long wires because we're going all the way back to the vista two okay great two wires are the same length and we're gonna pop those suckers in there and we're gonna plug this back in here and it looks like yellow is going to be rx and green is going to be tx i didn't make my colors match the wiring diagram but there you go and we'll just flip this back over so it faces the right direction oh and we'll plug in our esc again perfect the cadx vista is also going to need v-bat power uh the visit can be powered from v-bat up to 6s natively so you don't need a voltage regulator or anything like that one way to do that would be to solder on top of these xd60 pads here another way to do it though i'm going to just reuse these convenient little v-bat pads here they're right there on the esc so the power should be pretty clean they're right next to the capacitor so it should be pretty clean and it's going to be easier to solder to a second maybe i mean if you know you could solder on top of this joint easily you can just go ahead and do that i'm gonna go ahead and put it on the second joint though next i'm gonna solder up the cadets vista red wire to v black wire to g and then we're to do tx and rx rx is the one closest to the edge so yellow is rx which is going to go to tx on the flight controller or on the vista and then green is going to go to rx on this and then we do not need to worry about the ground and espos wires because we're not using the vista as our controller we're using crossfire and the vista is going to get installed in the back so then for mounting the vista i'm going to use a set of m2 screws if you need a m2 screw assortment i've got a link in the video description um i like cap head m2 screws and they're just going to go up through these four holes at the bottom and through the vista there are four holes in the vista and these screws are too freaking long so there you go let's have to find some shorter ones and you can see there we've got it nice and screwed down into place let's make this neat how about this we'll put the camera wire underneath here and run it to the front of the quad just make sure it doesn't get pinched um you can order the vista with an eight centimeter or a 12 centimeter camera cable i always get the 12 centimeter cable and i if it's a little too long then i just kind of give it some twists and take up the slack but i've often had cases where if it was the eight centimeter it wouldn't have reached like i think it'd be pretty tight here if this was the eight centimeter wire so i just always order the 12 centimeter if i can nice we are really getting somewhere put some m3 nuts on here since i think we're done soldering the flight controller just hold it in place and then i got to figure out what i'm going to do with the vista antenna and i had hoped to reuse the apex mr steel antenna bracket and have the antenna sort of i see that that's not going to work though because it's just going to be it would be in the way of the vista so i've got here the original factory vista antenna but you can see that it's i'm going to have a hard time figuring out how to mount that so i'm probably going to need to go research that and see if there's some kind of 3d printed adapter or something that someone has solved this problem for me because you can see that it's it's going to be tricky to mount this frame is sized for mr steel's camera which is a mini camera isn't it it's not we got too much space here we're like one millimeter off so i got to figure out if i need to put some washers in there or something to space it out crap well that's a we'll have to solve that problem as well welcome back to uh joshua from the future who has solved all of those problems and is ready to present the solutions to you but first i need to correct joshua from the past who did something dumb as he is prone to do i went around asking how do you guys hook uh cadets vista to the fat tech f7 like where's the best place to get v-bat from and they said v-bat is in the freaking plug you freaking idiot so what i should have done instead of soldering to the esc is used tx3 and rx3 just like i did and then use bat plus and ground don't use 5 volt or 3.3 volt uh yeah and then just power the vista off that plug just buy one of those sh cable sets that i showed you and build yourself a plug with just those wires in it and solder them up to the vista and then it'll just plug in here where i've got just the uarts now i'm not going to go back and redo that because i've already made my mistake and so it'll probably be fine going forward but that's what i should have done the other problem that i'm here to show you how i solved is the problem with the camera size and frankly if you go on thingiverse there are shims you can print but a lot of people don't have a 3d printer or maybe that's just not the solution you prefer what i'm going to do is i have some m2 washers these are just m2 washers you can just buy i have a i couldn't find an assortment of m2 washers only so i just have this huge assortment of metric washers most of which i will never use i only needed the m2 washers and i'm just going to use those m2 washers to kind of shim this out i don't know how well you can see there's a couple washers in there and i'm thinking about adding just a washer i'm going to shim that out and it'll be fine as for the capacitor i've tried a whole bunch of different ways and i think the best thing to do is first i'm going to go ahead and put some heat shrink or tape around it because this is v-bat if it makes contact with anything it'll be bad so that's okay that's taken care of now and then as near as i can tell the best way to do it is to put it up against this standoff vertically there's plenty of room for that and there's just no way i can find to put it straight up or lay flat that will actually work but for this particular capacitor anyway that's going to be fine well i went to thingiverse and i found some 3d prints that helped solve some of the problems that i'm having i'll put a link to the 3d prints i'm using as well as impulse rc actually has official 3d prints for some of these things i'll put a link to that also in the video description but i found this mount for the caddix vista antenna and it's got a little split in it that you just place it around the antenna and then you use a zip tie to hold it in place and it just yeah it's going to be fine just drops down on top here and for the crossfire antenna we've got this little print here it goes on under here i'm probably also going to use some m3 washers i always like to use m3 washers when i use screws through tpu because the tpu can really rip out so it comes in my assorted washers kit that i talked about earlier and i'm going to switch this antenna over to an immortal t that's pretty straightforward the other thing that i'll show you is i did download some of these little 3d printed shims for the camera you'll notice the camera's been removed uh the washers i mean i just wanted to show you the shims in case like you don't have the washers but you do have a 3d printer you can print these shims and they'll make the camera fit okay so let me put this back together and then i think it'll be time to go configure it in the case configurator before i button it up i just want to give you guys a shot of the final product uh since i've been kind of all over the place describing the build this is what happens when i've never done a build before and i'm just kind of feeling my way through it welcome to the process i got the camera mounted i've got the tvs diode mounted that's going to be tight but i think it's going to be okay oh yeah i know it's slipped up it's going to be okay we've got the vista the crossfire is mounted on top of the vista with some double-sided some vhb tape i'm not sure it's going to stick i may need to find a more robust way of doing that oh i'm going to have to change these standoffs out the um the apex comes with this bracket for mounting the antenna but it goes right here but we're not doing that and then if you use if you don't use that bracket you have some longer standoffs but those come with the frame kit we got the vista antenna mounted and we've got the crossfire antenna mounted just like so i think ready to go well now it's time to sit down and configure the quadcopter on the bench and i gotta say i gotta remind you i am not a super expert on kiss but come along with me for the ride we'll see how we do and i want to thank mark spatz uav tech here on youtube he just a week or so ago put out this amazing video going through the latest version of the kiss configurator a complete rundown of all the settings from the perspective of someone coming from betaflight and this was a great resource for me as i was just trying to make sure i didn't miss anything so i'll put a link to that down in the video description if you want to check it out but let's dive in so i'm going to go ahead and plug in the flight controller uh the usb on my computer when i do that i should see a new com port appear here in the upper left a quick note if you're coming from betaflight kiss uses the cp210 driver not the stm32 driver i think that's true for the kiss flight controller i'm not sure if it's true for the fat tech flight controller regardless if you don't see a com port here appear here you may not have the cp210 driver installed you may need to install it so let's continue we'll connect because flight controller is not activated activate now okay yeah i guess it's activated fantastic and let's dive into the configuration i totally know how to do this i guess we should should we update the firmware to the latest select remote firmware fett tech kiss fc firmware version and let's take the latest version 4045 for six i see so we'll go with four six now that i've updated the firmware let's check our settings here the uav is a quad x i'm gonna assume the motor output mapping is default because it's mr steel setup so i assume it's the same between the previous kiss and this one but we'll double check that the receiver type is going to be crossfire we've got this setting here failsafe level mode seconds i'm going to set that to zero that causes the quadcopter to go into auto level mode if you fail safe i don't i don't really like that i don't if i feel safe just i'd like to just fall out of the air please um as for pid presets we're going to leave that alone for now we'll come back and mess with that and we will save that let's check the receiver to see if the receiver is working we can check that in data output throttle yaw roll pitch is correct one thing to keep in mind is i don't think there's a way in kiss to rearrange the channel map so if your channels are not in the correct order you will need to go into the mixer screen on your radio and rearrange the channels don't go into the input screen by the way that's not going to have the effect that you intend you're going to go into the mixer screen and rearrange the the four control channels so they're in the correct order you'll also need to set up mr steele's idle up function the way that mr steele sets up his quad is that you arm and the motors start to spin but the pid loop is not active and the quadcopter does not begin to fly until you flip the idle up switch and then the quadcopter is ready to fly and that lets him arm and test his motors without the quadcopter flipping out on him so the normal procedure with kiss would be arm idle up fly disarm and then turn idle up off or you don't even have to do this you don't have to do idle up but that's how he does it and that's how a lot of people want to do it so that's what i'm showing you i am working on the radiomaster tx16s but these instructions are going to be the same for pretty much any open tx radio going all the way back to the qx7 and the x9d open tx is open tx no matter what radio you're working with the screens might look a little different but the the basic structure of the menus and options is still there the first thing you want to do is decide which two switches you're going to use one of them is going to be your arming switch one's going to be your idle up switch i'm going to have my arming switch as switch sf and my idle up switch a switch s e you don't have to do it that way so mr steele does it though so you know you just do whatever you want but okay i'm gonna press model setup and i'm gonna go to the mixer screen and the first thing you're gonna see is that i have my four main control inputs just like usual and i've got my arming switch set up as a typical mix to put that arming switch on channel five and then i've got this other switch uh switch sd that's on channel six and that has nothing to do with this that's just my my angle mode and turtle mode switch this is completely unrelated so i got my arming switch here on channel five fine the next thing you're gonna do is you're gonna go to the special functions and you're gonna set up a special function and that special function is going to be set to your idle up switch and it's going to say that when that idle up switch is in a certain position it's going to override your our your throttle channel which in which for kisses channel one i think it's always channel one you're going to override the throttle channel to the value of negative 100 and that is oh and you also need to have this box ticked on for that to work and so what that's going to do if we go all the way back to the main screen if i raise the throttle i'm here i'm moving the throttle and you can see that nothing is happening to the throttle channel because my idle up switch is it's locked out but if i move the idle up switch into a different position now the throttle is working okay there's one more thing that you need to do and that is we're going to go to the model setup we're going to page to the outputs and what we need to do is we need to adjust the bottom of the throttle channel upwards so that when when the we uh we idle up an arm the throttle does not go all the way to zero and what we need to do is we need to make sure that that is greater than the min command parameter in in the kiss configurator when the idle up switch is in the lockout position the throttle is all the way down as soon as i flip that switch the throttle has moved up to negative 84 percent as far as pids go kiss has a really cool thing where they have a whole bunch of presets and what you want to do is you want to select user presets and that opens up a ton of these little presets here uh i think i guess i could do mr steele's presets of course there's also a preset from crunked crunk is a prominent tuner who tunes both kiss and betaflight and he has what's called his kiss golden presets if you're working with basically any five inch kiss quad start with people tell me start with the crunk golden presets but i think i'm going to try to find mr steele's presets here oh there's so many a search function would be nice mr steele real mr steel pid values 202209 17. well let's see that seems pretty out of date i don't trust that that's pretty old all right we'll go the chronic golden starting point and i'll just hit use and it will load them and we will save we're going to need to set up our aux functions in order to do that there's no way to actually see i wish you could see the actual readouts on this page so we got to go to data output all right so arming is going to be aux 1 high aux 1 all of these turtle mode i definitely want and level mode is going to be aux to medium there you go and i'm gonna put the i'm gonna arm no movement on the throttle because we haven't activated idle up yet i'm gonna activate idle up no it's still it's still active is that so is that how it should be i'll go back down here yeah now it's dead idle up the motors the pwm outputs are active lower throttle still active you can see them sort of winding up idle up switch down yeah okay and now we're we're dead again um let's check these motors we got a motor test function right here let's just disarm let's test props are off i do know what i'm doing let me plug in a battery let's see how do we test them let's check that there we go okay we'll check our directions that is going the wrong way that just props out so i don't know if this is going to be true for you um but for me at least when i spin pwm one which is supposed to be the front left motor uh for me pwm2 the front right motor spin so i at least i'm going to need to change my board orientation or my motor orientation let's just check this out pwm1 is in this position so it looks like the board is correct front to back but it's upside down side to side so how do we fix that i'm going to conf oh no oh no i've done it wait stop good thing i had props off so here we've got motor output mapping oh see i've got the diagram here so i know the positions uh let's just i think it should be upside down one two three four yes that seems correct at this point i need to reverse the direction of some of these motors and of course i could do that by re-soldering the motor wires to swap any two of the three motor wires then the motor will spin the other direction of course that's a pain in the butt and you don't want to have to do that so the first place i went was the esc flasher page here in the kiss configurator but it only works with kiss escs not with fat tech esc's so for the fet tech flight controller you use the case configurator but for the fat tech esc use a different app this is the fetech esc configurator we'll go ahead and download this installer and we'll see how that goes um what if we go to settings okay ah perfect reverse motor direction on one and three we'll hit save and save connect data output test motors i know what i'm doing enable motors test one two three four and okay they're spinning the right direction and they're mapped correctly this freaking soft start on the on the esc is hot look how the motors start you see how they do that sinusoidal soft start it's freaking hot not only does it look cool but it also makes it easier to tell which direction the motor is spinning normally the motor just goes and it's a little hard to tell which way it's spinning you know very nice there's just a couple more things we need to do before we are ready to fly and the first one is to change the esc protocol to fettech one wire if you are using the fet tech flight controller and esc you want to be using this fet tech has told me that they are still working out a few little kinks in their d shot implementation i have no idea what those kinks are or what they mean for you but basically if you can be using fattek one wire you should that lets the esc talk to the flight controller over a single wire it's already in that wiring harness that you used so just select fet tech one wire if you have the fet tech esc and flight controller the other thing you're going to want to do is if you're using dji we're going to go to the advanced tab and we're going to choose use advanced serial configuration we're going to get a great big warning here and we're going to click i know what i am doing and then we are going to change serial 3 to dji msp and that will let our dji osd work and other dji related functions in the goggles and we'll hit save here we go ooh that slow start so cool and now idle up we're ready to go gonna take me a minute to adjust to the rates these are default kiss rates and lower than my normal rates in the center i can feel that already how's she fly boys you guys get used to these rates oh yeah that's slow as heck very different got that kiss uh prop wash beautiful prop wash handling as always of course crunch probably deserves some credit for that prop west what problems it doesn't there's a little prop watch there yikes interesting no problems there gonna find out how much of this is mr steele's tune interesting very interesting i remember when i first flew when i first flew mr steele's squad just thinking i i started flying a little bit like him now i don't want to like insult anybody by suggesting that i'm as good a pilot as mr steele but i just had a little bit of that zoopy zoopy twitchy i just felt like i could go anywhere and respond to anything i wasn't afraid to go into somewhere see right there like for example i just felt just a little out of touch like am i at the right throttle position what's the quad doing and on his original build i was just like where am i going where am i going where am i going where am i going um i'm not having that feeling and i wonder if that's somewhat an effective latency an effective latency that you don't notice the latency feeling like delay but you just kind of lack confidence to dive into places where latency where you would need that response time and i talked about this when i reviewed his quad compared to the iflake sedora that confidence might be a symptom of low latency and now here we've got kiss instead of betaflight but we've changed the latency obviously because we're using dji oh get there and like i can i yeah i think there's something to it his claim that with low latency you do gain confidence see i have no trouble doing moves like this even like a little gap like that because i just know this area so well that i'm i know it's coming i know the lines but as soon as i end up in a situation where i maybe need more twitch response i start to lose confidence like let's go down here i don't fly down here very often this is my wife's area which is this area for the kids to play and i just don't know this area quite as well and oh see like right oh oh hello tree get out of there get out of there son get out of there awfully i'm really glad i did this experiment when i flew the mr steel kiss uh apex i definitely thought there was something special to how it flew um and the question i wanted to answer was is that the sort of totality of what mr steele has put together everything from his pids his motors the weight of the build the camera or is there like one particular aspect of that that is carrying the weight like is it just the kiss flight controller is just that different and i gotta say like this it flies really good but if i you were to hand me this quad and say fly it if we were to put my rates on it i'm not sure i would like obviously know that it wasn't a beta flight quad i'm sure that kiss people out here right now are freaking out they've only got like two packs on it right now so maybe i would start to notice more differences as i flew more but there was not that sort of earth shattering whoa hey something special here moment that i had when i flew the actual steel build so i don't know what you want to take from that whenever people ask me which flight controller is the best kiss betaflight emu flight which is the best i say they're all good in their own ways and you can find people who say betaflight i could call flute like crap for me and then i put kiss on my quad it was amazing and you can find people who say i had trouble with kiss and i put betaflight on it and it flew amazing i think the takeaway is that they can they can all fly good and sometimes one of them will fly better under certain circumstances but i don't think i would agree if you said that there was one that was sort of universally magical and amazing in every circumstance there's more work to do here get a better tune on this take dji off of it and put steel's camera back on no i'm not gonna do that that's gonna do it for this video thank you so much for for watching you're gonna be seeing more freestyle from this thing i'm gonna be flying up more and hopefully getting more of a sense of what this fit tech flight controller and this kiss pin controller are capable of and uh maybe even trying to get the tune a little more sharpened up maybe i'll work with crunch and see if i can get it tuned a little sharper uh but for now that's gonna finish the video links down in the video description to the parts that i'm using if you want to pick them up definitely use those links their affiliate links and

here so my rolls I mean bra brothers rappers and I have mostly nickels in here some diamonds in there so I have this one right here already this is two dollars in nickels I still need to I still need to close it do not I know do the same as that it's not you know it's not gonna be perfect like this but yeah just close it to make sure that the the constant get out okay so I'm gonna make two dollars here was this was a tank inspire 2 4 6 8 10 10 2 4 6 8 and 10 so I use one pile as reference to make another one any more one more in there so far the story comes right there I need 10 more great

together one right after the other and they should fall flat no problem so there it is that's two dollars right there and then to close it you know we're gonna do the best we can oh by the way I'm doing this because the bang my bang is not counting coins anymore they don't have machines I got rid of them why who knows and they told me that the only option that I had with them was to was to do

gonna ask him for some some more honestly this is kind of that insular war and I seen a lot of people going to the coin store machines you know but they I think they charge you a 8% so does 8 cents for every dollar that the Machine tells for you and they are located in many grocery stores but again they charge you a percent an 8 percent fee for counting those coins yeah well it's a bit too much because you have like 10 dollars in coins that's gonna be 80 cents right there but then again you have to do this I'm gonna be a bit of work all the pain all the pain you know how many coins you so I'm gonna keep doing this you know how many dimes not many times multi nickels I have another year with a bunch of mixed coins that I have to work through later on but the meantime reason why I'm doing this is because the band doesn't have coin matching anymore so this is the only way they will take the coins for the puzzle all right that's it let's keep rolling you", "_fnIWDmaWHA": "I would

somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "JByeQq1xKw4": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel so today i have a super exciting haul for you guys and this is a haul from the bathing garden now the reason why i'm super excited about this is because i told myself that was if i was going to order from the bathing garden then it had to be from a collection that i really liked and so i skipped out on the halloween i skipped out on the winter collection and i skipped out on the valentine's day collection and so i was very tempted you know but i stayed very good and didn't buy from those collections um but i decided to order from the circus collection because the circus collection is just a collection of scents that i love and it's a lot of fizzy pop blends a lot of fruity blends and those are the two things i like the most in scents so of course i had to order there were some leftover things from the valentine's day collection that i picked up but i didn't pick up too much so yeah as always i'll get started with samples and everyone knows the bathing garden is super generous with samples so i'm just going to start um i don't really know the set notes for these so i'm just going to sniff them and tell you what i think and here you go this is spring fling i also have to say i really love the bathing gardens aesthetic like i love that she uses like old english and little like prints and pictures that she does on the labels are very high quality prints i don't know if you can tell but look at that but yeah and this is spring fling and this is a cute little bunny she uses a lot of glitter in her stuff so if you're not into that you would not like the bathing garden okay this smells like sort of florally and it smells like it has coconut in it so interesting i wouldn't expect that from a spring scent but yeah it smells like it has coconut in it the next one i have here is called oops it's called frolly look at the cute butterflies and this is a gorgeous tart like i don't know that's so pretty i don't i don't even know how much ounces this is at least one so yeah super generous and this one okay this one smells like it has a floral to it some orange notes maybe like a neroli i don't know that smells really good actually i'm not crazy into florals but i like whatever floral is in this so i might have to look up whatever is in there okay the next one i have here is in sunshines and rainbows and this is what it looks like so cute it sort of reminds me of like a mochi donut but yes this one yeah this one's definitely floral maybe some sort of like orange blossom perhaps definitely floral sort of sweet too as well so yeah um those are the yeast and then let's get started with the other ones so here i have coconut shortbread pie and it's in the cutest little pie shape i want to take it out really quickly um because dang that's cute okay put on hopefully i don't get smudgy everywhere but look at that that is so cute and wow wow that smells really really good now this reminds me of this coconut cracker or biscuit that my grandmother used to buy a lot of and give to me um yeah and i just brought back scent memories of that it's like it smells like that cracker like down like exactly it smells exactly like that cracker and you know my grandmother has since passed but you know i miss her a lot and that just really reminded me of her and that just is just so sweet and i don't know yeah i really like this scent um if she offers it i'm definitely gonna buy more because i don't know very nostalgic so yeah okay next one i have here is vanilla dumpling and this is what it looks like a little cute bunt very cute colors oh this is interesting this doesn't smell as vanilla-y as i thought it would be it smells like it almost has some tea notes to it interesting that's very interesting so it's a little bit vanilla-y a little bit fresh actually interesting the next one here is marshmallow peep cookies and another cute bunny and this one yeah it smells like marshmallows it's sweet yeah okay next one i have here is dust bunnies and it's a little cute brown little bunny head and this one this one smells like it has chocolate in it yeah chocolate and something sweet and the next one here is uh berry gummy bear and cute little bunt and uh i love gummy bear scents and i know i'm gonna like this one oh my god yeah that's good that's really good that smells exactly like a gummy bear but with like an amped up berry note that is so good actually that smells exactly like a gummy bear like you just opened a bag of like gummy bears this smells edible oh my goodness this is so so good wow i really like that the next one here is a lemongrass sorbet and this is a cute little ice cream scoop um i'm off the fence about lemongrass but yeah this smells like lemongrass for sure there's almost like a creamier uh vanilla note slightly but yeah i don't really know how i feel about this one so we'll see because lemongrass can um has to be done very well for me to like it next is marshmallow frosted mango tangerine and another cute little bunny that smells really good i definitely smell mango and tangerine in there there's not much cake notes um you would think you'll be bakery but it's not it's very fruity but that's very good a very bright tangerine scent a little sweetness from the mango that's really good i like that one okay next sample is salted almond milk very interesting i never tried almond milk and wax before and let's see how i feel about this one i don't know if it smells quite like almond milk but it smells sort of spa-like and creamy um i think that's where like the salted comes in but yeah this one is the egg hunt and a little cute egg shape hmm this one smells sweet yeah i don't know sorry it's really hard for me to tell what some things smell like sometimes without scent notes but it smells nice so lastly the last sample she gave me is a little sample scrub in the contortionist and this is a scrub and soap parfait this is what it looks like and i actually got the like it's very small here you go and i actually got the contortionist in a um little clam shell so i'll talk about that scent in a little bit but that's very cute i can't wait to try her um scrub formula especially this one has a soap parfait added in so yeah those are all the samples so i'm just gonna move all this stuff out of the way so i could have room for the clam shells all right so um i guess i'll get into a scrub that i picked up from the valentine's day collection i only picked up three things total um these were just leftovers and this is a scrub and this is in lemon curd and rose milk and i've never tried any of her scrubs before but i've heard very good things and so this is what it looks like it's very beautiful look at that and this one yeah i smelled that brightness from that lemon curd and it's a little bit toned down from the rose milk it's like slightly floral a little bit creamy and uh lemon curdy so i like that one i can't wait to try some of her scoops i mean scoops scrubs so um let me know if you guys have tried her scrubs before and what you guys think so uh from her valentine's day collection i really wanted to try her salted lime she seems to have a lot of like sense with the salted in it so i've seen like salted avocado salted rose like that one salted almond milk earlier from the sample but yeah i picked up salted rose and scent notes for this is sugary rose jam blended with salty tears and pink himalayan sea salt so i am not crazy about rose scents but i wanted to try this one this is what it looks like it looks like it has little salt crystals on there but yeah this one smells really good this is rose done really well now a lot of people say the bathing garden does rose really well and i have to agree this is really good so even if you're not a floral person uh consider picking this up this is like sort of spa-like and sort of rose it's very elegant smelly i really like that okay next one i have here is salted lavender i love lavender scents and so this one is my favorite lavender blended with crystallized sea salt and hints of soft wood woods white musk and sugary vanilla and this is what it looks like again some lavender buds oops i'm gonna get the floor so dirty but uh salt crystals almost i really like that wow yeah this smells like the most relaxing spa scent it's there's that lavender it's not especially herbal but it's not a sweet lavender either um and it just has that like sea salt note to it it's very pretty it's very beautiful i really like that okay so um moving on i'll get into the circus collection now finally so yes so the first one i have here is the lime juggler and this one is kefir lime blends with pink grapefruit tangerines and red strawberries now i really like lime scents i feel like not enough vendors do lime scents but yes look at that one very beautiful so this one oops i just dropped a bunch of glitter everywhere oh my god um yeah it's like tart it's limey but it's also a little bit sweet and you smell like the strawberries in there as well and a little bit of some citrus notes so that yeah that's really good i can't wait to melt that okay the next one i have here is bohemian rhapsody and set notes for this one is strawberry lime orange and raspberry so a fruity goodness and this one looks like this so very pretty i like the little heart here and this one this one i can't really smell that much it's very light on cold yeah i can't really smell this one that much um but i will say a lot of people say that for the bathing garden you do need to cure her stuff for a long time so i'm probably gonna let this stuff sit a couple months actually um because that's what people say and so that's what i'm gonna do okay the next one i have here is skittles lemonade now that sounds like heaven to me because i love lemonade scents and candy scents and i didn't really put any scent notes on this one because it's sort of self-explanatory this is what it looks like the little confetti like um little little sugar okay i don't know what i'm trying to say here but it's very cute it the little confetti i forget which sprinkles the confetti sprinkles yes that's what i'm trying to say looks like a bag of skittles so yeah that one smells so good um i really like that one it smells like skittles and lemonade like it smells exactly like that so good okay moving on the next one i have here is a circus bread now i wasn't going to pick this up i was only going to pick up like mainly like fruity scents but you know a lot of people are saying that they really love circus bread so i picked it up and this is yeasty fruitcake with fresh strawberries and vanilla and this one looks like this again she has some of the prettiest wax and she's so generous um yeah this one i can definitely smell that yeasty bready note to it it's like sweet bready not too much of the i don't smell too much of the fruit notes on here but uh yeah a very like bready kind of note and a little bit sweet the next one here is cola float and this one is bubbling cola with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and i really like cola scents um i don't know i don't feel like many vendors do cola scents but yes that that is what this one looks like very pretty this one is two-toned and yeah that smells like cola and it's like sort of sweetened up with that like vanilla notes almost yeah that's really good um it's like a little bit fizzy too but not that fizzy but yeah very nice i'm excited to have some cola scents in my collection okay the next one i have here is big top lemonade now i got two of these because i knew i was going to like it i debated on whether or not i wanted like her big clam shells in it but i decided not to um and i just got two clam shells tiny clam shells instead and this one is pink lemonade and yellow lemonade now pink lemonade is one of my favorite oils of all time and i love lemonade suns in general and so of course you know i just had to get some so this is what this one looks like so pretty look at that little cute um little lemon slice yeah that smells so good that is tart sweet bright lemonade goodness so so excited about that one okay the next one i have here is purple lemonade slushie and this one is blackberry juice with sparkling lemonade sweet cherry vanilla whipped cream and confectioner's sugar so that's what that one looks like how gorgeous is that like the cute little rose i think it's made out of wax too wow but yeah this one yeah it falls um like a very juicy blackberry with a little bit of like lemonade it's like sweet and a little bit tart but not too sweet um yeah i really like this this as well but the lemonade note in here is not as strong the blackberry is stronger so yes okay the next one i have here is fortunes darling and this one is herbal lavender with creamy rose are topped by orange blossom and pet to green essential oil i don't know what that is but um yes and it has little rose dried rose buds in here i have to be careful or else i'll make a mess how pretty is that yes and this one oh yeah this one's herbal all right even the rose in here smells very like a herbal rose almost yeah that's actually quite nice i feel like this would be very nice for relaxing like a bedtime sort of melt i definitely know that not many people are gonna like this scent but i do because i do like herbal kinds of notes but yeah this one's very herbal so if you're not into that you wouldn't like that but i like it so but i have to be in the mood for it okay the next one i have here is twirling trapeze and this one is a blue cotton candy sparkling strawberry soda pop blue raspberry ribbon candy does that not sound amazing so this one looks like this oh my gosh how cute are the little flowers oh these are little trinkets so i'm probably going to keep them and take them out of the wax melter once i melt them this one okay this one is smells sort of sweet i smell that like cotton candy notes and a little bit of that strawberry soda pop it's not that fizzy this is also sort of light on cold so i'm definitely going to hold on to this one um before melting okay the next one i have here is magician's bonfire uh bonfire wisp lavender chamomile sugar crystals so this one i oops sorry a cat hair you know as a fellow cat owner they just you just find here everywhere anyways um how beautiful is that this one cracked a bit it's okay but that is gorgeous oh okay yeah i really like that this is a very beautiful

and clotted cream now i got this one because this i do like tea scents but this one sounded very interesting to me so i picked some up oh gosh i'm gonna get glitter everywhere oops okay you definitely saw all the glitters escape there but how pretty is that even like the little rosebud um or i don't i don't know if that's the rosebud or not but um the little leaf here and oh this one is two-toned it's green on the bottom pink on the top look at all the glitter on my hand that sounds interesting this one's very relaxing but sweet there's like a creaminess to it from the clotted cream note and there's like a little bit of this like tea note and that's really relaxing i really like that so yes the next one i have here is in the illusionist and this one is neroli orange blossoms mandarin red grapefruit swirled with mango and red berries i'm starting to learn that i really like neroli as a scent note i really like that floral note too it's very unique and this is what it looks like there's like a little mask there how beautiful is that yeah i smell that neroli in there that's very beautiful yeah this is mainly like a very floral kind of scent um it's um a little bit fruity but mainly

that like fizzy compared to other vendors that i've tried but you still like smell a little bit of it like the lemon limeness but not like the fizz factor that you feel in your nose so the next one

smell that woods definitely and a little bit of vanillaness i don't smell much like soda essence to it actually this sort of reminds me of something from lush but i don't know what like i feel like in general the bathing garden has like an undertone to her wax that sort of reminds me of lush and i'm not quite sure why but yeah i get that undertone tour i do like her undertone i feel like it's very unique um that's all i can say yeah it's very unique but i do like it okay the last one i have here i got two of which is fizzing lavender soda i really wanted a lavender soda blend because i've never

of things i love big top lemonade i love her bonds fires magicians bonfire i think that's what it's called i love her purple lemonade slushies but yeah thank you so much for the samples um she's always so generous and her wax is some of the prettiest around and not just that her clam shells are pretty affordable these are 3.99 each so considering all the time and effort it takes to make her wax with all the samples and everything i mean i think she is an excellent vendor and yeah so thank you so much for watching let me know if you guys picked up anything from the circus collection or any collection you think i should be on the lookout for if i really like but yeah um have a great week and i'll catch you guys next time", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say

you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "RjOpejjgug8": "what's up guys steve here with ian a 5-star vapor lounge he is the manager here and we are going to be talking to you today about the five things that you need to know about CBD [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the first thing that we want to talk about number one what a CBD and is it legal we all know the medicinal benefits of cannabis the main two components in cannabis the main two cannabinoids are THC and CBD CBD is a way to get all the health benefits and the medicinal properties of cannabis without having to sacrifice your your your cognitive state in a way that might you know hamper your work ability CBD actually has most of the same medicinal benefits of THC but just without the high and it's the medicinal stuff that is in a more concentrated form yes like you're not getting as much CBD yeah from traditional okay yes smoke so you got cannabis and you got him so cannabis is actually very strong very concentrated in THC a very low concentration of CBD industrial hemp is actually very high in CBD but very very low if not anything of THC so actually a lot of the CBD comes from industrial hemp it actually doesn't come from cannabis lucky for us and lucky for a lot of people that are that need the medicinal benefits of cannabis while CBD legality can vary from state to state CBD is not only legal in Missouri but it's also legal on a federal level they actually just passed a new farm bill that was an update from the 2014 farm bill completely removed it from the controlled substance act is it legal yes however do be smart about it this stuff especially our flour and our pre-rolled items do look a lot like the quote unquote real deal so I recommend that the customers leave that in the package until they arrive at their home if it does feel a little disjointed yeah studies have shown that CBD reduces pain inflammation anxiety depression migraines seizures IBS psychosis and mental disorders and nausea so thirdly how is CBD take it you have sublingual sublinguals are a quick way to get in your bloodstream usually just drops under the tongue topicals creams balms there's even patches that are great for muscle and joint pain then you have your pills pill form is great capsules really quick and easy way no hassle no frills way to take CBD then you have your edibles edibles are delicious there's all different kinds of edibles vape available form of CBD can be great for somebody who's already using an e-cig or already has a vaporizer that they're using on a daily basis and when it comes to flower we have the jars of loose flour we have the roll-your-own kit that has the filters and papers included and then we have the pre-roll we have regular pre-roll and then we actually have a Keith and honey rolled pre-roll concentrates concentrates include wax shatter crumble any sort of concentrated CBD isolates and CD is also pet safe there are specific products designed just for pets you could also take a sublingual that's meant for human consumption and give that in small doses to your pet either through their water or in their food meow the fourth thing is how much CBD do I take we always recommend in your starting dose you should usually start about 25 to 50 milligrams and then kind of go from there start a little smaller work your way up and just see what works for you it's not uncommon for people to take upwards of a hundred to two hundred you can't really overdose on CBD so take it you know if you want to start at a hundred start at one hundred if you think that's what you're gonna need one good thing to know if you are using any kind of sublinguals or anything like that with the dropper most droppers are one mill per dropper so you can figure out hey I've got a 30ml bottle it's got a thousand milligram of CBD and you just divide that a thousand by 30 mils and that's basically how much each dropper will be so the fifth and final thing that we're going to talk about will I pass my drug test with CBD yes you will however some CBD products do have trace amounts of THC in them the legal limit for CBD products is 0.3 percent or less THC a lot of the products that we carry are 100% CBD pure CBD or isolates isolated zvt if it says full spectrum that's where you get into that gray area where yeah I'd include something like that and the flower and and yes again it's very trace amounts but if you are using CBD on a regular basis at all I would recommend sticking with isolates and pure CBD and stay away from the flowers and the multi spectrums in the full spectrums now quality is a huge factor know where you're getting your stuff from know where your shops getting their stuff from if you're into CBD at all you know the names like green rose and fresh leaf and summit stuff like that that's what we carry so it's all lab tested most products aren't only just lab tested they're double and triple lab tested and keep in mind even if you're at the point three percent you're not gonna get high from it on the other hand if you're not getting drug tested the multi spectrums are fantastic they have what they call an entourage effect because you're getting all those camp cannabinoids to work together all that synergistic stuff going on aside just all they say all the harder right pretty role in the flower stuff it's some of the best stuff for anxiety and insomnia sleep disorder sleep IDI is an excellent way to go for for anxiety alright guys thank you so much for watching I am Steve this is Ian we are at 5-star vapor lounge in st.

We also have her brand new planner that I'm going to show\nyou later in the show, but I wanted to show\nyou how the blocks look and what we're going to be making today. So these are the three blocks\nthat I made with Homestead. This free pattern has three size options, nine inch, six inch, and three inch. And so those were my three blocks that I'm going to turn\nthese into the quilt that is going to look\nlike this at the end. And I'm going to do\nthree different quilts. I'm going to show you the blocks that our sample makers made. So Teresa used Quotation by Zen Chic, Debra used Figs and\nShirtings by Fig Tree Quilts. And if you're not\ninterested in pressing open, you can see that Debra\ndid and Teresa didn't. So do whatever works for you. We wrote the pattern as pressed open just because when you start\njoining the blocks together, you might have a lot of things that touch. So we felt it was easier to do press open, but you don't have to finish this way. Terry made her block with Folktale, Sue made hers with Shine\nOn by Bonnie and Camille, and Angel made hers\nwith Cider by BasicGrey. So this is nine inch,\nsix inch, and three inch. And that's what we're going to\nbe making today, super easy. So for today, let me show you. The basic premise of this block is four half square triangles, a four patch, and some two patch rectangles. And today I'm going to show you how I save time in my sewing room. And the pattern is written\nto do it the traditional way. So you might want to sew it that way, you might want to try my technique. We obviously don't write the\npattern for my technique, just because I kind of make it up as I go. So let's pull out the\npattern and get started. So I take from my Sewcialites\nbinder, we're on block five. It's called Wisdom. It's only one page today, yay! This is definitely a beginner\nblock, so that's great. For your half square triangles, if you're going to, you can\nmake them the traditional way, which is right here. This is your instructions. If you want to use triangle\npaper, you would use one inch, which is H100, for the three inch block, H200 for the six inch block, and H300 for the nine inch block. You would just take the unfinished size, which is listed right\nhere, take 1/2 an inch off. And that gives you one inch,\ntwo inch, and three inch. And today I'm going to be\ndemonstrating the six inch, so I'm going to put these two away. My two fabrics I'm going to\nuse today are right here. I have them starched and that's kind of how you\ncan tell they are starched because they stand up\nlike a little teepee. I'm going to iron these real quick. And when I'm ironing, I do use steam. I'm going to go ahead and put the fabrics right sides together and kind of the same sizes together. Now, when I start, my\nfabric has already shrunk, so you can see that one side\nis longer than the other. So you can see that about\n1/2 inch shrunk off. So when I'm working with the fabrics, I usually put the sizes\nthat keep the sizes together as they shrink kind of. You don't have to pre-starch,\nthat's just what I do. And this time, I'm not going\nto cut everything at one time. I'm just going to do the\nhalf square triangles. Real quick, I'm going to do those and then we're going to\ncome back and do all of this because I'm going to chain piece. So first I'm going to cut for A and D. Actually. Look, I just pulled this\noff and it went like this. Sorry. - [Lilly] I've done that too. - I was like, oops. Okay, so here I'm going\nto cover up the nine inch and three inch so I don't get too confused and cut the wrong thing\nlike I did on week one. So for my A and D, I need\ntwo three inch squares, so I'm going to take two of\nthe pieces off of this roll. So I'll just cut two from the end. And it looks like this\nis cut off kind of funny so I'm going to actually throw these away 'cause that doesn't look\nlike it was cut straight. So I'm going to start with two clean ones, cut directly on the solid line. I always make my triangles\nwith triangle paper. Now we wrote the instructions\nwith the traditional way, because we don't want you to feel like you have to buy the triangle paper. I'm going to just place\nthis on any corner. My fabrics are already\nright sides together and they are pressed before. I'm just going to cut\naround this real quick. We're going to do the\nhalf square triangles and then come back to the rest. So from here, when you're\nworking with triangle paper, you have a solid line and\nyou have dotted lines. I am going to stitch\ndirectly on the dotted lines and I'm going to use... I use a 1.5 stitch length but what you should do at home is whatever stitch length you\nusually use, go down 0.5. So some people use a 2.5 stitch length, then you would just use a 2.0. I just use a regular needle for this. If I was doing a lot of triangle paper, I would use a size 90 needle. So move my stitch length down and go right on the dotted lines. (sewing machine whirring) So I've stitched on the lines. Now I'm going to cut\naround the four sides. You can cut any way you would like though. The goal is to cut on the solid lines. And if you want to do the traditional way, we have those instructions\nwritten right here. And then let's cut, cut. I'm going to move all of my\nitems over here that I'm using. And here I'm going to\njust pull my paper off. Sometimes I fold over and pull. Sometimes I just pull, kinda\ndepends what I feel like. So I'm going to pull this paper off. We're going to iron. I will be pressing everything open. And this block is pretty easy,\nso I'm excited about that. I did want to remind you guys, next Friday, I will\nnot have a live stream. I'm going to do it on Thursday instead because my daughter is\ngoing to a dance convention and we're going to drive\nup on Thursday night. Her solo is Friday afternoon. The funny thing is she\nhasn't done her solo yet. So I said, \"Well, which one\nof these solos is yours?\" She goes, \"Oh, I don't\nknow the name of the song.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So I don't even know. I don't know exactly what time. So I have set my seam. I press to one side. And then I'm going to cut\nmy little dog ears off and then press open. So yeah, I will be doing block\nsix next week on Thursday. So we're going to release\neverything a day early so that I can still do the live stream. Okay, so to press open, I will\njust finger press and press. And I like to let that sit a little bit. And then sometimes I stack them on tops 'cause then that just gets\nthe bottom one even hotter. So just do them all at the same time and then I'm going to\nuse one of the clappers. I just put that clapper right on that, move it to the side, and we\nwill move to the next part. But let me know if there's any questions before I keep going. - [Lilly] Yeah. First of all, Wilma Evans\nhad said, \"Good morning. \"Happy birthday to me, big 77 today.\" - Oh, happy birthday. - [Lilly] I see you in\nour live chat every week, so I want to make sure to\nwish you a happy birthday. Stitch with Lisa Bongean\nsays \"Hi, Lilly and Kimberly, \"first time I am watching live.\" - Oh, yay! I watched you the other day. I didn't want to comment though. I was like, I don't know what to say. - [Lilly] You can just say hello. From Crafting a Planned Life, question. \"I've never made a quilt before \"and I am waiting for my Homestead fabric. \"The directions say 5 1/2 yards\nfor backing and finishing. \"Is there fabric in the fat quarter \"or do I order separate yardage?\" - Read it again? - [Lilly] So she says\nshe's waiting for Homestead and the directions on the pattern\nsay she needs 5 1/2 yards, I think for backing and finishing. And she's wondering if there's\nfabric in the fat quarter or if she needs to order\nyardage separately. - Fabric requirements are on the blog. I don't have them printed out right here, so I can't answer that. Can you pull them up on the screen? - [Lilly] Oh, I don't\nthink I have them today. - Okay, so I would say\ngo to the blog and look, but usually backing is\nnot the same as finishing. So when it says fat\nquarters for finishing, that is for the half square triangles that go around the edge right here. So if you do the upper camera. Oh yeah, I can read that. Okay, so the finishing fabrics\nthat are called for extra that are the eight prints\nare for right here. Just for right here. If it says one, okay, so if you're looking\nat the six inch block, it says 18 fat quarters,\nthat's for the blocks. The 3 1/2 yards, okay, you're\nlooking at the nine inch. Okay, so for the nine inch, if you're going to do the nine inch, you need 18 fat quarters. That is for all the blocks. The 5 1/2 yards, it says\nblocks and finishing, that is for here, right here. And the print squares\nis also for right here. The backing is totally separate. So this is your blocks and then we consider this your finishing. - [Lilly] Okay, so that\nwould not be included in the fat quarters she ordered. - [Kimberly] No, because\nthe fat quarters are for like right here and right here. - [Lilly] Gotcha. - [Kimberly] Sorry, I didn't know that off the top of my head, haven't looked at that in a while. - [Lilly] Okay, and we had\na question from Isa Rojas. \"I know Kimberly uses\ntriangle paper, but Kimberly, \"do you have a tip for\nthe points in the corners \"when I sew them? \"They can kind of twitch on the machine, \"the smaller they go.\" Doing the traditional way? - I would say just start,\nmaybe do a leader and an ender. So some machines do better\nwith leaders and enders and that just kind of\ngets your thread going. And that's just like a little\npiece of a scrap, like... Like you could just take\nthis little piece right here and just stitch on it,\nget your stitches going, and then just chain piece and keep going. That will help you. I don't feel like with the Juki I need it, but sometimes if I use my Baby Lock, I do feel like I need it. So leaders and enders\nsometimes help with that. That's what I would suggest. - [Lilly] All right. And then we do have a lot of super chats that have been coming in, so I'll go through a couple right now. We had one from Lori at the beginning of the live stream for $5\nand Lori put a little pear that's like dancing like\nthis and it's got those... - Bazookas? - [Lilly] Yeah, those, yeah. It's really cute. Thank you, Lori.\n- Thank you. - [Lilly] And then our next super chat was from Valeria Bauer for $19.99. And she put the dancing pear\nwith the top hat saying, \"You are amazing.\" - Thank you. Okay, so I'm going to\nshow you what I'm doing and I hope to not confuse you. This right here, you can\neither cut rectangles and piece them together\nand chain piece them and squares and piece them together. But to save time, I'm\ngoing to chain piece this. So I'm going to kind\nof guess on what I need and I probably won't. Let's see, I probably\nneed two or three strips. I'm not exactly sure how many, so I'm just going to cut three. So I need Bs, Cs, and Es\nare all 1 1/2 inches wide. So what I'm going to do, I'm actually not even\ngoing to cut them 1 1/2, I'm going to cut them a little bit bigger. And actually here, I would just guess. So instead of doing the math,\nI'm just going to guess. And I'm not going to cut 1 1/2, I'm going to do a little bit over 1 1/2, like 1 3/4 and I'll show you why. And I'm just going to do three strips 'cause that's my guess. I'm trying to do this as\nmuch like I do at home here and this is literally what I do. Sometimes I would plan, but here I'm just going\nto do three strips. This little piece, I'm not going to be able\nto do anything with, so I will cut that off. And then I'm going to put\nthis in my little scrap bucket that I have over here,\nkeeping all of my scraps. So I just kind of keep\nthem underneath my blocks. So I'll keep it all together. Now what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to stitch with a 1/4 inch seam on both sides. I'm going to just cut, I'm\ngoing to sew real fast. And I put a 1/4 inch foot on it and it went back to like a 2.0 stitch and I'm going to go super fast. (sewing machine whirring) And I don't have to be as accurate with my 1/4 inch seam\nbecause I'm cheating. (sewing machine whirring) And I'll show you why. I don't think I really need all three, but I think I'm going to need 2 1/2. (sewing machine whirring) So I've got these little strips done. Now, I find that it is much quicker to just do all these strips and then sub cut them down\nand then go from there. But if you're a beginner,\nthis might be a little much. I'm not sure. So here I've got my half square triangles. Now you can see how nice and\nflat they are with my clapper. And I'm going to press this down flat. Press to one side and then press open. And when you press, you just want to make sure this\nis nice and flat right here and it's not like a duck pleat so that it doesn't like come over. - [Lilly] Need a little\ngraphic or something that comes up on the side\nthat's like, no duct pleat. - [Kimberly] I know and I\nthink I made that word up so everybody gets confused,\nbut that's just what I call it 'cause it looks like a duck bill. Now I'm going to just- - [Lilly] Oh, I get it now. - [Kimberly] Yeah, I just made that up. - [Lilly] I never knew\nwhy you called it that. - [Kimberly] Oh! It's just one of my made up words. It's hot, this iron's pretty hot today. So I'm going to put this\nlittle thing on the side and go ahead and put this\ndown while I do the last one. And I did finish Designer\nMystery last weekend, so that was super exciting. I finished it on Sunday,\nlike at two o'clock. So I'm super excited that that is done. Gina is going to be quilting it today. And so I can show you\nkind of a sneak peek of it in a week or two when she's done with it. So now I've got these\nstrips and you're thinking, okay, what am I going to do? Well, I'm going to turn\nit into this and this, but the first thing I'm\ngoing to do is trim it down because like I said, I wasn't\npaying attention to my seam, I just want to go fast. So it originally was cut 1 1/2. So if you take 1 1/2, you take off your 1/4 inch\nseam that you just sewed, you can trim that down 1/4\ninch away from that seam. And I've wasted so little, but it's going to be more accurate because it's going to be exactly 2 1/2. So now this is going to be 2 1/2 inches. And I'm going to go ahead\nand start with this one. Now I just need two pieces\nthat are 1 1/2 by 2 1/2, so from here I will cut\na three inch and a 1 1/2. These two are going to become right here, what I've done right\nhere, and I saved time. But now I need to cut four of\nthese that are 2 1/2 by 2 1/2. So now I'm going to cut... Well, normally I would\ncut with, let's see, this is normally I would\ncut a five and then a 2 1/2. I always cut bigger and then trim down, so I've got a five and a 2 1/2. And then, see, I only need one more. I didn't need three. And then this, I need to trim\ndown right here to 2 1/2. It's just going to be more of an exact, you're going to get more of an exact because it's like you're, I\ndon't know how to explain it, but it's just going to give\nyou a more exact result doing it this way. And yes, it is extra steps. So this I don't need, but\nI'm not gonna throw it away. I'm gonna put it in my\nbox of scraps right here. And then who knows what I'll do with it? I might put it on the back,\nwho knows what I'll do. I might throw it away, never know. I'll just put it in here and\nwhen I need it, I need it. So now the only thing left to do before I put my block together is to sew these together real quick. So I will put them together and look to see if they're lined up. That's not lined up. Can you zoom in a little bit? Thanks. So you can see that it's not lined up, so I'm going to just move it over. Put a pin in. I do my pins straight. Some people when they pin,\nthey pin, what do you call it? Diagonally. You can pin whichever way you like. I'm going to stitch this real quick. (sewing machine whirring) And I'm going to look and\nit looks like it matches, so I'm going to press this and then we'll put our block together. - [Lilly] Yay. - Did I get all of them? Okay, I did cut one of these wrong. One of those is too short,\nI did something wrong. I'll fix it. And that's kind of sometimes what happens 'cause I go really fast. I cut pretty fast. Okay, so... Da, da, da. I usually count, like at\nhome, I'll count to 10. Sometimes my kids are like\n\"Why are you counting?\" I'm like, \"Oh, it's okay.\" So here I can tell, look,\nI cut one of those wrong. So one of them's too big and\none of them is too small. So 2 1/2, that one's wrong. 2 1/2, 2 1/2. Okay, so who knows what I did? I'm going to find my strip again. And cut this down. Cut another one. I don't exactly know what I did, but that's what happens\nwhen you get on camera. 2 1/2. So now we can lay out our pieces. And this one, you can\nhave a lot of fun with it. So I'm going to show you some\ndifferent things you can do. So I'm going to lay this out the way that Sherri McConnell designed it. This is the wrong one. And I just follow my diagram. Oh, and I forgot to cut that. Oh, no, I didn't. It's in my clapper. It's right here. (hums) So there's my block. And all of my oranges are\nkind of making a circle, but you can change it. So you could do this and you would have more of a white circle. To go further, you could do this and you could have a\ntotally different look. So this would be kind\nof an inverse of this. So before you sew it together, you know, you can change it up. You don't have to do it\nexactly how we designed it. The whole point of this is to have fun, to, you know, just learn some techniques. I hope I don't confuse you too\nmuch, but I sew really fast and this is how I do it is\nI use any kind of tricks that I've come up with. So now I'm going to double check to make sure I've got it the right way. This really doesn't matter in the center, I don't think that really\nmatters which way it goes. And I'm going to sew down a 1/4 inch seam and then we're going to press. So when I'm doing this,\nI will put them together. And since they line up\nperfectly, I'm not going to pin. If they didn't, I would pin. So I'm going to stitch. (sewing machine whirring) I'm not going to cut apart, I'm going to leave 'em chained together. (sewing machine whirring) And I'm going to press. So I'll put these over here. So again, I leave them chained together. When you're chain piecing, you want to leave a\nlittle gap between 'em. If you chain and you don't\nand you're like this, like if you don't leave a\nlittle bit of thread between, it's going to be hard to iron. So that would be one tip. Yeah, 'cause it'll be like,\nif you're ironing, Lilly, it'll like, I don't know. It'll bump, bump up. So here, I'm just going\nto press to one side. And again, you can press\nhowever you would like, I'm going to just press\nto one side, press open, let it sit a little bit, and\nthen we'll add the next side. And if you're doing a\nlot of chain piecing, doing this technique will really help. Like if you're doing a really big quilt, it will really help. So I'm going to count a little bit. I'm going to put the\nbigger clapper on it now. Set it aside. And then we'll come\nback to it in a second. So let me know what questions y'all have while that, I like that to\nheat maybe a minute or so. So I did think about that this weekend when I was sewing the Designer Mystery, I thought, okay, tell\npeople how many seconds. So when I'm pressing and\npressing to one side, I usually will leave the iron\non it five to 10 seconds. When I'm putting this here, I like to leave it about\n60 seconds to two minutes. So it's a great time for me, like if I need to go to the bathroom, I run to the bathroom\nwhile this is sitting here. So this is a really\nimportant part of what I do. Now, you don't have to do this. You don't have to use this. I quilted for 20 years without one. And when they came out, my sales rep at Riley Blake was like, \"Oh my gosh, you have to use it.\" And I was like, what is she talking about? I didn't understand it. And then when I started\nusing it, I understood it. So it's kind of one of those\nthings that you don't need, but once you use it, it's\nhard to not use it, I guess. So I'll lay that back\nout and cut these apart. Now, if you left these chained together and tried to sew without cutting apart, it gets kind of tricky. So here, I'm just gonna\nput these together. They're lining up, so I don't have to pin. (sewing machine whirring) Some days my stuff lines\nup, some days it doesn't, so it depends kind of\nhow it's going that day. (sewing machine whirring) So let me know, are there\nany questions, Lilly? - [Lilly] Yes. I was making sure the\nsewing machine wasn't going. From Marilyn Dumas, \"Does\nit matter if you sew down \"or if you sew across?\" Like when you're building the block, which direction you chain piece? - [Kimberly] No, it doesn't matter. - [Lilly] From Amy Leech, \"When are the clappers\nlikely to be back in stock?\" - [Kimberly] I think one\nof them is coming back in stock soon and the\nother one is December. I can't remember which is which. There is also a version of this by, tell me the company, Lilly? - [Lilly] Steady Betty. - Steady Betty. And that one is in stock and\nI have all three at my house. And you could also go to\nHome Depot and make your own. It is, I think it's maple. Is that right, Lilly? It's a certain kind of wood. So you have to, all that matters is it's a certain kind of wood because the wood takes the heat out. - [Lilly] Yes, I think it is maple. - I think it's maple. - [Lilly] Because then oak is too soft and it could get sap on it, I believe. - Yeah, so... - [Lilly] And then a\nfew people were asking if you could actually demo with\nthe rotary cutter real quick to show how it works, especially like how you\nunlock it, open it up. - After we're done. Okay, let's do that after\nwe're done with the block. So here, I'm just going to go here and I'm going to sew this real quick and then we'll do a little,\nwe'll do a demo on that. And then I'll also show\nyou what you would do if you want to do the\nchain piecing like I did on the three inch or the nine inch. So I'm just in the intersections\nthat, how do you say, intersect or that the seams\nneed to meet, I pinned those. And then stitch. (sewing machine whirring) Now here you can press or you can add. Okay, my points don't match up exactly so I want you to zoom in. I'm not going to actually\nunstitch it today. - [Lilly] Oh. - [Kimberly] I'm going to leave it today. I've decided today is going to be... - [Lilly] Can zoom in\na lot more if you want. - [Kimberly] Well, see,\nokay, so this lines up, but right here, it's\noff by 1/8 of an inch. - [Lilly] Can you center it? And then I can zoom in real tight on it. - [Kimberly] Okay, so right\nhere, that does not match. See how it's off? And that's why, actually that is why, because this bumped up. So I am going to take it out. That's why it did that. So I was like, why didn't it match up? So something happened there. Usually I wouldn't take it out because it's just orange,\nI mean, nobody can tell, but I'm going to take it out\nbecause I don't want this bump. This bump, if you don't take it out, when you iron, you will\nhave a crease right here. When you iron it flat, you're going to have a little crease and that crease is not going to come out. So I am going to, look, I'm getting so much better with my tools because Lilly's getting me all organized. Yes, Lilly and Ashley are setting it up so I don't get so disorganized. At home this weekend, I swear, I've got to buy some new seam\nrippers because I could not, I was seam ripping like\ncrazy this weekend. I usually don't. But I think because I was in such a hurry, I was needing to seam rip, and I had like, I couldn't find the seam ripper ever. And so I'm going to have\nto buy a couple more so that they're kind of everywhere. It's always hard for me\nto seam rip on the camera. I think it's because of my\nvision, it's hard to see. - [Lilly] I was going to say the seam ripper is also camera shy. - [Kimberly] Well, I think\nit's just hard for me to see, my eyesight is so bad. At home, I'm like, I'm\nputting it right in my face. So... So yeah, I will show the rotary cutter. - [Lilly] Yeah, I think\npeople were just wanting to see how the whole mechanism worked. - [Kimberly] Yeah, I'll show it. This is... Okay, so hopefully this will\njust pull out right here. This is why I need to get that eye surgery (laughs) so I can see on camera. Several people have emailed me about it. I had radial keratotomy when I was 18 'cause it was free on our\ninsurance at the time. But because it was a much older, it's not laser, it's the older one, your vision will get progressively\nworse once you hit 40. So I think I'm going to have\nthe, well, I don't know. I got to get, I'm not going to have it until\nthe world is back to normal, but where you can get lens replacement. And then when I get older, I won't have to have my cataracts removed. 'Cause I know I'll have them,\nlike there's zero doubt. Everyone in my family has them. I have, yeah, it's not good. Okay, so now I'm going to go and I'm going to actually\npress this because, press this with my iron so that that little wrinkle comes out. Line it up again. Sew it. Now, if I was in a huge\nhurry, I wouldn't redo this. I told Gina when I sent her\nDesigner Mystery, I said, \"Oh, this is not perfect.\" Because it didn't have a ton of time so it was a little bit less lax. Okay, so that's better. Now I'm going to go ahead and just add the other side to save time. Sometimes when I'm doing a block, I'll stop and press and add. It just depends. Today, I just feel like I'm\ngoing to go a little bit faster, but you can do whatever. It's kind of, I want to show\nyou how I do different things on different days. It kind of depends. If I have deadlines, I do it one way. If I'm just doing it for\nfun, I just do whatever. So you don't have to do,\njust do whatever basically. Whatever floats your boat that day. So pinning. Stitching. (sewing machine whirring) Okay, now see, I'm telling\nyou today is a mess. So look what happened. - [Lilly] Oh no. - [Kimberly] So I've got to fix that. I don't know, my sewing\ntoday is not great. My sewing skills are... - [Lilly] It's all right. It's 'cause Mercury's in retrograde. - [Kimberly] Something's off. When I was driving to work,\nI was like something is not. What is Mercury? The planet? - [Lilly] Yeah, planets go into retrograde and Mercury will be in\nretrograde until November 2 or 3. - [Kimberly] Okay, well, then good, I don't have to sew until then. - [Lilly] It's all right, yeah. - [Kimberly] I'm just kidding. - [Lilly] (laughs) Also\njust because a few people were sharing in the chat,\nwere asking everyone to tell us what your favorite snack is while you are sewing or what you do when you're also seam\npressing and using the clapper and you walk away for a sec, what's your favorite thing to go do? - [Kimberly] Oh, that's funny. So I usually go to the bathroom and I usually check my email. You can ask Lilly, 'cause I\nanswer my email all the time. - [Lilly] That's true. - [Kimberly] I will say I\nhave been not doing it as much on the weekends as I used to. I used to work 24 hours a day. I just... And I'm going to press to the inside. It doesn't really matter which way. Yeah, my sewing skills\non this is not great. My seams don't match up but that's okay. I noticed there was a\nlot less traffic today. I got here super early. I was like, what is going on? I was like, is it a holiday? - [Lilly] I think the\ntraffic was happening earlier in the day, 'cause I had a\nlot of traffic very early on. - [Kimberly] Oh, I had like none. But I go the back roads. I don't get on 35, ever. Ever since I had that\naccident, I don't get on 35. And when Kevin gets on it,\nI'm like, oh, I get so scared. - [Lilly] It's not too far. Yeah, if I took the back roads, it would just add 10 minutes. - Yeah, it adds 10 minutes to mine. But I don't know, I'm just, ever since I had that car accident. It hurt so bad that I'm just like, I'm not getting on that road. Do do do. And when I'm sewing, one\nthing that I do is I watch, oh, I watched some good TV\nthis week I can tell you about. So Netflix released, I\nwanted to text you, Lilly, but I try not to text y'all. So David Letterman came out\nwith his \"My Next Guest\" and I watched it all in one night 'cause I went to bed like at\nmidnight, which I never do. It was Lizzo, Robert Downey Jr. Oh my goodness. It was so good. How could I forget right now? (Lilly laughs) Kim Kardashian. She told a really good story\nin it and I don't even really, honestly like Kim Kardashian is not like, I don't even really... My daughter watches her. I think she's beautiful, but I don't really know much about her. So that was actually kind\nof interesting for me because I didn't know much about her. I knew a lot about Robert Downey Jr. He had some funny stories. Lizzo. Okay, so he asked her, what does \"Why men gotta be\ngreat till they're not great?\" or whatever that song is. - [Lilly] What does it mean? - What does it mean? And she answered it and\nit didn't make any sense, so I still don't know what it means. I still don't know what it means. - [Lilly] It's like men are nice until like they get power or fame- - Oh, okay, I didn't know what it meant. - [Lilly] A better life and then they're not great to you anymore. - Oh, okay. - [Lilly] I think that's what it means. - And then who was the other one? Okay. Okay, Kim Kardashian. Oh, my favorite, Dave Chappelle. - [Lilly] Oh! - I love Dave Chappelle. So that was actually good. I like to watch anything that\nis like documentary style. I don't care their politics. I don't care any of that. Like, this is not about that. It is because he always\nhas people that are left. So some of you people are\ngonna say, oh, you're whatever, but it was just so interesting. I love the way he asks questions. And then \"Unresolved Mysteries\" came out, I think yesterday or the day\nbefore, with new episodes so I've been watching that. Okay. And Lilly showed me how I can\nuse Spotify for my podcasts. So now I'm deleted my Apple\napp and I'm starting over because I had too many on my Apple app. So here's my block and\nI've got a couple of, what do you call that? Thread coming off. And you can see, zoom\nin a little bit, Lilly, I'm going to show you\nhow they don't line up. So right here, this does not line up. Look at that. That is not, that is way off. But see, it's all orange,\nso nobody's going to know. If it was like white and\nsomething, I would maybe change it, but I just, I'm not. At home though, I would have fixed that. So now I'm going to trim and\nI'm just going to make sure that when I trim, my 1/4\ninch line touches the tip of my half square triangle. So that when you cut, you're\nnot cutting off your tip. And the goal of this is just\nto get the little edges off. Makes it a little bit easier when you're piecing it\ntogether at the end. This is a step I probably never take out. I usually always do this. I kind of like it, it just\nkind of makes me feel good. So now I'm going to show\nyou all the blocks I've done that are from this collection. Just to show you real quick\nand then we'll, listen, I'm going to move the\nsewing machine real quick. (clattering) To the side. - [Lilly] I can move it if you want. - [Kimberly] It's all right, I'll just move it right there. There, now we have more room. Okay. And then I'll show you all the\nrest that y'all asked about. So I'm thinking what I'm\ngoing to do on this is make a little table runner that's just long and skinny like this. I'm just going to keep going. So can you zoom out a tiny bit? Kind of what I'm thinking I'm\ngoing to do is, well, see, I've got too much dark, so we'll switch. So see how some of your blocks are darker. So I would consider these\ntwo darker, these lighter. So I'm gonna keep going but what I'm going to do is\ndo a long, skinny table runner like this way, horizontal. And then I'm going to\nadd a border that way and a border this way and it's going to go\noff of one of my tables. It's just going to hang off the sides and it's just going to have a\nborder here and a border here. So that's what I'm thinking\nI'm going to do with these. My other option, because my\ntable is about 12 inches wide, is to do like this and just keep adding. But I'm thinking that this\nkind of fits the style a little bit more. And before I sewed them together, I would play with my placement. But you can see like I've got three blocks that are pretty light, two\nblocks that are pretty dark. So I'm going to wait until\nI have an assortment, I need many more. And that's kind of what I'm going to do with my first extra project. That's kind of what I'm\nthinking I'm going to do. I keep changing my mind. So I just put them back in my little box. This is a little box\nyou can get at Target. It's in a weird section of Target. It's by the wedding section. So I don't know if they're wedding boxes, but I just put, yeah, they're\nin the wedding section, but I don't go to the wedding section. So anyway, Emma found them\nfor me a long time ago. And so I take this home. So I take this home\nand prep for next week. Now I'm going to show you a little bit about the rotary cutter and I'm going to talk to you about if you want to do the other sizes. So I'm gonna find some fabric. Pull from my box. So for the rotary cutter, there are lots of options\nfor a rotary cutter. In our studio, we only have these two because I cannot use the others. So there are other ones\nthat do not have this. So this is a lock. So when that's up, when you go like this, the blade doesn't come out. When you click it, it does. I do tend to put it on\nlock because if I drop it, I don't want this to go on my foot. 'Cause it will happen. So I do use this lock a lot. I probably don't use it\non set, but at home I do. And the way this one, this one is called Ergonomic Pacific Blue and this is just the Ergonomic Original. You just go like this. And when you put your ruler, you put your blade right on the edge. There are other ones that\ndo not have this lock and they're more of just a straight. Yeah, we can show that little tiny one that's over there for an example. But we don't keep them in here because I literally cannot use them. I have never figured it out. And I've tried and Lilly can attest that I don't have a clue how to use them. - [Lilly] You gave it a good try. - So there's, yeah. So there's this one. You can get this in any size, but this was the traditional,\nthis is less expensive, but you basically up and\ndown with your thumb. But for some reason when\nI go to do this, watch. It's harder for me because\nthe way the wrist is. Whereas if you do this, I feel like I can just go like that. So it's something to do with that. Also this is what I started on. Some of the ones I have at home, I've had for like 20 years. Okay. Now, if you were going\nto do this right here in the one inch size, if you look at B, E, C, and F, they're all cut one inch wide. So you could start with one inch strips or 1 1/4 inch strips and trim them down. On mine, I did 1 3/4, the\npattern calls for 1 1/2. And for this one, it calls for two inch, so you would cut 2 1/4 and then trim down. If you want to do it the way that I do it or a version of what I did. So that's what I have on the Sewcialites but I'm happy to answer\nany questions on that before I move everything out of the way. - [Lilly] Yeah. I'm going to go through\nsome super chats first and then we have a couple\nquestions about true crime. - Oh, okay, yes. I know what you're going to ask already. I already know the question,\nI bet I could guess. - [Lilly] Oh man, okay. We had a super chat from Kathy Deeson for $20 earlier in the\nchat and people were saying that they would like to see\nme act out what she's doing so I'll do it when I do my segment later. - Wait, my what? What'd I do? - [Lilly] No, no, no. They were talking about,\nthey want me to mimic- - Oh, her little acting. - [Lilly] Yes, my acting. - I was like, is she going\nto act out my rotary cutter? I'm horrible at that. - [Lilly] That's funny. No, it's a little zombie, I think. Zombie girl, she's got a ponytail. And then she like shakes\nher head and smiles. And when she smiles,\nher eyes turn into stars and then her hair turns\ninto a giant heart. - Oh my God. - [Lilly] That's our\nfirst super chat for now. And then we got another one\nfrom Faye T. for $19.99. And they put a little pear that says \"Thanks for being\nyou\" with the long hair. - Oh, thank you. - [Lilly] And then we got\na super chat from Sprocket for 10 pounds, I believe,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong. And it's got a little\nfox with a little heart and it's holding it like this. - Oh, thank you. - [Lilly] Very cute. And then we had a few new YouTube members. Kim Martin is a new YouTube member. Yay! And then we got a super chat\nfrom Deb Summers for $4.99. And Deb says, \"I really appreciate\nall of your instructions. \"I never miss Wednesdays and\nFridays with Fat Quarter Shop.\" - Thank you. So on Wednesdays, we have another channel, it's called Fat Quarter Shop Flosstube. And so definitely subscribe over there. And that's just all cross stitch. So, but some people I think watch just to hear my commentary. I will tell you a funny story. Sunday, so I got up super early. So I'll tell you this whole story. So Kevin's birthday was\nFriday, so we went to dinner. Oh my goodness, I thought I was going\nto have a heart attack. We went to this restaurant, I've only been once\nbefore at lunch by myself. So I thought, okay, this\nis just a nice restaurant. It's kind of farm to table,\nbut they have steaks. So that's Kevin's thing, he likes steaks. If we're going to have like, that's what he'll eat\non a special occasion. So anytime we've ever booked\nanything for like birthdays, we go steak for him. So and it's more of like a farm to table, so we went and there was\nzero social distancing and I about had a heart attack and I was like, we're\njust going to get in, we're going to get out. It was super uncomfortable,\nI was freaking out. Kevin thought it was fine. So he felt like they\nwere social distancing. I did not. That's okay. But if it was not his birthday,\nwe would have walked out. I can tell you that. Absolutely would have walked out, but it was his birthday, so I was like, I'm going\nto keep it together. I'm not gonna, you know, throw a fit. I did think about doing a review and just saying like, hey,\nnot social distancing, but then I thought, no, it's not worth it. I don't need to do that. So then Saturday, I worked\non Designer Mystery, and then I went with Kevin\nto two guitar stores. There's like some vintage\nguitar stores here. I did that. So when we came home, I still didn't finish Designer\nMystery, I stayed up forever. Well, Sunday morning, thankfully I got up and I was sewing and I was in my pajamas and my hair, I just throw my hair up. I don't even brush it. Hadn't brushed my teeth. I was like, whatever. And then Will came in my sewing room and he was like, \"Mom, somebody is here.\" And I was like, \"What?\" He's like, \"Mom, come, somebody's here.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" And it was a lady and\nPiggy had gotten out. So we have like a back gate and I guess with the wind\nor something, it opened. And they're building a\nhouse like next door kind of but behind me. It's hard to explain\n'cause it's a weird lot. And he was over there in that, like where they were doing construction. And so she was like, \"Oh, ma'am, you know, \"I don't want to wake you up,\nbut I know that it's your dog \"and he's at the construction site.\" So I'm in my pajamas. - [Lilly] Oh my God. - Will's in his pajamas. We're like run out there and Will had like gone\nto the wrong street. I was like, \"Will, she\nsaid the construction.\" So Will's like, I don't\neven know where he was. He didn't put his shoes on. I had on shoes with my pajamas and we had to get the dog\nhome and he was in so... I didn't even yell at him. I was just like, please come home. So I don't know. And I don't think my boys opened the gate because they hadn't gone. When they walk, sometimes they'll\ncome in through that gate. They hadn't done that. So thankfully she came\nto the house and told me, but oh my goodness, that dog. And he was like, when I try to get him, I mean, it's this weird\nlot, so it goes way up. So he had gone like way up and then there was all these ditches and he was like getting in and out of 'em. I was like, dog, just come home please. Poor thing, he'd probably\nbeen out for a long time. Poor thing. - [Lilly] Getting to\nknow the neighborhood. - I'm like, I don't\nknow what he was doing. I mean, I think he was just exploring, but I was like if I have to go\nup that hill in these pajamas and I was sweating, trying to, you know, just running to get him. Oh my goodness. It was quite the... But luckily the lady\nknew that it was our dog. So I was so grateful. I think he would have come home, but I don't know how\nlong we would have taken to know that he was gone. - [Lilly] All right,\ncouple new YouTube members. Kim Hewitt. Welcome, Kim. - Thank you. - [Lilly] Another new YouTube\nmember, Valerie Nowski. Welcome, Valerie. And then we got a super chat\nfrom Amy Johnson for $49.99. - Thank you! - [Lilly] And she put, yeah, that's huge, thank you so much. And Amy put a heart and it's\nnot in motion for me right now so I will act this out later for Kimberly when I see it a little better. - Okay. - [Lilly] And then two\nmore new YouTube members. Darlene Wolf. Welcome, Darlene. And Robin Williams. Welcome, Robin Williams. - Thank you. - [Lilly] Question from Teresa. Are there any plans to sell other binders like the Sewcialites one? - Yeah. We're probably going to do that for going forward for our charity quilts and our spree sew alongs. Our charity quilt this year\ndoes not have a binder, but starting in 2022, it probably will. And then Lori is doing them now with every fabric collection. So I believe her first one\nstarts with Flea Market. Yeah, so we'll do a couple\nevery year, just a few. This one's super nice though. I mean, I was very nervous\nabout doing a binder just because you don't really\nknow what you're going to get with the paper product as much as you do with a fabric product because we're not in the\nbusiness of stationary. So we don't know as much\nabout it, but it's great. And I love it and it's been\ngreat taking it home and back and I can always find it,\nthat's the good thing, because I have a lot going\non in my sewing room. And I did clean it. I took a picture of Will. He won't let me show you though. Last week when I did\nDesigner Mystery, I used, the pattern is written to use the Eleanor Burns\nFlying Geese Ruler. And so you have to draw the lines. So I have this ruler, so he\nfor 45 minutes drew lines. And he told me I couldn't\nshow his picture. - [Lilly] Susanna Solano. \"Is it better to iron\ntowards the dark or middle?\" - It depends. If you don't want to press open, press to where there is\nthe least resistance. So if you lay, like if you\njust throw your piece down, it'll usually flop one way. And that way is the way I would press. - [Lilly] Okay, and from Morgan M. \"Question, how do you get\nyour points to come out? \"I'm struggling to get mine to come out.\" - So my points today were horrible, but normally for accuracy,\nI do the starching method. I learned that method from\nLisa Bongean of Stitch. So she's with the Primitive Gatherings and she has a new channel called Stitch. I learned it from her, but starching, setting\nmy seams before I press to one side or open, and pinning. - [Lilly] And from Stephanie Ward, \"What is going on with\nthe Scott Peterson case? \"I keep seeing his name\nin the news again.\" - Okay, so Scott Peterson was convicted of killing his wife Lacey\nand his unborn son Connor in like 2005 or 2007,\nsometime around there. There was a juror, her last name is Nice. And she was called during the trial, she was called strawberry shortcake because she had pink hair. And she did write a book afterwards, so you could read that book. But when she was giving\nher jury form, on the form, it said, \"Have you ever\nbeen part of a lawsuit?\" She said no. Scott's defense attorneys have gone in and she had filed a\ndomestic violence report against like a boyfriend's\nex-girlfriend or something. So she considered that,\ntrying to be all legal here. She considered that as just a, you know, filing something with\nthe court, not a lawsuit. So they're saying, it\nwent to the Supreme Court, and they're saying that she\nshould have disclosed that. But if you go back and\nyou watch that trial, Mark Geragos wanted her on that trial. And he did everything he\ncould to get her on that jury. Now ask yourself, why did he do that? Maybe he knew, and maybe he knew that\nlater they would appeal it because his firm is representing him. He is in trial today and it's going to be a\nfive minute proceeding. And it's basically going\nto be he's going to be able to pick if he wants to have\na state appointed attorney or if he wants to use the Geragos team, which rumor is he's going\nto use the Geragos team, which he's an amazing lawyer. But what is in question is\nnot his guilt or innocence. What is in question is the death penalty. So he is trying to get the\ndeath penalty taken off for killing his child and his wife is what he was convicted of. So he will not get out of jail. It is just to see if he\ncan get life in prison instead of the death penalty. So there's my legal analysis of today. - [Lilly] Is that the question\nyou thought I was gonna ask? - There's a couple more, but\nyeah, there's a lot going on. Ghislaine Maxwell. She had fought to keep\nher depositions private. They came out yesterday, it's 465 pages. I've listened to a lot of people on them. She has a great lawyer, I'll say that. She didn't answer any questions. And she got away with not\nanswering any questions and I guess that's what you get when you have a lot of money. - [Lilly] All right, and\nthen we had a funny comment from Lisa Clark. She said, \"Piggy's big adventure. \"LOL, love it.\" - Oh, I know, oh my goodness. So I'm thinking about\nactually on that back gate, maybe putting like something on there. So I talked to Kevin about it and he was like, yeah, I'll look. 'Cause Kevin was like, how did he get out? I was like, oh, poor thing. I mean, he doesn't usually get out. So it was more just a cluster mess of if I have to go up that\nhill, I'mma fall down. I'm very clumsy and it's like a steep, like the lot is weird. It just goes from like\nnothing, goes way up. So I was like, I don't know how I'm gonna\nget up there to get him. But he came, I just\nsaid, \"Piggy, come on.\" And he came. Luckily, after he went through a ditch and I was like, you're going\nto break your leg, dog. 'Cause they have like a big ditch. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, so after I finished\nDesigner Mystery, that was Sunday, I had a lot of leftover fabrics. So I'm going to preface this\nwith this is what I made with my leftover fabrics\nfrom Designer Mystery. You might have enough, you might not if you sign up for Designer\nMystery, but this is fun. I did this on Tuesday. And it only took me an hour. Everything. Not the starching, but\neverything else took me an hour. To cut it out, everything. So Lori's brand new book is\ncalled \"Prim and Proper\". And last week I showed you all this beautiful pillow right here. And I was thinking, oh my\ngoodness, that would match. Since I'm going to put\nmy Designer Mystery quilt in my bedroom, that would\nbe great for my new chair. So I took my leftovers and I made this. So this is the pillow top. It took one hour. Everything here was leftover. And one tip that I will give you is when you add the outside borders,\nyou see how perfect it is? I cut them 1/4 inch, bigger,\nadded them, trimmed down. So that's how this comes out so nicely is I just made these four bigger. And then I didn't, this is definitely not\nleftover from Designer Mystery. I just had this. This is the same collection. But I wanted my backing\nto be kind of a white, but I didn't have enough leftover, so this is what I'm going with. Instructions for the envelope\nback are in the book. And I put a top stitch, can you zoom in? I just did like a really fat top stitch, just so there would be like a nice stitch when you put it, there you go. Can you see it? See, I matched my fabric so good. My thread. So I used an RFL red, did a top stitch. And I'm sending this to Gina today. And so what she'll do is\nshe'll do the envelope back like this after she quilts this. And then she's going to put my binding on, which is this, and this is leftover. So everything here is leftover. This, you will not have\nenough for backing, I can tell you that right now. Normally I would have done\nthis fabric on the back, but I didn't have enough. So this is kind of another\nexample of I got this new book. Oh my gosh, it's so cute. Look how good it looks in Fig Tree. So that was fun, I made this on Tuesday. Let me know if y'all have any questions. This is the Strawberries\nand Rhubarb collection that is shipping in 2021. - [Lilly] It's an excellent\nname for a fabric collection. - Yes. - [Lilly] I like saying rhubarb, rhubarb. - I've never even had that. - [Lilly] I haven't either,\nit's just a nice word. - I didn't know it was a food\nuntil like it was in a fabric. I think it's like, you can\nuse it in a jelly, right? - [Lilly] I think so. - Yeah, I don't think I've ever had it, but I don't think it's grown\nin Texas, so that's why. I don't think they grow it\nhere, so I think that's why. So yeah, I'm going to\nsend this to Gina today. I'm so excited. - [Lilly] We have a new YouTube\nmember that just joined us. Muck Mack. Welcome, Muck Mack. - Thank you. Okay, so today we also have a Martingale trunk show to show you, I'm going to take a quick little break so she can do her little, she's going to do like live emojis. - [Lilly] Oh my gosh. - Okay, but first I have to find my mask before I leave to go to the bathroom. Oh my goodness, this happens every time. I need, oh, there it is. I thought about getting\nlike a little, okay, this is what I was thinking about. We have these new like little clippers. Not clippers, they're for\nyour scissors, they're tags. - [Lilly] Scissor ID magnetic clips. - Scissor ID magnetic clips. So this is what I'm thinking of doing. - [Lilly] Oh, sorry. - Is doing this so that it's always there because I can never find my mask. So that is what I'm going to be doing. Or put it on my little, hook it here. See?\n- So fancy. - And then your mask,\nyou can always find it. It's always in the same spot because I'm having a hard\ntime keeping up with my mask. So this is what I'm going to do with this. - [Lilly] Just careful with the magnet if you put your phone in\nyour pocket close to it. - Oh, okay. - [Lilly] Or credit cards. - Oh, okay. But I can put it right here. - [Lilly] Yes. - Okay, so I'm going\nto go to the bathroom. She's going to do some little emojis and show you her fabric. And I'll be right back. But I don't know where I put my shoes. Oh, I put my shoes over here. - [Lilly] Oh yeah, they'll be over there. - All right, okay, my shoes. (humming) - Quilting intermission time. Hello, everyone. Give me one second to\nget myself situated here. My name is Lilly. If you haven't met me already, I am the videographer here\nat the Fat Quarter Shop. And this tall pile of stuff is my projects for Journey to Nebula. Journey to Nebula, if you do not know, is a skill builder series\nhosted by Jaybird Quilts, leading up to a Block of\nthe Month called Nebula, which is being done by Tula\nPink and Jaybird next year. We have spots available\nfor that Block of the Month at Fat Quarter Shop if you're interested. But this is the progress of my\njourney to getting to Nebula. So I'm going to show you guys what I finished this last week. This is my Jawbreaker pillow. (hums) And I'm going to go to top camera to show you guys some detail here. Okay, so I am using the\nLiana fabric collection by Kimberly Kight of Ruby Star Society. And in this one, I did some\nbasic quilting around here, just like straight lines\nin the darker area, so it's not as easily seen, but I tried my hand at a\nlittle free motion quilting on my little sewing machine at home. And they're just like\nswirlies, they're not perfect, but I've always wanted to\nget into free motion quilting so I thought I'd try a little bit. So that was my project that I finished this\npast weekend, Jawbreaker. And then just to show\nyou what's been going on, this was my Seaside table runner. It was the first project we did as part of the Journey to Nebula. These are all made from\nthe same fabric collection so they're all going to kind\nof match around my house and it's going to be real nice. I originally did it with the intention of picking kind of fall autumny colors, but my idea of calm and fall and autumn is still pretty busy fabrics. And I think that's just\npart of my personality. Here, we have Lucky Charm, which I finished a couple of weeks ago. Another pillow, this\none's nice and fluffy. I think this one was a little bit tighter than the Jawbreaker one so\nthat's why it's sticking up more. And then for this week, we've been working on\npiecing for Rock Candy. And Rock Candy actually uses\nthe Sidekick ruler right here. And I haven't pieced it yet. I've started to, there's\na little chunks that are, rows that are pieced here. I realized I started piecing the rows not according to the pattern, but I think it's going\nto work out just fine. And this is my layout for the rest of it. That's what it'll kind\nof look like at the end. And then I also have the Hex N More ruler just because we've been using it for some of the other patterns, like the Lucky Charm and\nthe Jawbreaker pillow that I showed you guys. So that's been my Journey\nto Nebula thus far. And emoji that I forget who sent it, feel free to let me know who sent it, but it's this little zombie\nand it's on the YouTube side 'cause it was the super chat,\nbut she's going like (gasps). But then her like hair goes into a heart, which I have very short\nhair, first of all. But second of all, I don't\nthink I could make it go into a heart even if I tried right now. And let's see, from Barbara De La Ray, she says, \"Lilly, what foot did you use \"for your free motion quilting?\" So my machine, I have\na Burnett B38 at home and it came with a little,\nlike the round foot. I don't remember what it's called, but it's the round foot,\nit has a spring on it, and it's the only free motion\nfoot that it came with, so I just used that. And Benita Nan says, \"Do you find the rulers are easy to use?\" I do, actually. I was a little concerned\nbecause I am spoiled by using Creative Grids rulers. And these don't have the\nlittle grippies on the back so I was worried they were\ngoing to slide around, but it's been absolutely fine. They're great. They're easy to follow. And I didn't realize until\nI started doing this so long that there's so much versatility in everything you can do with them and even things that you\ncan kind of come up with on your own using them. And I think Lori Holt\nsays it looks awesome. Thank you, Lori. And none of these patterns have Y seams, I see a few of you asking about them. That's the beauty of it,\nit's all in how you piece it. And let's see, Kathy Crackers is asking, \"I have my rulers and patterns\nand just need to start. \"How long from cutting to\nend does each project take?\" Three to four hours to piece the top. To cutting to piecing the top, maybe a little bit longer\nfor the table runner. It took a little longer,\n'cause it's longer, it's got more fabric in it. But yeah, it doesn't take that long. It's nice that they're\nlike smaller projects and we've been doing one every other week so it's a lot more manageable than just trying to do them all in one go. I will be honest though, this past week I worked on Jawbreaker and the Rock Candy one\nbecause I was falling behind and that wasn't even\ntoo overwhelming at all. Oh, maybe it is a darning foot. - [Kimberly] They're\nasking when you quilted what foot you used. - Yeah, it was like that free motion foot that I was telling y'all about. I think it's called a darning\nfoot or a hopping foot. Yeah, it's the one that\nhas like the little circle. But yes, that is what I have been up to on the quilting side. There's also a couple of projects Kimberly's showing later on that I've been working on as well, that were kind of hush hush\ntop secret for a little bit. And the last thing I just want to do, I want to give my mom a shout out because she gave me pretty much the whole outfit I'm wearing. She gave me this shirt and\nthen she gave me the skirt and these both used to be hers. And one day I told her I liked them and she was like, \"Do you want them?\" And I'm like, \"Mom, just\nbecause I say I like it \"doesn't mean I want\nit,\" but I did want it. And she knew that, so she\ngifted them to me very recently. So thank you, Mom. And yes, let me put my mask back on and I will let Kimberly come back up here. (humming) Intermission is over. - Thank you, Lilly. It's so complicated. I was looking and we have\ndifferent things back there and there's like one screen,\nthey're all three different and so I don't understand the difference. I was trying to figure out. I wanted to let you guys\nknow that Barb and Mary of Me and My Sister have a brand new book. It's published by Martingale. It's called \"Third Time's A Charm Again\". I'm going to flip through it. We do have a coupon for this book. So these are all the\nquilts that are in it. And I'm just going to flip\nthrough all the pages. And I'm going to show\nthem to you in person. So this is Valerie. These are all Charm Pack friendly. And they are showing you\ndifferent Moda collections. So this is that same quilt\nin Catalina by Fig Tree and Safari Life by Stacy Iest Hsu. The coupon is 20% off. The coupon code is CharmBook. This one is Whitney. And I'm going to show you all the quilts, but I like to show you\nthe inside of the book so you can see what you're\ngoing to really get. Xena. And they give you different color options. Yolanda. Zelda. And if you notice in their books, they go in alphabetical order. The names are in alphabetical order, so that's how they do it. It took me a while to figure out. - [Lilly] I had not noticed that. - [Kimberly] Exclamation Point. And Question Mark. So you can see it goes V, Y, X, Y, Z, Exclamation Point, Question Mark. So I'm gonna show you the quilts. So the coupon code again is CharmBook. 20% off through Monday. Sorry, I'm trying to move some stuff. Oh, there's the coupon code. So what's nice about these is they're very beginner friendly. They're Charm Pack friendly, so everyone has a Charm\nPack in their house, so this is something you can\nthrow together in a weekend. This is one of their older prints. You can tell that this is the colors they used to design with. And I believe this is\na Moda Essential Dot. And then this is the\nSafari Life collection with that quilt by Stacy Iest Hsu. And some of these\ncollections are now sold out but I think it's great in the book that they show them to you so that you can get different ideas. And this one, the way they quilted it- - [Lilly] Hang on, let's\ngo to the top camera 'cause front camera, sorry,\ntop camera went all crazy. - Okay. I don't know what that\nroom was you just showed. - [Lilly] That's our film room. - Oh, don't show it again. - [Lilly] No, yeah. - So what they did when\nthey quilted this was they, what do you call that? Stitched in the ditch around the plus sign and then did custom quilting out here. I'll just show them to the\nfront camera, it's fine. - [Lilly] Yeah, let me try to fix. - We're having technical difficulties. - [Lilly] Yeah. - All the live streams\nI've watched this week have had different technical difficulties. - [Lilly] It's Mercury, I'm telling you. - (laughs) And so this is Fig Tree. And okay, I do want to show this. What Barb and Mary do\nis they actually write after it's quilted with a Pigma pen, it says Me and My Sister Designs. That's how they label it is\nliterally with a Pigma pen because you can't take that off. It's permanent pen. - [Lilly] I think we're\ngood with top camera now. - [Kimberly] Okay, so I'll\nshow you the, where'd it go? Oh, there it is. See how they do it? And you can tell they do it after, 'cause it's right by the binding. So if it ever gets stolen,\nit's there, it won't come out because it's permanent. Here's the next quilt in the book. So this I believe is, all of these collections\nare listed in the book. This is definitely Zen Chic. And this one is also custom quilted. Each of the little\nrectangles has like a rainbow and then there's bubbles. So these are all custom quilted. All the quilts in the\nbook are custom quilted by Sharon Elsberry of Akamai\nQuilts, A-K-A-M-A-I Quilts. This is beautiful, this is a feather. So this is a feather that's custom because you can see the feather here and then the start and the, well, not the start and stops, but the custom. And this one has a little border. This is the backing. So I think this is Rue\n1800 by Three Sisters. And then this is the Me\nand My Sister Collection. - [Lilly] Back Porch. - [Kimberly] Back Porch. And this one's also custom quilted. See how it's custom? And then this is all custom. That's pretty cool. And so this is a brand new book. Let's see, okay, this one's bigger. (hums) And the quilting on this is, I love it. You see the little daisy? - [Lilly] Oh my goodness. - [Kimberly] Yeah, so this is Xena. Or how do you say that, Xena? - [Lilly] I think it's Xena. - Yeah, Xena.\n- Like the warrior princess. - [Kimberly] Yeah, so this\none's a little bit bigger. It's 38 by 38. What did you just say? Warrior princess? What is that? - [Lilly] It says it in their book, but Xena I think is a character\nthat is a warrior princess. - [Kimberly] I don't know who Xena is. (laughs) I am so out of date with that. Is it a Disney? - [Lilly] No, it's a television series. - [Kimberly] Oh. This quilting is amazing. And this is Kansas Troubles\nQuilters, Milestones, and stitch in the ditch\nand custom quilting. And let's see what they put on the back. Same color, but different\nprints on the binding. This is... I love this one. This is Canning Day. Look at that custom quilting. I don't know how you do that. Oh, and see, their signature? It's so pretty. And this one's 38 by 38. I should make one of these this weekend with some leftover fabric. I feel like I just show stuff and then the next week I come\nback with the same stuff, because I like it so much, I can't stop. This one is Yolanda. And this one is Urban Farmhouse\nby Primitive Gatherings. And so you can see there's\na lot of custom quilting. And this one, she mixed wovens. Oh no, this is not wovens. Is it? I don't know if that's woven or not. I should know, but I don't. That's what my head was thinking. I'm not sure. There's the back. And then Sugar Creek by Corey Yoder. I love this collection. I still have a little layer\ncake of it that I'm hoarding. I love this collection. And this is a Bella Solid. The quilting on these are amazing. So for all of you that\ndon't want to sew a label in the back of your quilt,\nyou can just draw it. This is Ombre Confetti. Let me see where they... So you can see how it ombres. It literally goes from dark to light and they did a scrappy binding. - [Lilly] That's really cute. - Mm-hmm. Well, of course you would like it. So they probably planned it\nwhere they cut different parts of the fabric, but it's Charm\nPack friendly, so maybe not. But that's really nice. They're getting bigger. This one is Zelda. I'm getting confused on the name, sorry. Zelda Finnegan. They all sound the same to me, so that's why I'm getting confused. So there's a custom flower here. So you can see the custom flowers. This is Finnegan by Brenda Riddle. Goldenrod by One Canoe Two. If you've never been to her website, you should go because\nthey have awesome planners and paper products. I'm a sucker for paper\nproducts and booklets. So the quilting is amazing. This one is rectangular, it's 34 by 42. This one is Ticklish. Super cute. So she did like different,\nlet me show you. So you can see this is\ndifferent rows of quilting. So that's a row, that's a row. It's all different. Each row is different on the quilting. I think that's pretty awesome. And then there's the backing. This one is Exclamation Point and this fabric is Scarlet\nand Sage by Fig Tree. I think this might have\nbeen part of the collection. I can't remember. Or if that's a Bella, it's really pretty. This one is 33 1/2 by 38. Bubble Pop. Nope, Ticklish by Me and My Sister. So look at this one on the front camera so you can see the design better. See how it does like a little? See, it like, yeah, with like it forms. How would you describe that? It forms an off, yeah, it's awesome. I would make this one. - [Lilly] It's like echoed. - There you go, echoed. And then the next one is American Chain. Bubble Pop. And you can see all the custom quilting. Oh my goodness. She did amazing on these quilts. And then this is the last\none, it's the biggest one. It's 36 by 44. I think it's the biggest one. The blocks are eight inches finished. This is Abby Rose by Robin Pickens. This quilting is so pretty. And you can see that\nThatched is also used. So this is the basic of Robin Pickens. Think it's Thatched. Maybe it's part of the collection. I think I'm wrong on that. Ignore me, that was not right. This one is Linzee McCray Flour Garden, and this collection was super popular and there's another collection\ncoming out this December that's the same color way. So you could mix, if you\nwanted to make it bigger, you could use the newer\ncollection with this. So fun to show all of these quilts. I don't know how we're going to get them off the table though. - [Lilly] Oh, I got them. - [Kimberly] We're going to scoot 'em. - [Lilly] Scoot 'em off. - [Kimberly] Scoot 'em off. So it's kind of like a modified pinwheel, but you can see from this that you can do a lot with Charm Packs. I have Charm Packs everywhere. Or you could use your scraps\nthat I've been showing you, the Lori Holt method where\nyou pull from your bin. So that is the quilts. - I got the-\n- I got it. There we go. So again, it's \"Third\nTime's a Charm Again\". I think this is the fourth in the series and the code is CharmBook. So... Let me know if y'all\nhave questions on that before I show you the next one. - [Lilly] From Pam Jordan. \"Are they all small baby quilt size?\" - Yes, I would say so, wouldn't you? - [Lilly] Yeah, they're\nall about 30 something to 30 something square, about-ish. And okay, Pamela had the same question. - Yeah, they're all pretty small. Of course you could do two Charm Packs or three Charm Packs and make 'em bigger. So let's see, these all use\none Charm Pack, I believe, and so that's why they're all small. But if you wanted to, you could easily make any of these bigger because they're all set\nthis way and this way. There's nothing funny in terms\nof there's nothing on point. So you could just add\nmore rows, more columns. - [Lilly] From Irack Hunt. \"Hey, could you say happy\nbirthday to my daughter, \"Shesack Hunt? \"She has recently gone into quilting \"and is a big fan of yours.\" - Yay, happy birthday! - [Lilly] Happy birthday, Shesack. Let me know if I mispronounce the name and I can say it correctly. - And I'm going to pull this stool up because my back is hurting a little bit. - [Lilly] Okay, go for it, yes. Oh, Cathy Longo, when I was\ndoing Journey to Nebula, was asking me which\nproject I enjoyed the best. I have to say Jawbreaker, which was last week's project,\nlast two weeks project, because that one came together\nand just looks so intricate with very minimal effort. And my family saw it and they\nwere like, this is so cool. How did you do this? I'm like, it's actually really easy. - Just say it's magic. - [Lilly] It's magic,\nthe magic of quilting. Okay. And Fiber Fairy says \"I\nhave a pressing question \"for the Sewcialites block Wisdom. \"I want to add it to my current quilt, \"but it needs to be 10 inches. \"How do I adjust it so that\nit can be that size block?\" - Okay, so if you want it\n10 inches, it needs to be... Let me look at the block first, Wisdom. So you need it to be divisible by, okay, 10 divided by three is 3.33, right? So that won't work. So it won't work because you need, so you have three equal sections. Can you show the front? I mean, the top? So like this is a section,\na section, a section. So you have three sections. Or actually I could just show the block. Of course it will be the\none that I can't find. Oh, there it is. These are equal sections, so you need it to be divisible by three. So you said 10? - [Lilly] Yes. - [Kimberly] So it wouldn't work by 10 'cause 10 divided by three is 3.33. - [Lilly] It'd be a little smaller. - [Kimberly] So unless\nyou can figure out how to make a 3 1/3 on all this,\nwhich is probably not possible, but you could do 3 1/2\nplus 3 1/2 plus 3 1/2, which would give you nine. You could do four, four, four, uncut, which would give you 11. So if you wanted to do 11, these could be finished at four inches, unfinished four inches. - [Lilly] Question 'cause I am curious, would it be ridiculous to just add a little 1/2\ninch border all around it? - No, it's just that you will have, if you do 1/2 inch, yeah, you could. It just would be hard\nwhen you start sewing it to the next block because your seams, you're going to have like\nthree seams altogether would be my concern. I would do it on a smaller block just because then you're going\nto have so much right there, you're not going to. - [Lilly] Okay. And from Shyla Ham, are all the quilts just shown in the book? - Yes, everything's in the book. And the collection names\nare all in the book and they all use one Charm Pack and they all use Moda fabrics. - [Lilly] And let's see, we have a few super chats\nthat have been coming in. We got one from Nancy Lane for $19.99. Nancy Lane says, \"Thank you,\nKimberly and Fat Quarter Shop. \"You are such a sewing inspiration to me.\" - Thank you.\n- With a bunch of little of scissors emojis. - And don't forget, next week\nit's going to be Thursday. And next week, the block is hard. So maybe I'll reward\nmyself with a hot chocolate before I start. - [Lilly] Hot chocolate sounds nice. And then we had a super chat\nfrom Michelle Moore for $4.99. Thank you, Michelle.\n- Thank you. - [Lilly] And then, oh,\nour last super chat here for the moment is from\nMr. Domestic for $2.99. - Oh, hi, Matthew. - [Lilly] Hello. And he put a little pear, it's very cute. - So also new for Martingale\nis a brand new monthly planner by Sherri McConnell. I'm going to flip through it so you can see how detailed it is. Now, Sherri is very into planning. If you know anything about\nSherri and her daughter, they love to do planners. So I know that she has worked on this for several years with Martingale and it's called \"A Quilting\nLife Monthly Planner\" because her company is\ncalled A Quilting Life. And there's lots of\ndifferent sections in here. It's very detailed. I've already gone through this, but if you are a planner, this is great. This is like your table of contents. This is your introduction. The first section is to dos and it starts with your current WIPs. And basically you can\nwrite down block names or different sections that\nyou want to group it up into, and then you can check\nit off as you finish. So this is kind of a way,\nif you want to break down, you could either do each\nquilt is its own thing or you could do each block, or\nif you're doing Sewcialites, you could put the Sewcialite block name. And then this section\nis for long-term WIPs. So if it's something, you know, like my quilt I'm never\ngoing to finish for Will, the Harry Potter quilt, that\nwould go in the section. (laughs) I have to finish it for Christmas. This is my bucket list, so these are things that you\nmight want to do in the future. This section records your\npatterns, rulers, and notions. And so it's got your pattern inventory. You can put the pattern\nname, where you have it. If you don't want to\nput where you have it, location of pattern, let's see. So this is like the book name. And then this is your ruler inventory. So if you were a new quilter\nand you weren't, you know, you could write down your rulers. And then when you went to the store, to your local needlework store, you could say, oh, okay, yes,\nI have it or no, I don't. And then this is like, you\nhave it or you need it. This is your specialty notion section. Like it says 10 inch design\nboards from Farm Girl Vintage. You can put your notes. And then she also has like\nquantity, like if you have 30. So it's great because it\nshows you how to use it. This is your goal section. She gives you 20 steps to\nan organized sewing space. And she's going to talk a lot about this on her YouTube channel and her blog. So you can look her up at A Quilting Life. These are all organization. And then these are different things that you could take from here. Take some of her ideas and okay, which one of these would you like to do? Or which ideas did you already have? List them out. You could even put, one of the things I like\nto do is put a date. I could put a goal date. That's probably what I would do. Simplify your storage. Scrap management. So for example, I've been\nsewing my scraps into 2 1/2, 3 1/2, 4 1/2, 5 1/2,\nand 6 1/2 inch squares. You could put that in there. Talk about how you're going to do it and how much time you're\ngoing to devote to it. And also give some definition\nof some basic pre-cuts. And this is like your progress charts. So again, this has a\ndate and your results. You could write down how\nmany squares you have and then that way you would know how many squares of each size. That's probably something I need to do. You could do a monthly top three goals. And the great thing about this\nis you can start any time. You can start December, January, you fill it in yourself and\nyou give yourself goals. Setting goals. I always have goals, so\nthis is very helpful. These are gifts that you're going to make, and you could even put the occasion of what you're making it for. And here's some charity,\nthe section for charity. Here's your planning section. It talks about how to use the section. And these are different ways,\ndifferent goals you can set. And the month at the top,\nbecause this goes, yeah, with the other, the summary. So lots of sections on planning. This will help you stay on track and not get behind like I do sometimes. So there's a lot for this. And then this is your quarterly planner. So this could be your monthly,\nthis might be quarterly. So more of a long-term plan. This is your project planner. And this is the section I like the best because for each section, you\ncan write down what you need and then you can put you\nhave it or you need it. So you could write down\neverything you need and it'll keep you on track\nof getting everything, all your supplies together that you need. So this is gathering your supplies. This is what you need to work on next. And this is notes. So this is more of a\nmicro per project planner, which I guess would be a project planner, but yeah, per project. So there's lots, and you\nwould, if you got this, you wouldn't have to use all the sections. You could pick and choose\nwhat works best for you. Lists and locations. So these are shopping lists, so these are different\nthings that maybe you want to be looking for on\nFat Quarter Shop site, or, you know, I need 20 Fat\nQuarters or 10 Charm Packs. And this you can also use with, over here, if you put it on your shopping list, once you get it, you can\ncheck it off that you have it. I like that she has a big shopping list. And then this is great\nbecause this is a way to keep track of your different precuts so you know what you have. So you could list any type of precut. They're all defined here and you can have an inventory list and you could even add designer, so then you would know what\nyou have from each size. This is a great thing, because this is if you want to display your\nquilts in your house, like I do, you can put your item,\nwhere you've stored it, and where you want to\nplace it for decoration. So I definitely need this section. Inspiration. She's giving you non-fiction\nbooks, quilting books. She's giving you a list of\nbooks that you want or have. So you can have a list also\nof your book inventory, as well as your pattern. You can keep track of your\nfavorite social media sites. You can also keep a list of hashtags. And here's some more information. This is sewing space considerations, Sherri's favorite tools and notions. And so she gives you\nwhat she uses the most, her favorite specialty notions and what tips you want to write down that maybe you want to come back to later. And that is Sherri. So this is brand new. It is $18.99 and it's 128 pages. So I wanted to show you guys that. So if you're a planner, you can plan. I'm a planner. - [Lilly] We have a comment\nfrom Charlotte Shirko. They say, \"Lilly, would you\nplease let Kimberly know \"that I am very grateful\nfor the live tutorials. \"I am new to quilting\nand she is so helpful. \"Thank you for all you do.\" - Oh, thank you. - [Lilly] And then we have\na question from Rita L about the live stream next week. \"Will it be live on Thursday \"or recorded and shown on Friday?\" - Live Thursday. We are going to prerecord some that will be towards the end of the year for like Black Friday, Christmas time. But this week, we'll be live Thursday. Some in the future will be prerecorded due to like people want to take off work, or I want to be with my\nfamily, that kind of thing. But we do try to be live when we can. I'm a little bit nervous\nabout next week's. Oh my gosh, have you seen the block? It's got a lot of pieces. - [Lilly] And then we had a super chat from Princess Pea Holly Martin for $5. And Princess Pea says, \"Thank you for all you\ndo, Fat Quarter Shop.\" - Thank you. - [Lilly] Thank you, Holly Martin. - Yes. - [Lilly] And then we\ngot another super chat from Raddie Catlin for $0.99. And they put a little emoji\nthat looks like it's the beach with an umbrella. - Oh, thank you. - [Lilly] Relaxation time. And new YouTube member, Christina P. Welcome, Christina. - Thank you. I wanted to also show you\nguys, we have a brand new book that Sarah has been working on like crazy. It's called \"Jolly Bar Book Three\". So a Jolly Bar is a five by\n10 inch precut that we sell. It's obviously named after\nJolly, Kimberly Jolly, Jolly Bar. Five by 10. It's basically half of a Layer Cake or double of a Charm Pack. So this is our third book in the series. It is only $9.95. If you pre-order for\nthis to ship in February, you even get 10% off,\nso it's a great deal. What we love about these books\nare they are very inexpensive and you get a lot of bang for your buck. So you can see all 20 quilts. These are all quilts that\nwere previously in Jolly Bars because every Jolly Bar\ncomes with a free pattern. And I'm super excited about this one. There's the cover. And so super exciting. So everything is there. We would hope that you\nwould pre-order that. I'm very excited about it. And we are going to have\na sew along with it. The sew along is going to\nbe a table runner this time, which is super exciting. So it will be... And it will have a piece backing, but the great thing is it'll be smaller. Because some of the last\nones have been kind of big, so we went a little bit smaller this time. Okay, so I'm going to show\nyou something else new. It's over here though. - [Lilly] Oh, sorry. - That's okay. I don't know what I did\nwith the other one though. Did I leave it on my? - [Lilly] Are you still wearing it for- - I don't know, I took it off. Oh, here it is, it's in my hand. Paper. So we have these new scissor\nID paper, scissor ID tags, and they're a way to label your scissors so that they don't get mixed up. So you can label thread scissors, fabric scissors, and paper scissors. So this was on... They are magnetic, so these go on paper. And so it's great for your\nhusbands and your children so they don't open your Amazon packages with your fabric scissors. Don't ask me how I know about that. But very inexpensive, cute little item. And it will also cuten up your sewing room because everybody likes cute. - [Lilly] Yeah. You should show the back of\nthe thing, it has a little- - Oh yeah, the image. So it has an image of\nfabric, thread, or scissors. So paper, fabric, thread. Okay, so we also came out with brand new foundation paper pads. So this is our fourth one. All of them come in six\ninch and 12 inch sizes. They are foundation paper piecing. We have Log Cabin,\nEconomy, Pineapple Block, and now Courthouse Steps. Lori and I have something\nsuper special planned for you. I'm going to be sewing\npart of it this weekend. And it will use all four of the pads and you can do either six inch or 12 inch. It is going to be a sew along next year. But I'm super excited about these papers. This is the one that\nI wanted to have made. They all have instructions here, and this is the quilt size guide. So if you wanted to know, you know, a crib, here's your\nsize, you need six by six. A large lap, 12 by 12. It tells you everything you need. And the paper's really nice and thin so that when you pull it\noff, it will come off nicely. And we have made some projects from it. I think Lilly made this. - [Lilly] Yeah. - [Kimberly] So this is made with the Deer Christmas Honey Bun. So she used the six inch size. Who quilted it? - [Lilly] Mike. - [Kimberly] Oh, Mike quilted it. So mylongarm.com quilted it. This pattern is included in the pads. So she did this one, the table runner. So she took it, it's two\nblocks by eight blocks. It's Honey Bun friendly for the six inch and Jelly Roll friendly for the 12 inch. She put mammoth flannel on the back. So that's super exciting. Lilly was busy. - [Lilly] Yeah. Like I said, top secret, couldn't talk about it for a little bit. - [Kimberly] And then this\none is also made by Lilly. This one is Ghouls and\nGoodies by Stacy Iest Hsu. And she just used four\nCourthouse Steps blocks and then she used some leftovers of the strips for her border. And one thing that Lilly does, that's different than what I\ndo, so I think it's awesome is she leaves her paper on the\nback till she's totally done. So she keeps it in, even when she's putting\nthe blocks together. So that's one thing\nthat's great about it is you can make your own. You can either take it off\nas you go or leave it on. And it gives you perfectly, what I like about the paper\nis when you trim at the end, it tells you where to trim\nand where not to trim. You get a perfectly square\nblock and it's not shrunk. Because sometimes when you do Log Cabins or Courthouse Steps, as\nyou build, you shrink. So that's super exciting. I'm going to show you all of\nthe others that we have also. It's so pretty. Are you going to quilt it or are you going to send it to Mike? - [Lilly] I'm debating that. I'm not sure. But I'm going to use it to hold, I don't think we'll be\ntrick-or-treaters this year, but to hold the candy bowl. - [Kimberly] Oh yeah, decorate. Yeah, I'm like, yeah,\nwe can have decoration. - [Lilly] Yeah. - [Kimberly] Let's see. Yeah, my neighborhood is doing some kind of like trunk or treat thing. But I'm not going to be here, so- - [Lilly] Oh, that's right. - [Kimberly] I get to miss it. - [Lilly] Get to miss it. - [Kimberly] I get to miss it. I'm not, Kevin is huge into Halloween. Anybody who works here\nknows, he loves Halloween. 'Cause we always have a\nlot of Halloween fabric because he can't stop buying it. So this is kind of an assortment of all of them that we have. And this will give you kind of a tease to what we're going to be doing. So I've actually done\npart of the quilt already, but we're not going to give\ndetails until about December. So I've been working on\nthat behind the scenes. And the Economy paper is\nactually by Lori Holt. And then I have one other\nthing to show you today. It is a quilt kit that came in stock. Sorry, we have a million things. It is the Pumpkins and Plaids quilt kit. It's actually featured\nin our newsletter today. And these come in, there you go. That's such a pretty picture. So it is Lori Holt fabric. Lori designed it. The pattern is exclusive and only available in the quilt kit. And it comes with a magnetic closure, so you can see it, it closes. It's just, there's a lot of fabric in it. So you can see it comes with the pattern, all of the fabric, and\neven has the rick rack that you can put in your binding, which is really nice\nthat it comes with that. So pretty. So of course it's all Lori Holt fabric. It's a mix of her Basics\nand her Farm Girl, the Basics, Farm Girl, not, yeah. I'm thinking Farm Girl Vintage. I'm trying to think of the\nname of the collection. Let's see. Yeah, it's all just different\ncollections from Lori. But I like this one, so I\nthought I would show it. And the outside of the box\nis inspired by the border. So that's where the outside comes from. - [Lilly] Think that border\nlooks like little presents. - Yeah. And you could use that too. You know, after you've finished the quilt, you can use this as decoration. You know, you could even\nput it in your family room. You could even just put it, I mean, it could just be a decoration. - [Lilly] All right, questions. Okay, Crafting a Planned Life was asking why I leave the paper on instead\nof taking it off like you. I find it helps me keep\naccuracy with the piecing 'cause then I just keep\nfollowing that 1/4 inch line on the paper. - Oh yeah, so you follow it out here. - [Lilly] Yeah. I follow it as I piece them together. - Oh, okay, as you piece\nthe blocks together. Oh, I see. Yeah, that makes sense. - [Lilly] Yeah, and it helps me, it gives me a little\nmore sense of security. And I also find that\nwhen I use these papers, other people were asking if I starch, I generally do, but not when\nI foundation paper piece. Not for any reason in particular, but I find it helps keep it stable so then I don't need to starch. - Saves time. - [Lilly] Saves time, yes. Lori Holt said, \"Autumn Love.\" - Autumn Love, yes. I'm like, there's a name. Sometimes I get her books and her fabric collections mixed up. And I publish her books so\nI should know the names, but with everything going on. I dunno, today I'm kind of in\na weird mood, I don't know. - [Lilly] It's Mercury, I'm telling you. - It's hard to, like, I don't know. It's hard to do these\nlive streams sometimes. I'm really hyper, so I don't know. - [Lilly] Okay, and from Lynette Briggs, \"This is my first chance to\nactually see Kimberly live. \"I want to thank you. \"Kimberly gave me enough\nconfidence to make my first quilt, \"the ultimate beginner's quilt.\" - Oh, awesome.\n- Awesome. You should share a picture\nwith us on our Facebook group, Kimberly's Stitch Squad. - Yes. - [Lilly] And a few people\nwere saying that it's good that Kevin doesn't stop\nbuying Halloween fabric and for him not to stop\nbuying Halloween fabric. - Yeah, well, sometimes I have\nto stop him 'cause it's bad. And I'm like we can't buy\nevery Halloween fabric. He loves Halloween though with the kids. I was like, they shouldn't, I mean, I really don't think\nthey should participate in this trunk or treat\nand he's like, \"We are.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, we are. \"You are 'cause I'm going\nto dance convention.\" Yeah, so yeah, I'm going\nto a dance convention. They released the schedule yesterday and all the rules and everything. And seems like it's\ngoing to be pretty safe because you have the option\nto do it in your hotel room. You can do that. And I'm like, well, that's great. But how are you going to\ndance in your hotel room? But some people are going to do it at home and then drive in if they compete. So not everybody will be there. Lot less studios are there. Usually it's like crazy amount of studios, so I can tell that they\ndefinitely have limited it. And then the ballrooms, they have like five\nballrooms instead of two. So yeah, I looked through everything, but I'm still confused. 'Cause I was like, \"Well, you need to\nhighlight all your dances.\" She was like, \"Oh, I don't know.\" She was like, \"I'll do it later.\" So I don't really know. And of course, none of\nthis stuff has the times. Or anything. So it's kind of one of those\nyou just kind of guess. - [Lilly] A few people are wondering, is there enough fabric in the kit, both on its own and if you starch? - Let me look. It looks like there is. I would kind of read through\nit first to make sure, but they give you 1/4 of a yard. And like the first one\nsays cut two strips 2 1/2 by width the fabric. So that would be five inches, so you would have four extra inches, so... I'm kind of one of those\npeople that if I need extra, I'll just buy extra if I run out. But it looks like you should have enough. Maybe not on the, I don't\nknow about the background. That would be the one that\nwould be the trickiest. - [Lilly] And then Sandra Ingstread says, \"Is the Pumpkins and Plaids\npattern available separately?\" - So it's not, it's only\navailable in the kit. And it says it on the back of the kit. Kit includes fabric for\nquilt top and binding, a spool of vintage trim,\nand the exclusive pattern that is only available in the kit. Now, some of the patterns\nthey rerelease later, they've released one after the fact, and they might be doing\nthat in the future. So guys, thanks for watching today. I hope you have a great weekend. Find some great stuff to watch on TV. And I'll be back next week on Thursday. - [Lilly] Bye, everyone.", "ABSNiljfemk": "(upbeat music) - If you've ever been in a quilt store, most likely you've been\nentranced by precuts. These nicely packaged gems,\ntempt you from across the store, flaunting their colours,\ntied up with bows and flair. However, as they begin\nto pile up in your stash, you're wondering if they're as special, as you think they are. Here are 10 facts you need to\nknow, especially the last one. So, stick with me and I'll\nshow you how to do it. (upbeat music) Hi, I'm Karen Brown of\nJust Get It Done Quilts. I give you tips, tricks and strategies to help you make the quilt\nthat you want to make. And if you like what you see, please hit that subscribe button. And I'd like to thank\ntoday's sponsor Skillshare. I don't know about you, but I find fat quarter\nbundles, quite mesmerising. Seriously, they are my kryptonite. But I rarely buy other sizes of precuts. So, back in February, I sent a question out in the\nSocialverse, asking quilters, \"What precuts do you buy and why?\" And then I took them all for a test drive. And here are the top 10\nthings that you need to know before you hit that buy button. First, just a little bit of background. Fat quarters have been\nwith us for a while, but the first jelly roll,\nonly appeared back in 2006. People were making quilts out\nof two and a half inch strips, but they had never actually packaged them together like that. And then came layer cakes. Moda was the first company, but the other manufacturers\nfollowed soon after. Quilting cotton is about 44 inches wide. And when you cut a yard in half, you get a piece 18 inches tall and we call that a half yard cut. If we cut the half yard cut\nin half, we get a fat quarter, which is 18 inches by approximately 22. And if we cut that in\nhalf, you get a fat eighth, which is 22 by nine. These three types of\ncuts are sold in bundles, with one piece from\neach fabric in the line. Each piece includes part of the selvage and all the edges are cut\nwith a straight knife. And the price changes on the bundle, depending on the number of\npieces within the bundle. For jelly rolls and honey\nbuns, fabric is folded in half and stacked on top of each other. So, the selvages are one side\nand the fold is on the other. Then, fabric is cut in strips\nof two and a half inches for jelly rolls and one and\na half inches for honey buns. There are 40 strips in every roll, but half rolls are available,\nso always check the quantity. Some, or all of the\nfabrics, may be repeated, depending on how many\nfabrics in the collection. All the edges are pinked. It includes two selvages\nand the price is the same across manufacturer and fabric type. With layer cakes, charm\npacks and mini charms, the fabric stacked again, but this time, from selvage to selvage. And then the fabric is die cut, into 10 inch squares for layer cakes, five inch squares for charms and two and a half inch\nsquares for mini charms. There are 40, or 42 squares,\ndepending on the manufacturer, but there's also half bundles. So be sure to check the quantity. Some, or all of the\nfabrics, can be repeated, depending on how many fabrics\nare in the collection. The edges are pinked. There are no selvages on these squares and the price is consistent across manufacturer and fabric type. There are other pre-packs\nlike hexagons, HST's, hearts, four inch squares and the Fat Quarter Shop has these things called jolly bars, but I'm not talking about those today. I'm just talking about the major ones. (upbeat music) There's definitely an ease in cutting. You don't have to manhandle yardage and try and fit it on your cutting board. It's all nice and simple and ready to go. And a lot of patterns that\nare designed for precut, don't have many cuts in them either. And this is especially good for people with accessibility or dexterity issues. And for many people, cutting\nis just not their thing. That's the part that they\nlike the least about quilting. So buying a precut is a fast and easy way. (upbeat music) They come all from the same fabric line. That means they coordinate. And for many quilters, one of the most stressful\npart of quilting, is colour. And then there's the challenge of finding coordinating patterns. Buying a precut bundle,\ngives you the confidence that everything will coordinate together with a unifying theme and colour harmony. (upbeat music) Precut bundles come in all\nsorts of different price points. So, you can buy a fabric\nline that you'd like that suits your budget. If you love a certain designer, or you love a certain fabric line, you can buy the whole line. You can add it to your stash, at the price that you\nare comfortable with. But there's also a cost to this, but I'll get to that in the last point. (upbeat music) When we're looking at fabric,\nwe need a crystal ball. We are trying to visualise\nthat future quilt pattern, so we'll know how much fabric to buy. When you buy precuts, you\ndon't need to worry about that. There are so many patterns\nout there for precuts. There are designers and companies, who have built their\nbusiness around precuts. Many are free. My very first quilt that I ever finished, was the jelly roll jam\nfrom Fat Quarter Shop. I personally have four\nvideos about stash busters and I'll put a link to\nthat down in the notes. I also caution you with all these, the free and the not-free patterns, to read the instructions first. Some patterns don't use all\nthe precuts, or the bundle. Some have you slicing and dicing so much, you might as well buy yardage. So always check the pattern first. (upbeat music) One of the frustrating\nparts of some precuts is this pinked edge. Different brands have\ndifferent sizes of pinking and you do not know where\nthe edge is supposed to be. It's supposed to be the inner\npart of that pinked edge, but that means I can't\nuse my sewing ledge, which means I might\nneed to trim the square, which negates the whole purpose of buying a precut to begin with. Quilters also complain about the accuracy of this pinked edge, in some bundles. So, always check it before you buy. This pinked edge also\nproduces a lot of lint. So make sure you clean your\nmachine after every use. (upbeat music) A fabric bundle gives\nyou at least one piece of every fabric in the line. The layer cakes, the jelly rolls, and the other ones,\nall give an assortment. And that depends on, one, how many pieces\nare in the layer cake? And two, how many pieces are in the line? I bought the layer cake for this beautiful, multicoloured\nfarm fabric on the top, but I only got one of those. When I laid out the line, I found out the one that they\nduplicated was the chicken wire. And I got a lot chicken wire. In this one, there's\n10 fabrics in the line. Therefore, every single one of\nthem has different multiples. I've got five of this one, I've got four of this one, I've got three of this one. So, look through the bundle first, so you know, how much of\neach fabric you're getting. (upbeat music) And the other disadvantage\nis, you do not get to choose the slice of the pattern that you want. So, it's not really a\nproblem for, you know, little stripes and little dots, but it becomes a problem\nwith the hero prints. So for this one, this\nCathy Dougherty print, these beautiful magpies,\nunfortunately I do not have one complete magpie frame that I can use. It would have been so much better, if this was just cut two inches larger. So you'll also have this\nproblem with the hero prints, when you move into layer\ncakes and charm packs, because the main part of that\nprint, may be off centre. Now, before I get to the last three tips, let me tell you about Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community that offers membership with meaning. With so much to explore\nand real projects to create with the support of fellow creatives, Skillshare empowers\nyou to learn that skill that you've always wanted to try.

(upbeat music) So many people complain about not being able to pre-wash their precuts. But honestly, why are you\nwanting to wash precuts, anyways? Precuts are all about fast and easy. Prewashing just slows you down. And the resulting shrinkage,\nwill most likely mean, your fabric is too small to\nuse with free cut pattern. If you must wash your\nprecuts for health reasons, put them in a mesh bag\nand lie them flat to dry. And then adjust your pattern accordingly. (upbeat music) When fabric is manufactured, the cross grain can often\nbe pulled out of shape. Now, having a perfect grain,\nis much less of an issue when sewing quilts, than sewing clothes. Especially, it's not something\nyou need to worry about when you're a beginner, or you're making a fast and easy pattern. When it does become an issue, is when your edges begin to fray and then you get these thread tufts. And if they are disturbed too much, they will pull right back\ninto your seam allowance and make your block too small. A pattern can also be printed off grain. And again, most often this\nis not going to be an issue with precuts, because your pieces are going to be pretty\nsmall in your quilt. Check, if you've got some stripes, if you've got some\nstrong vertical elements, to be sure that they're within your own personal tolerance level. (upbeat music) Now, the last point is pricing. I went to two major online stores and these are some prices for\nsome current in stock items. If we look at the price in\nterms of cost per square inch, this is the premium that\nyou're paying for a precut. And I checked my math several times. And when you look at the price\nof precuts in solid colours, the premium is even greater. Now manufacturers have\nadditional costs for precuts. There's the cost of cutting,\nthere's the cost of folding, wrapping, packaging and wastage. And for layer cakes, charm\npacks, and mini charms, you're going to have the\nwastage of the selvages on the side and any extra little off cut. And you personally have your own concerns. Your skill level, your affordability, your accessibility and time constraints. So only you can say whether\nthis premium is worth it. I do recommend that you look\nto your local quilt stores, who often will make\ntheir own precut bundles and not charge a premium for it. (upbeat music) So, I have been on this journey, making this video, for\nthe past four months. Not only do I have the\nchallenge, all the time, trying to figure out how\nmuch fabric should I buy, when I like a fabric? I now realise, I have\na challenge of knowing, what is the best form I\nshould buy my fabric in? Am I comparing apples to oranges? And then I'm wondering, if\nyou also have that problem? And should we be\ndeveloping a tool for that? So, I would really appreciate it, if you could take a couple of minutes and just fill in a survey for me. I've got a link to it down in the note. You can also find it on my website at justgetitdonequilts.com I just have a couple of questions. And if you fill it in,\nI'd really appreciate it. And if I do actually go\nthrough and develop a tool, you'll be the first to know about it. So, that's all I have for today. Stay tuned for next week, when I have a stash buster with precuts.

(upbeat music)", "p35o0aUv-yo": "hey everyone its Rob with Rob Finds\nTreasure and I have been asked by some of my viewers how I roll\nwell maybe that's not what they meant when they're asking how I roll but let\nme talk to you about how I roll how long it takes me, what denominations do I\nroll everyone has their own system but let me tell you what I do - I don't roll\npennies at all I don't roll pennies I don't reroll mythem I should say I\njust take them to the Coinstar a box of pennies will probably cost me two\ndollars and seventy cents in fees at Coinstar which stinks\nbut by time I pay for the rolls the coin wrappers I mean and then take them to a\nbank with the gas and the time to wrap them it's not worth it for me but I do\nwrap nickels dimes quarters half dollars you name it all by hand\nsometimes if I'm really lazy I might I might take the nickels to the coin star\nbut that's rare but I could save a lot of time and a lot of money with a few\njust a couple of key things I do so let me flip the camera around and show you\nwhat I do to save a little bit of time and money we're gonna be doing quarters\nin this video so I'll go ahead and show you the quarters box I go ahead and buy\na thousand crimped end coin wrappers or they're also referred to as the\npreformed coin wrappers for all my denominations but it's like literally\nguys eighteen dollars for a thousand of these now I have Amazon Prime so it's\nfree shipping but when you think about eighteen dollars for a thousand of these\nthat's like a couple of cents per roll a couple of cents per roll - two cents per\nroll times 50 rolls is a dollar in cost to wrap pretty much any denomination\nthat I have it's a buck - so you're basically spending a dollar on rolls, my\naverage box takes 20 to 30 minutes to roll up so if I was paying myself ten\ndollars an hour it would take me five dollars in labor and a dollar in the\nrolls six bucks throw in a dollar for gas\nseven dollars to take a box of quarters back at $500 a box in in total coins\nit's well worth not dropping it off at a coin star or even taking it to a bank\nand having to worry about dropping it in the bank and then taking a week to get your\ndeposit credited so I prefer, plus there's no fees when they're\nwrapped my bank doesn't charge me any fees by bringing a bag in the\nonly like I said I'm basically a dollar of materials and a half-hour tops of my\ntime once I've got the and I've got that for all the denominations I've got some\nnickel ones down there I'm almost out of Dimes I've got some overflow nickels\nhere and then I also have some pennies down there but I don't I don't do pennies\nand then finally I got my half dollar wrapper ones down there so what I use as a machine is my Royal Sovereign coin sorter guys it's pretty simple I've got\nsome extra coin wrappers in here that aren't the ones I bought they came in a\nlittle sample that I got from a retailer so I'm gonna finish using these up first\nbut guys this is super simple all you do is drop them in there like that right\npush it in let me get this bad boy turned on back here gives you a total\ndenomination and you can drop in any denominations you want this thing I hear\ncost me less than a hundred bucks less than 100 bucks so let's say we hit run\nand now it's ready guys and so for funsies we'll take a few quarters here\nand I'll just drop a few taken home quite a bit without getting a jam\nso it fills up the roll and it counts it out and once you hit once you hit ten\nbucks which is what a quarter roll is the machine stops and says hey you've\ngot a full roll so then what you all you have to do is just pull it forward and\nit immediately starts the next roll so we'll go ahead and get a couple of rolls\ndone for fun just take a few seconds to unjam it so I found it just smarter to\njust let it do its thing for more quarters than we've got all right\nonce that's done guys it's super simple you can see the way that this is set up\nall you really ever tried just one-handed all you like to do is push\nthis up like so and pull the coin roll out like that and I'm doing it\none-handed so if it was two-handed I'd be already done with this roll and then\nyou just fold it in like that and it's done we're have another empty cartridge\nslam it in there same thing you'll pull that one out the exact same way push up\non the gap like that pull the roll out add another cartridge in there just like\nthis and it's still waiting for me to push it back into position and once I do\nit'll start counting again so we got 20 dollars done let me go ahead pause this\nreal quick so what I wnat to do is set the camera up with a tripod and kind of show\nyou how fast we can do a box now I've got a couple of rolls already done I\nknow but you'll get you'll get the idea I'll even have a stopwatch going\nright here mater of fact when we get it started I'll even start it and give it\nlike 30 seconds before I begin but we'll go ahead and get that started and we'll see\nhow long it takes to get a whole box done alright guys I let it run for a few\nextra seconds I had some technical difficulties - I should have\nthought the face of this turns off quite a few times so every once in a while I\nnoticed the face was off but we did $490 on the screen our know if you could see\nit we had that one role that we started with the test role so technically I\nadded about 10 seconds on to about 26 minutes to do this whole box of quarters\nand like I said for $1 in product costs and 26 minutes of work this is ready to\ngo back to the bank that's how I roll now when I go pick up my half dollars\ntomorrow I can just exchange at that Bank cuz they like quarters I can\nexchange a box of quarters for a box a half since they're worth the same amount\nwell there you have it everyone that's how I roll I mean I get the rolls the\npreform rolls for cheap less than 2 cents each when I buy them by the bulk\nand 20-30 minutes of work they're done I hope you enjoyed the video if you did\nplease give it a thumbs up and as always everyone thanks for watching", "H4U6O2D25v8": "hi I'm here to talk to you today about the wonderful world of pre-cut fabrics you're probably familiar with fat quarter fabrics which is an 18 by 21 inch cut of fabric it's a standard commodity in most quilt stores and it's a wonderful and versatile piece what you might not be familiar with though are the more recent introductions of charm packs layer cakes and jelly rolls and a lovely assortment of other cuts I'm going to talk to you today about what to do with a charm pack a charm pack consists of a 5 inch by 5 inch piece of one of each fabric that's in the line of fabric from the manufacturer we really love about charm packs is they everything matches the color coordination is done for you I'm going to show you how to do these two bit where these bags is the same bag well this one has ties on the side and this one of course does not and they look completely different but it's the same bag maybe charm squares when I'm working with charm squares the first thing I like to do is separate them out into different colors because I'd like a like a nice random feel to my bag sides so I've got these separated out and I'm going to lay out my my charms in 5 columns three rows so I'll start doing this and then you can switch things out how you like them I like to put it put my fabrics where I don't have the same fabrics together in the same colors together so I might like a yellow down here one of the things that I really like that charm squares is the fact that the fabric always matches everything goes they are pre-selected for me I don't waste many and the packages are actually very inexpensive to buy I know I'm an addict I'm a collector so I really like the fact that I can go in I have just a little bit of everything available to me so we get these out and swap them out too if there's no rules you just put it put it how you like it so that's one of my bag sides a time-saving step for is this assembly line sewing and to get our squares ready for assembly line sewing's I flip the second row on to the first row and then I stack up these fabrics and I stack them like this and when I go to assembly line so everything comes out in the right order so I'll show you real quick what I mean by assembly line sewing as I take the first two off the stack and I so here these are the ones that I laid out right sides together and then I take the second two and without snipping my thread I just feed it through the sewing machine and I sew down this side and I do the same thing with third so now I have three rows two columns and you open these up after they're sewn and you take the next one on the pile and you sew it this square and you continue in that fashion you open this up and sew the next square and when you're done with that you have something that looks like this now we have our three pieces that go with our tote front ready to go we sell those all together and this is our tote side so if you notice that my tote sides don't match up with the fabrics that I cut earlier and that's perfectly fine all you have to remember is that you slice this off and you square it up and you measure it and all of your pieces should be that same measurement we're not very precise but as long as your lining matches and your pockets match and your both sides match you're going to be fine now that you have your sides sewn together the next step is to fuse it to the fusible fleece that looks like this now they're laid out flat there's a rough side of this and kind of a smooth side and the fusible side is the rough side and you layer your already trimmed bag side on the top of your fusible fleece where the right side of the wrong side of the fabric is against the right side of the fusible fleece and then you take a nice hot iron and you press that all down flat and it sticks really nice to it and you get something that looks like this when you're done as you can see that I have top stitched around here and sewn some buttons on it and added my application my bag site all of which are completely optional steps because you've used the fusible fleece you don't have to do anything else to it I just like the way the little bit of quilting looks after you've gotten your side of your toe to look the way you want it to the next step is to create some notches in the corner and this will create a box bottom when we are all finished and what you do is you layer your your little square ruler and this is a handy little tool on the backside and cut I'm going to use a 3 inch notch you're not CH is half of the depth of your bag so if you have a 3 inch notch you're going to have a 6 inch depth on your bag and if you change the size of your notches you'll get a different height and a different width of your bag and that makes this particular pattern very versatile and you just just look like that you do that on this side and this side and you do it for both sides your bags and your lining the next step in making our tote bag is to create the handles as you see I've already ironed on the fabric onto our fusible fleece and I have a nice piece here the first step is to find the middle fold your fabric in half wrong sides together and if you like you can press it to make a nice crease and but you don't have to do that fold one side of the fabric up to the middle and fold the opposite side of the fabric up to the middle as well and then fold those in half and pin in place and you continue along your handle all the way long until you have it all folded and you get something that looks like this so down this side and across this side and make sure you catch the fold in here and you'll have a piece that looks like this slide you're already quilted bag sides over and do a quick measurement and find about six inches over and pin your handle to that measurement it's same for the opposite side and make sure you don't twist up your handles and pin in place and before you sew these down you can slap it up on your shoulder to make sure that you like the width that you've got going here the next step in is to layer your fabrics right sides together and sew down this side across the bottom and across this side and of course you've already pinned your other handle to the opposite side of your bag at this point we have sewn our handles to our bag sides we've layered our bag sides right sides together and we've sewn down the side across the bottom and across the opposite side now I'm going to show you how to make that nifty little box corner that helps your bag sit flat what you do is you take your two pieces of your bag and you pull the corners out to where you have a flat side and line up the side seam with the bottom seam and kind of flatten out flatten out your seams so you have something like that and you pin that in place and all you do you can pin in several places or just one like I do pins I have comfortable you are and then you just sew across the flat side take your pins out cause it breaks your needle ask me how I know and that's that simple and I've already done the opposite side so that's the bottom looks like and the sides and I will show you you turn your bag right side out kind of poof up the corners that you're just sewn with your fingers on each end and you can see it's got a real nice crisp corner to it and the outside of your bag is done the next step in making our tote bag is to create inside pockets the first thing you do is draw a straight line with a pencil or a pen or crayon if you want across the bottom of your bag about anywhere between a 3/4 and an inch above the knots you just cut then you take your pocket fabric which is starts open you fold it in half and create a crease and then open it up and place your fusible fleece against the against the crease and then fold it back over then you line up your pocket fabric with your drawn line right here across the edge and you sew a quarter inch away from the raw line like this let's get this out of the way and then flip the pocket up and draw dividing lines for your pockets kind of wherever you want and we give you some guidelines in our pattern but it can be wherever you like and then stitch across that do that for both sides of your lining layer your lining right sides together and sew across the sides and across the bottom as you did with the main tote with the exception you leave and opening in the bottom so you can turn your bag right sides out and when you're done with that you will get a nice a nice bag like this with pockets and that's all there is to the lining we are down to the final stages of putting our bag together you've got your main bag piece and you've got your lining piece and what you do is you tuck your main bag piece inside of your lining and you line them up on the seams at the side and you make sure that your handle pieces are between the lining and the main part of the bag you pin around the top make sure everything is lined up and straightened out you don't have any creases and you simply stitch around the top and that's all there is to this step at this point you have tucked your main bag into your lining and I'm going to show you how to turn it right sides out we have an opening here that we left in our lining bottom so you reach inside of that opening grab the top part of the bag and just start gently pulling it through that hole don't worry if you pop a few stitches we're going to sew that closed in a little bit anyhow so hopeful pull there I managed that without popping a stitch okay so now your bag is outside your lining is outside take this hand where we left the opening in the lining and just you can pin that and hand stitch that or machine stitch this opening closed then tuck your lining inside your bag kind of using your hand to straighten out the corners and get them all straightened out so now we have tucked our bag into our our lining into our bag and we are going to top stitch around the outside here make sure you line up the seams and roll them out flat and we're going to top stitch up here so we get a nice finished look something like this this is where we've topped stitched around our finished bag you see it reinforces the handle and gives it a really nice finished look at this point you can sew your optional ties on the side as well and that's all there is to making a square tote bag we love these new products these terms squares and jelly rolls there are a lot of great patterns out there they're economical they're easy to use they're time savers so you want to try", "lYWh-UVU-Eo": "(upbeat music) - Hey, guys, it's July 3rd, 2020. I'm Kimberly Jolly from Fat Quarter Shop. And I have a great demo for you today. I wanted to let you know, we have some Foundation\nPaper Piecing pads. And so the very first\none that we came out with are the Log Cabin pads. And so they're available in\na six and a 12 inch size. And I have been sewing\nalong with these all year to make a big Log Cabin quilt. So we have those. So I'm gonna show you those first. The second ones we came out\nwith are Pineapple paper, six inch and 12 inch. And for now we're gonna\nstick with those two sizes. We're not gonna be adding\nextra sizes at this time. We might in the future. And then the brand new ones are\nEconomy blocks by Lori Holt. And I'm gonna be doing\na demo on these today, along with another block. And I wanted to let you know, on the Economy block the\nsix inch, it comes this way. I'm gonna show you lots of options on how you can play with this paper. And on this one, you can\neither have this Economy block in the inside, or you can\njust put one big fabric here. Both options are available on the paper. In addition to that, we have size guides that you can download for free. And they show you how, with\na six inch or 12 inch paper, how many blocks you would\nneed for a wall hanging, crib, lap, lap, twin, queen, king, table runner. So it's a fun way to,\nif you wanted to know exactly what to make, it\nworks with any of the pads, 'cause they're all six and 12 inches. So that's super awesome. So the first thing I'm gonna show you is my quilt that I'm gonna show you today. So I made this on Tuesday.\nIt took me about three hours. And what I did here is I\nalternated Economy blocks with a Simple Star block. So the very first demo I'm gonna\ndo is on the Economy block. The second demo will be on the Star. (metal clattering) Oops. My rulers are flying. So I'm gonna kind of get all\nmy stuff out and show you. So the very first thing\nis on the Economy block. You can see right here. What I did was, I did dark, light, dark. You could do it all Scrappy. So where every piece is Scrappy. You could do the same thing\nwhere it's dark on the outside, but maybe more of a medium on the inside. You could do Scrappy on the outside with a dark on the inside. You could do a light on\nthe outside and the inside and a dark on the middle. And then these are the two papers. These are the two blocks that were used for the cover of the pads. And this is made out of Prim. So let me know if you\nall have any questions on the Economy before I demo. And I'm gonna, as you're asking questions, I'm going to kind of get\nall my stuff together that I need to make this. - [Lily] Great, the first\nquestion we had was from Teresa. They say, \"I love the Economy block. \"I wonder if there's a\nchance that Lori would do \"a smaller one, say a four inch size?\" - So we're not doing\nextra sizes right now. We will be adding extra\nsizes maybe next year. We want to build up our\npads in the six and 12 inch, and then we will add to the sizes. But right now it's not gonna be soon. - [Lily] From Dinos & Tutus, \"So is that like Triangle paper on a roll? \"That's so cool. Perfect\nfor a beginner like me.\" - Yes it is. It's just in a pad because\nit's more of a block. And so we're gonna be expanding\nall of our paper products. And they're all made in the US. - [Lily] And then we\njust had a fun comment from Linda Gillespie. She said, \"My show. Ah!\" And then she put a bunch of hearts. - Thank you. - [Lily] So I thought that was cute. Thanks, Linda. From Cindy P., \"Why did\nyou name it Economy?' - That is the name of\nthe Traditional block. And so it's the name of\na block that came out in the Kansas City Star\nnewspaper, in the early 1900s. And so Lori came up with this idea. We will be adding more from her. Our next pad, our fourth pad\nwill be Courthouse Steps. And then Jocelyn and I\nhave a list after that. But obviously we don't\nwant to tell everybody what we're doing so people\ndon't do it before us. Okay. So now we're gonna\ngo to the top camera. And in your pad, whether\nit's the six inch or 12 inch, or any of the pads, when you open it, these are the instructions. And it will tell you what size you need to cut for light and dark. And of course, like I showed\nyou, you can reverse it. So here's your pad. I've already started\npulling from this pad. So you can see that the pad stays together even when you pull the papers off, 'cause this is the pad\nI was using at home. So the very first thing is\nI've already cut my fabrics. And this is kind of\nthe look I'm going for. And I, to make mine, what I did, was we have a Petite\nVintage Happy 2 Stacker that has fewer, it's\nnot a full Layer Cake. It's 10 inch squares. And so I bought one of these. And this is what I used. And even this is leftover\nfrom my table runner. And the reason I made my\ntable runner two by 12 is because that fits in my sewing room. So now I'm gonna show you how you would do this and how\nto do it really fast at home. So the very first thing\nI do is I am going to use this Add a Quarter ruler. I like the six inch size\nfor the six inch paper. Now, if you were doing 12 inch paper, you would get the longer size. And I'm just gonna kind of crease it between the one and the two. So, yeah, sorry. It's\nhard to see. There you go. So between the one and\nthe two I've got a crease. So when I turn it over,\nyou see the crease, you want your square in\nthe center, right side up, and you go about a quarter\ninch past that crease. And then you put a triangle,\nright sides together, so you're doing this totally opposite of what you would think. And you can see you're\na quarter inch past. Now on the very first one\nI might pin, I might not. Now since I'm on camera,\nI'll pin so it won't move. At home I don't even pin. So I turn that over. And we're gonna stitch\none all the way down, right here, between the one and the two. But I'm gonna start about\na quarter inch before and stitch a quarter inch after. Let's see, I usually\nuse a 1.5 stitch length. But some people are saying\nthat that's too small for them at home, and that's\nfine, you can do longer. (machine whirring) So now you can kind of see. Sorry, I'm trying to get the light, right. And then what I will do here is fold this back. And trim it at a quarter inch. Okay, this is not gonna be great. Okay, we're gonna trim at a quarter inch. It's not gonna work.\n- Okay. - [Kimberly] So let me\njust do it over here. So I trimmed that at a quarter inch. And now what I'm gonna do, you can either iron at this point, or you can use your Seam\nPress Roller by Lori Holt. That's what I do, 'cause it'll save time. And then I don't have to get up. Now I'm gonna go to the other side, fold between the one and the three. Crease. Then I need to trim this\na quarter inch away. Hold on, let me move everything. There we go. That should work. And then we're going to\ntrim a quarter inch away. So you don't have too much waste. And then right sides together,\nyour next triangle, and add. And you can pin or not pin. Now, like I said, I'm\non camera, so I'll pin. But at home I don't ever pin. You could also use a glue stick. That just takes too\nmuch time for me. Fussy. (machine whirring) And so that is actually\nhow fast I sew at home. And then I just keep adding. And if you are ironing this at this point, you would wanna make sure\nyou have your steam off so it doesn't shrink your paper. So let me know if you have\nquestions before I keep going? - [Lily] Yeah, real quick, I have seen a few people saying that\nthey're having trouble seeing the video because of the chat. If you're on YouTube and\nyou just tap on your phone and go to the top right, there's\na little chat bubble there. If you click it, the chat goes away, so you'll be able to see it. And a question from Tracy Eckhardt, they're asking, \"You don't\nsew directly on the fabric?\" - [Kimberly] No, you\nsew on the other side. - [Lily] Okay. - [Kimberly] So you're sewing\non the line with the paper. You're putting, you're sewing where the numbers are, and then the fabric's on the\nother side, right side up. - [Lily] Mm hm. From Buzzy Bee Cottage, \"What is the size \"inside the square in the Economy block?\" I think that center, yeah, you got it. - [Kimberly] Three. - [Lily] Three inches square. - [Kimberly] And it will\ntell you on the instructions what size to use. Now on this, this is Layer Cake friendly. So if you wanted to do the six inch size, it's Layer Cake friendly. Or if you were going to do something like this, where you use all different fabrics, it's Charm Pack friendly. It's just, if you wanted it\nto be matchy matchy like this, you would need a Layer Cake. So it's either Charm Pack\nor Layer Cake friendly, depending on how you\nwant to use your fabrics. And I love this one. - [Lily] That one's really cute. - [Kimberly] I don't know\nwhat I'm gonna do with it, but I'm gonna do something with it. - [Lily] All right, and\nthen a few people asking how many sheets come in the pads? - [Kimberly] 42, I believe. Let me see.\n- Mm hm. - [Kimberly] 42. - [Lily] Okay. And Bobby Millican says, \"So one packet equals a whole quilt?\" - So you would download that\npaper that I have over here. And it will tell you how many you need. So for example, for a wall hanging, you would only need four. For a lap you would need\nfour by six, which is 24. Six by six is large. So you would download this, and then it tells you how\nmany squares you need. And then you would decide from that. And so that's why we did that. And that works with any of them. So we need to do one that's the Economy. So, Jocelyn will draw up the Economy one. Ashley, can you email her to do that? But they're all the same.\nIt's all the same measurement. - [Lily] Okay, and then\nHudson Johnson was asking, \"Why are you trimming before you sew?\" - [Kimberly] That's how you\ndo Foundation Paper Piecing. And then, okay, so now\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn this over, and sorry, the light is really bright there. But what I do is I'm gonna pull back, so you can't really see the lines. So I pull this back and\nthere's a line right here between the four and the five. And then there's another one over here. We can do this one at the same time. And I just pull that back. Even if the paper tears, it's fine. Can you see that? There you go. So you can kind of see, it's really shiny. So I don't know if it's too bright. - [Lily] Let me press\nsomething here real quick. - [Kimberly] Lily's gonna\ntry to help me fix it. Oh, no, there, there. - [Lily] Okay. - [Kimberly] So now we're\ngonna go back over here and I've already creased the line. So you put the Add a Quarter, and the reason I like the Add\na Quarter is it has a bump, and it bumps up to where\nyou need the quarter inch. And so you don't have to\nthink about your quarter inch. And so you have very little waste. And then you do the same\nthing on the other side. And that's what's fun about this block is on the Log Cabin and the Pineapple, you have to start and stop over and over. And this one you can do\ntwo (ruler clattering), oops, two sides at once. So now, I'm just gonna add this. You can actually do these at\nthe same time, if you want. And then I'm gonna turn it over. And when I sew, I sew really\nfast, and I'm just showing you, because this is what I do at home. You obviously don't have to do that. And again, when you're stitching,\nyou start before and after your intersection about a quarter inch. (machine whirring) (machine whirring) And so then, I'm just gonna use my seam press. And anytime you're working\nwith a Foundation pad or Triangles on a Roll\nor any kind of paper, having a bed, it's hard to see, but this has a bed of a machine, it will keep it so that\neverything stays flat. So from here, I'm gonna go\nand just pick two corners, it doesn't matter which\none, two opposite corners. Find the line. And trim. Sorry, we only have so much camera space. And the bed's kind of getting in the way, but I wanted the bed so it'd stay flat. So again, you're just gonna trim. And then we will add the last two. Or the first two, I guess. Put that one in, and remember,\nright sides together. And on all of our other papers, the Pineapple and the Log Cabin, we do have videos on how to\ndo those that you can watch. And then this one, we\nwill do another video that's not a livestream. (machine whirring) (machine whirring) And when you're working with\nany kind of paper product, whether it's Triangles\non a Roll or this paper, whatever stitch you normally use, you want to go a tiny bit smaller, so when you pull the paper off, it does not rip the stitches. So if you usually stitch at\na two, you could do a 1.5. I usually stitch at 1.5. So\nthen I move it to like a 1.25. And some people have said that that's just way too small\nfor them, and that's okay. You do whatever you wanna do. Okay. So now I've got those. Now I just need to\ntake, do these last two. I'm gonna just do it here. Sorry, guys. We try to do this perfect. And it's hard. Okay, so here I'm just\ngonna press back over here. You just kind of pull your stitches back. And the reason I like to have\nthis extra stitches right here is so that my stitches\ndon't unravel under here. So that's just something\nthat I like to do. So there you go. You've pulled it back on those lines. And I will use my Add a Quarter. I love this Add a Quarter\nthing. This saves so much time. The very first time I didn't have one, when I was doing Log\nCabin, and I was like, \"Oh no, this takes too long.\" And I actually had it. I had\njust lost it, which is typical. And by the way, I have\nnot found my fabric. I don't know what in\nthe world I did with it. - [Lily] Oh no. - [Kimberly] I'm like, \"Okay!\" Okay, so then I can pin those. And I'm just gonna do\nthe last two real quick. And then on the last two, you want to stitch off the paper, not off the paper, but off that, a quarter inch away from that line so that you have your seam off the paper. Does that makes sense? Sorry. I'm trying to show it. I'll show it when I'm\ndone and then you'll see. (machine whirring) (machine whirring) Okay, so here I'm probably\ngonna really iron, real quick. Just so that I have it nice\nand flat before I trim it. And it's not plugged in. Or it's not on. Okay, so that's fine. There we go. We're about flat. Okay, so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move this off the table so that I can really\nshow you what I'm doing. Okay. So now you would do the same exact method if you did the 12 inch, the\nsame exact type of technique. So if you look on the back, you can see that there's\nlines where it says, \"Trim on this line. Do\nnot trim on this line.\" And we have that just so\nthat we make it accurate. Now what I've done is, the\neasiest thing for me to do is take a Creative Grids 6-1/2 inch ruler. You could either trim around\nor you can do what I do. And I'm gonna kind of, I just put my ruler right\non the edge of those lines. And then I just trim all\nfour sides at one time. (cutter slicing) I'm kind of far away from\nthe table, so I'm gonna... (cutter slicing) So there it is. It's perfect. Now I will trim, take my\npaper off right after that. And when you stitch with\na really low stitch, it'll come right off. If you want to crease\nit first, that helps. So example there I didn't crease. But here, if I crease it,\nit's gonna come off faster. So that's up to you. This is a great activity for children. So you could just do this and then have your kids take the paper off. And it just comes off really easy. So, let me show you, let\nme get all the paper off, and then I'll show you again, one thing. And I usually go from the outside in, 'cause then that center square\nwill just rip right off. And then if there's little\npieces, usually at home, I don't have all these little pieces. But when I'm on camera, of course I do. Okay. So there's this. So again, there's different\nways you can do it. Let me iron this. So I'm gonna just kind of show, just different things that I did at home. And I did the whole table runner, all the Stars, and these blocks, I think it was less than four hours. - [Lily] Oh wow! - [Kimberly] So. These are just different\noptions of what you could do. And then I'm gonna show you, if you wanted to sew\ntwo of these together, for example, if you didn't\nwant to do my Star option. So this is my Star option. And the reason, I don't know, Lori told me it looked cute, so I did it. It's all Lori's idea. So I just did Economy, Star, Economy. But if you wanted to do all Economy, the best way to do that,\nto join them together, is you're gonna have two\npoints that meet right here. Sometimes you don't want to\njust put those together and sew, or they might not match. So what I do is I put\nmy pin in the very point of the intersection and\nthen the very point, whoops, I just poked myself. In the very point of this one. And then you just kind\nof keep your pin up, just keep it there. And then I usually pin once on each side. And then I would pin at this intersection. And then I would just stitch. And by having those pins there, when you stitch and you open, it should line up. You will have a lot of bulk, because with Foundation Paper Piecing, you have to press all to the outside because of the way the paper works. So you're gonna have a big\nbulk here, which is okay. But that pinning will help you. So, yay! So I showed the Economy block. Can we go to the front camera? And then I'm happy to\nanswer any questions. But I did want to show\nyou the Star block also. But I'm happy to answer any\nquestions on the Economy block before I show you the Star block. - [Lily] Yes, we have a lot of questions. about the Economy block. Okay. Give me one sec. From Rebecca White, \"Is\nthe paper easy to remove?\" - Yes, and so when we\ndeveloped this paper, we did a lot of testing. And so it's a thinner paper. It's not, it's not as\nthick as regular paper, or it would be hard to remove. So it's specialty paper made\nspecifically for this product. - [Lily] From Peggy Rodenburg, \"Is this block six inches\nfinished or unfinished?\" - Six and a half unfinished,\nsix inches finished. And then the 12 would be\n12 and a half unfinished, 12 inch finished. And you could mix, you could do Log Cabin with Pineapple with Economy. And when we have all of\nthese papers released, in a year or two, when we have a bunch, we'll do a big sampler quilt. - [Lily] From Pokey Rella, \"So you sew right on the dotted line?\" - Okay, so you sew right on\nthe line, it's not dotted. Can you go to the? Okay, so you sew right on the line. It's not dotted at all. And you just sew directly on the line. You don't worry about a quarter inch seam because on the outside\nwe account for that. And we tell you, \"Do not\ntrim here, but do trim here.\" And that's why those words are there. And they're on all four sides, to try to help you not forget. So it's solid lines on this paper. - [Lily] Okay. From Barb Setterdahl, \"What\nsize needle do you prefer?\" - So, okay. That's a great\nquestion. I'm so happy you asked. When I'm sewing with\nFoundation Paper pads, I like to use a size 90 needle top stitch because it is thicker and it's\ngonna pierce that paper more, and easier to pull off. If not, just use a regular one. But after you have done a full,\nlike if you do a whole pad, you want to change your needle, because stitching on\nthe paper will dull it faster than if you were\njust stitching with fabric. So you would need to change your needle a little bit more frequently. - [Lily] Peyton Jolly\nsays, \"That's my mom.\" - Hi, Peyton! (chuckling) - [Lily] Hello. Aw.\n- Aw, that's my little baby. That's dinosaur, look,\ndinosaur, dinosaur, roar, roar! He knows what that means. - [Lily] Oh. (chuckling) - He knows what that means. He loves dinosaurs. - [Lily] Oh my gosh. Question from Lisa McKay. \"So the crease is your sewing line?\" - Yes. It is your sewing line. - [Lily] From Crow Boo, \"No back-talking at\nthe beginning and end?\" - So I don't. What I do instead is\nI start a quarter inch away from the intersection\nand sew a quarter inch after. You could do the back\nstitch and forward stitch, if you wanted to. I think that takes too much time. So I just stitch a little bit\nbefore and a little bit after. And then when I go to the next step, I just have to fold the\npaper a little bit more and that's okay. But if you want to do\nit that way, you can. - [Lily] Also, lots of people are saying, your top is gorgeous. - Thanks. I have it on because we\nhave to refilm a video because I totally messed something up. And so I was, it's really funny. So when we're doing the Jelly Snowflake, which I'm gonna show you, or the Jolly Snowflake,\njelly, whatever, after, I don't know, we just\ndidn't have it together. And that means me. I\ndidn't have it together. So we have a lot of mistakes,\nso we had to redo it. And so I had worn this in all the videos. And so I had to go and make sure that I picked this up\nfrom the cleaners before. So that's the only reason I'm wearing it. But it's fun. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to be like, \"You know what? \"I was just having a bad week.\" Everybody has a bad week. Everyone has a good week. And sometimes when you just start off bad, it just becomes this whole catastrophe. And that's what that was. And that's okay. We're gonna fix it today. - [Lily] Yes, magic of editing. - And thank you to the customer\nwho saw it on livestream and emailed and said, \"I\nthink that block is wrong.\" Because we had filmed the whole thing and nobody had noticed. - [Lily] Yep. Not one. - And we would have released that and I would have got slammed. And I would have probably\ncried in my bed reading that. - [Lily] Okay. So we have a\nquestion from Annette Hillison, \"On other paper piecing,\nyou don't have to cut \"the shape out ahead of time. \"Can you do that with this one?\" Where you, since you had\ncut out like the triangles, on other paper piecing,\nsometimes you just use a random scrap and--\n- Oh, you can. So what I did, I will\ntell you on this one, on this one, I had\nalready made all the rest. And so I didn't have full squares that I could cut on the diagonal. So I actually just threw\nscraps on this outside edge just to use what I had left over. So you can definitely do that. The cutting in all of the pads is just a, like a guide to get you going, but you can do whatever you want. And that's the way that\nI was able to use all of, basically I used everything in this except one or two squares. But the whole point of this is you can use anything that you have in your house. I just grabbed one of these 'cause I thought it would match my sewing room. And so it would look really\ngood, also, this is... six by two, but I think this would look\nreally good eight by two. But my table is six by two. So you have enough fabric\nin this to do eight by two, but my little thread cabinet,\nthis fits almost perfectly. - [Lily] Okay, from Sia Joy, \"Good morning from Connecticut. \"Quick question, can you use\nyour lovely packing paper \"for paper piecing? \"I hate to throw it away. It's so nice.\" - No, that is way too thick. So that packing paper is, it comes, it's from recycled paper. And it is very thick. And anytime you do any\nkind of paper piecing that's Foundation Paper Piecing,\nyou want to use thin paper. So like a typewriter paper, like if you went to\nOffice Depot or something. You would want the typewriter\npaper 'cause it's thinner. I would use that maybe as a stuffing for your Christmas gifts instead. - [Lily] Okay. From Rhonda W., \"Will you still carry \"the Cupcake and Cake Recipe papers?\" - Yes. Yes. I love those. And so the Cupcake and the Cake Mix, those are from Moda Fabrics. We have lots of videos on how to use those with Carrie Nelson, who works at Moda. And those are to use either\nLayer Cakes or Charm Packs, and they do a different\nassortment of blocks. So they're totally different because they, you can make different things with them. This is just one block. Ours is more of a block concept where theirs is more of a quilt concept. - [Lily] Okay. From Pat Schmidt, \"How\nbig would the quilt be \"if you've used one package\nof the six inch block papers.\" - Okay. Hold on. So six inch, the closest we could get is, if you did the biggest, the biggest, okay, so if you did a crib, that would be six blocks by six blocks,\nit would use 36 squares. So you would have some leftover, and that would give you a\n36 and a half inch square. And so that's why this is\ngreat, because it will show you exactly, so you don't have to think. - [Lily] From Hudson\nJohnson, oh, they say, \"I am on my son's Facebook. \"The reason with doing it with the papers, \"because it's more precise and easier? \"Sorry. I've never seen this before.\" - Yes. So Foundation Paper Piecing\nis just so you can have more accuracy and you can go faster. You can see how fast\nI sewed on my machine. And when you're working\nwith an Economy block, I will tell you, and\nI've always said this, my least favorite block\nis a square in a square. And I have some square in a\nsquare blocks to do at home. And I keep putting them\noff because you're just, I just feel like I can\nnever get the points right on the edge because it\nall becomes bias out here. So Foundation Paper is just an option. Now you could do it the traditional way. This is just a way for us to\ndo things a little bit faster. It uses scraps. So yeah, it's just, but I do struggle with any kind of block that has corner squares on the outside. And so this is just an idea\nthat Lori had to do hers. And remember on this 12 inch, on the 12 inch here, you can\neither do the center this way, or, sorry, this whole\nthing could be one fabric. So on the back, sorry we have lights, so you can see there's darker lines here. And those darker lines\nare so if you just wanted to put one big fabric and fussy cut it so that it would be just\nlike this, with one fabric. So this has two options. - [Lily] Okay. Question from Nikki Young Ledbetter, \"Is EPP different from Foundation pieces?\" - Totally different. So English paper piecing is something that we have lots of\nvideos on by Tula Pink and Jen Kingwell on our channel\nand you can check those out. And we will be doing some\nEnglish Paper Piecing in a Stitchery Sampler\nSew Along in the fall. And so that will be fun. But this is Foundation Paper Piecing. And I learned how to do it\nfrom \"Simply Quilts\" TV show, like 20 years ago, from Alex Anderson. - [Lily] That's cool. Okay. From Tammy Eckelbarger,\n\"Yesterday, I was watching Kimberly \"and she commented she had a fresh blade \"in her rotary cutter, but\nshe called it something else. \"What kind of blade does she use?\" - Okay, so I use an Endurance blade. Let me see, we have them right here. So I use this Endurance blade, and it says it cuts twice as long. I actually, when this product,\nI'm gonna be totally honest, when this product came out, I thought, \"Oh, they're just trying\nto get more money.\" 'Cause it's really expensive. So I didn't buy one, 'cause I thought, \"No, I don't need that.\" And then I got one in my Sew Sampler Box, and I used it and it is totally different. It is like a different product. So it just, you can cut longer with it. And I kinda, I will use my rotary blades\n'cause they're expensive until they completely, I either go over, like nick on a ruler or mess\nit up to where I can't use it. So I am really bad about\nchanging my rotary blade. And the reason why is\nthey're really expensive. And one question I do\nget a lot is people say, there's those rotary blade sharpeners, and people have asked me, and I just, first of all I think I would hurt myself, or I know I would hurt\nmyself with one of those. But the reviews that I have seen from people doing it are not great. So that's also an option. I'm hoping that one day\nthey make one that's great so that I can save money. 'Cause the Endurance\nblades are, they're just, I don't know if it's\nlike sharper or thinner, or it just cuts faster, more layers also. - [Lily] From Teresa, \"What size is the center\nsquare of the 12 inch block?\" - Okay. So the brown is three inches, just, the brown three inches, just\nlike the six inch paper, because that's basically\nthe six inch paper inside the 12 inch paper. - [Lily] Oh, magic. - Yes. And then the green would be six, which would be six and a half. And of course, when we\ntell you what to cut, we give you a little bit bigger, because when you're doing\nFoundation Paper Piecing, if you did the exact same size, when you put it on your machine, it might shift too much\nand then you become short. So there is some, like\na quarter inch waste. And that's just because\nif you didn't do that, you would get frustrated with the paper. - [Lily] From R. Allenman, \"Does cutting the paper dull\nthe rotary blades faster?\" - Yes. - [Lily] Yes, but for these, you only cut at the end of the block, right? - Yeah. You only cut at\nthe end, and I, yeah. I would kind of do, like what\nI did when I made this at home is I did all of my Foundation Paper, and then I did all of\nmy Stars at one time. But I haven't changed my\nblade, even after I made those, I still have the same blade on. - [Lily] From Charlotte Walker, \"Have you ever used a light box in FPP? \"And are there any real benefits to this?\" - Yeah, it would definitely help, because you could see that line through. I don't own a light box. I think it'd be great. I just don't want to\nspend the money on it. - [Lily] Yeah, I know some people just hold it up to the light too. And that works fine. We've got several people asking when we are gonna have\nLori Holt as a guest? - Well, right now we can't\nbecause we can't go anywhere and she can't come here. She was gonna come in about two weeks, but that all got canceled. She will be a guest when\nlife goes back to normal. - [Lily] Yeah, but if\nyou need a Lori Holt fix, she does have a YouTube channel now. - Yes, YouTube channel,\nit's called \"Lori Holt\", and there's something, oh yeah, so she has lots of videos. She comes out with videos every Friday. And I will show you next\nweek on the Flosstube, what she made on the previous one. But she's filming it today.\nSo I can't show you yet. - [Lily] Oh, so exciting. But yes, I love her videos. - And she shows you like different things, like how to paint or how to do a banner. It's not just quilting.\nIt's really crafting. And so it's a way to\nalso be able to utilize, Lori's motto is to use it all up. So, if you have leftovers,\nyou can make a banner. You can, all kinds of things. And different things that you haven't seen on other channels, which is great, because she's got her\nown original content. - [Lily] Yeah, it's like\nthe Lori Holt variety show. I love it. - Variety show. (chuckling) - [Lily] Yeah. It's a variety of crafts. - Oh, I see, I see. I was like, I didn't understand. - [Lily] Oh, sorry. (chuckling) She does it all. Okay. - I thought you meant, I\nthought variety meant something like drama or something, I\nthought it meant, never mind. - [Lily] Oh no. A variety show is usually\nlike where they just do a variety of different skits and comedy and different things. - Okay yeah, that's what, I get it now.\n- Yeah. Okay. So funny comments from Gwen Smith. \"I need to hire some\nkids to tear the papers.\" Maureen Mullarkey also said, \"For children or retired\nhusbands\", that paper tearing part. - Yes. Yes.\n- That's hilarious. - Yes, so I bargain, Peyton's listening, but I bargain with him to either, they either walk the dog, tear the paper, vacuum the house, do the dishes, and then they get like a\ndollar or two on their iPad. Because right now, honestly,\nthere's not much to do. We are gonna try, well, we, my daughter's gonna first\ntry Diamond paining today, to see if she likes it, She's the oldest one,\nand then if she likes it, maybe the boys can try it, and if they like it, they can try it. I'm not sure how it's gonna go. I'm a little bit nervous about that. But they're bored. They got nothing to do. - [Lily] From Melissa Reynolds, \"The Economy blocks look\nlike a wonderful way \"to use up some of my massive stash. \"Would you kindly provide\nany recommendations \"on how to choose fabrics that\nwill create a cohesive look?\" - So I would say if you, if the fabrics all play well together, you could just do Scrappy. Because that's the easiest. You don't have to think. You just throw it together. And you could do all dark\nor all medium or all light. I would say, if you're\ndoing something like this, you just want to make sure\nthere's enough contrast. So if it's Scrappy, I\nthink it can be whatever. But if you want contrast,\nI would just make sure your fabrics between the two contrast. Like for example, this one,\nyou could put all different. So that's why I did a\nbunch of different blocks just so you could see. And I would come of just\nstart with one and see, do you like it? Do you like the way it looks?\nAnd then just keep going. 'Cause I think this would be really cute if it was all Scrappy on the outside also. I like this one too. I just did a bunch of\ndifferent things on Tuesday just to kind of prepare for livestream and had fun doing it. - [Lily] From Sewing Becca, \"How are you planning to\nfinish your table runner? \"Borders or just bind?\" - Okay, so on this one, this fits perfectly on my table runner. It's about a half inch too long and about one inch too short on the width. So on this, I am going to\nmail this to Gina Tell today. We've already picked the pantograph. Actually, Gina, I'm not\ngonna mail it today, 'cause I forgot the backing. Yeah, forgot the backing. So, and the binding, but yeah, I'm gonna, I'm just gonna send it to her. But I was thinking about adding borders. To me, it all depends on your table, what table you're gonna put it on. So that's kinda what I\ndid is, at first I thought it was gonna have borders. But then when I put it on\nthe table, it looked fine. So that's kinda what I did is, and I even thought about, 'cause you have enough to\nmake eight instead of six. So I thought, well,\nlet me put it on there. See if I like it. And\nthen if it looked funny, I could add the eight\nand it could hang off. So it's kind of one of those things where, just do it as you go and\njust be flexible enough to change it if you don't like it. - [Lily] Okay. From Sandi Shorter, she says, \"You said you needed to\nredo the other video. \"Some of us have started that\nblock and are now concerned.\" - Oh, no, it's the last video. - [Lily] Yeah, you guys\nhaven't seen it yet. - No sorry. - [Lily] It still part of the mystery. - I shouldn't even have talked about it. But yeah, no, it's a future video. - [Lily] Yeah. No. So everything we've released\nis totally accurate. - Yeah. And so what we do is we film\neverything kind of all at once. So we'll do, it's really hard for me to do more than two or three\nvideos a day because, I think it's kind of like one of those, your brain gets overwhelmed\nand you start getting like, it's like a short circuit. It's like, your computer\njust starts frying. So we do two a day. And so we kind of filmed\nthem two, two, two. - [Lily] Yes yes. Okay, and we do have lots of Super Chats that came in during the demonstration and lots of new members, so I'm\ngonna go down the list here. - Okay, and then as you're doing that, I am going to kind of get\nready for the next set. - [Lily] Perfect. All right. So we have a new member Denise Slater. Welcome, Denise. Yay. There was a members only livestream we did earlier this week on Wednesday, that's available for anyone new and old if you joined our membership to watch. New member Greg Borden-Neary. Welcome, Greg.\n- Thank you. - [Lily] All right. And then we had a couple of Super Chats here. First one was from Pye\nNygren for 22.00, NOK. - Oh my goodness. - [Lily] Thank you, Pye. - Y'all are like, all,\nNOK, you always donate. - [Lily] Yeah. I think\nit's always Pye too. So thank you for your generosity. And they put a pair, that's, okay, I'm just seeing the still, but it looks like it's\ntwerking a little bit, but it says cool. I don't think it's\nactually twerking though. Another one from Pye for 22.00 NOK. And they say, \"Courthouse Step\nis my favorite block.\" Yay. - Yeah, I'm excited about that paper. And it's actually already at the proofer. So it won't take too much longer. - [Lily] And then we had a Super Chat from April N. for 4.99. And they say, \"Kimberly,\nyour videos are the best. \"Thank you so much for them.\" And they put two smiley faces. - Thank you. - [Lily] Thanks, April. Another one from Pye here for 55.00 NOK. And Pye says, \"How many patterns\non paper do you have now? \"I'd like to try different blocks.\" - Three. So we have the Log\nCabin, Pineapple, and Economy. And we have all of those in six and 12. So that would be three styles,\ntwo sizes each, six total. We'll be adding the Courthouse Steps. And then we have some\nother ones after that that we will be adding. - [Lily] All right. And $20 Super Chat from Barbara Setterdahl. Barbara gave us $20.\n- Thank you. - [Lily] Thank you. And then we had a new YouTube\nmember, Gabriel Fuentes. Welcome, Gabriel. - Thank you. - [Lily] Yay. And then we had a very generous Super Chat from Crafts for Others for 99.99. - Oh my goodness. - [Lily] And they say,\n\"Being a young widow, \"your videos gave me something\nto look forward to each week. \"Thanks so much.\" Oh my gosh. Thank you so much. - Thank you. I'm so sorry for your loss. - Yeah. For your loss.\nI'm sorry about that. And thank you so much for\nthe ginormous Super Chat. That's super generous. I can't even thank you enough. From Kathy Brock, Super Chat for 14.99. Thank you, Kathy. - Thank you. - [Lily] All right. And then\na quick word from Lori here. Lori Holt said that \"She\nchose the Economy block \"because normally it's a\nhard block to sew accurately \"because of all the bias. \"But paper piecing this block,\nit's perfect every time.\" - And it's really hard when\nyou're doing the Economy block to get these little points\non the outside accurate. And mine are never accurate. So it's gonna give you\nreally nice results. - [Lily] Okay. A sweet comment from Caroline Alexander, \"Kimberly was born to do demonstration. \"She could be a hand model.\" - Oh, that's funny. Thanks. - [Lily] And then\nquestion from Karen Sharp, \"For the white background,\ndo you use yardage?\" - Yes. So on that I probably\nuse like half a yard. I just used it from my stash. And I use, this is the\nVintage Happy collection, so I even have this leftover. So yeah, I just pull from my stash. Okay, so we're gonna go to the top camera. I'm gonna try not to confuse you here. I'm gonna try. Okay. So on the Stars,\nthis is a Simple Star. Lori gave me this idea,\nand you can either do the star like this, or you\ncould do a star like this, where it's all one color. And so when you're using your Layer Cake, you can either use your\nLayer Cake to make both or one Layer Cake would\nbe for the outside here and the inside and vice versa. So there's two different ways to make it. Well, there's three different\nways you can make it, but this is just fabric options. So you could make your whole thing with everything just like this. You can go to the Farm Girl Vintage book. I'm gonna, this is the Simple Star page, and you could piece the\nblock just like this. So most of you already have\nthe Form Girl Vintage book. And you could piece just like\nthis with your Layer Cake. I'm gonna do mine slightly different because I just want to\nshow you what I do at home. So the center square is\nthree and a half inches. And these outer squares\nare one and a half inches. No, they're not, they're two inches. So these are two inches and\nthree and a half inches. So that all stays the same. I'm gonna put these aside\nand I am going to show you how I do Flying Geese. And I have my cheat book. This is my favorite little book. It has all the fabric we\nbuy, everything in it. But I'm gonna show you, I'm\nnot gonna do the whole block, but I am gonna show you\nhow I do Flying Geese. So Eleanor Burns. I met her, I think it was 19 years\nago, at a Paducah show. And she did a demo on this ruler. And I thought it was great. And ever since then I've been doing the Flying Geese this way. So she has a small Flying Geese ruler that makes three by six and\none and a half by three. And then she has a large Flying Geese that makes different sizes. So what you do is you cut your fabric according to the pattern and\nwe're making the smaller one, the one and a half by three. And inside, she has\ninstructions on what you cut. So you don't want to\nthrow this paper away. You always want to keep\nthis paper with your ruler. So I've already cut according to that. So what I will do is put the fabrics, sorry, right sides together. And then there's this brand\nnew Creative Grids ruler, do you know what it's called? I don't even know what it's called. Seam guide or something. We put a link in it below. - [Lily] Yes, Ashley, if\nyou could help us out here. - [Kimberly] Ashley, please\nhelp me out with the name. So I like, I love this thing. And the reason why is it\ngrips so it doesn't move. And I mark both sides. There's a short one and a long one. This one is C-G-R-S-M-N-9. And I love this. I have both of them. So what I'm gonna do is put\nthis on my sewing machine and we're just gonna sew\ndirectly on that line. And you can just sew really fast. (machine whirring) (machine whirring) And then you cut in between. And I just use this little ruler to cut. You're probably shouldn't, it's\nkind of dangerous, but I do. And I'm gonna press towards\nthe yellow real quick. I'm gonna just do it with my seam presser. This thing is awesome. It's giving my little, I have\na glass, that's not glass, it's like plexiglass, on my table. It's giving it a run for its money. So you do that. You press whichever, I\nlike to press toward the... The dark, this point, whatever this is, if this is light or dark, so whatever this print is going to be. And then you put these together. And when you put these together, you put them right sides together with the fabrics on the opposite side. And you're gonna have this weird thing going on in the center. It's not gonna match like this. Like it's not supposed to be like this. It's supposed to be just like this. And it feels weird,\nbut, and it doesn't even have to be on there exact,\nit's not like exact. - [Lily] And Ashley's letting us know, it's the Creative Grids\nNine Inch Seam Guide. - [Kimberly] Thank you. And there's a bigger\none too, a longer one. But yes, thank you,\nbecause I forgot that I, this is brand new. It came out about a month\nago and it is crazy. I've used it a million times. - [Lily] And Lori says\nthat you're scaring her using that skinny ruler to cut, Kimberley. - [Kimberly] I know,\nyou shouldn't, but I do. And I have been. (chuckling) Okay. So here we go. So here I'm gonna sew this. (machine whirring) (machine whirring) And then I am going to\nuse the correct ruler. Okay. Now, in here you have two Flying Geese, one on each side. What I do is in between the seams, so there's a seam here\nand there's a seam here. I'm gonna clip right in the\ncenter between that seam. And I'm gonna show you why. If you are pressing open you\nwould not have to do that. And I'm gonna show you why. So the first thing I do\nis I'm gonna set my seam so that the friction\npen lines will go away. And so I want to press towards the yellow. So on one side I'm gonna\npress towards the yellow, turn it over, and then this\none's gonna go the other way. And when we trim, that's gonna go away, and I'm gonna show you that. So you do both the same way. You put your ruler right on there. And that's why I didn't\nhave to be so accurate when I was sewing, because\nI'm gonna trim around. So I will trim three sides, making sure when you trim here you don't go too far\ninto this Flying Geese. Actually, I didn't get that very good. Let's see. It's hard to cut when I'm so\nfar away from the table, sorry. You're gonna have to see\nmy hair for a little bit. So you cut three sides and then flip it. And then you use this line. And I use this on all Flying Geese. This is how I make all my Flying Geese. So when I get a pattern,\nwhether it's a Sew Emma pattern, any kind of pattern, any manufacturer, any, I just convert it and figure it out. after years and years of doing it. And then I do mine this way. And from two squares, you\nget four Flying Geese. So from here you would get four, you would get two here and two here from two pieces of fabric. So you waste way less fabric\nand it's always super accurate. You would just need to look on the website what sizes are available\nin the small and the large. And then from there you would just piece it\ninto your block like normal. I don't need to show you all that. But you would just\npiece it in like normal. And so here it is, let's see. - [Lily] That was pretty magical to watch. - Yeah. So it's really fast. That's how I got it all done in one day. So when I tell you guys that\nI sew at home, and I do, can you go to the front? - [Lily] Oh yeah. - Sorry. So when I tell you guys,\nwhen I'm sewing at home, I'll do anything I can to save time. And so this is one of the\nthings that I do to save time. is this ruler. Yeah, love this ruler. So again, here is my table runner. Lori gave me the idea. It's so cute. And on the back, I will show you what I'm\ngonna put on the back. I'll open this one and show you, 'cause I forgot to bring it. It's in my shower. It's in my shower. (chuckling) It's in my shower still. What do you call that? - [Lily] Starching? - Starching, drying from Tuesday. So it's definitely dry by now. - [Lily] So it lots of hanging\nout in the shower by itself. - It's just hanging out in the shower. Hold on. I gotta get this off. There, this is the one on the very bottom. That's what I'm using for the back. And because I think it'd be fun if this, and I'm not even gonna put a label in it, because I just want it to\nbe flat just like this. And then that way I can turn it over. and I will have a reversible table runner. - Ah.\n- Yup. And so not even putting a label on it, because I want to be\nable to use it both ways. And I always put a label on everything. But sometimes you have to improvise. And this is gonna go in my sewing room. So I'm not gonna give it away. So it doesn't have to have a label. - [Lily] Yeah. All right. About the, a question\nabout the Economy block, from Suzanne McCallon, \"When will you do the tutorial on this? \"Or will Lori do on on her channel?\" - So I was gonna film one today. It will be available in a week or two. We still have to edit it. It\ntakes a long time to edit. So, and that's gonna be a long video. So I would say two weeks\nfor sure. Maybe one week. - [Lily] Mm hm. Okay. From Annette Hillison, \"Do you starch these before\nyou make paper foundations?\" - I did. I always starch. - [Lily] And then Gina Tell\nfrom Thread Graffiti says, \"I'll be ready when you are. \"Thanks.\" - Oh my gosh, text me\ntonight to not forget. I probably won't, because\nyesterday I was thinking all day, \"I need to go get that backing fabric. \"I need to go get that backing\nfabric. I need to go get it.\" 'Cause I was cross stitching all day, because on Tuesday I did\nthe quilt and I was like, \"I need to go get the backing fabric. \"I need to go get the binding.\" And I never did. - Aw, she also says--\n- But I will feel bad. - [Lily] \"Hope y'all have\na great holiday weekend. \"Stay safe.\" Thanks, Gina.\n- Thank you. Yeah. We're not gonna do anything. We're just gonna stay home. There's no fireworks in Austin. Sometimes they do them. There's a mall right by\nus, and the mall does them. And we usually watch\nthose from our backyard. So we're not sure if\nthey're gonna do them, but if they do, we'll walk\noutside and watch them. But we're not going anywhere.\nWe're not doing anything. We're just staying home. - [Lily] Yeah. Teresa also had a very\nsweet comment for Ashley. She said, \"Ashley is a great\nbehind the scenes hero.\" - Yes. - [Lily] Ashley is the\nbehind the scenes hero. - And she peeked her head\nin a couple of weeks ago. - [Lily] Yeah. Okay. And then from Virginia Bouvier, who very kindly told me\nhow to pronounce her name by putting a little ghost. - It's like John F. Kennedy's wife. - [Lily] Bouvier, oh yeah. - Yeah. - [Lily] Yeah. You're right. It's from Virginia, she\nsays, \"Hi, Kimberly. \"Can you please tell me\nwhat tea drink you order \"when you go to Starbucks? \"I would like to try it. Thank you.\" - Oh my goodness. Okay. Black tea, no sugar, extra ice, no water. And I'm super picky about my ice. And so if they don't give me enough ice, I won't finish it as fast. I will finish it, but not as fast. So like last night, I\nwent to Starbucks at 8:15, 'cause that's the latest\nyou can order on the mobile. And I was like, \"I need tea.\" And so Emma and I went to Starbucks. But there's one that's\nreally close to the house. And there's one that's 15 minutes. And I've been going to the\none that's 15 minutes away because they do my tea right. The one closer to my house doesn't, and I don't want to be that Karen that's like, did-un-ee, it's just tea. Like I don't need to\ncomplain about the ice. But I just feel like they, and\nthen the one right by work, there's two by work, one does\nit right and one doesn't. So I drive whatever way they're\ngonna make my tea right. And one thing that's pretty interesting that I learned recently,\nI told Lily about this. We did, we met with the dietician about different eating plans\nand stuff for our family. And I kept telling the lady,\n'cause it was like all of us, and I was talking about\nhow certain things, and she was like looking at me. And so she handed all of\nus these little slips, they're like little litmus papers that you would get in\nscience class in 3rd grade. And she was like, \"Taste it.\" And I was like, \"Oh my God!\" I tasted it, and I was\nlike, \"That's disgusting.\" And Kevin was looking at me\nlike, \"It tastes like water.\" And like the other kids,\n\"It tastes like water.\" So for me, and she said,\n\"Okay, that's what's wrong. \"You are a supertaster.\" So she was like, \"Do you like green tea?\" And I said, \"No, I hate it.\" She goes, \"Yeah, that's why.\" And so she was explaining\nto me why certain foods and why I'm so picky. And she was like, \"Can you\ntell the difference in water?\" And I said, \"Yeah, that's\nwhy I don't drink water. \"And I only drink one brand of water, \"'cause some of it tastes funny. And then she was like, \"Well, that's why. And so I told Kevin, I was\nlike, \"Ha ha. That's why.\" Now I have an excuse because\nI'm super picky about like, not so much food, but definitely liquids. And so then it was really\nfun, 'cause that night, I was looking up what\nsupertaster is and all that. But I wish I knew that 30 years ago because I am so picky and\nKevin has made fun of me all these years and now he\ncannot make fun of me anymore because the lady was like, well, this, she explained a lot of things about how green tea and\nbroccoli and asparagus, they have certain enzymes,\nand if you're a supertaster, anyway, if you're a supertaster, it tastes much more strong\nto you than other people. And if you're not a supertaster,\nall water tastes the same. But if you're a supertaster, different things tastes different and certain things you're just like, you have an adverse, 'cause\nit's more bitter to you than if you're not a supertaster. Sorry. - [Lily] No, you're good. Gabriel had the same\nquestion and comment I had. He says, \"What about your\ntwo packets of honey?\" - Oh yes. Stopped. 'Cause I'm getting chubby.\nNo, I stopped the honey. I stopped the honey. I stopped the honey. - [Lily] Oh, stopped honey? - Yeah. - [Lily] Okay, Lauren Milner was asking, \"What iron are you using?\" - This is an Oliso Itouch. We just are about to get\nanother shipment of these in. And it pops up, and I\nuse this at home also. I use the yellow one at home. I think they're all the same, but it pops up, and so I don't have to, you don't ever want to\nlift this if you own this, I'll give you a tip, don't\never put it on its back, because once you do it,\nit almost ruins the iron. I don't know what it is about it. So I get really mad when\npeople come to my house and they think the irons\nthere and they touch it. I'm like, \"Don't touch my iron!\" - [Lily] Yeah. - But it pops up and down\nand it will save your wrist. If you're sewing, like\nfor example, eight hours, it will save your wrist the rotation, which can cause carpal tunnel. And that's why I like it,\nbecause it stays, less movement. - [Lily] Yes. Also from Lauren Milner, \"If I use the 12 inch Foundation Paper, \"would I order a Layer Cake\nor a Petite Layer Cake?\" - Oh, let me see. - [Lily] I think it depends\non how many you want to make? - You would definitely want\nto, you would want a big, you would want a full Layer Cake. And all the pieces are\nLayer Cake friendly, and this one they're\nnot Charm Pack friendly. But definitely a full Layer Cake, 'cause they're gonna be bigger pieces. And so with the six inch I'm able to, from each Layer Cake, make two blocks. From this one you'd only\nbe able to make one. And you might have to, You might, if you wanted your\noutside points to be the same, you would probably have to\nbuy two matching Layer Cakes, or it would need to be Scrappy, just because the pieces are\nmuch bigger on the outside. - [Lily] From Katrina E., \"Could you do a video on\nhow to convert patterns \"to use Triangles on a Roll\nand other special products?\" - So we do have a Triangles\non a Roll conversion chart. and so Ashley can link it\nand that will help you. And it will tell you, if your pattern calls for a\ntwo by four, follow this one, use this paper, or sorry, two by two. So we do have that. So\nI would start there. - [Lily] Last question\nabout Starbucks here. A lot of people are asking,\n\"How do you get black tea \"without adding water to it?\" Since you said you don't add water. - Okay. So that is something\nthat somebody who works here, Cody taught me, she said,\n\"Just, next time you go get tea, \"ask for no water.\" And I said, \"It doesn't make sense.\" But it does if you watch them. So when you go to get\ntea, they will put tea, and then they will put water. So it waters it down\nso it's not as strong. And so it's like, I don't know, Gabriel works at Starbucks\nso he could answer, but it's like a conversion, like so much tea to so much water. But I like my tea super-strong. And I drink so much tea, guys, that if I, if I don't have a tea within\nlike four or five hours of each other, I'll\nstart getting a headache. It's really bad. I need\nto get off caffeine. But I'm not. 'Cause when we went to the\ndietician, the lady was like, \"Okay, everybody needs\nto get off caffeine.\" I was like, \"That's great. \"Everyone in this family can\nget off caffeine, but I'm not.\" I was like, \"Y'all can, but I'm not.\" And they were like, \"That's not fair.\" And I was like, \"Well I do pay the bills.\" - [Lily] That's funny. But yeah, so I think\nthe tea is concentrated? - Yeah, it's just very strong. - [Lily] Okay. And then we have a couple\nof new YouTube members. We had Jennifer Bon, sorry, Bonynge. Let me know if I pronounced\nthat right or wrong. Welcome, Jennifer.\n- Thank you. - [Lily] And then we have\nanother new YouTube member, Karen Dougan. Welcome, Karen. Yay!\n- Thank you. - [Lily] And then we did get a\nSuper Chat from Gabriel here. Gabriel Fuentes, for $1.99 and he says, \"Just get an extra cup ice on the side.\" - Thanks. You know, I do do that. If they don't give me\nenough ice, sometimes. I just really feel bad asking. 'Cause to me it's like, it's just a tea. I don't have to be so picky. But I'm so picky about my\ntea. I think I'm ridiculous. But it's just the one thing. I think it's like my one\nescape right now, especially. It's just like, \"Can I just have my tea?\" (chuckling) So, okay. So I'm gonna show you a\ncouple of other things. We're already at the hour limit, so I'm gonna just show\nyou a couple more things. This week we started\nour Jolly Bar Row Along. And so it is going to make this quilt. And you need the Jolly Bar book to do it. And I'm gonna show you the quilt I made, and I made it a really,\nreally long time ago. So this week we did the\ntop row and the bottom row. - [Lily] Yes, we did a\ntop row and bottom row. - Sorry, I couldn't, and then my backing. This is how I did my backing. - [Lily] Ooh! - With my name in the center. So here I'll show you,\nhere, do the upper camera. So on this quilt you actually do not have very much leftover from your Jolly Bar. So I took these leftover\nfrom corner squares when I did right here. When I did the Spool blocks, when I cut that off of the edge, I saved those pieces and\nturned them into Hour Glass and trimmed them down\nand used this as the row. Because you don't have a\nlot of scraps leftover. So that's what I did for my backing. So that is going on.\nThat started this week. And then I'm just gonna\nshow you some blocks from other people. So these are, I'm gonna do it\non the table, how 'bout that? - [Lily] Sorry, there we go. - [Kimberly] So this is Harvest Road. And Carrie made these. - [Lily] Ooh! - [Kimberly] This is by Layla Boutique. It's pretty, right? I\nlove this collection. It goes really good with Folktale, also. - [Lily] Those are very\npretty, oh my gosh. - [Kimberly] Yeah, very pretty. - [Kimberly] So that is, let me move this off and\nthat would make it easier. Okay, the next one I'll\nshow prettier. Sorry. So that's one option. And we show you all of this so that you can kind of just see\nwhat's available out there and what kind of look you're going for. This one is Catalina.\nAnd Nancy made this one. And you can see on hers, she\ndid all different fabrics, where Carrie did duplicates of fabric. So you can kind of play\nand see what you like best. And so on Carrie's, her top row and bottom row probably match. And so what Nancy did is she\ndid too aqua, two yellow, two Navy, two red, two\ngreen, two light blue, with Catalina by Fig Tree. And then this one is Terry's. And this is Harper's Garden. And this is one of her rows. And this is, the SKU is\n9900-131, and it's a Bella Solid. So hers is gonna be fun and bright. And when you download,\nyou can download this, and this tells you how many\nblocks you're gonna make, what page number to go to, the\nsize, and then what to cut. And of course it doesn't\nhave the sizes to cut 'cause you refer to the book, but this is how you're gonna\nfollow along each week. So we have that. If y'all have any questions\non the Jolly bar Row Along, let me know. A Jolly Bar is a five by\n10 inch cut of fabric. And it's called Jolly Bar,\n'cause my last name is Jolly. - [Lily] Yay. We had a question from Shari Wallin, \"Is it possible to use\nthe Flying Geese method \"that you just showed on\nthe Sparrow Tracks blocks \" in the Jolly Bar Row Along?\" - You cannot because the\nJolly Bar is not big enough. So you have to have those\nbig squares to start with. So what you would do at that point is you would look at your\ninstructions from your ruler, which I don't have right in front of me. And you look and see, and\nif it fits, you can do it. If it doesn't, you don't, you can't. So I'm gonna show you one\nother thing before we, a couple of other things, but this one, I'm just gonna show you. I've already kind of showed you these. This is our Jelly Snowflake. I'm just gonna show you this one today. This one is every Thursday of\nthe week of the month of July. We're gonna be showing a section. So this is the first section.\nThis first video is out. It's a completely free pattern. You can use any Jelly Roll. And we encourage you to use your stash. And so this is how it's\ngoing to be laid out. And you can download this for free. And then I have two\nmore things to show you. So this is a video that we\nreleased earlier this week. It is called 4th of July\nQuilt As You Go Mini. It's not a pattern, but\nit's a video tutorial, because it works much\nbetter as a video tutorial, rather than a paper pattern. And this would be great if you wanted to make something for July 4th. So you quilt as you go. So you can see there's\nno quilting on the top because you have quilted, you have quilted it as you sewed. So that's new. - [Lily] Yeah, Kathrene\nBryant actually says that \"She did this mini flag quilt yesterday, \"and it was so fun and easy. \"It's her first quilt as you go. \"Thank you, Kimberly.\" Thank you. - Yeah, it's fun. And I like that this one is achievable. Sometimes the Quilt As You Go can be hard, And it ends up 13 by 22. The quilt behind me is\nalso a free pattern. This is the free pattern you can download from Fat Quarter Shop. It is\nQuilts of Valor appropriate. So if you are looking to\ndonate to Quilts of Valor, you can make this quilt and\nsend it in to Quilts of Valor, and it fits their guidelines. So Quilts of Valor, you should look it up. It's a great program. They\ngive quilts to Veterans. And they have certain size requirements so that the quilts will be appropriate if somebody is in a wheelchair. So this one finishes 63 by 84. So we have that. And then THE last thing to show you today is we got the brand new Prim\nAurfil 50 weight box in. It's, oh, sorry. It's so pretty. So I'm\ntaking this one home today. I love it. So that's what I have\nfor you guys this week. I am happy to answer any questions. I'm so sorry that it\ntook longer than an hour. I just had a lot of stuff. Next week I am gonna be showing you the Stitchery Sampler quilt,\nthat Joanna Figueroa designed, and we're gonna be doing\na Sew Along with it, but I'm borrowing her quilt. And I'm gonna show you that next week and kind of talk about all\nthe different things with it. - [Lily] Mm hm. I just want to give a quick\nshout out to Marlene Manley. She very kindly sent us\nthis, it's back there. Since we always use\nconfetti cannons on here, she sells it at Hobby Lobby.\nIt says \"Cue the confetti!\" And it's amazing. I love it.\n- Yeah. So we're gonna try to have it on the set, because then it goes with Lily's confetti. - [Lily] Yeah, it's part of\nour Fat Quarter Shop livestream goodness, we love it. Okay. So question from Teresa, \"Is there a way I could buy \"a Block of the Month for a friend?\" - Yes. So when you sign up,\nyou would just put bill to you, and then ship to your friend. And then whatever email address you put in is what's gonna get the\nshipping notification. So if you want the shipping notification, that would be the email, et cetera. If you want her to have it,\nyou would put her email in. - [Lily] Mm hm. Okay. From Sharon Berkemeyer, \"How\nbig is that Jolly Bar quilt?\" - Can you scroll back up? (woman speaking faintly) I don't know. Let me see. Yes I do. 51 by 56. - [Lily] Yay! - Yay! - [Lily] And then from Sue Cleek \"Does this year's Designer\nMystery come in a nice box?\" - The Finishing does and it\nwill ship with month two. We haven't, we are working on\ndesigning 2021's right now. We meaning Jocelyn, not me. I've designed a couple of them, but Jocelyn does most of them. - [Lily] From Amanda\nEdens will there be videos for Stitchery Sampler? - No. Now, it's Joanna's pattern,\nso she might have some stuff. I don't think she's planning on a video. And a lot of times we\nwill have guests come in and do a bunch of videos for us. And obviously right now there's no, I haven't seen a sales rep since March. So we have a no visitor policy. So it applies to that too. - [Lily] Yeah. From Amy Cowan Walden, \"How\ndoes a Sew Along work?\" - So a Sew Along works\nwhere we break it up for you into different sections each week. You can obviously follow that\nor do it however you want, but we release different\nsections each week. And the reason that\nSew Alongs are popular, and the reason that I like them, is it gives you a little\nbit to do each week. So a little bit to look forward to. and then you can take a\nbreak before the next week. And it's just a little\nbit, so if you get behind, you can catch up the next week. And it just kind of breaks\nthe quilts up for you so that you actually finish. 'Cause a lot of times we\nstart and we don't finish. So it kind of sets goals for you. - [Lily] Also, lots of\npeople are wondering if you have found your fabric yet? - I have not found my fabric.\nI have no idea where it is. I keep looking around this room\nthinking I brought it here, but I don't know where it is. And I sewed all day Tuesday,\nand last night I was sewing. I did a little bit of sewing last night and I didn't, I have not found it. - [Lily] Okay. Priscilla Martin says, \"The\nPrim box you just showed \"is not the one she got in her Prim kit. \"Does she need to get this box as well?\" - No. So the Prim Aurfil\nbox is for cross-stitch. This is 50 weight, which is for quilting and piecing and applique. - [Lily] Okay. Okay. And then a few food\ncomments, questions here. From Diana G., \"A quick question. \"Since you are a supertaster,\ndo you like cilantro?\" - No, I hate it. Like if it's, or pico de\ngallo, if it's on my food, and also spicy stuff, jalapenos, I can't. So the other day we went to the pool, and our pool has where you can order food. And so they just have like\na couple of options, right? Like hotdog, hamburger,\ntacos, because it's just, whatever, it's just the pool. So I got the tacos 'cause I thought, well, I don't want a hamburger\nand I don't want a hotdog. And I only ate one of them. And my mouth was burning\nthe rest of the day. And I was like, \"Kevin, do\nyou want the other one?\" (chuckling) Because it just, it had cilantro in it. - [Lily] Yeah. And then the other one was a very interesting fact\nfrom Cindy Greggs-Ecker. She says, \"Kimberly, my\nmassage therapist said \"that honey will make you\nfatter when put in a cold drink, \"but it will help with weight loss \"when you use it in a hot drink. \"I noticed this myself. \"Also really enjoy your program. \"Have a wonderful 4th.\" - Oh, awesome. - [Lily] Yeah. Just a\nvery interesting fact. - Yes. - [Lily] Okay, from\nCharlotte Walker, she says, \"How do you use specialized thread packs \"if you are always using Aurfil 2021?\" - So I will use this on, I,\nokay, so let's be honest. I love Lori and I keep all\nof the things she's done. So if you go into my stash,\nI have all of Lori's things. So I keep it because I\nlike it 'cause it's Lori's. But I would use this if I was appliquing. Or I would just, honestly, I'm gonna put it in my\nsewing room and I'm probably gonna put it like this on a counter. And it's not gonna be used,\nbut I'm gonna look at it. - [Lily] From Jane Bromley, \"Will you be carrying\nthe Clover Wonder Pins?\" - Yes. Okay, let's talk\nabout those Wonder Pins. Okay. So the Clover Wonder Pins\nwere announced last week. I ordered a lot. They're\nshipping next week. They're coming in packs of 20. And they will be used for, you can use them for\nbasting your quilts, mainly. And a couple of you have asked me if they're gonna make\nbigger packs, like a 50. So I emailed the people we buy it from to pass it on to the company. And she said, \"So many people\nhave already asked for it. \"They already know.\" So Clover already knows. So I hope they make bigger packs. But that has definitely been\npassed on to the manufacturer. I have not personally tested those. Usually that would have been\nsomething that at quilt market, we would have been able to see and test. And at least I would be able\nto know a little bit about it, but haven't gotten a\nprototype or anything. But I don't know that I would use them 'cause I don't ever baste. But I have gotten so\nmany wonderful responses. So that's super exciting for Clover that they've come out with a product that people are really looking forward to. - [Lily] Okay, and then we\nhad a new YouTube member, Teresa R. Higashi. Welcome Teresa. - Thank you. - [Lily] Yay, cue the confetti. And then we had a Super Chat\nfrom O7mmartinez for $1.99, and they say \"Kim and Lily make my day.\" Aw, thank you.\n- Thank you. - [Lily] And they say \"Thank you as well.\" Aw, that's so sweet.\n- Aw. So guys have a great July 4th. Be safe, social distance. And I will see you guys next week. - [Lily] All right, bye, everyone.", "0dmClHXQ9X0": "hey what up yo this is too short I'm up here in hotnewhiphop I'm going to show you [Music] [Applause] [Music] I buy this way from a dispensary in LA demence tree from my studio it just so happens they nicknamed this brand Illuminati that's what it's kind of that's pretty goddamn good no yeah I'm an OG guy and not because it's the word oh gee but I just really liked the OG Kush and different strands of OG Kush I really like the original cookies when it first came out put the all the water down cookies they're good and name but I like yeah you know I like flavor so even when I smoke sativas I'll talk about some Skywalker something like something I go more for the flavor than like I want so either get me so high I just like the flavor I'm not really big on edibles unless it's like like an assorted sleeping pill environment like I'm trying to get some rest or just relax I don't can't do edibles in public no I haven't had a bad experience on any drugs ever I'm like I'm really like I either have a high tolerance or I just have the presence of mind not to do too much of whatever I'm doing so a lot of people love that diesel that Sour Diesel my brother smokes to [ __ ] out of that [ __ ] but is that's like [ __ ] soda with no calories or so [ __ ] it's cool though you know I really don't like people never understand what I was saying but there's this weed that a lot of people liking to me it tastes like [ __ ] vegetables or so [ __ ] I don't know what the finally not explain it I can smell them all the way I know I never like to hit it unless it's the only weed in the existence but I don't like it everybody I hang with their smokes smokes they went from Swisher's - you know Swisher's and [ __ ] all those old blunts to the now to the backwoods and and the Leafs and all that so we have the [ __ ] weekly debate about what's better but my philosophy is I smoke joints too that's what I always smoke and when blunts came out well they first when I first got turned on the blood it was probably 92 maybe somewhere in there maybe well in the 92 yeah I thought of the dumbest [ __ ] in the world like I to this day I still think it's kind of stupid man like you take like maybe not the leaf but [ __ ] a blunt like you take a tobacco product and you take the tobacco out of it which you first and foremost you're supporting the tobacco company but you're not even using their product you just want the [ __ ] paper and then you smoke them just the tobacco residue or weed and you you have all these piles of like tobacco laying everywhere you drop them on the floor they fall out to ash tray you fill up the ashtray with tobacco it's in every trashcan the world smells like the [ __ ] then you smoke the bluffs and you [ __ ] you lose like it don't even taste like weed it's like I don't get it man I get the fact that if there's a bunch of heads trying to share it burns better yeah but you know you smoke this junk I'm not letting everybody [ __ ] the room in it I really the first time I smoked some weed it was some fake ass weed a little cheap ass with my brother I was youngest [ __ ] and I hate to [ __ ] like two times and I started pretending like I was drunk and my brother kept saying [ __ ] faking like faking it I thought I was supposed to act that way but some I didn't really like take the weed right away some years later probably like high school I became I was like a high school smoker I am you know it was it was like a lunchtime type of thing you know we just some we like in Oakland you could buy a joint like a pre road joint for a dollar like you could buy three drinks for - that was just some [ __ ] like that it was in the early 80s that was a thing I haven't did a little stand of selling some joints I used to sell joints to get extra money like you could buy a a five or ten dollar bangle we all right I'm gonna take the trade a five dollar version you could buy when I was in high school I could have five dollars in my pocket literally likes to sell cassette tapes and all these little husband's and I could just like not be broke so for weed money I was like okay it'd be early in the morning I'm not getting out to sell tape ship before the school so I take five dollars I go to the homies housewife right on the bag of weed I break the weed down and I roll up maybe like twelve joints so I could sell you three for to like get me to like 84 like I just I just anything to make double to get $10 back or some [ __ ] like that so and you just like just walk through the day like that man I go to Radio Shack and buy a three cassette tapes a little cheap tapes of something for like $2.99 you get three tapes and I go duplicate some [ __ ] and go sell those three tapes for five dollars a pop and I'd be selling a little bit couple joints on the way and it's always have money and anyone a [ __ ] work fast food and then like this you know do you have any rollin tips I know I don't like to use tips I really know but it always argued with me about the [ __ ] tip rollin the putting the little crutches in there and glass tips I'm like oh I'll just I'm from the day we use it rollin joint and smoke us up we argue about the blunts and the joints I've compromised somewhere along the line but 20 years ago maybe a little longer than that I stopped smoking zigzags and I started smoking the Rizla which is a is some kind of licorice flavored paper or something that's like candy licorice but it uh it only serves one purpose with me cuz I could smell raw papers I could smoke zigzags I just smoked these because I hang around a lot of blood smokers and it just kind of eases their whole psyche of me not smoking a joint so nobody really notices when you smoke brown joints versus I can I could break out a pack of zigzags or a pack of raw papers they like oh you smoke them joint since this car man it's always somebody notices if you smoke these it's just you just blend in and people go let me hit that blend them like miles personal homie and can't get this one I like to roll no crutches no none of that stuff I like and actually people say they like to put the crutch of the tip in there stick your smoke all the way right but I don't do that because I love the doobie world you know like I love my roaches I love to like that moment where it's very rare but that moment where you just don't have we or the weed that in the room at the moment is kind of shitty I'm like you know what I got some [ __ ] doobies from like good weed that's better than [ __ ] y'all smoking I'm just gonna tap into my doobies and smoke that I love it so you get you get big doobies than when I roll it so my technique is some people just they've even joint smokers they be like don't [ __ ] use a lot of [ __ ] paper like they were a big fat ass joint with one paper I do the one-and-a-half technique cuz I'm I like it to burn a certain way so I was like they'll have to pay forward and I tend to I don't do it always but people say do you realize you just rolled a joint without looking in like four seconds and like dinner it's something I I don't need to I could roll a joint in the rain with no umbrella outdoors tending in the rain with no one brother a lot I'm talking on the phone I can roll the joint while I'm driving a stick shift and traffic talking on the phone seriously and pull it off you have on these pop it open just keep it on you just hose one blunt one joint mmm but y'all smell it fast you pop that up when I wrote this ever and you need to see it is like a [ __ ] magician so this is another thing I want to show you the weed before I rolled it because it was about the same amount of weeds you might put in the blunt but the only thing is you're gonna smoke all that tobacco and all that extra [ __ ] paper and pass it all around everybody in the room and I'm just this right here I could uh I could smoke that I could smoke that thing all day like in like I'm not a [ __ ] Snoop Dogg smoker when we blaze all day this just like a little leftover in one of these I've been smoking on this all day I just hit it three four times four or five times put it out keep a little pre-roll on me ready to go somewhere you know my infamous move is uh I don't excuse myself I just disappeared and I find like you know be somewhere like real corporate or something and I'll be in the staircase smoking hella weed any [ __ ] where before the airport is got outside we used to do it at the airport before before the Gulf War [Music]", "m4jJsseY2Ic": "- Today we gonna make packing\nlunch for work or school a bit more fun because\nwe're using bento boxes. Bento boxes are easily\ncustomizable with compartments that you can fill with a\nvariety of ingredients, colors, and textures to create healthy balanced meals that you can enjoy on the go or at home. And because bento boxes\nare normally eaten cold or at room temperature, this cuts out a hefty\nchunk of cooking time. In fact, there's just\na couple of ingredients that are cooked in meal\nprep in today's video, the rest just require a little\nbit of chopping and assembly and you are done. And because bento boxes are great for both kids and adults alike, I'm happy to have a few extra hands helping me in the kitchen today. Let me introduce you\nto my niece, Nicolette, and my nephew, Nathan. I'm excited to partner with\nMonbento on today's video as they have so many amazing options when it comes to bento boxes. And I say we just dive right in so I can show you some of those options and a whole bunch of tasty meals. I've got two different\nbento box sizes today; Monbento's MB original, which is rectangular in size, and their MB square, which is taller and bigger\nfor those extra hungry. But I think it's helpful\nto see them side-by-side. Each of the bento boxes is two layers, which is perfect for a\nmain meal in one container and snacks and the other to\nkeep you full all day long. And there's a separate food cup that's perfect for nuts, dips and spreads. You can also get separate sauce cups for dressings or nut butters or things that you wanna keep\na lid on so it doesn't spill. But the great thing is that you don't have\nto worry about leaking with these bento boxes as they're air tight and leak proof when you close the silicone seal. So once they're full, just\nstack them on top of each other, add the cutlery which fits\nunder the lid perfectly, and add the elastic strap. This very lightweight container is now ready to go wherever you may go, and there's tons of\ndifferent color options to suit your personality. And just for my down shifters, I do have a discount code\nlisted in the description box. The first bento box we're making today features a Greek salad, and Nikolett is already hard at work slicing and dicing one large cucumber. I should also mention that\nfor all of the bentos today, I specifically chose salads\nthat you can meal prep. That means you can make a\nfull batch as we're doing and enjoy it over several days. And a quick reminder, the principle recipes for\neverything I'm showing today are in the description box below. So, add the cucumber\nto a large mixing bowl and then slice a pint of\ncherry or grape tomatoes and add those to the bowl as well. Remove the seeds and stem\nfrom a green bell pepper and then slice and dice it into chunks about the same size as\nthe cucumber and tomato. Thinly slice half of a red onion, add it to the bowl, and add four ounces of Feta cheese. You can use store-bought Feta crumbles or buy a block of Feta and\ncut it into small chunks. And lastly, add 1/2 cup of pitted and\nsliced Kalamata olives. To make the best homemade\nGreek salad dressing, add 1/3 cup red wine\nvinegar to a small bowl along with the juice of one lemon, one of Dijon mustard, two minced garlic cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. And while Nikolett is stirring that, I'll add 1/2 cup of olive oil and she'll keep stirring\nit until it's emulsified. The great thing about this salad and the others I'll show you today is that they're really durable. So feel free to add the\ndressing ahead of time. Give the salad a good stir to make sure everything is well combined and then add a portion to your bento box. (upbeat music) In the snack side of this bento, I'll add one hard boiled egg with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. I have a separate video on how\nto make perfect boiled eggs, but it's really easy. And you know, hard boiled eggs are always in my meal prep rotation. To make them, gently add a few eggs to a pot of boiling hot\nwater with a skimmer. Let them cook for 12 to 14 minutes and then remove them to an ice water bath. After the eggs have fully cooled, you can store the rest in\nthe fridge for the week and add one to your bento box for lunch. Next to the egg, Nikolett\nis adding a couple spoonfuls of my homemade hummus, which she's obsessed with, and a little sprinkle of paprika. To make the hummus, just add two 15 ounce\ncans of drained chickpeas to a high powered blender with 1/3 cup of the aquafaba\nor liquid from the cans, 1/2 cup of tahini, 1/4 cup of olive oil, the juice of two lemons, two garlic cloves, one teaspoon of cumin\nand 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the lid, blend it on high for about 30 seconds or until it's nice and creamy. And that's how ridiculously easy it is to make homemade hummus that\nyou can enjoy for the week. To finish off this bento, I'll add several celery\nsticks to scoop up the hummus, and this Greek salad bento is done. (upbeat music) The next spinto features\nmy zucchini noodle caprese and baked chicken. Nikolett is spiralizing\nthe zucchini noodles. And for a full batch of this recipe, you'll need three to four zucchini. Once they're spiralized, add them to a mixing bowl along with eight ounces of\nsmall balls of mozzarella. Unfortunately, they didn't have the really small mozzarella\nballs in the market, so she's just cutting some\nof the bigger ones in half. And then at eight ounces\nof cherry or grape tomatoes also sliced in half. Now, what makes this recipe taste amazing is the fresh homemade basil pesto, which is so much more\nflavorful than store-bought. To make the basil pesto, just add two tablespoons of pine nuts and 1/4 cup of raw cashews that you've lightly toasted\nto a food processor. Then add one packed cup of basil leaves, two garlic cloves, 1/3 cup of olive oil, one teaspoon of lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a little black pepper. Blend that until it's fairly smooth, but still has a little bit of texture. And you may need to scrape down the sides as you process it as well. This is the perfect amount of pesto for this doodle caprese salad, but if you're making\nan individual portion, you can always freeze any leftover pesto. So give that all a stir to combine and then add it to one container and you can top it off\nwith fresh basil leaves if you want to be extra fancy. (upbeat music) In the other container, I'll add a handful of baby arugala and then top that with\nmy baked herb chicken. I've shown you how to make this before on my very first meal prep video, but here's what you do. Just lightly oil both sides of a couple of boneless,\nskinless chicken breasts in a casserole dish. Sprinkle those with salt and\npepper and your favorite herbs. I usually do a blend of basil,\nparsley, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder. Bake the chicken in a 425\ndegree Fahrenheit oven for about 18 to 22 minutes, depending on how thick your pieces are, then remove them from the oven, let them rest for a minute\nor so and thinly slice them. I already meal prep to\nthis batch of chicken the night before, so it's easy to just add some cold chicken on top of my frugal now. I'll also use some of\nthe Greek salad dressing from the first bento box, and you can either drizzle\nthis directly over the chicken or use one of Monbento's sauce cups. Lastly, in the small food cup, I'll add a handful of\nraspberries and blueberries, and bento box number two is now done. (upbeat music) Our third bento box features\na tuna salad sandwich along with sweet and salty snacks. To make the tuna salad, Nathan is adding a can of drained\ntuna fish to a mixing bowl along with 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, one stock of celery that's been diced, two tablespoons of dried onion, one tablespoon of chopped parsley, 1/2 tablespoon of Dijon mustard and some salt and pepper. And I'm just over here\ntrying to get Nathan to break his very serious\nconcentration phase. Once that's all in the bowl, stir it together and add it to some\ngluten-free sandwich bread with baby spinach, or you can place it in lettuce\nor colored green leaves for a tuna salad wrap. I also love to add slices of fresh avocado to tuna salad sandwiches. So I'll layer those on top, add the top piece of bread, and slice the sandwich in half. The great thing about\nthe MB square bento box is that they're deeper, which\nis perfect for sandwiches. And next to the sandwich, Nathan is adding some plantain chips. Plantain chips have surged in popularity the last couple of years, and you can now find\nsome store-bought options with clean ingredients, but they're also really\neasy to make at home. Just peel a plantain that's a\nlittle bit on the green side and use a mandoline to slice it on the\nthinnest setting possible. Add all of the slices to a small bowl and drizzle a little\navocado oil or olive oil. Give them a gentle toss to\nmake sure they're all coated, and then place them on a\nparchment lined baking tray. And I usually need two\ntrays for all of the slices. Then sprinkle them with a little sea salt, bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 20 minutes or until they're just\ngolden along the edges. And that's it, homemade plantain chips. And with those chips, this container is now done. For the other container, Nathan is making my\nmelon mozzarella salad, and I think he specifically\nchose the salad because he just wanted\nto use the melon baller. So after I showed him how to use it, he's on a roll making lots of\nlittle cantaloupe melon balls. Now, of course you don't\nhave to make little balls, you can just slice the cantaloupe\ninto bite-sized pieces, but I think I trust him much\nmore with the melon baller than with a knife, and he's doing a great job. So after he's finished up one cantaloupe, he's going to create little balls from one honeydew melon as well. Next we'll add 1 1/2\ncups of mozzarella balls, and I'll just quickly slice these in half and add them to the bowl. Then I'll toss in two\ncups of fresh blueberries and one cup of basil leaves, and you can always chop\nthese smaller if you'd like. For a quick dressing, add 1 1/2 tablespoons of\nolive oil to a small bowl along with 1/2 teaspoon\nof white balsamic vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of honey and\na little salt and pepper, then give it a stir and\ndrizzle it on the salad. It's a simple dressing, but really helps to enhance all\nof the flavors of the fruit. So give it a stir and then\nadd it to the container. (upbeat music) And in the food cup, I'm just gonna add a half a cucumber that I've sliced up for Nathan, and this bento box is now done and ready to be placed\nin the transport bag for easy carrying. (upbeat music) For the last bento box, we're making smoked salmon pinwheels and some very tasty nibbles. To make the pinwheels, Nikolett is spreading\nsome herbs goat cheese on one of my homemade\ncassava flour tortillas. Once that's in a nice thin layer, she's adding a handful\nof baby spinach leaves and spreading those out, and then topping the\nspinach with smoked salmon, which just has so much flavor. She'll then roll the tortilla\nas tightly as possible and he'll give her a little help here, and then she'll slice it\ninto about one inch pieces. The end pieces always go\nstraight into my mouth as they're fairly empty, and the rest will go into the bento box on top of a handful of spinach. And that's container number one. (upbeat music) For the second container, Nikolett is making my watermelon\ncucumber and Feta salad, which is perfect for summer. It's just five cups of cubed watermelon, two large cucumbers that\nhave been peeled and diced, and 1 1/4 cups of cubed Feta. The dressing is one\ntablespoon of olive oil, the juice of one lime and one teaspoon of honey. And after a quick stir that will get drizzled on the salad after adding two tablespoons\nof freshly chopped mint leaves. I'm such a fan of simple\nfruit salads like this, and it's great because it will definitely\nlast the entire week. (upbeat music) In the last food cup, we'll add my macho pistachio bliss balls. And to quickly make those, Nikolett will add 3/4 cup of raw cashews to a food processor along with\n1/4 cup of raw pistachios, 12 pitted Medjool dates, 1/4 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut, two teaspoons of matcha powder and one tablespoon of coconut oil. And then blend that for about a minute or until it's finally chopped\nand start sticking together. Then we'll use a cookie scoop\nto scoop out balls of mixture and roll it between our hands to create evenly-sized bliss balls. This recipe makes about 14 balls, and once all of those are done, we'll roll them in more\nchopped pistachios. That's the final container, and Nikolett has a cherry\nblossom carrying bag to match her cherry blossom bento box. (upbeat music) I hope you guys enjoyed these\nfour bento box lunch ideas.

see i'm going to put the color on the bottom left hand side of the page as i progress through this image i am going to go ahead and keep the speed on this image i will pause at each color so you can see what color i'm adding the whole point of this image was to go ahead and try to make it look as close to the cover as possible i looked at the cover when i originally got the book and i thought wow maybe i can make this work with distress inks and i had never tried to do distressing for the entire image in a coloring book before so i thought this was a pretty good challenge so again my main goal was trying to make sure that i got this picture to look as close to the cover as i could it was really fascinating for me to go back and watch this as i was editing it and see the progression of what i had done with this image you know when you're actually working on the image it takes you a really long time i think this image took me more than 10 hours so to watch it back in you know 20 minute increments was kind of amazing i hope that you all can enjoy it as much as i did i will post my finished image on my facebook page at sh art online if any of you are also working on images from kirby

catch-all goodness here I have added a planner to my lineup so in my last video I talked about four different planners I was going to use and I've added a fifth so I don't even know I don't even know if I am able to keep up with all those planners I have three in here right now and so I'll be moving things out but yeah so if you're interested in how this whole thing is set up just stay tuned okay so I'm gonna move this out of the way and just first go over real quick my planner set up my different planners so okay here we go let's start with my catch-all and not catch all my daily planner so this is gonna be like all of my two dues things I have to do every day the actual planner is one that I created myself this used to have a choose happy cover I've changed out the cover and the discs because I'm going to start putting my personal development type stuff in the back of this planner I used to have a complete home long-term storage planner that was really bulky and big and I never ended up using it the way I wanted to so what I decided to do was to take out all the pieces that were in side of that home planner and put it into their individual respective planners for each topic so this is my daily so my daily is like anything I'm working on whether it be my freelance right now my Etsy shop social stuff anything I need to focus on for the day as well as home stuff like errands and things like that that's what's going to go in here and it is a horizontal planner so I've shown this before it is actually one of my own printables from my Etsy shop squared plans and it's C and it's very neutral I'm really excited about and I just did showed you guys this spread your in a previous video and so the week is here and I haven't even touched a week yet and it is it is Sunday the the day before so it's the 29th and I'm just so behind I took a little vacation things are all off so I have no nothing ready to go for next week I'm not set up I just I don't even know so anyway I'm going to figure that out but I this is the daily planner and I push this lovely cover that used to be on my home long term planner it on the front of that it's not so I changed out the Rings did that and then I added in my personal development section so this all was in my home before and it's just basically all the things that I keep long-term like old goals or goal-setting ideas ideas for you know my just for my self you know things that I am working on creatively or professionally research things I've you know watch tutorials or on or like I'm learning photography so learning you know about lighting and and the right settings and things like that that goes in there and then professional is things that are directly related to my graphic design career in business all of that is in there and there's a couple of nice you know gold folders that I got and oh that might have been a oh I don't know anyway so but this is now going to live at the back of the unused planner for 2020 instead of being in a separate planner and that way I know anything having to do with kind of my daily personal development type stuff will be in here so this is planner one I'm gonna set it to the side next let's talk about health since this is the second topic in my catch-all which you'll see so this looks much the same as in the last video I didn't change it much other than I believe I added yes I haven't added it yet but I will be adding my health long-term storage in here as well that will include all of the stuff from this previous year 2019 goals you know like measurements things like that anything that I don't need in my catch-all but is related to health that'll go in the back of this and this guy is again another one of my printables I had a really hard time finding a layout that I really liked for health this year so I decided to create my own and I made it super minimal and I did again show this already this is the first spread for the year getting me all set up and then like I said I'm not ready at all for next week so empty but this is the actual layout how it looks and I'm really excited about it super clean super functional you know I can basically do whatever I want color wise and it's gonna look great so excited about that I also added two more water droplets on the side from the healthy hero spread so I have 10 which is awesome so I can go 100 ounces 10 ounces a piece or you know it just gives me more options for how I want to track my water because I was always kind of I don't know waffling on what what each droplet was going to signify so I have that there and then yeah so I'm really excited about that and I discussed in my last video how I took old dividers reused them and then I'm just taking the pages that I made in my printable and I'm sticking them down to the old divider so that I have dividers with to use with my printables it's just you know trying to use some of the older stuff and so I think that's gonna work out great so this is my health planner which will go in my catch-all as well it's starting to stack up guys okay so and we'll go into my social so this is the third section of my current freakin plan planner it is is not this planner here so this is a 2020 cover that is actually the guts of it are in the faith planner I changed out this cover because I changed my faith cover and I thought this one fit better with the social kind of look and feel that I was going with it's the homebody that's actually inside of this planner so you'll see I don't know how much I've set up in here but it's actually the homebody planner which doesn't go with this cover but I still like the way that they coordinate they kind of have similar feels to me and I just I don't know I just liked this cover a lot so I decided to use this one instead so a little cover shuffle and it came with gold discs with the homebody I changed about four black discs because I've been trying to put the gold discs on things that that need them which you'll see so yeah so since this is kind of only gonna be in and out of maybe once or twice a month it's it doesn't need to be as durable and the plastic disc discs won't work like so I do have my January set up but I'm gonna show you because then you guys will know what's coming up and I keep some mystery you guys and yes so this is kind of the start of the layout but I haven't gotten that far and I've got some ideas but I'm just trying to work out how I'm going to use this page and you know I've been doing dashboard for a while on my social but it's kind of figuring out how this is going to look so anyway this is this setup for my social it'll be a dashboard layout and looking forward to getting into this again long term stuff is in the back so things I'm not currently needing in my catch-all but I might need to reference in the future kind of go in this little miscellaneous folder back here and that's where that will live so that's my social setup going on to faith so this was the brand new one I talked about in the last video I'm starting to get kind of hand over here already so this is a brand new one that I talked about in the last video and I replace the cover so I had this cover it came from a happy notes from a long long time ago not a long time ago maybe like beginning of 2009 and it was just so pretty I love the watercolor flowers and then rejoice in the Lord or just not that fit so perfectly with faith I actually picked up some gold rose gold metal discs because this guy is a bit chunky I do see myself using this for not just for grabbing the calendar out which I'll pull up there so this is the actual planner which goes with this cover which makes sense if you look at it so the guts came from this cover planner but it's now my faith minor and I have a don't think I've started anything in here yet either so the layout I'm trying to work out how I'm gonna use it but the layout is monthly and so I have some notes here which I'll talk about a little bit more I don't want to get into that quite yet and daily tasks and my idea is to write down the verse of the day each day on these in these sections because I believe there's 31 of these included each month I'm gonna have to count that though 824 yeah 31 and then they have the notes page so have that that I'm still kind of figuring out how I'm gonna use it but I got some ideas as you could see and I'll talk about those in a minute I also put all of the faith guts that I had in my home planner in this planner now so that's why I put it all in the more durable rings because I do see myself kind of getting more into it I have Bible studies in here I have like scripture when I'm you know practice writing and and things like that and also scripture guides I also have like Bible study guides and notes and all of these folders to this folder here this folder and the guides and notes folder all of these came with that happy notes that you see the cover of so it just it just is yeah I just love that I love all of this watercolor it's very beautiful and so I wanted it all to be together I also have a bunch of these pages from that happy notes that I haven't used and I didn't really have another place to store them but I did want to keep them together with the faith so they're all gonna kind of live here together as one and happy harmony anyway so that is my face planner I'm really decided to get into that this year and finally there is the brand-new one to the lineup which I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with you guys but I'm gonna give it a try because I really love the layout this cover used to be on the daily that you saw earlier so now this is the home and budget kind of thing so that's what's gonna go in this planner and I just won this in the giveaway happy planner had going on on IG and it could not believe that I won I never win anything the planner looked like this before so this is the planner I got I got a planner babe and it's got these beautiful purple discs which I'm repurposing again so cover and just went somewhere else we'll talk about that in a second this guy is the the guts of the planner Bay which is a vertical layout now you guys know I'm not a fan of vertical layouts they're hard for me they're just this is a little bit awkward so I don't know like I said I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep up with this but the guts like I said are from this planner babe planner that I just won and I really love the aesthetic of it it's really cute and colorful and I just like the clean fonts that they used and the disks everything's adorable so I decided to keep it and try to make it work into my lineup so my idea is to use the monthly for budgeting so just because I have a little mini that I've been using for budget planning for the last six months that has worked out pretty well so we'll see if that works for this and then I don't know here are you guys I'm thinking maybe I can do I don't know I'm still not sure I'm still not sure if I'm how many use this or I might not even end up using it I might just use the monthlies because the monthlies are cute and they got some really cute dividers so we'll see but you know Furcal is always a challenge to me and so I even though I love the layout I love it it's black and mostly neutral in in many ways I just I don't know how I'm gonna use it but for now that's the plan okay so those are those planners and then finally I have this one here which is my lettering it's not really a planner but it's just going to be my lettering space so I took the cover in the disks from the planner babe and basically set it up for practicing and samples and lettering because I want to do more of that as well as bullet journaling so I have lots of extra paper in the back and some stencils and things to just try things out so that's what this printer is going to be all about all right so that's the lineup and I will set up my catch-all here in a second so so many so many so yeah so stay tuned okay so let's get to it here is my catch-all planner and I'm going to keep the same rings I just love these gold rings I'm just gonna show you guys kind of an example of the newer gold color or know if you guys can see the difference but it's a lot oranger and so I am using these rings because I really love the tone of the gold so I'm not going to change those I'm gonna keep those on my pet role as well as my favorite cover this hello beautiful cover which I got ages ago and still I'm rocking in love okay so there's that first step the way it's currently set up I've got my pencil pouch which will stay and then I have a new order so I'm gonna kind of put that to the side I have some notes for myself throughout so that I can do this on camera and not lose my mind I was like trying to figure out how I wanted it to be set up and you know sometimes just thinking things through can be tiring so I didn't want to do that on camera I wanted to kind of have a plan for you guys so that's what we're gonna do so we're gonna keep the pencil pouch we're gonna keep the sticky dash which is just some I don't know what kind of paper this is maybe acetate I don't know anyway I just think it sticks better with the sticky so I have that here and I'm using my little clear photo corners to stick it to the back of this card stock so it's kind of one cohesive piece gets a little bit more structure I'm going to keep that and then my goal section so I had a different eye on my last video I had put in this bookmark here I did like that but it was the only one that was one of these shorty bookmarks and so I wanted it to be consistent all the way throughout when I won that giveaway again about the giveaway pretty awesome I want all this planner babes stuff there was a set of dashboards in there so I changed it out with that for this and I think this will work really nice I just like the rainbow effect and most importantly it had this very first tab so all of my daily and monthly not daily and monthly weekly and monthly tabs are here and that anything's perf lists will be either on this side or on this side which you'll see will be coming so we're gonna leave this here and I think for now I'm going to keep the goals at the front so we'll just ignore that so goals will stay and then I have my goals section which I've rearranged a bit so we'll keep that so let me just see yes I have my vision board and then now I put some photo corners on it so that I could go straight to my 2019 review and 2020 goals both of these I have videos on this and the vision board and this whole goal section actually is pretty much all in my goal-setting series so if you're interested in finding out how all of these were made go ahead and check that out and then on the back I don't have anything on the back and then we've got my first project sheet which this will be a priority this year and then opening an Etsy store was my other project which I've done it was pretty exciting and still working on it you guys I'm hoping to get some new sizes in sooner than later hopefully before this video launches and then I'm just gonna keep trying to add to it piece by piece so if you're interested in minimal designs that's where it will be and then maybe in the future I'll do some more designing stuff style of things but for now minimal and neutral is where it's at at my store so if you're looking for those check that out create an online portfolio again this is kind of my task sheet which will help keep me going as I get through it so I have that all set up and ready to go although I do need to fill out a lot of stuff here and then I didn't look for my Etsy store to help me get to where I wanted to go and it worked out really nicely you guys I got a lot of stuff done and in the time frame I was hoping to so that was that was great I also have my habit tracker ready to go for 2020 and so I'll be digging into this very very soon and on the back I need to fill it out I think I'm gonna use this guy for reading because I want to read more in 2020 as well that's one of my 2020 goals so I'll be filling that out and using those to have a track those two goals next up I have my happy day morning routine which I did a long time ago in June and then just refreshed recently to kind of help me get on track with you know all my goal setting for 2020 and then I also did kind of a preliminary layout of my master schedule of how I will use each day and make time for my goals and also for the gym and and everything else I have going on in my life and okay so now we are at the spot where things are you're going to be added so I have some notes for myself I'm thinking to add faith as the very first thing since that's gonna be the thing I'm gonna do first thing in the morning and then also I need to add in a perpetual calendar that said let's get into the faith planner and grab out the very first month and I did put in it's the perpetual calendar from this one previously but I took it back out because I got that planner babe planner and I really love that perpetual calendar so we'll be adding those in so let me just grab this whole section and then this will be faith here but retro will go before that and let me take out hold on sorry I'm thinking thanks for as I do it so faith is gonna go here so let me get the calendar first from planner baby but which would be here I almost don't have enough room for all this stuff you guys so this is the perpetual calendar that will go in front so after my goal section should I put it in front of my goals what do you guys think yeah let's do that because then I'll know exactly where it is it's always gonna be behind my stickies then we'll go the yearly stuff and then move in to move into the goals section okay so enough let's do that real quick so now it's going to be my planner page my planner front page the year at a glance and these two perpetual calendars which I just love oh you can't even see it I'm sorry let's try this again okay so now it's going to be the front page the year to glance perpetual and yeah alright alright give me a second to change the lighting here that way it's not so bright okay so yeah so lots of fun there then we'll get into goals and I like how the rainbow kind of just all goes together goals and then now we are in two faiths so I'm gonna be putting in dashboards in a minute but for now we'll just put the sections in and move stuff out got that in and so we're going to move out daily so Daly's gonna come in next let's see I also have lost track of which one holds what so many things there it is that's not here okay so this is the daily so we'll put in this whole month so I keep a month at a time in my catch-all from each of the planners it just seems to work out best for me I did I was thinking about putting these whole thing on expander discs but I just couldn't bring myself to do it I just can't handle how big they are they're just they're massive you guys so I move those to the expander discs that I did have out of my home planner since it doesn't exist anymore and I put them on my recipe planner which is where I needed it and so that's where they're gonna live going forward I'm going to keep these on my catch-all and so since this is now my daily I'm gonna pull up this dashboard this guy out of here and put it in yes your daily month so I still need to add in the faith dashboards but there's gonna be some dashboard moving around so we'll just get to it we get to it so come back to that got that and then I'll move in the weekly let me move out everything I've got so far okay and then again I have more notes to myself so let me so this will go away and be put into the yeah so that'll be put into the long-term storage this one will be put in here and remove this board to the weekly which isn't ready not gonna lie you guys I have a little bit of an anxiety about not having a decorated spread ready to go for tomorrow what am I gonna do maybe I'll try that hole as you go planning thing just that very first week see how it goes I don't know it's not really my style you guys know how I like to do things but since I don't have anything ready maybe that's what it's gonna come to so anyway so that's where we're at and then I'll do a flip through all the way through kind of the new setup as I go but so daily is now in here took out that month put in this month and now I have a pocket folder which used to divide my daily from my health section but I'm going to do some swap out because I have so many new sections in here that I am going to take this guy and I'm actually going to remove the pin pouch or pit pouch the pin holder I'd like to keep them on these folders because I feel like you can move them around a lot easier and they come up pretty clean I don't have any residue or anything like that that just came off of that and they stick well so it was affirmed the happy planner they're harder to find nowadays but I will include links to all of this stuff in my description below so I'm going to retire this folder from the setup and maybe move it into somewhere else because another benefit of that giveaway was some planner babe accessories and they had these cute folders included so I think I'm gonna use one of these and I think I want to use maybe this I like the planet paper one alright we're gonna use a green one put the head back on yeah and that works well cuz it has black and so the black will work with the black lines on this planner folder sure it's straight there we go let me stick it so I want to move this guy now to the front since it's not going to be a separator any longer I just gotta figure out where in the front maybe behind my goals section yeah let's put it here okay so now I have a pocket folder there kind of near the front and in front of my faith then two daily and now we're into health okay getting there we're getting there you guys okay so now I have my health section which is led by this pocket pages healthy habits type of I don't know creative thing I did back in the beginning of last year I did not do a video on this it was before I had started my youtube channel but I will be doing something similar for the faith section so we can talk about it more when I get to it in the next couple of weeks so stay tuned I'll show how I did all this and how I'm gonna do something similar for the faith but yeah so right now it's got that and then it's kind of holding my December goals kind of talked about how this page was always kind of odd to me in monthly health that I just did for January because I always had to kind of keep it but it was also had the back of a weekly spread so I was sticking it together with this little arrow but I am retiring this style of goal setting for 2020 and I'm gonna be setting my goals on my monthly so this is going to go into storage and then I have my whole December and still working on the weights but I'm close to the end and so I'm gonna pull that up as well as this week which I haven't even filled out yesterday's but yeah so all of us is going away and I'll make sure I get this filled out before I actually archive it and then you guys can see that full thing when I do a 20-19 flip through each of those daily and health planners so stay tuned for that but all of this will be retired so I'm gonna go ahead and put that to the side so you can see that I had some dashboard shuffle because I was running out of dashboards to use so I'm think I'm moving a health month to faith month since have another idea for the health one so you just pull off this label hopefully I can get it off clean almost doesn't really matter I'm gonna put another label on top but would you like to pick up stuff all right well I'll clean it up a little bit later so this is going to go to faith so we'll move that forward and I like to have my month tabs to be the center and then my outside tabs to be the week that's how this will be set up then back over here and this guy is going to stay for the work I think we'll see we take off this guy as well okay so health section is next let me grab that one put that in okay that one alright so this is the section I was telling you about that will be moved into the actual health planner right now it has a few things that I currently have in keeping track of so my measurements and you guys have seen me kind of set up some of these DIY sheets and then this is like super old measurements so I'm going to stick gonna grab all of this move it into here this guy did not go in cuz it's a card has like old measurements from before I started planning and then this is the guy I just made so I'm gonna keep this but now I'm gonna keep anything having to do with like health goals and stuff just in the front and before the month so it will be these and then we'll stick those kind of like DIY sheets in the front here okay so now I can put that away next is health so we've got daily week so health I need to figure out where those dashboards will be we'll get to those so let's move on so that used to be just health and then we go straight into social all right so this is my social section and again there used to be actually this folder was here before and I moved it I think before I figured out what I was gonna do when I was trying to work through how this was gonna be set up so yeah so this is going to move farther back so I'm going to move this behind all of the five planter sections and so that will be a separator between it and the kind of I don't know what you call this side of stuff my dividers and stuff where I keep things I'm currently working on in these topics okay so social so um let me go ahead and grab out you guys have seen some of the stuff so I'm just going to pull this guy off and then pretty much yeah this and this last section okay so now we just have the dividers so this will be put in the archive for 2019 and let's see what else we gonna do okay so this is the faith daily dashboard now and I know some of these are kind of odd like I was going back and forth so many times trying to figure out which dashboard would work with what layout and faith kind of got being less than happy kind of got the that's what I'm looking for just like the things that we're at the bottom of the list so I really like this planner the dashboard but it doesn't really go with a lot of the themes that I have currently going on in my planner so I ended up here so we'll see so this will be the faith daily divider and then we'll have this end that week daily month I'm going to go back out here to social so this will remain a social month and I really like it because it I'm gonna real able it though so I'm gonna pull that label off I really like it because it's all clear and I keep that as well as an all clear one in my daily month and almost all clear one in I'll show you guys yeah so this one has a little bit of dots and then this one has nothing because I like to see the full spread in certain sections so that's why I really like that one here and I wanted to keep that one there alright so let's go to social social is I believe this guy right yes and I have them all labeled and I should just check the label but yes so suddenly my social section we just grab all that you guys got a little preview there so this will be social month to that really quick so you guys hopefully didn't catch what I have planned for you coming up and then I'll just flip it and do that fill out social week oh I kind of showed you already alright so social week I kind of figure out what is coming for that dashboard oh there we go alright so then I had this dashboard that I got with that journaling stencil pack which I'm gonna use here for social cuz again it's mostly clear which I like and I feel like these flowers go with the home body aesthetic so that'll be that and then I'll label it social week whoo all right so those are three sections I got two more to go let's go to oh wait no it's four sections could I move faith in front so now we only have left the new section that I'm still in limbo about but the budget work section so that will go here got that and yeah so this is going to be work week so this will go here and then do I have another one okay so this one I have in store for budget put that one in here yeah and then I will go back to health since I have to put in there so this is now going to be budget my budget health month and then health week [Applause] okay I think I got it so all the weeks are here on this tab to the left just go quickly yeah and all of the months are here on the center tabs which is how I like it although it was a little bit easier when I just had three we'll see we'll see if this remains and then the last dashboard I have to add in is let me skip forward to this guy my notes section so just basically where I keep all my note paper and I had this guy in there for a while but it's a super thick one and even though I like the gold I just would like a little bit lighter feel to my planner because I have so much new stuff to add in put in this guy which again was a new dashboard in the planner babe series which purple I wouldn't normally go with purple and it's like full page size as well but I think it's gonna work pretty well for finding notepaper quick cuz you get to kind of see how easily now it's like right there at the back and it's the only one on this side the goals is the only one right now on this side so I think it'll just help keep those guys easy to find okay so that is the setup after all of that and see I don't have everything it needs to be yes okay so I'm gonna quickly label those dashboards and then we will come back and I'll do another quick walkthrough of how the final setup looks okay so we're all set and I think we've got everything ready to go so 5 planners + goals + notes and also my little section of long term stuff all in this one planner so quick flip through just so you can see how the final result is we've got the front section with the pocket and the stickies and then it goes into the yearly section which is like the perpetual calendar all good to go and then we have the goal section which I've already gone through and once we get to the end of that we have that folder than to divide that section from the main section and then we have the faith so first thing in the morning that's where I'll be so I've got the faith month with the divider here I I might go and look for some new dashboards for this section just because I don't feel like these guys work real well with it but I still kind of need my OCD needs them to be middle and outside and clear so it's been hard to find lately so I've got that and I've got this monthly section which I'll like I said I'll go over kind of what I'm gonna do I'll go over real quick what I plan to do right now and then you guys will see a set up video later so my idea for this page is to do monthly trackers here with morning prayer Bible reading right the first daily and then either I'll transfer that to my actual goals page which I showed you before this is it so either I'll work off of this page and then transfer it here for the year as I go I'm thinking about doing it that way or maybe figuring out some of the things to track here but for now I'm going to do these same three things here and then I will transfer to the overall picture page and then maybe put that as a goal to start my morning routine maybe put a memory verse for the month here I put my actual morning routine down to get me started on the right track these are just ideas we'll see and then maybe that memorizing that verse for the month and then I'll fill this out as I go like things that I think well for just as I go through the month and then I don't know if I'm gonna need that as a check off but anyway that's the plan it's a little bit I don't know how exactly I want to use this but that's how I have it set up and then we've mentioned before that this will be the actual verse of the day as we go through so nothing too outrageous there then we'll get into daily daily month which you've seen same old thing and then daily week which will be to come but super excited about this nice clean layout nothing to cover so we'll see how that goes and then that's it for the month and then we go into health which has my little healthy habits to start me off and then my body tracker as I go through the year putting that in putting that to good use and then we'll jump into the month which I have all set up and ready to go again this dashboard is not my favorite for this I prefer clear dashboards just so I can see through them a little better and the pink is not necessarily like you said cohesive with the theme so I like clear for that so I will be looking for some new dashboards in the near future but for now this is what its gonna be and then the monthly spread know what they spread the weekly spread and as we go everything good good so a month of that then we're gonna head into social and this is gonna kind of go through also through my little morning planner routine this is how I usually go through my planner as I planned so now that faith is in the front that will be the primary thing and then I'll go straight to daily that I'll fill out all my stats for my health and then I check and see what I need to be doing for social for the day I put the divider in front of it so you guys wouldn't see the month and then I just flip to the month that was funny so anyway so the month is all filled out ready to go and then I'll be social week and yeah I have some stickers and maybe even just things I'm gonna glue down for ideas for this but I need to kind of tweak them a little bit and work with them a bit more and then I'll show you guys how they are set up but that'll be it and again I love this clear dashboard and it's my favorite and then we're gonna be on to this new little section for my budget this will be my budget planning so you guys aren't going to really see these spreads too much I show you a little bit on my social but not a whole lot because it's mostly functional this will be definitely functional and a bit too personal I think to share unless you know I do like a sample spread for you guys to see so that'll be my budget though but you you probably get a good look at that as we go through and then I have my vertical freelance itse schedule we'll see how this actually ends up working out for me but it's all set up and ready to go I've got another month in there for that and then the pocket folder to divide the two sections I might end up actually replacing this pocket folder with the other planner of a pocket folder I'm debating I also have another what-you-call-it pin holder that's in green it's like this tone and maybe I'll just stick on here and replace this guy out thing is that this pin which I recently got about a month ago and I really love it's got the four colors and it's a friction pen is great except for it's pretty fat so it does fit in here but it gets stuck sometimes when I try to get it in and out it kind of has a little bit of friction there with the rubber grip so I do want something that's wide enough to make sure that I can get this pin in my planner cuz I really do use it a lot and love it still debating on changing out that folder but that's it for now so kind of bracketing all of my calendar stuff is the two folders and then in the back is where I keep my gold divider sections where I keep stuff that I'm working through for home like home has passwords and budget things and things like that in there work has just like ideas or things that I'm working on for whatever it is whether it's it C or my freelance sometimes that goes in there social usually YouTube or Instagram stuff and then miscellaneous stuff that I just want to have on hand and then we flip to the note section and we have this lovely planner babe divider going on right here and it's pretty purple looking at it it's cute but I don't know how long it's gonna last I really like that it's a whole page and then it's got this on the corner but if I don't have to turn to it too much it'll stay but if I am constantly getting no paper I might I might make an adjustment but for now I like it and some no hate for so this note paper is just a little bit of a hodgepodge of different ones this front kind of colorful one is from the planner brave collection this is from an old accessory pack collection some more planner babe paper some dot lined pie from a happy notes I think some dot grid just to have it on hand I think this was from a farmhouse one and no happy notes and then just some doctor and I think I picked up on clearance and whatever that was so yeah and then the back so this is a full set up this is me for 2020 who I'm excited and it's already kind of chunky as I thought it would be and I haven't even put really any stickers in it so we'll see I'm only going to be decorating I think two or three of the spreads plus the months out of all of the sections so I shouldn't get too bad but you never know the stickers tend to like bulk things up so it's gonna get kind of fat near the end of the month but yeah so that's it you guys so I really hope you enjoyed this video and seeing how my planner setup get you guys this set up and ready to go for 2020 love the franking playing system if you haven't tried it before now it's time to try I really like having it all in hand quick and even though I'm using all of this for the year it's you know having it all in one little place and then just kind of dipping into these once a month is not a big deal so I really like that and I will continue using that going forward if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up down below go ahead and leave me a comment if you'd like to get in touch and think about subscribing to my channel if you haven't already if you'd like to see more of my videos alright you guys I'll see you next time I you", "BEgotffMbrY": "[Music] hello and welcome it's barbara from vienna austria we are on part five of our altered book junk journal series i'm so happy you have joined me i hope you're having as much fun as i am last time we stopped with this one so let's move right on to working on some more pages so let's tackle this last one now this paper clip three tier pockets so let's think about the background for this i'm wondering if there's enough of this to well there should be enough to put on two anyway and then this one doesn't need to have that so i'll try that it has the perfect height so i just wanted to go a little lower than the first tier because you will be able to see inside since they are you know wide pockets so i could just do half and half actually like that and that would leave me enough then for this pocket yeah [Music] and this time i won't even go over it with just so i'm just gonna leave it as it is i think it's very pretty like that so i can glue these down [Music] i was thinking this might be a great place to finally use this blue boot that i've been meaning to use but we have another boot here and i think two like this is a bit too much although it would be so perfect maybe i can find something else so she's adorable maybe i could put her somewhere she's an option this is another boot so i guess that's a no and we have her she's adorable as well i would have to tear around her because this is too wide [Music] so one of these two i feel this one ties this page in more because of the green whereas this one is more completely just on that side which is fine as well either would work let me try this one first i'll tear around it and then see if we can make that work i'm happy with her there i think this is very harmonious this page now we just need to back her with a few with a few elements [Music] no that's too gray [Music] even though this is not real money at least i think it's not real money it's weird to tear it but let's try it this is really weird [Music] i like that there [Music] yes that works for me so that one's done as well and i think it creates more dynamic on this spread since we have one focal element here and one here rather than having both on the bottom or both on the top so let's just do one of these i'll do this one here but this one i'm thinking let's just add some scraps we have left over from what we used maybe add a few more and then put a layer a thin layer of gesso around it and then build the page up from there don't even have to cover everything like that so i'll glue these down and then we'll apply some gesso this time i'll try to add some gesso with my finger because i feel i have more control this way for this kind of page and i am primarily putting it where the edges of the paper are and on my clip can't hurt ah that was too much no what did i do oh it's okay okay i think this is good to go and let that dry it has dried i'm taking my tea dye distress oxide this time and i will go over it [Music] let's check some possibilities for some focal points i really like the image but she kind of disappears into the background doesn't she it's not bold enough this one is very bold i kind of like this one this image goes with it's from the same series as we have here with these two so it's nice to have something from that series and another part of the book so we need some background maybe some of these map images will work that's too much yes that i like because there's a little bit yellow there so these go together very well this one maybe if we make it smaller no i don't like it what about some more of this tea bag [Music] i don't know [Music] i do like this framing this it really makes it come out then i'm not sure about this anymore i'll ink around this glue these together and then we'll see we could maybe add another piece of doily yes that works really nicely let me glue that down i'm going to be courageous and glue things down without knowing if it's going to work with the final product at the final outcome just going to do it i found this torn piece which seems to be like a leftover from a snippet roll that actually would be nice right there so again i'm going to be brave and glue that down then i have this random piece here which maybe can go underneath like that yep let's do it that might be all i don't know if i want anything else there a tiny strip of yellow this is a watercolored book page if i do that i'll need something here i like how that yellow is picking up this yellow this is a sticker from a packaging like maybe maybe it was from an amazon package or something like that totally worth keeping maybe if we put this underneath is that too much i mean it's extremely bright but i actually like it i'm gonna do it okay i'll glue the rest down and then show you the final result this is it very happy with how that turned out it's definitely a bit different from the others so next let's start filling in some of those opposite pages so maybe let's start with this one and i want to use another napkin as a background i have this beautiful one and i'd get asked sometimes where i get my napkins from but i'm lucky to find mine usually locally in places like bookstores or stores that have stationery or other little knickknacks i i don't go hunting for them i kind of just usually find them by coincidence so i'm very lucky with my finds again i'm going to take my water brush and i will just go down this spine here oops is some water dripping out again i will use my glue stick to stick this down and make sure that every part of my page is completely covered i don't want any bubbles in the napkin and i will dry this with my heat gun and this time i'm also going to use some matte mod podge to go over my napkin just to try something different unfortunately the matte mod podge still isn't really matte which is really annoying i think and still you have to be very careful applying it as you can see i'm using a sponge brush but you can use a regular paint brush as well this is not coming out okay i guess it has thickened up quite a bit not sure how long i have this not that long actually i don't know why it did that now i'm really scared to tear my napkin because that's what always happens to me so let's see how it goes this time [Music] i believe everything is covered and incredibly i didn't even tear it that might be a first so now i want to be sure that this is really dried well before i do anything else with it it's completely dry now and i don't know if you can see it well but it's not matte it's shiny maybe it's a little bit less shiny than the what is it called the unmat the shiny mod podge but this is definitely still shiny which i don't really like in my journal so i will once again add some gesso and now i don't have to be so scared to tear the napkin because the mod podge has really sealed this in i love how the text peeks through here and actually this is a beautiful page as it is um you know what i'm thinking now i'm thinking why don't we just leave it as it is because it's actually beautiful we don't have to cover this up what do you say i could maybe add some mod podge maybe just around the edges that might be an option let me try that but this is really almost too beautiful to cover up i think just maybe to frame it a little bit and then we could maybe just add some distress on the edges and i'm putting my hand in my gesso good job where are my baby wipes hello [Music] and on the gesso it wipes off really easily with a baby wipe so if there's too much i don't have to worry about taking off the napkin that's pretty cool i just want this to be faint i think that's okay okay i'll let this dry a little bit and then i'll add some distress stain just around the edges probably let's try some vintage photo distress stain with the soft brush i must say i'm really not liking the shiny it's not shiny of course where the gesso is but of course now in the middle it's still shiny so i'm wondering if i should maybe add the gesso everywhere let me just try it [Music] okay i'll dry this one more time there is still a little bit of shine but it's not as much as it was before so i will have to accept the way it is now and this one maybe we'll get a quote later on but for now i'm going to leave this page as is and call it done here's actually another one where there's a double page without anything look at that how did that happen let's find a background maybe we can use one of these too maybe we have those left let's take this one let's cut it down [Music] again i'm going to have to cover this with gesso because it is just too bright too busy [Music] okay time to let that dry i'd like to try to use her as a focal point or actually maybe her see here i spilled some water on it so the ink run a little bit maybe this one would be better i mean i can always tear her out i'm not gonna throw her away but maybe we can just use this one as it is kind of like that so what other things can we put in the background we have these here which i guess are from the same kit [Music] of course all of these borders here are too much i think i will tear around this one to get rid of the border even though the border is absolutely lovely but it's just too much here i think this is now easier to work with and the eiffel tower actually has i think a similar problem because i mean the border is absolutely gorgeous but it's too much unless i keep him for another focal point because i kind of don't want to tear this apart i really really love this floral border so i'll keep this for something else this one i can definitely use here somehow what else do we have that might work here we could take the paris off of this one since i can't use it as a whole anyway i'm gonna have to tear it apart i could try to use this paris we have some more round elements which look like they were from the same kit of course we don't want it saying paris twice so maybe i won't use this one but maybe i can make this one work i found this ticket here in my box of goodies and i kind of like how that goes with the roses in the background to bring those out a bit more so we could add that here put a little bit of color accent there and we would need to balance that either with more of those tickets or we can always revert to stamps of course postage stamps show a little bit there that's all right then we need a stamp maybe around here i'm gonna ink her up in the paris and glue everything down and then we'll see if we can find a postage stamp it needs to be a pink stamp that goes with these two maybe one of these this is pretty pretty close i think this is definitely an option and why does it need to go there because we want a triangle because we want our eyes to move around the page and three is such a pleasing number for the eyes so this is good i'm not thrilled about the image maybe there's another one we can use there is this one which i like a lot better so both of them were italian would be nice to have something from paris here from france but i don't have any i don't think wondering if we should try again two on top of each other to make it more interesting that's not the right one i have this cool one but it's an austrian one but uh it might be too big yeah i think this one is definitely too big although i would love the colors with this one yep too big what about this one no it's too much too bold too pink maybe i should just leave it with this one yeah that's what i'll do i find my flea market my free markets i find my stamps mostly at my flea markets if you don't have flea markets i'm guessing you can find some on etsy or ebay or maybe in a second-hand store i am not sure so this one is done and i kind of i kind of like it it's a fun page somehow let's find another page to work on let's take this one i'm going to use one of my authentic vintage ephemera for this page here all i need to do is tear along here and here i have received some questions in the comments of my second video in this series asking me why i'm not leaving any blank pages and that is a very a very good question i wanted to make a junk journal with lots of pockets in which we will be adding journaling cards so we will make cards in which we decorate the front but leave the back for journaling that was my intention of course you you could also you could tear out your pages and leave some without actually making them into a pocket that is totally an option i just wanted to have lots of pockets so so you do what you want to do obviously you have to do exactly what i'm doing i was just showing you what i'm doing and also i received the question a few times why do i tear out eight pages well eight pages seems to work very well and also i received the questions is eight pages the correct number for any width of book so no matter how many book pages the book has and i would say eight is always a good number except if you know you're going to be adding a lot of embellishments bulky embellishments then i i would actually even do 10 because that way you can maybe prevent more the situation of having a gator mouth we're still okay here but we have only decorated about i would say half the pages and we're now if i let go of it it's like this i really don't want to get to the situation where in the end it's like this when i could squish it with my fingers so that's what what why i think eight is pretty good ten would have maybe been even better but i wanted to do eight and you'll see at the end what it looks like once we have all the pockets filled and everything it's an experiment let's find something to add here as a focal point i actually don't want another face because i think she is good don't want to take anything away from her maybe this is the chance to finally use this boot i've been wanting to use it for so long even though i tore off the tip but i'm going to use it anyway i obviously don't want to cover up all of my beautiful vintage ephemera so i'm going to try to make a simple page and i'm going to look at my my small scraps here to see if i can use any of these this box makes me so happy i can't even tell you i don't know if you can relate it just has more specific scraps and i really like these and i like that it's not a huge amount of scraps it's not overwhelming and i it's something i can totally deal with i like that that is very nice nope too modern i like that it's weird but i like it i think that's all i'm gonna do i think anything else would take away from these bits and i actually like them so i will glue these down i love this pop of color here this is a scrap of a book page which i water colored that's all this is and i love it it came together super quick and easy and those are the best pages we don't have to struggle a lot but i think it's really pretty and i love these two together i love that one has a lot of decoration and one is more minimal maybe we can do this again so let's find a page which has a lot on it i could try this one let's do this one here i have this beautiful blue ledger paper i'm wondering if i should risk putting that here next to this one although that might be too muchy matchy yeah i think i'm not gonna do that i found this one which is really cool this must have been from a from a happy meal some stamps really cool and i think that they were meant to be cut out i'm sure but actually i like the page as it is but again i think this might be too muchy matchy but maybe we can use this on another page is that too weird i don't know would work this would also work i like it here because it has some of the same blue but not a lot this is really good let me tear this [Music] down now this part is very dark instead of putting gesso over it which would be one option i can just try to add my focal point here and maybe add some things around it to cover up some of that blue let's see i'm going to look for some scraps that i could maybe put under this [Music] i will glue these book pages down but before i glue the boot down i might want to add some stamps underneath the boot so let's look at some of our bluish turquoise stamps this one here is jumping out at me it's a german one i love that now you might be thinking we just covered up some of the blue why am i adding it again very valid question this way it i'm just adding little pieces of blue rather than big blotches and that just kind of breaks up the page a little bit by adding some interest i hope that makes sense i could add a bigger one here in this case we would actually only need two because i think we already have a triangle with this here so one two three but we could also add another one here and we could see what that looks like we could put it there not necessary but it's fine so i will glue everything down but actually what i'm thinking now is whether this is kind of boring i mean i like how the rose is sticking out but it seems like it's just missing something so i'm wondering if i can somehow add a little bit more pink in there without taking away from this flower would have to be a soft pink here for example i like that that just picks up the pink a little bit fortunately that's the only one i had i have this one but that also has the magenta in it it works let me glue these down see what that looks like this is it and i am very happy with it it's a lot less boring now than if it just had these three blue ones i love how the pink is picked up by these two stamps as well so we have two triangles here actually so that was page number six for today's session i think that's all we have time for quick recap so this was one two three not sure if this is finished four this is one of my favorite ones five and six

sheep program as one of the project partners at this stage i am now going to hand over to shannon james and noel for their presentations thank you so without further ado i'm going to introduce our farmer for this evening this is james james how are you going i'm the best good good man good morning thanks very much cheers for joining us here this evening so this is a fairly up-to-date photograph um um for james is showing a bit of the background now obviously there's not many sheep out on the farm at the minute um but to say we'll chop through that uh because i think most are in there getting ready getting ready for an almond gym so appreciate you taking the time because i know you'll be you'll be getting ready into the thick of it now fairly shortly so basically james um you know for the audience say obviously we'd love to get out onto the farm we're not there so basically james if you could maybe run through what what your the farm is what your background is and we'll take it from there so over to yourself james right well i fought farming full-time with my father here and about all their family help during la monde that we're only 300 years split equilibrium taxes scottish blackface and pure powers scotch blackfish on 130 hectares of sda ground with over 20 hectares of grassland 40 hectares of semi improved 70 hectares of rough grazing and hill ground and 5 hectares of woodland all in the one land parcel and what height would you be quite high up james or we're starting at 280 foot with some of the better grassland and run on to 850 foot on the hill ground right see what what about rainfall james bear have enough heavy enough would be up 1200 plus miles a year right which it is a it is a a a strong hell should we say um this is just a wee map james uh to show where your your lab is as you say it is in one me and me and parcel um um so if we just show here if we go back one this this is your your me and parcel here um apologies there's your main parts so the yard james for the the pointers all right yeah and then the cotton ground is that failed two a and three which you can't see where's the right hand side of it there oh yes yes third in there and philly 18 and 23a as well would be cotton ground okay okay and then your your hell itself james assume this is that that's this that 45 a is the hill ground and there's right but a rough grazing there those other 43 and eight whatever there's operation as well so that's the mailing for the where the horn yours would be that's the horned used turret up there right uh just to show a thing with a photograph here yeah this was fairly well i don't know when that was james it was some maybe i was fairly recently him how do we get a dry weather probably the spring time with bob cotton out right right very good very good so that is the tape of the ground and obviously you know there's a lot of farmers obviously that's your own ground as such it's not common james but yeah they'll be a very pattern of of what the rest would help um as regards managing that james how do you you know obviously there's a fair bit of heather would it get ahead of you or what way do you work with that generally bought was controlled born and carried out or not on a nine or 10 year rotation okay sort of up on 20 acres a year may be burnt okay yeah very good so it keeps it keeps as best you can so far enough james and the next we bet james we've a bit more if you want to just chat through some of the things you're doing here or the numbers you use and what way you breed um yeah there's 150 pure pair of black facials haunted them with red pure usually the first three years of use then there's twenty two soldiers excellent for replacement for the lowland flock and this year for the first time those 20 20 or 25 of them went to blue fish leicester and the hope of getting new lamps to sell later on you've never done that before james this is the first first year of sighted and then the lowland lowland use as the texas scottish blackfish you crossed together a taxi we were team some of those for ourselves for the lowland flock again i'll sell one bites them at least to regular customers replacement use and we've tried a bluefish laster on the more tax lien ones than this year okay very good very good um i'll say there you're you're keeping your own replacements you know when you basically only assume just buying in tips in as you need gm right yeah buy an untapped as we need okay now this third point james is something that we're going to chat about um you're having to keep a lot of your ulams basically there is an issue with barn rate um and again that's what we're looking on with with your vat as well we'll have a look at that you know wide so that's been going on maybe james we've been a while you think or something's been happening or there's been there's been an issue for a long time we're maybe starting to get to the bottom of it now but we're we're having to keep all our for the majority of our black fish fuel arms that are suitable the majority of the tax will cross to the blackfish we're keeping them as well and the only ones would have wants to sell are they quite a great taxes okay i was telling you well we'll chat with that later on as well the last point there are james that you're lamin indoors when you know why why'd you do that when the alarm you know um when they put the yours in you know that type of when they put them out or what are you doing when you're quite you know those type of things i suppose now from the 12th they're about to march that suits our systems were not taking whatever reason so the use is housed from about december time probably second third we get a sample then they'll be fed silage only to get weeks out depend on the silage if it's really good six weeks out then introduce males at once at that stage they'll be turned out as soon as possible push slam on 24 hours at the delay 36 hours depending if the weather is bad we have enough housing to keep them two or three days usually are they just around the house severing us around the house james for a while and then moving the hornies as well everyone goes to the green ground to start with and then the horned hills get them a month old the singles will go to the hill and the twins will go to that rougher reason and hope to have the silence growing clear to yours by the first week of may to get a cut of salvage at the end of june then okay that's dead all that stuff now these are some as easily as we want your first and second cross to actually use on your plastic slots uh have they been a while in james or how have you have you found them yeah that'd be a mix of the the scottish blackfish crosstax leo's there especially the fierce ones as they are on the pure white face to the quarter taxes very happy with the plastic slats they're in three if not four years now you see a bit of stuff there lying on the top of them but a skate round where we ache twice a week even and it'll give very little bother clogging up excellent that's very good very good um so we'll have here say his best you know a few more photographs here which hopefully will show so these are your tips um um you have your three scottish sir you have three or four charlie maybe at that stage three taxes and a couple of years i think there the blues not in that there he's a he wasn't in that one he was camera shy that day so i mean he wasn't there that day but uh no that's that's terrible um then show there's your horn using how have they like you're the man of what a few years james how have they adopted to to be in house should i say the settle remarkably quickly and the house should either they give very little ball you'd know if you'd up there in the middle of the daytime they'd all rely on quietly and they'll continue dying quietly unless it's reading time really yeah oh that's good that's good you know right jim thanks very much that's i say it's a whistle stop tour in the yard we'll just show some of the facilities and we'll see sort more photographs as well um this week but james we might be chat through like as i said at the start of the program i sat down with everybody and went through what the areas they wanted to look at and what areas they wanted to develop um ourselves james was sat down um seems a while ago now um and we looked at three areas as we said first you try to improve your barn rate then the ead which you're using to improve it and then the hill as well so how are you getting on with them james or things might be changed or got a wee bit quicker or possibly the first two there the ucid in the barn right could maybe have been switched around we've got onto the eid system quicker than we thought and the barn which has been harder to to get under control than we thought barn right we the first year we blood tested pre-tapping and we turned out turned up toxo and the horned use but we were too close to tap on time to to vaccinate for them that year so we fed decocks in the mail from christmas time to llaman time it worked well but from a liberal point of view it wasn't really suitable we had a bachelor separately so that you were only feeding the oats that you wanted the decocks it worked out fairly expensive probably similar to waxnet for a one-year hut so this last year we vaccinated for toxo and enzo we've never had a baller with anzo but that's the cheaper the two vaccines and more advised if we don't have it now is the time to vaccinate to keep it out rather than wait for it to come on and have to treat everything with antibiotics and then vaccinate themselves we want to use yeah yeah and that's again us which we'll be chatting to with with noah like that's been very helpful and very you know you picked up a lot and you know good advice from that and that's what say we're encouraging people to do that so thanks very much james now the next bit obviously is with all the farms there's the targets james um this actually these targets will be um in the latest edition which i think is actually today um of all the upland farmers their benchmark results for 2020 so these are fresh figures as they say so we'll have here the 2020 and the targets um the only difference would be in there in the purple the scanning rates and the barn rates are literally jams in the last look of weeks um these are the up-to-date figures so um those is where you're concentrating on gmc i think you're well you've kind of said though there's the area especially with the helios that you want to look at yeah uh happy with the bayern red and the crash bridge but it would like to left the skier maybe maybe 1.7 1.75 even with a lot of singles at the moment with them i'd quite like to get a good lot more ones out of them the crop the blackfish uses the buyer and rates happiness whenever you take the buying rate out of those use they're scanning at 1.4 which is added perfectly adequate for the environment they're on but it's the fact that we're getting hit with a lot of our news is pulling everything down in there i will say james that you know you're here anecdotal and we're hearing from some of the other program farmers and other health farmers that you know barn rate seems to be an issue you know um you know and it's something that i think i would be strongly advising all farmers hell farmers you know to keep a good note in that and like we will try to um we're not of all the answers but certainly something to investigate and hopefully some of the things we're talking about this evening will do that um you're weaning percentage of stadiums yes that will probably hopefully fall in from that from the numbers um store lambs potentially a few more maybe going away bit heavier hopefully hopefully someday some food on beer this year hopefully good good the old numbers james i think they're you're you're more or less where you're at you might go up a wee bit more but you're not probably that for the next couple of years focus on getting the buying rate down before we approach numbers any further in a way yep no that's fair enough faster and the final figure here is the gross margin and like james now that may seem low but for a hill situation like that's james is nearly the top 25 percent from some of the latest figures we've had so um at 34 you know so he's he's doing well um and i'd say hopefully with the barnard teams that'll push up to you know the target of 45 and get more alarms out the gate and just one final point on the benchmark and for those uh bdg members that are less than eight i would strongly encourage anybody to do benchmark and decide i was doing best working to do it early in the year i think james you agree with out there yeah you get to make changes for the coming year early there's no good in doing it in october and finding out your problem that you could have started in august but you're too late to do it for this year yeah yeah very good thank you james so just just to be thinking what kind of mentioned that there is just just to finally summarize there right yes james wants to get you want to get more out of your use or increase decrease the bar the use are nearly where they're at um you know as you've said they're getting more out of grass um um you know you get to get the meat costs down as well um the other way thing here we're talking about gmc we've chatted some of this already um briefly go through these here the lamb you're using eid as well um lambs tagged at birth any issues james any no the tags really only come out of the bag they come on and straight into the lambs they're not sitting about outside any that are dropped running on the ground dip them or doesn't factor before you put them on and the recording system is a great job you can follow a problem you or you can if you pack up a second on the field you can read his tag and you know exactly who his mother is whose one is and if there was an issue with her atlanta and say she put out a reader or something you can follow that that through and you can make a decision even do you want to go out and catch that you or was there a reason that that she's not really in the second alarm let her be with a single or whatever yeah nice excellent uh the grass and improvement you've mentioned um the soy salmon i think james you're hopefully in the process of getting around around the gear to get all tested um hopefully a photo of things is awkward at the moment and then the the the health plan which was chatted about um is is in place as well i'm about to focus on some of it as well that's james for for anybody's not aware this is just a screenshot of one of your eid um uh systems or sorry some of the data um that that you've used so um james will be able you know for anybody that has considered this is the type of information that james is able to um to glean from that and hopefully make decisions from that um the next week but just to show james that's that's the the top hell where they use the helios go that's their type of environment yeah that is them open on the first week of may this past year was mainly used mainly used with singles just go up there okay that's fair enough that's fair enough right james thank you very much now that's the now we're going to the me and we bet here um or what we're trying to focus on here we've given james uh uh james has given a good outline on what is over the next few minutes um just go to some of the things that james is doing obviously um that's come out of the health plan that he del we drew up with noel and also as a sideline and that or sorry another addition to that is that obviously what we're talking about tonight as well is the adjustment producing of antibiotic usage and in the form so james has already mentioned vaccinations so uh talk someone enzo um has been done now james um as you said you've done the enzo so you've done the the decox which was expensive and i'm a bit uh time-consuming um as with all farmers or you know you you're savage analyzed um and your yours are fair according to that um and i'll say well we'll chat through some of those your sheep house obviously was going to show that now we minute that gets thoroughly cleaned named and disinfected and then the last point um watery mark scar uh you have used that james but i think we'll chat you you want to get that down a wee bit yeah yeah that's dead so basically some of the basic things we're talking about here on the practical things we just want to raise you know free lamb and feeding you know james this is your sale he's just your mail um me just chat us through what the the difference is here this is some of your some of the the practical things i think you would do you know this is analyzed earlier on there and we're feeding according to the analysis twins is up they're getting 1.7 of a kilo here at the moment about a week out of llama and that was just head and first one they weighed two buckets from eighty two three gallon buckets look exactly the same but there's nearly a kilo difference one of them's 11.6 dollars you'll either be over feeding or under feeding and you're not you're not real asian exactly but that's that's what that weigh-in that's exactly james a very simple thing you know and it doesn't have you ask your true test for your for your actual weigh-in but you know that's even the bathroom scales or something you know anything at all would would be useful for that so just a wee tip that we thought was useful uh this is just some of the o's james three photographs of the meat and away here um all seem very very happy just you just threw the meal over the top of the salad james male's just through over the top of the salads they're all panned according to to let their size lamin date and body condition school yeah at the moment and we're feeding just on top of the sillage twice twice a day at the moment square and under the o's james are they they mixed together or the horn you separate or see there's some mixture here it doesn't really in a million they're mixed if we have a full batch of honduras i'll keep them sharp but but i know there is a difference in the summer analysis tell you to feed differently for horned use and crossbreds i'm feeding all the cross-graduate and i've got water with foreign use not lamb and lambs or anything so and just some of the other things we're here jim this is like your your week your kitchener your preparation area yeah maybe just describe what we'll have here this is actually up in the alarm and she had james yeah that's in the corner this year beside the melbourne there's hot water and a sink there great job for washing hands after laminio keeping tubes and bottles and things like that clean without dragging them out of the house every time and you have hot water and mike's gloss to mix milk there's a fridge there you can store colostrum if you mix too much you might do whatever throw it into a jug in the fridge it keeps for 24 hours you can store vaccines for sheep or whatever as well they're at the right temperature they're not going to be destroyed certain sitting out there's also that red thing as a paddle for the gel for max and milk that love feeder okay all right so just it's all practical rgm's nicely sitting together um and these are your pens here james um fairly sturdy look on um stock board where'd you get the mgms i made myself for him we built the sheared but went for the stock board because the hound uses a tendency to try to kill around beside it after if they can see another alarm they'll bit and slap at it they'll unless their lamp sticks its head through they'll not kill it what we had all used killed their own alarm in the process of doing it right well if james were just about finished our wee bit here we just um that's the photograph i think that mummy probably sums up um really where you're coming from you know you know you've got a rate better to grow your you want to push more into the grass um we have three ulams here but you want that picture to be in a few years maybe follow the old arms or more arms obviously take a few more annoying but that was two of the scottish blackfish cross tax alarms on a pure blackfish as well in the bike yeah that's we that's how we feel that was drilling reseeded two years ago yeah so that is showing like growing more grasses making the difference so well james finally this is the last bit for yourself um what's james mckay's farm what i think we've talked some of these things you know you could briefly take us through these a what you're hoping to do or what you're hoping to develop yeah for soil sampling again will spread probably a couple of hundred tunneling this last three years soil sample hopefully it'll show up but we've improved the ph and just check for p and k levels whatever and get soil into the right food healthy to grow grew grass we're in a lit enough part of the world as it is so every help we can get with gold grass is required and hoping to develop the ad system a bit more as you've seen there earlier with the two test way head now that links to the handheld recorder so whenever you weigh lamps it automatically sends the whip to the recorders will it's the first full year we've had it so i'll be wearing my lambs at six weeks as that gives an indication of modern ability milk yield whatever in the o and then i'll wait follow them on through and weigh them on ahead i'll be able to pick my best your lambs on growth with and your milk ability which should develop the maternal line going ahead oh if i could get her arms with ebv's and the breeds i'm looking for i'd be happy to buy them but they're very hard to get in this country at the moment hoping to reduce the burn rate we're working on it put us a slow progress at the moment with blood sampled use again after skin on timbers who weren't happy with it we've done manual profiles and whatever on them hoping to turn up something they're bullish twice a year but will possibly go emmanuel's inch as well just to top that up pre-tapping this year okay to see if we can see if we can sort that problem out no it was vaccinated and everything else should be right and hopefully take more alarms to fight they kill it and get them away through don't be here and hopefully fuel arms to the sales replacements which should should improve the gross margin conservatively no james is very commendable i'll say you're always saying that nothing's going to change overnight you're there you've looked at the problem you're looking at it you've investigated it with your vet um you know with ourselves as well so that's all i would say to anybody out there you know um if there is an issue note it down work through it and um you know help will come out so basically james thank you very much that's your bit let you have a race now and then we'll be finishing up here now i'll be home over to a noble now um here you give a that's a vets perspective on a health and management well so for now james thank you very much and they will be chatting to you after we fight so say folks just a quick introduction to noel though he has been introduced earlier so say noel uh is that from my local area who's been in toronto for a few a few years now um noel worked with worked with james um myself drawing up james's health plan so we thought it was it was up that they would break noel in this evening so thank noel for for his time for that so um just uh move on nolan floor's yours okay so well firstly thanks for giving us this forum like at least a chance to chat a few sheep farmers uh and thanks james for asking me to do this as well so just are we linked maybe to james is just as a follow-on and like to try and improve james's fertility in his black fiscals like before like i would be put my hand up and say i'm a blackfish sheep reader and there is a bit of an issue in blackface sheep and they'll be trying to get this barn right sorted out and maybe just the number of lambs once you get past the empty used blackfish you'll seem to produce lots of lambs but it's just getting past this sort of number of empty youths especially in the younger youth first glamorous it does seem to be a bit of an issue so we've approached james's they took blood like last year we took blood again this year um he had a bit of a toxic issue and was trying to address that uh he fed decox last year because it was too late to vaccinate and was subsequently vaccinated there in last a august september time um but still this year's day the scan hasn't been as good but there has been other issues possibly with surround not working and it's muddied the waters a wee bit so it's an ongoing process our talk so we've played the o's again and the top three results aren't back it shouldn't really be a problem now they're vaccinated but it doesn't always do what it says in the 10th time so i'm sort of i'm eagerly anticipating the toxic results so a mineral blood analysis of the virus baron you're going to do that best time would be to do that i think just maybe as soon as uh like after scanning and you've got empty um that's a good time to get your blood tested because especially with helium if you're coming off the hill if you have got a mineral issue that is when it's going to show up like if you maybe bleed hell use in the middle of summer time it might just be as obvious so i think it's a good time james houses his use a early the biggest reason is james has had a major issue with fluke on his farm like we're out in the western here there's high rainfall and all the places make it higher inflow but they're in dry hills james's hill would not be dry by any stretch of the imagination and they were struggling to keep i think maybe use alive from a fluke point of view this is going to be historic so uh if james is flicking news from august on uh and then he's sort of housing you from december on and because as soon as you get used off ground you can get ahead of look like my advice for fluke in the west here is to be if you can use nearly once a month uh well at least maybe five weeks if it's not a month and we have to avoid trickle bendazole products like fascinating movements to us because we've got resistance issues so we're down to two products so my advice on that this is what's in james's health plan is to alternate between sort of close and all this like like flavor and like nitrox and all these like throat decks they'd be two good flug agents and they can be alternate from one year to the next and then as i say gm sticks as cheap as using even as black eos they come in from the start of january uh and then they're done at housing and they're done a month later a the second dose after your house use if you're coming from a fluke early is the most important one none of the fluke agents kill all the fluke there's always immatures left i think hey if look either on that they claim to kill them down to five weeks so if you house use and do them on the way in you'll still have a small population of flu if you jokes again months five weeks later you're going to wipe that out and it's vital like my view with yours is you try and keep them sort of at a fairly constant condition score all year ideally in round maybe a three and to achieve this you have to have a good fluke regime if you if you've used carrying the fluke coming up to llama you're just losing a lot of your feed so and then the other issue that's turning up is opa this is your a well known name is taxid this is your chronic disease issue uh or the it affects the lungs the lungs basically solidify become sort of like maybe liver-like so you shows uh exercise intolerance if you put the dog behind them and you have a batch of 50 euros you notice two or three coming slow at the back consistently slow and you handle them you also tend to be lean if you watch those used carefully they're breathing faster and shallower they'll be your clinical signs of opa so hugs that are well suited for parasites a well grazed but they're just leaner than the rest of the other companies are they concerned about opa and the best approach there is you showing cynical signs should be called immediately and would be the rest they could be scanned you can scan for opa it's not a black or white science uh there's a bit of uh a depends on the operator but you could maybe get user identified from scanning and then you go and slaughter some of them use and some of them don't turn up lesions we've tried it but like it's a good management tool if you're conditioned scoring your use and checking their exercise intolerance is a good start the scan will come in behind that but it's just a case of trying to get rid of yours so they don't spread anymore to the rest of the flock until you can still get rid of them when there's a call value with them so but that's just the few things that james on his black issues he's trying to sort of get on top of so right this is back to i suppose uh the amount of antibiotics that we're using a in the sheep flock is is i was sort of a bit shocked uh we've got another slide in a minute or two it shows the amount but there's four areas where there's a lot of antibiotics used in sheep and a lot of it is in round lamenting so if we're going to make an impact a on the amount of antibiotics used it knows the tendon's thinking about it but i just want to say one thing i'm advocating that we try and reduce the amount of antibiotics used but at no stage should this be done a detriment to sheep to flock house like there's always another avenue and maybe more strategic use of antibiotics role in this blanket treatment we're trying to get away from the blanket treatment that's that would be what we'll be emphasizing tonight so the first one would be the use of like a blanket use of oxycat which is sort of your animation la caromacin engiomycin this is often used by sheep farmers uh to prevent enzymatic abortion uh that's the biggest reason to use it about three weeks out they've had an issue in the past and it's been used just to stop an abortion storm and they thought right that's a good idea i'll keep doing that that's used this is a serious amount to be honest we have a very good vaccine there on the market there's a couple of them on the market and if you vaccinate your use a month beforehand one month before those attempt that's the minimum you can do them two or three months beforehand as soon as the sword goes hey that's far better than using this blanket oxytoc okay the next one lameness this is the other place where there's a lot of use or there's a lot of antibiotics used uh and once again uh like foot rot is the main source of lameness nerf a secondary to that was with this new disease coming in a cod contagious ovarian digital dermatitis that is a nasty and nasty bug if you haven't got that in you want to avoid that so that's when we emphasize about biosecurity and not buying sheep and that's what you're trying to avoid is called so from a lameness point of view what can we do instead of using lost antibiotics once again we can try and if you haven't got a lot of foot rot don't buy it in keep a close flock that's number one number two would be it's a vaccine for food facts and it's a very useful product if you've got a big issue with limitless you might have to use twice initially but if you've only got a minor lameness problem foot facts once a year will control it and there's a there's a fierce labor a lot of labor used in sleep with liam sheep so if any of our older farmers out there a normal father thinks football is great because it just it's got less things to gather up sheep than having to look at feet uh just quickly we'll be going through joint and and watering mouth now as we chat about in round ramen but sometimes farmers would be injected lambs like blanket maybe a half a cc or something like nora cloud or cine lux atlanta to control joint in the envelope there's better ways of controlling that if you've tried them like what they've been through in a minute uh but just blanket treatment we'll have to try and get away from that and then water your mouth this is just uh this is a slide i've seen another talk myself a 12 months ago and it just shows the amount of antibiotics used in the farming sector in the uk compared to ireland right and then the green in the uk column that's the amount of antibiotics used in sheep and goats i was surprised at how big that is maybe that's out of the hundred percent that's probably maybe up against 30 percent like i would have felt that the dairy sector would have been far bigger i would have thought pigments have been far bigger but no the sheep sector is a leader in the use of antibiotics so that's something that basically we can't really keep going like that we have to reduce the amount of antibiotics used next slides please so how how do we go about doing that so this is where most of our antibiotics get used in round lamenting so where do we start we'll start with good clean sheep a good clean environment for lamb and like the group playing here to the left of the slide like dust sort of like clean straw perfect if you can it's like if you're rearing calves about to say you should be able to lie down and roll with the calves like you could lie down and roll on that pen and lose yours i guess it's it's clean that's what you want hey there's a lot of times driving in the country and you see yours that have come out of sheds and they're sort of they're discolored they're they're sort of green looking and like that's that's just fecal contamination so the bugs that cause like new little scars like scars at one two three days old the bugs that cause your watery mouth uh like it's mainly e coli and like most e coli is coming from like sheep faces so if we can keep the fleece clean the use claim like this is this is that's the way forward uh is james there can i speak to him or is he is it yep i'm here yeah yeah james yourself how often do you clean your pants now at lam and time first they'll be cleaned after every year unless we're very busy and then they'll be blamed if they weren't cleaned out yeah you know see like this we're talking about it's a case of just trying to keep like the the hedging up i know some farmers say that they're having the mountain power to do that but if you want to keep the health up and reduce the cases of like watery mouse or the cases of scar they just the hygiene has to be kept on and then as i say if it is very busy you need to be at least removing cleansing and lining pains but pens would need it ideally cleaned out after every yo and if that can be achieved after every second you that that would be the way forward go ahead right so hygiene is the one prong and then the second one is colostrum quality and quantity okay so if we're going to tell about colostrum and use a i would like just to take a second or two to back it up about maybe six weeks or two months before 11. like it's condition score new zen and batching news that gives you scanned you know where your doubles and your triplets are and your singles are this is when you make your decisions about how you're going to figure you pretty long and how well you feed your yolk and she maintains her condition this all works out into the quality of the colostrum that she produces like you're feeding your yog to produce lambs of good good birth weight like you know three kilos plus say er the sort of the bigger alarm the more likely they are to survive if you've got multiples and they're lightweight their chances of survival are greatly increased and then the quality of the colostrum that's purely reflected in the quality of the use basically the feeding beforehand if you've got good videos which have uh the conditions for you say they carry no no parasite burdens like no fluke issues it worms not so much of an issue now maybe in mature yows but fluke and possibly room and flu would be two big issues out in the west the problems here and you'd want them under control and then feeding like james you said what was your feeding plan just give it to me again i know you mentioned it earlier from from about seven weeks out you're feeding what but seven weeks out though we've been getting point two of a kilo uh five weeks old probably up to point four three weeks out point six they're up there at point seven nerd but a week out and yeah i'll probably put them all to point it over that's a twenty percent not too high sorry inclusion yeah james does for your doubles are you are your triplets getting more than that or are they just getting somewhere are they getting fraction more triplets have been getting suppose nearly a kilo for maybe six weeks now right right and uh well the whole point of this thing and getting this right is to make sure that we have like enough a good quality classroom and uh james you yourself lose health with the youth you're working colostrum's not really an issue like use health planting seemed to have plenty of classroom very few alarms that you wouldn't have enough leo doesn't have enough for her own arms right and james like myself if you're assessing colossal quality a there's a few things you can do to improve colostrum quality and the mineral side of things is important a like this is why we're sort of pushing maybe mineral analysis there's two things that you could use if you've got sheep that could have got adequate minerals and you've got good bright alert lambs lambs that runs their feet quickly and yet you've got good quality colostrum the two go hand in hand and james you test colostrum do you a or do you just assess it with your eye and look for viscosity and color or what do you do up to now i have been assassinated just by color and thickness but we've now been provided with our effect amateur through the program so we'll be able to use that from now on right well james just this is from my own interest would you see a difference between the quality of a yo saying maybe with a single on her colostrum and the u was a triplet uh does it be any different or or have you noticed anything so far probably the over the top but maybe has the best she's getting that but more male 1 she seems to be producing better yeah like so basically you do see the reward of your feeding is in the amount of cholesterol you have plenty of good quality cholesterol because you know as a as soon as we go down the line of what lambs you know go down with scar or watery mice like it's always the multiples of the lambs that are losing risk and james how much colostrum are you of a ulam and say it was triplets what is your approach like i mean shalom's down to three lamps or shelf and they're just starting to get onto their feet what do you do james or what's your usual i would usually milk o and split what you have equally between the three of them that get at least two tubes for 120 ml either our own colostrum or our own colostrum topped up with powdered glass some if she doesn't have an oven for them right you would top up so they'd all get a share of your own colostrum and then you'd be tough enough and so what cluster are you using james or what do you usually use this but it'd be a preventative powdered class than we would top up with yeah you know myself personally i would probably rather a farmer's using a powdered colostrum i know some boys will say that isis or what else would it say what did it say i think it's a better more uniform product than maybe getting cow colostrum uh there can be some issues maybe with with cow colostrum uh i i find i see counter loss from sitting out for farmers to collect places and just the whole the hygiene and maybe the uniformity of the classroom would all be a little bit up in the air like and if you are going to use coyote colostrum it just make sure that it's definitely off the first milking of the cow or i think you could be wasting your time a little bit with it uh like james's here tops up with pervita uh there is colostrum out there there's a calf choice total which is based on how colostrum is it's artificial like it's fish and coco lost or missed me from it and it actually has antibodies in it if somebody wants to go the whole hog a and go for a real top-notch colostrum uh but it's expensive compared to the likes of for vita provider price a lot of energy it's a good supplement to the eu's own colostrum that's the way i would definitely look at it but and the one thing is just when you see all these pictures of stomach tube and lambs and it's just the hygiene around all of your equipment is vital vital i couldn't over emphasize that sometimes farmers wonder why uh you get sort of watery mouse starting and just going from pain to pain or lamb to lamb uh just sometimes you could be spreading out yourself just be very wary that's why when the scene james is set up there where he's gonna sink hot water just everything needs to clean and disinfect from between lambs if you can uh but so what else we need to do is uh uh dipping navels veil you know and my view is uh i i would always use strong iodine on some forms iodine doesn't seem to handle some of the bugs that's there some of these things can be very farm specific they're thrilling and it's just not working they're still getting a lot of sort of like a new level abscesses uh so chlorhexidine that's another disinfectant like we would use chlorhexidine if i was doing say ciu section i was scrubbing her up that's the pink stuff a cure exiting it there was never as much use as it was used this year for a hand sanitizer so but iodine would be number one choice because iodine is a good disinfectant and more most importantly it's a great drying agent as soon as you get the navel dried it's no longer like a root way into the lamb if the navel stays wet like bugs bacteria that they can get up sort of into the lab i would rather dip as opposed to spray because i think you use the product better you get better coverage just one of your little a if you're giving a like a urine sample to the doctor one of those containers or if you're taking a milk sample from a dairy cow uh just top that up just fill up half of the heading and you get total coverage just make sure you yeah sort of empty that out and refill it sort of if you're busy so you aren't just using a contaminated stuff all the time i wouldn't dilute it at all it was id strong iodine is what would be used and i would do this with birth or shortly after and then i would repeat six hours later because you will have it licked off if you just do it immediately afterwards uh if you go back the second time and sort of sneak in when you use maybe a feeding or something like that you'll get them done and she might just let it off go ahead silent right so we're back to this antibiotics issue like just i sell antibiotics okay that's part of my that's one of the things we do but i would like to see responsible use of antibiotics as opposed to this a broad like this blanket treatment so it's important that at lamin time you are going to have to use some antibiotics a one you'd only use basically what's been prescribed by your vet okay and you want to be using the correct amount basically it should be on your any antibiotic you buy it'll say on the dose rate and how to give it whether it's under the skin breath into the muscle and then whether the course is a one-off injection or a three-day course a any use is handled if you're a lamineo and they handle the main i don't mean if the the nose is there and the feet are there and you just give it a pull i wouldn't count that as a handler uh but if you have to push in and replace and move stuff around uh that you would definitely need maybe like a shot of antibiotics afterwards and then more importantly that same you would need a shot of a painkiller there's good painkillers non-steroidals that are out there a like two metal something like oxycontin under the skin that's fatal because you want that yo to mother the lambs in her pen you don't want her thinking about how sore she is and being miserable i'm wondering well she'll eat you want her sort of moving on thinking out the two elance look after here i have to get keep going if you know what i mean uh and just on the antibiotics point why are a question for this reduction in antibiotics the doctors have come to basically the veterinary profession and the farming profession and say look that they're concerned that they're getting resistance in hospitals to some of the antibiotics that you're using and that's because they're being used or overused in the agri sector so we're trying to do our bit to reduce or slow down this risk this this rate of antimicrobial resistance and there's another side on to we have a lot of very good antibiotics that we've got access to in that many possessions if we don't get our house in order some of these drugs could be taken away from us and that will be a step backwards so if we can keep our house in order reduce the amount of antibiotics that are being used maybe rather than using some of these new uh sort of i would call them some of them super antibiotics there's a few new ones that come out in this last 10 years are very good but there's a lot of traditional antibiotics still out there penicillin penicillins uh and sort of we can go back to those and use those responsibly and they do an adequate job like oxycat used correctly it's still a very useful shoot done to be honest and it's only sell them that you should be using maybe anything much stronger but it's just if we can use some of these these newer ones under veteran advice and only for specific cases okay that's the way forward so just watery mouse is i would say if when your lamin use especially out of alarm and shell like it's the one disease that you're sort of every time you have a young lamb or like you have triplets and you're going to be a few lambdas you know this is getting busy it's in the back of your head when's watering where it's going to start hey i know a lot of farmers just basically every lamb born gets ordered to be able we have to try and get away from that uh multiples your triplets are most vulnerable to watery mice there's only one reason for that is that they get less colostrum than a single or a double so if we if we can get around that so what we've already mentioned is go back to your feeding if you're yoga making sure she has plenty of colostrum it's making sure that we are topping up at birth and if your lambs are an adequate birth size they're they're a healthier love they're they're less vulnerable so my advice would be is get your hygiene right use good and clean good clean hands get your colostrum in and get it in early like if jim says he could have it in living before uh the use of lamb lick this for spiritual loss from this 120 150 ml in and then only you can make a decision to say well last year i used old antibiotic on all the lamps this year i'm just going to maybe use it on the triplets and that would be a major reduction or i'm going to lamb the first hundred years and try and avoid using it at all unless there's a lamb that's being stressed maybe a llama said a hard lamin that's one or multiples but make a decision we're not asking people to say that if they don't use world antibiotics they're going to have a lot of dead lamps with watery mouths we just want people to try and see if they can change their system a little to re to use a little less antibiotics that's that's the sort of the way forward and this is all very very clean number one but just to just make sure before you start laminating although it's going to be our lamb at the minute or we'll be starting shortly make sure you have all you need like your your gloves your strong id your gel your harness for keeping in prolapses uh your trusty baby bottle of maybe a pen strap for your handle your bottle may be a painkiller or a few injections of it you know just have this you know if you have it at your hand you'll use it maybe there's a bottle of spectam there you'll still need that from maybe your triplets okay and have they add a good number of hands you know if you want to keep hygiene good just you know lots of paint so and they say the equipment all here is spotless it's a bit like james's you know it is doesn't want to say i i being lamb and sheds and you know i know when the whole thing gets busy and you've been laughing for two weeks it might just quite look like that but that's what we're aiming for just gonna head on to the next bit here so no so i i can cover this button also i'll let you have a bit of a rest so thanks thanks very much um no one obviously be here for questions folks i'm gonna see with a lot of them so i quickly go through these last few slides here um as they knowledge said obviously about the ander microwheel yeah years on farms i'm just going to briefly mention here a project called the stamp project which you may be aware of and i know knowledge from the veterinary side um is aware of this but it's basically called strategic and microbial use and dairy beef and lamb production so um i'd like to thank ag research for providing some of this background information so it's co-funded by a jarrah under the research challenge fund um agrisearch's lead partner app is research partner and there's also industry partners um health and welfare northern ireland the lmc and a farm vet system so they're the partners within the project so basically what it is it's a benchmark until an ambiatic benchmark until to use on farm um as nola said the doctors are coming to the likes of the vats and whatever and obviously in the current situation uh the the use and the the highlight of antibiotics uh in the culvert situation is brought to the fore so all farmers all grower you know whatever advisors whatever we all have responsibility to to do our part and play our part in a reducing antimicrobial issues um but as noel said huge when necessary um so we all have a role to play um i'll say we're just highlighting here that this is this is a you may see this and being a publicized fairly recently um so basically why they were doing it was busy it's what we're trying to get the issues are being reported you have a conversation with your vet um from farmer's point of view and we want to do is encourage farmers to make changes uh to their practice and what it does is basically this a benchmark and similar to financial about sparking that the bdg members would be familiar with it's showing uh antibiotic usage on the farm and that would compare a with yourself and be with other farmers in the area so basically it allows farmers to understand how your how your use is changing and hopefully what it is to to relate to the other industries so it's a big emphasis in this and it's it's coming to four from processors from supermarkets and so on so everybody has a role to play um from our point of view we will hopefully to be rolling that out through carefree to all the bdg uh members the livestock members over the 20 21 22 year so i would encourage farmers to uh the members to keep an eye out for that so folks that's just that we bet i'm going to finish off here now just on tonight um i say noel will be available here on darn as well before i hang back over daily just to give a quick recap on take home messages uh on tonight um as nola said you know get the basics right you know um good pre-lawman management is vital you cannot go past it you know feed your you well keep her clean and keep the place for she's got alarm clean um if you have problems or if there's things that aren't going right write them down record them and then do something about it um you know speak with the likes of noel if you haven't got one get an animal health plan in action um strongly encourage you to do that there as i said on recovery resistance is an issue um i want to make people aware of it however antibiotics are necessary at times but please speak to your vet and use them as necessary obviously as in james's case you know be mindful of buying in disease um keep your flock as close as possible and finally there in red you know where you can i know it has emphasized that very strongly vaccinate while it's for foot problems whether it's for um abortions or whatever you can do whatever um vaccinations you can do you know speak to your vet and drop a plan on your farm so say prevention is better than cure so folks thank you very much uh for that that's us and in terms of the presentation so we'll hand back over to alien now i'll see if there's any questions uh we're more than happy to take them so thank you very much that's great um thank you thank you very much james newell and sannen excellent presentations i'm sure you will all agree a huge amount of very valuable information especially now when we're all possibly somebody who's already there but sort of just getting stuck into lamb and um james is doing a great job with what he's doing and you can also see the benefits having a good working relationship with your vet and prevention is always better than cure where possible we have got quite a few good um questions here folks so i'm going to get stuck in um i'll maybe just start with the gm's um because a lot of the questions that are coming in are very much focused in and around your um system and i suppose james there was a bit of a talk in relation to um your barn widths and a lot that's got to do with feed so a question we have here is did you try increasing your feed or your meal or by male or improved forage um six to ten weeks post happen and do you think that would have a benefit on your barn with i know possibly you might want to comment on that um i suppose it's the management of that you are immediately passed upon if that's beneficial well the o's had crystallics like buckets introduced from three three weeks after they went through arms those are particularly bad wet sleepy weeks they were introduced to that they stayed on crystal x pockets for probably six weeks then went on to mail and silage wants to come off their arms and it hasn't made a wild pile of difference this year bill oxford yeah um and i suppose we just did so i go ahead no yeah well james last year when you started to feed your decocks wasn't even a meal earlier do you think the fact that they were fed a bit earlier do you think did that have an effect you know maybe what do you think they had free access to crystal x buckets this year probably before they had the decocks last year right fair enough there was no buckets with them last year at all until they got the mail so it's hard to know yeah i will there's one other thing that i just want to mention this on that bar with black faces coming off a hell scenario there is an issue i think with maybe reaching maturity and some of the younger youth and just what wait you know so uh just on that point uh we have just in the county down just i remember the castlevania and blackfish breeders i have sent out a questionnaire there last week a job with 40 farmers who are part of that group just to check to see what the results are like and a whole range of questions regarding just the length of time one hill and a few other questions around it just to see if we can try and get to the bottom of why there is maybe a bit of a burn like you know what i mean for personally i think the three biggest factors maybe is minerals toxo and possibly your maturity basically i think there'd be three factors plus this nutrition shortly after uh after topple like that they they would be the four factors i think um yeah and there's another question which links vaguely to that i understand as opposed to age but um in relation to your lamented gems um your laminate is seems quite early for a hell farm um do you think it would be possible if you push that back would it you know would that coincide even i even think from a financial point of view in relation to grass growth and keeping the youth outside for longer with that help from you know a nutritional point of view and i suppose in relation to the stress and maybe senna if you could even comment there on how this is on the other farms the other hull farms in the program well the helios is three weeks behind from the crossbred use for start they're not lamin now to the fifth april but we we have split the two up we've put the crossbred users out three weeks earlier from a labor point of view you get most of the crossword used through and then you can concentrate in the helios come on nearly as a separate batch yeah and just just on the the farms within the program uh we'll have a bit of a range actually we'll have um some of the hell one slam on literally the 20th of march up to the 10th of april and the crossbred used from the 12th of march the 27th of march so there is a fairly better range you know within that um like james is by no means you know the the the earliest for the for the ldos like no yeah um and i suppose maybe why we're on that theme there's another sort of sort of question or sort of maybe suggestion coming in you know and a lot of us are possibly guilty of this that's maybe something that we need to think about but you know housing your whole use does seem like you're sort of adopting that intensive type system without the input or possibly what the input have you any plans to try and get used laminar outdoors or to reduce labor in the common years or is the system that you have in place the one that you feel is best for yourself we'd be short of grass for or grazing for those hellos if we didn't house some of them would be my opinion on that but i also would find that there's as much labor if you're going to look about the o's i hit the alarms where they're on hindus or crossbred use so i would rather put on a butter extra label on the sheared and try to decrease my motile to it and maybe sam how do you feel maybe the other guys in the program are they on a similar sort of train of thought there or the the labor thing is something that you know in the purest sense you could say yes the hell you should be on the hill all the time the crossbar using the thing reality in a lot of cases is labor um you know getting there we're getting help and in a lot of cases it's it's just easier you know the time is time is of the essence and that seems to be a lot of fellas are looking at that you know it's it's an easier option than spending time driving around fields you know but rightly or wrong way but that's that's the way it's been looked at you know yeah um okay we have a good few questions i suppose in relation to um you know that management of lamb and i suppose definitely from a veterinary and disease point of view i know i'll maybe um i'll touch you with yourself with this one um but has anyone had any experience using products such as pure x3 water bowls and the impact of this and watering both and lambs the influence of oil i just missed it there island using purex through water bowls what is purex i wouldn't be sure if but i haven't come across it um i'm not sure it must be i'm assuming it's something that someone has um has possibly tried or used um well maybe we'll maybe get a bit more information on that one and come back to you okay okay and i suppose then i'm relation that i'm maybe just while we're on the train of thought of vaccines and whatnot is there a vaccination from status and she quite a bit of our antibiotic use this year has been dealing with some status um any suggestions there any maybe help there well there isn't uh like a vaccination from a stadium sheep yet because if the mistakes that she generally get is what tends to be a staph aureus mistake is where you can get you know if are you sucking two lambs outside and how did this you take the status you get like a bad three or four days of weather a couple of days a bit of stress a little bit of dirt in the round maybe a throttle you're feeding them and you just you'll come and carry the leg like that's the obvious case and no matter what you do she tends to lose that quarter and you're maybe struggling to save you but uh there's no vaccine even in the dairy sector for cows there's only one vaccine serve available for acute e-coli and it's a very labor intensive for you use when you have to go three or four times so we're we're a long way away from a vaccination from a stagnation sheet at the moment like i said i would say yeah yeah yeah and maybe i'll maybe just bring we'll have you there maybe just bring it back because obviously there's a huge amount of interest and focus on you know preventing those deaths in those young lambs in relation to watery mouth and um you know it's been suggested you know obviously the used classroom is the best you can possibly give to that lamb so a few questions here um you know is there a benefit or a merit to getting a refractometer to test the quality of classroom and also um if you do milk a used classroom how long will can it be stored well in the fridge or freezer well firstly just for storing it in the fridge you can definitely store it for 24 hours like i would say there's no issue probably maybe slightly longer but 24 hours would be a good gold standard go with that a using your refractometer to test your colostrum i think it just would be useful to compare cloth from from one yolk to the next to the next because sometimes you might think it all looks very similar i know some of it is more viscous and more yellow that's what we're looking for and as soon as you get slightly waterier uh for some issue maybe the useless slightly earlier or the yield wasn't just as good a neck a purse might not be as good and if you are going to store any or freeze any if you use your refractometer for your spare test it just store and freeze the best and you can freeze it the same way you freeze cow colostrum small amounts that are easily soldered out not too big so you can slide small amounts do not use it to make the microwave saw it out slowly that's because the antibodies that we want to get into the lamb in that first couple of hours of birth that you get your antibodies transfer that's what we're looking for uh you don't want to be destroying loose antibodies yeah yeah um and then i suppose just maybe on that thought just will happen on that train of thought on the veterinary side of things um your thoughts on using um on dosing use around lamenting in round level and this is your preparing for touring it rise if you took down samples from yours as they come up the lamin you would see the number of eggs being produced increasing and then during early lactation we use under stress so the thought to thinking was that if you always uh is dosed in around one that she goes from the shed to the things she's not going to be shedding uh so i still would would be sort of on that line of thought that i would be doing would in around then but that might be the only warm dose of that you need during the year like we're trying to reduce this into mature sheep and and the way to get on top of that is take your your love of dung samples later on in the year but i would still be maybe juicing that you a sort of either as you leave the lemon pen or sometimes somebody remember dosing yours when they're doing their haptic pee you can maybe stick your worm dose in there and have that done one last job for at lamenting and and they're definitely not going to be maybe going out maybe we'll be shedding more but it's the case of just trying to reduce the amount of worms hitting the pasture okay no that's great that's great no that's brilliant thank you and we'll possibly just move slightly away i suppose from from where we're sitting at in relation to the veterinary side of things and john you look like you're possibly getting it too easy there and let me see if you've got some advice for ourselves um we've sort of mentioned earlier on about this whole you know hull farm getting away but intensive uh and is that the right sort of way to be going and it's a difficult one dancer and i suppose maybe taking that into consideration you know we've been reading about the performance of health sheep systems in recent weeks and particularly improved scanner rates you know with some of these farmers be better to increase their lowland flock numbers and retail in a small sort of you know flock of house shape um for better quality ground and then you know take it sort of like advantage of the challenges of getting them back up in the summer again you know from the likes of yourself and maybe some of the experience you've had with these different health farmers would you have any sort of recommendations or suggestions yes i mean i suppose that's that's the consequence of obviously i suppose maybe doing a good job and some of them farmers doing a good job is that there's more grass around kind of increasing slightly and there is a happy medium before you go because we all want to drive outward but if you drive out for too much we end up having more of our twins say suckling lambs and yours down on green ground or in by grazing or whatever the different farmers uh phrases and there is a risk enough once vegetation starts getting out of control is trying to get the sheep back up there like i've seen some some farms that have done that say sometimes it might be a few years say maybe ahead on the under charges sort of program uh where they've had experiences they've increased say maybe lowland numbers are brought in a percentage of that to keep the pressure on the oh and trying saying that happy balance that was well that's a hard concept when we're trying to increase numbers of course if you end up having too much down we're just going to end up buying concentrates uh putting in a lot of cost in the system that isn't really giving it back and at the end of the day and it's all it's unfortunate i'm going to say what i'm going to say is that a lot of the income on some of these farms is coming from how you manage the hill and if we put that at risk where we're creating more challenges as well so i do think that we need to have a re-look and and that's something we'll be looking at synonymous looking at the golden berries uh with the environmental side of the category is the condition of these hills and how we can bring them into a more productive state even if they say the increase in little side has gone up so we get more out of the hill for longer during the year yeah yeah no we see that problem you know across hills and like you say a lot of the time a huge amount of income and possibly going forward i mean we don't know we don't have a crystal ball but that might be where it's generated and i suppose farmers are like the rest of us you know we like to follow a trend and you know someone sort of suggested here you know as the train for these you know this chasing this lowland replacement market you know breeding these fancy replacements are going to get a high price is that in some way you know does do do you think that's going to cause an issue you know we're chasing a different ball and maybe taking her eye off the ball that is managed and then that hell um and if you any you know suggestions or how is that responsible for maybe some of the situations we're in yeah and and look at uh we never feared until probably someone takes to know and saying this what i'm going to say is it may be wrong but i i think that in some areas that has been detrimental to the management of say the sheep system to the management of ill vegetation and it's chasing i won't say chasing the show but it's chasing maybe higher prices and look at it every time has to improve and we all have to i suppose maybe improve our own stuff but i've seen some fans that have maybe taken on more lanark green for sort of your sharper type mule uh sometimes they have gone for a bigger type your to have a bigger type you will be that's what selling best who didn't find in this that you always maybe got into too too heavy the other live race particularly under harder hills and that they're just not surviving up there and this uh and if you're in a situation where you're bringing feed up to them as well that i think just first of all the system has to be the breed has to suit your terrain and i think then it's it's trying to push that after and like look at we all want to improve genetics there is genetics that can be improved the ramsay to try and bring a bit more extraordinary quality into it into that land and there's one area where the hillside i think is really lacking on this and we do hold up to have to hold up behind the whole area around to the ethics genotype and black books like there is a massive role there for the north and south like uh right across i suppose all hill systems in trying to drive that forward because there is a superior performance she hasn't given lightweight in every breed and i think it's trying to identify them and trying to get a program in place and that's something we need to move towards yeah and it's great to see that those thoughts and it brings us quite well into the next question those thoughts are in their minds of our listeners tonight because a great question is coming you know has dna a role to play in getting to the bottom of barnes and blackfish use and i do think also is there a role to play and you know making sure that we're breeding the most appropriate use for the hull i mean i'm happy to throw that open to even to both james um darn santa and yourself i mean whoever maybe wants to have a go with that first or maybe yourself stan and you know where is the likes of flock recording and dna where does that sit within the program and how important is it to the guys in the program well it is well it's probably something down the line yet ailing to be honest um a lot of the production stuff we're trying to improve but yes the whole i know within calfrey of sales there was like a genomics project um going in um and hopefully ruled out in the next period of time so yes it is something that needs to be done something needs to be done you know and yes we very much the farmers in the program would be very much on for that type of you know to get down to that level of scrutiny to see is there help to be there and say the farmers have said every one of them about ebv's you know any sort of help to help reading you know very one part very open but we all all hell lacking farmers probably would say that they're empty hogging use they tend to just get through back to the hill they're tend to be retained if you know what i mean uh i do think myself personally that the yields that are empty as first glamors i think if they were maybe immediately taken out of the equation and maybe that might be a step forward if you know what i mean yes whether those were smaller ones or younger or for some reason but other breeds wouldn't tolerate those empty u's whereas unknown hillbridge that the empty yields tend to get back out some come back in the next year and have maybe a pair of lambs and the whole thing's okay sometimes maybe they don't but that's something i think that possibly needs considered uh because i think from a genetic point of view you've got a pool of animals constantly you know that that maybe our role environment if you don't mean like it's definitely not helping the issue yeah it's probably something all that say from research point of view it would be great if that'd say what's in a mention there about the economics program but even if they got to program up and running like that even with farmers and we're attracting even cheap baron one year what's coming the next year yeah you decided that i'm definitely keeping these because look we're working with a group of farmers this at the end of the day it's all a commercial decision so if they decide that they're keeping them just even though we have a record of them and i know some of the families are doing that now to know and and even james with his eid it would be refreshing to see how what yours are performing if there's any sort of trainings or that it comes comes to mind over the next couple of years and i'll maybe possibly bring james in on this one it may be if you know just a very quick sort of like overview of the records you're keeping or that records that you think are important for selecting your replacements um obviously with barnes and maine but you know obviously to make sure you're selecting the best replacements on farm at the moment we were increasing numbers there for a number of years we had bothered that was basically calling the very worst to them and keeping all the blackies apart from anything that had a physical defect of some sort but going forward you'd be aiming for the best best growing alarms out of the most probably your earliest lamb lambs as well which was your most fertile use i've tapped in the first cycle and your best growing lambs was to six weeks and i was also that's the used milk coming through to six weeks yeah no that's great um i'm not sure if there's anything maybe that you would want to add from a program point of view the sort of records that you're recommending to the guys in the program to keep now you know from lamb and through as opposed to win and to try you know and help you know make sure that they're selected from the the most prolific and most suitable use yeah well like obviously the rebound of the program is to help the individual farmers but that's to go out to everybody else um obviously ead is a great system um i would say we have a fair few of the farmers with it and we're just encouraging those and james is a great example and that he is using it more however you know for those that don't have ead or any other farmers there's listening you know a simple notebook uh i know hillsborough i just finally found one earlier on hillsborough used the wii lamman book you know such things like uh did the you need assistance did the alarm get up you know some sort of we record even though he's if your computer are happy with it you know a spreadsheet or something out there some sort of record that you know at the end of lam and you don't sit back and say oh i must mark her let you for whatever issue per colostrum or whatever that you have a record so a simple notebook you know convert it into a spreadsheet if you're so wish or you know the rolls royce obviously would be the id system you know some think you don't forget about it and then use that throughout the year yeah yeah yeah and i suppose those records you know bringing back to the theme that we have the night the whole use of antibiotics you know and medicines within shape how important those records are um and i suppose maybe you know even for yourself null you know obviously you said you sell antibiotics but it's also your job to do the best we can but you know is there a risk in assessing lifestyle enterprises on the volume of antibiotics used rather than the actual type of antibiotics um and that is if we want to reduce antibiotics will not just lead to the use of top shelf sort of critical antibiotics you know do we need to safeguard those and i suppose then you know what we but you know and relating to purex you know um we've been a background research the fact that it's a probiotic um are they possibly beneficial um for us and if anybody else wants to maybe make a comment on that they can yeah well probiotics if they're shown to to be useful if you know what i mean sometimes when there's a gap in the market you get some stuff appears and when you actually read into the back of it there's not an awful lot of research or a lot of data support in it so just probiotics shouldn't do any harm but from the point of view of the top shelf antibiotics i would like us to be able to retain the use of all these top-shelf antibiotics so but it's up to us to control what they're being used for some of the older antibiotics the likes of like oxycat footages are like a broad standard allen icing uh if it's used correctly that's still a very very useful sheet antibiotic but we want to get away from using it in hundreds and thousands of years three weeks before allowing there's no need for that from the point of view it's been used most for controlling foot rot and for really preventing enzymatic abortion storms there's two examples of where i would say you know seven to eighty percent of the antibiotics has been used that can be changed over to using vaccination and so like that would make up a they'll put a big hole in the amount of antibiotics that we've got for use and so like that's sort of the way forward i think you know yeah okay um that's great and i suppose that sort of brings us back um i am conscious of time and i'm conscious obviously there's a lot of good questions but hopefully you know we've answered we've got a good answer across the board but i think it's also very important to bring that you know the whole thing background to you know these systems have to make money and they have to be profitable and maybe touch yourself with this one darn you know can you see a system whereby processors or supermarkets are prepared to pay for projects that has been produced you know this so-called antibiotic-free you know is this would this be a good thing for supermarkets is it gonna you know obviously we can see the health benefits from it but um is there is there a pay point for the farmers here yeah and i suppose what i'd say in that idea is this i do think that that there probably is uh say an appetite there but i do but i think that is probably the wrong way for the industry to go and i've seen that a bit say there's been a bit of work done initially and even some greenlands have been exported a couple of years ago there that were meant to be sort of uh i divorced uh benchmarks haven't received no antibiotics at all in their life hopefully uh for me is if we were to offer supermarkets something like that but the more we offered supermarkets the more they intake and the more that they put this in as the standard and the next question will be is well if there's a standard there that you can't produce uh that you can produce a and you've got a tree what's wrong with everything else that is produced and naught hit the nail on the head early on when he said strategic use of antibiotics like antibiotics are vital in every agricultural enterprise they're vital in human health that's why we have them and that's why we need to stay at garden so i would be just cautious i i wouldn't like to see it happen uh i would prefer to see uh something like a sort of hidden develop on the back of the environment that it's brought up on rather than anything sort of towards antibiotics ideas yeah yeah and i think everyone on the panel here the nate will definitely you know agree with you there um you know antibiotics they're there they have a place you know we want you know healthy sheep but we also do one sheep that are in pee and so we need to share that you know that we we look after them and we have you know a perfect sort of forage based diet or grass sort of environment to produce good healthy lambs folks i'm conscious and of time and we have tried to answer a good range of questions i'm sure that there probably will be sort of different burning questions that come along and if you are in a business development group please contact your local advisor with any other questions and they can feed them back to us if you're not in a group please do contact um the guys within the northern sheep program contact either graham campbell from caffrey darren carty from the journal or san an um who is advisor folks just before i go to wrap up and a few and say a few thank yous i do want to especially in the light of the sort of tonight's event in relation to help i do want to make you aware of some important work ongoing work in relation to sheepskab it seems to be common more of a more of an issue and it's not something we want to see on sheep farms there is a northern ireland sheep scab survey um it will be um it's a great opportunity as opposed to kind of trying to identify the problems that we have there within the industry and it is anonymous and they do want to hear from all sheep farmers are relevant of size you know from large blocks to small flux um the survey will take about 10 or 15 minutes to complete and the link you can find the link at www.harperdashadams.onlineservice.ac.uk.um forward slash na

it when something small simple and inexpensive makes my life better don't you hi i'm ardith and today's quick video is about things in my craft room that didn't cost much but they really make a difference in how efficient i am when i'm making cards and some of them are homemade so they're even cheaper let's dive right in number one is my thin magnets for my misti these magnets are one and an eighth inch in diameter and a sixteenth of an inch thick like really thin i love them because they're big so they hold everything in place really well but they're also easy to pick up and when they snap together they don't catch the skin on my fingers i got them from amazon here in canada but i'm sure you can find them where you are too number two is binder rings for my nesting dies this was genius if i do say so myself these nesting circles and squares are the dies i use the most and i may want any size at any time so having them close by and easy to grab really helps me to keep moving as i'm making my cards number three is my sponge dauber holders i have a sponge dauber for each of my catherine pooler colors and there's about 60 of those the cases that are available for the daubers hold 40 and the drawers i keep my mini inks and daubers in can't hold two of the cases one day i was watching tv and i just cut a bunch of cardstock strips and i formed them into little boxes i glued them into a 12x8 grid which fits perfectly into my drawer and then i glued long strips around the outside to hold it all together number four is my spray studio in my craft room i have a small closet and in there i have stacked drawers that hold lots of my papers as well as my magnets and stamp pockets for stamp storage and other things this year i took one set of drawers out of the closet and i set up my spray station it's really just a cardboard box i keep my sprays in an old plastic container and i line the areas around the box with some bristol board to catch any overspray number five is my cricut spatula about a hundred years ago i owned one of the very first crickets the ones with the cartridges anyway it came with tools and this thin flexible metal spatula was meant for releasing the cut paper from the sticky cutting mat but it works like a charm for separating those layers that i put down wrong pretty much every time i use goo gone type stuff to clean the glue off it every once in a while number six is another homemade area in my craft room my photo studio in quotes this is not professional in any way but it mostly meets my needs because i have a big north facing window that gives me a ton of natural light it's built from two pieces of white foam core to bounce white light back down onto the area that's being photographed the base is another piece of foam core that's wrapped in gray vinyl wallpaper that i got on amazon number seven is my color-coded stamp and die storage system this is a hack i've shared before but it's another one i started way way back when i put my stamps and dies into pockets for storage i put a line of color at the top of the white card stock insert i have green for sentiments yellow for backgrounds red for christmas gray for dyes and i've added a couple of new colors this year lilac for the bear wear series from ellen hudson and for my birch press dies i've also changed some colors being on the design team i have a lot of those dies and having them all gray didn't really help me find them easily so i kind of combined my two systems dark red means christmas dies dark green means word dies dark blue means layering dyes and so on and while we're talking about those intricate birch press dies number eight is a tool that makes weeding out those pieces really easy it's the tool in one from spellbinders and this brush end just rolls over the die and presses out all the little pieces quickly and easily finally number nine is the tool i invented about 10 years ago when i was making wedding invitations for a friend and i needed a way to heat emboss an image onto the envelopes without that thin paper burning my foil lined shoebox lid this is as simple as foil from the kitchen doubled up and taped into a shoebox lid then you just put the piece you're embossing into the lid and heat it up with your heat gun you don't have to hold on to the piece so it reduces the risk of burnt fingers and i think that the foil reflects the heat back onto the reverse side of the piece and reduces warping too as i said i created my first one about 10 years ago this is only my second one so it's really really great value all these little hacks are tried tested and truly my favorites and i'm betting you have similar hacks i'd love to hear all about them share them in the comments below thanks so much for watching see you next time", "SS6medwHhsM": "hey it's marin welcome back to my channel this week i'm going to be showing you how i set up montessori inspired spaces in my house for my toddler and my baby to just explore their environments and learn and if you know me in person then you already know i'm super obsessed with like the montessori world and just like lifestyle and type of teachings um because i love allowing my children just the freedom to explore their environment and learn on their own so this video i'm going to be showing you how i set up just certain spaces around my house because my toddler is getting so big and she needs more spaces to continue to grow and learn on her own so let's get on to it okay so to start the video i just want to quickly explain like what montessori is for those of you who don't know or who may just be doing like research and things like that the montessori like way is kind of to just allow your child to be their own person you look at them as their own person and allow them to lead themselves and what they're doing and just giving them the freedom to be able to do things for themselves and on their own and i definitely love like the montessori kind of way because it just gives my daughter like the confidence to know that she's her own person she can do things for herself it just she's pretty independent she's only two and yeah it's just really helping us it's really working for us and my daughter is learning just so much every single day and i love the fact that i'm not really like forcing her to learn things that she wants to learn things on her own because of the way that her like environment is set up she has the freedom to explore and learn anything she wants so yeah that's the way we do the montessori like inspired ways and teachings and things so that's what like montessori is like in a nutshell and yeah let's just get started on the video and how i am preparing these certain spaces so for this video i'm preparing the play room the bathroom the kitchen in multiple areas and our laundry room oh i am not a montessori teacher i wish i was um this is just the things that i do with my babies and that i feel like have been helping us and what just works for us so take that as you will and this is how i'm setting up our house so let's get home hey it's mary and welcome back to my channel this week i'm going to be finally organizing and just redoing my daughter's like play area in our living room so we follow like a montessori inspired um just lifestyle so her playroom it needs some help okay it's just so unorganized i'll show you in a minute let's see we have little baby bell over here making all the noise okay so yeah anyway everything is just a huge huge huge mess this was like all montessori inspired and you know everything had izabelli everything had everything had a place and now it's literally just yeah chaos chaos ksks everything is chaos so even like this box up here full of toys so the plan for today is to finally finally get this area together again and i'm just gonna be taking you along on how i do like [Music] on how i set up like her montessori inspired and styled playroom okay so i've been holding off on doing like this play room because i have been waiting for these like presenting trays to come in these like wooden trays and they finally came in honestly they've been here for like a week and a half or something and your girl still hasn't done anything with this room clearly it has been struggling for a while so now i have no excuse i have all the trays ready to go um i've been doing some more research on which toys that i want to put out for both of the girls and i'm ready so let's get on to it okay so as i am preparing to just clean up this room and organize everything you'll see me referencing this book and this book is the montessori toddler and i got it on amazon and when i tell you this book is literally amazing it's a whole guide on like what montessori is how to start montessori like the approach that you need to take how to de-clutter organize your space what kind of activities your toddler should be doing at what age group that they're in and it's seriously just amazing so i'm definitely referencing this book to make sure that the toys that i'm going to be putting out are appropriate for my girls and their age group if you are looking on any kind of material about montessori and all of that i highly highly highly recommend this book okay so here we are finally completed and this first shelf is actually the baby's shelf because when she crawls around this is the only shelf that she can access and so i just have a couple of like teething toys a sensory ball and this like pop up and down school bus thing that she absolutely loves and it's just perfect for her on the second drawer i just went ahead and put in their musical instruments and my daughter loves this triangle and these maracas almost all of these toys i got on amazon so i'll be sure to link everything in the description down below so be sure to check that out if you're interested in any of these things on the third shelf i went ahead and put her geo board and then on the fourth shelf technically it's a little high for her and i'm putting the arts and crafts things on top of here as well as her sandpaper letters and these are toddler safe scissors they can only cut paper and i absolutely love these and then right above that shelf i went ahead and put her sorting bears and her sorting like blocks so at the bottom i already explained is the babies we got musical instruments we got hand-eye coordination and then we got arts and crafts and then some more language so this very top shelf holds all of our homeschooling materials so here you see the montessori toddler which i referenced earlier all the rest of her sandpaper letters homeschooling materials and then in this wonderful box we have all of her crayons at the top and i make sure to use the like twistable ones because they're not as easy to break so i really enjoy those and then her washable markers washable paints her dry erase markers all of that and then the very very top of this shelf i went ahead and put extra material like her stamps for language um the rest of her books for her speech therapy an object permanent box for the baby like just extra materials up here so in the kitchen i have the drawer that's closest to the ground that she can reach i put all of her dishware in this drawer and this is why i love montessori teaching like let's just see it in action okay you can do it there he goes wow good [Music] okay here yeah let's put that on your tray too okay my mom grab it there you go you need more you did wow thank you you can do it you can do it you can do it baby um okay let's put it on okay [Music] now what it's a little warm it's a little cold for that one that's the one you want the eyeshadows yeah it's cold outside you gotta wear that one babe there you go can you put it on here baby it's your arm yeah yeah right through there hi mama um here you go baby you're welcome lovey okay let's see wow go show daddy you did it [Music] where

done minecraft ties with the ribbon at the side and you open it up isn't that lovely okay i've put a piece in here for you to write your own greeting um and i've done my bits over there decorating it and i put my verse in there as well and these come in different sizes and everything i have done mine this way around so that it will stand up on your shelf from side views it would look like that okay so it can be seen and lots of them i saw opened up this way which i suppose you could have that so that it would sit open like that um but i decided i wanted mine to go like that and um i've had to change my measurements because i wanted to do a card that's five and a half inches by five and a half inches so that you can get one out of either a4 cardstock or if you're in north america you can get one out of your cardstock too the finished card how i post mine is i would use one of my shop bought six by six envelopes if you have a ambulate punch board you could make your own but the that fits into a 6x6 envelope beautifully because obviously there's quite a bit of thickness there okay so let's get started i'm going to start off by showing you the card pieces that you're going to be needing and i'm going to the designer series paper i'm going to be using poinsettia place so to start off with you need i will also be putting the metric measurements in the box below the video so you need a garden green card base which measures five and a half inches by 11 inches scored at five and a half you need a piece of designer series paper which measures 10 and a half inches by 10 and a half inches you will need two pieces of very vanilla cardstock which measure five and a quarter inches by five and a quarter inches they are the two that will go on the outside because i have decorated the back as well then you will need two pieces of designer series paper also for the front of the card and the back and these measure five inches by five inches yeah and then you need two pieces of very vanilla which measure five inches by five inches and these are the two pieces for the inside of the card to cut this one here okay and i'm going to show you how to line up your stamparatus to do that bit of stamping as well so if you're like me and you use your stamparatus for virtually all your stamping now i'll show you the easy way of doing that right so to start off with i think we'll do this bit first and that is our folding if you have a directional pattern and you want to open your card this way you need to do the fold here if you wanted directional pattern and you want to open it this way you need to do your straight fold across there all the other folds are diagonals so the easy way to remember is whichever way your fold on your card is going to go that's the direction you need to have your straight fold to go all right so we're going to do the straight fold down here so i need my straight fold down here this isn't directional but just imagine it is for the purpose of explaining this okay so the first fold turn your design over okay so that's the design i'm having inside turn it over and fold in half now i do not recommend that you use a bone folder for your creases this is paper and too much much scoring and it will make it split and your finger really will crease it enough so open that back up again now this time fold corner to corner take your time to make sure you get it right and then open that up again and then fold it corner to corner on the opposite side okay right now where you've got the straight fold which is this one here you should be able to um right let me show you how i'm doing this i'm putting my fingers underneath the straight fold my index fingers and i'm putting my thumb and my middle finger on either side on top of my paper as you bring it in it should just come to fold up like that okay and what we're going to do is put those two pieces together and then get this to fold so that that fold lines up down there and that fold lines up down there okay okay your finger is enough to do the folds on this now what you need to do is you can either mark where halfway is or you can use where your two folded bits join those two together that's going to be your halfway mark so you could either mark it on here or you can just eyeball it and you take the first corner and you fold it so that it lines up with that crease there okay so it's the crease that's nearest to it fold it like that and the most important thing about this is making sure that all of this stays flat all the time don't have one of these raising up okay so there's that one now i'm going to do the same for this one bring it over line it up with the fold on that side making sure they're level okay they've got to be leveled that way you see that's sinking down so that is not good see that's sliding down yes you can okay so i've got to make sure that comes up level once that's in place give that a squeeze turn this over and then do exactly the same on the other side to bring that one up just make sure that's all nice and flat still and then squeeze that down bring this one over line it up make sure it's all nice and flat and then squeeze that down okay trust me no bone folder is necessary now what you need to do is one at a time open this up open that and then push that so it folds into the other direction so it's going to fold on where you folded that folded that make sure that comes out to the point line these two up and then fold that one down okay so you finish up with a straight edge with your point disappeared inside turn it and we're going to do the same to this one push the straight bit in find where your folds are go get it down to go to the point make sure they're nice and straight and then give that a squeeze move around one more take this one open it up push the straight line in find your crease lines at the side here push that down so that you get to the point make sure these line up it might need a bit of encouragement like that one did okay and increase that on the inside and then round to the last one push that in find these fold lines make sure they line up beautifully and then squeeze that so then if you lay that down you should find that that is all nice and straight across there okay and then that should be level and that should be level okay now at this stage i will use one bone fold with the bone folder once all right on that side on that side there and there and that is it that's all i'm doing so that's how your card is going to be opening up cloud rhythm right next thing we're going to do is we're going to adhere this inside out card before you start trying to glue it in have a look to see where it's going to fit you will see that you will have a gap on this side you have a gap on that side and you'll have a slightly bigger gap there okay it's just much easier to familiarize yourself before you start gluing okay so when you close this that will fit right into the fold there so what i'm going to do is i'm using tombow you could use nail plus not snail plus seal plus which is our tape runner at the moment it doesn't matter which side is which all right so i want that into the corner there i don't want this gap on this side to be about the same as that side there we go okay so i've got my green gap that side grid gap this side and a bigger gap on there okay and that fits into the corner so now i'm going to put glue on here and then i'm going to push that down onto that side you can see how quick and easy this comes together in all the videos i saw you would be amazed at the different sizes that people do there was one that was really quite a small one it was just a bit bigger than a gift card really i suppose there we go let's give that a good flattened down to give tombow a chance to do its job now the way you do your fastening is entirely up to you you could do a belly band if you like i prefer the idea of the ribbon i think it's an easier way of doing it so to do that i forgot to get my snail i have still got some snail which is why i haven't moved on to seal yet um so these next pieces what i'm going to do first of all i'm going to adhere them together five and five they're both for the inside it's five and a quarter five and a quarter that's it i don't think this is a directional pattern but there are times i think [Music] and i've chosen to use very vanilla with this although it says this goes with white i'll show you my poinsettias that i've made i've done this ahead of time obviously i thought the white looked a bit stark i don't know if you can see that on camera can you i hope so but the white one i will use that for something but i just felt that that goes better than the white one okay i'll show you that so that you have the choice you may prefer the white one looks best right let's stick these together i've wanted to do one of these cards for absolutely ages and i don't know i stumbled across a video the other day for one of these and i was just so surprised at how easy it was so i thought i must share this with you i'm sure you'll love it that one as you can see i have prepared some of my images beforehand partly because it is just so time consuming especially when you want to do the poinsettias like that and you don't want to rush when you're doing a project like this you don't want to rush and finish up doing something that maybe you think i'm really very happy with that this is our hobby so we should take our time to enjoy okay so that will now be going on here i think i'll do that [Music] oh that's better that way for that one let's see which way oh that looks alright doesn't it no definitely that way okay so what i do is i use my snail to help me and i want my ribbon to go halfway i'm going to use this which is from the forever greenery combo you get to roll with this and you also get some gold cold which is great for this time of the year and i think if i remember rightly i cut myself 22 inches um that's 16. that's 22 oh i'm going to do 24 just in case right so what i'm going to do is i know this is five and a half by five and a half so half is two and three quarters i'm just going to get my pencil turn it this way two and three quarters yes yes so just make a pencil mark there and a pencil mark there and turn it over to the same again on this side this grid paper is so amazingly helpful for so many different things um i don't think i've got the right way wrong way this design have i no i haven't okay so i just take my snail just put a little bit on that line from that line this is just to hold it in place while i'm putting my front and back covers on it so i've got that in half so my fold is going to go on the back of my card there we go and i'm going to put that across like that i'm going to double check that that is right use my turn three quarter inches again and as long as both sides are the same then i will be happy okay slightly out but that's all right at least they're both out the same amount okay so a bit of snail again pull that straight and this time if you make sure the one underneath is down straight and then pull this one to line up with the one underneath there we go that's close enough so the first one i'm going to keep this way around so put some tombow on this again you can use tape if you prefer i'm not quite sure what my design is going to be like for this card i've prepared um just three bits i think it's all going to work out i don't have any alternative plans i'm that hopeful that this will work out okay so pop that on in the center should have the same gap all the way around and what i normally do when i do this i normally put some glue on here as well i forgot to do that on the opposite side but nevermind in fact the front isn't it the other side in fact because i would have turned it while i was putting the glue on i will just check make sure i have still got it up the right way now without getting myself into a mess yes that's the front definitely the front yes oops don't do that there we go so then to close if you push the two bits together and then pull in night not tight and then you can do it up in fact that 24 inches looks better than the 22 but i'm not going to do it right up now i want to do my decorating now i know you're curious you want to know how we're going to do that bit in there we have a way with our two pieces of 5 inches by five inches on three sides you need to mark at two and a half inches just one little line because with this is five inches by five inches we know two and a half is halfway normally i would use my grid paper but i just want to make sure that you can see exactly what i'm doing this is quite a crucial bit okay we'll go down double check it right that's good so now you need your trimmer oh i didn't say to you with your cardstock that you needed that you would need scraps for your decorating like anything that you're doing here if you're stamping this was actually the dsp that i cut up but i've given you the measurements for the two pieces in there so anything else you want to go on there you need scraps for okay so my trimmer now put the one up at the top so you've got one there one pencil mark there one pencil mark there and one there so you're going to go from the top one down to the side put both marks into your cutting track and then slice and then turn it so this is the top one and i'm going to cut down to the one on the opposite side i forgot we've got two pieces to do haven't we let's do the other one now that you've seen me do one the other one i'm going to do using my grid paper so that's one there one there and that's my top one right so my top one is here and i'm going to cut down to this one put that mark into the cutting track and that one into the cutting track and then slice and then that pencil mark in the cutting track and your top into the cutting track okay so now i'm going to use my eraser to take those pencil marks off another reason why i think the um i like the idea the ribbon to tie up the card is i think it's probably a better clothing thing if you're going to give a card to a child i mean my favorite method is to use magnets but i would not recommend using a magnet on a card for a child but with this card you could make it such a fun card for children right so that's that and you will see that that is going to fit in there okay so now we just need to decorate it now as you can see on here i've done on one of mine this one i have done my little verse up there and i want to show you how i put that together if i could find my stamparatus obviously this is particularly useful if you're going to do more than one of these um so what did i do okay now because i've got this one in the correct position first of all i'm going to show you that it's correct okay so line that up there and put that in okay let me just do this one first because this is what i'm using for this card dear fighting me shouldn't let those two get too close to each other right okay now this i'm going to stamp in pool party um let me show you the three stamp sets i'm using i'm using four unto us i'm using this verse here which says may your heart be lifted in praise this christmas for the wonderful gift of jesus and the joy he brings to our lives um this one for the poinsettia and merry christmas for the front of the card and that's tag buffet and that's poinsettia petals so let me put one stamp set under here now as you can see that lines up beautifully now i don't want to redo that one so i'm going to show you how you can line one up for here the principle is the same in fact i suppose now that i've done that i could actually redo that couldn't i right let me get my simply shammy i clean that now what you need is close your ink pad first you need to take a piece of computer paper and anything that you're going to be recycling and take it to be a piece of paper that's five inches by five inches just like the piece that we've cut and then if you mark all four sides at two and a half inches and then join them all and the reason i do four is because if i get it wrong first time i can turn it around i have another go and another go but with this if you imagine if you took that off and that off you would finish up with this okay now when you if you left it till here no if you tried to do it when you still had your five by five inches this one no lines on it you would think you could only allow your stamp to go up into that corner underneath it to it two and a half inches where in fact you can come over here so let me show you that if you didn't have your lines on there you just look at that and think um that's got to go in there somehow but once you've drawn that line you know you can go quite a bit over like that okay which is why i've done this bit so what i do then i move this bit over make sure i've got my magnet holding that in place then i place this where i want my sentiment to go now i'm not going to fiddle about with this until i make it perfectly straight it could take all evening okay so i'm just doing this to show you the idea now i've got that in place i don't want to spoil that so i'm going to move that out of the way and with this grid paper when i stamp that i can see whether it's straight or not because i've got lines on here so that's what i'm going to do it doesn't have to be stamped perfect inked up perfectly nor stamped perfectly now my goodness that looks really quite good it is slightly wonky so what i would need to do is move it up slightly okay now i know that that's my position for it um a little bit confused here that's coming down so that's got to go up a bit okay so moving that very slightly and what i'm going to do is ink it up again and so that i can see properly i'm going to move that around and i'm going to stamp that again oh got too high there i can see it okay but you can see the idea of what i'm doing here i know that i've got to keep it there keep moving until i've got it straight on here once it's straight on here i know that i can bring this in like i did and stamp it and it's going to be perfectly straight i hope that makes sense i'm sorry that it takes me so long to get something straight but at least you see the principle of the idea and that's what i've done and this is what i will keep for future use as well next thing i need to do is to decorate the inside of my card i have done this now to decorate what i'm planning to do and i don't want that to go too far away do i um i have done some fussy cutting you could stamp on here oh i've got oh never mind um no i'm gonna leave that um this was die cut with the poinsettia dies which i have here this die here will die cut flowers on here the only ones it will do are the ones where when you look at it none of these extra little bits and pieces actually touch the flower okay there's a gap all the way around on that one this one that's touching touching so you won't be able to die cut that this one here it's nothing is touching so you can die cut that one i think there are four on a sheet if i remember correctly but those are the ones you can die cut which is what i did here but then i i found that two wasn't enough i couldn't really do anything with them so i went to my other sheet which was was it this one yes it was this one and i die cut that one there but die cutting it when they're they've got these other bits attached to it means you do have to go right up to the edge and then once i'd worked that one out i thought i don't want to have one that's got an edge on it so i went around the other one like this and cut the edge off okay so this is the same as that um let's see if i show you there we go okay so it's the same it's just i cut the edging off and now i can put the two together okay which is what i intend to do for here when you die cut the fussy cut these you finish up with a white edge around here now if you've been watching me for a little while you know that i will go round the edges i have actually done all this one already but i go around this is my soft suede by the way that was soft suede ink as well i'm keeping my pen my brush end below my design so if my pen slips then i get a line drawn on there but then i just touch the edge all the way around and that will fill in any white areas okay it also gives you a nice dark brown line all the way around which makes it show up nicely on there now whether this is going to be enough decoration for me or not i'm not going to know until my card is finished i might go back and add some bits on it might not um but i will do it after the video so you can always go onto my blog on the same day that this is posted and there will be photographs of it any changes you'll be able to see in the photographs okay right so let's adhere these two obviously because it's on the inside of my card i'm not going to be using oh let me just do this up first um because it's on the inside of my card i'm not going to be doing any dimensionals okay so now that one is definitely going to go in the corner there thought that fitted in rather nicely if i do need anything else in here i'm not quite sure what i'll be doing no ideas are springing to mind by the time i get this adhered inside my card it may be that it looks good without having too much in there right there we go you may see if you go back to my blog on the day the video is posted you may see that i've done something to cover that little markup not quite sure what if i'd have been anything the idea is coming to my head now is it would be a star which would be appropriate for christmas right there we go that's that one the other one i'm leaving plain because that's to write a sentiment which is the front this is the front okay so i'm going to pop this one in here first again before you start putting glue familiarize yourself with the amount of gap you've got from the folds so get that ribbon out of the way don't get that all glued up i warn you it's not very easy to say probably easier if you use something like stripes or something that's a good way of cheating yes that's okay you see what i mean because that's all very busy with poinsettias that may be enough let's see what it's like once i got that one in and turn this the other way around there we go let's pop that back up there we go so that's all right one of those is a bit sticky because it got onto the glue so there we go that's that so we just need to decorate the front now and what i'm planning on doing that is i made this poinsettia so i'm going to show you that how i did that and i'm also going to stamp the same merry christmas and as you can see i haven't used a diet to die cut that that has just been cut free hand i felt that because this is all straight lines everywhere it needed something to help break it up okay so i'm going to use that on this other card as well so first of all all my scrappy bits here i know one bits thicker than the others taller rather than the other and what i've done here is i have lined up all my three stamps on here let's bring this back pop that in there now i'm only going to die cut one of these stamp all three but die cut just one i'm going to make sure i die and stamp all three of them properly though so that i can go back and finish it afterwards for another project and that looks if it's got to come up a little bit let's just make sure oh touch and go isn't it okay that one there that one there when i started doing my stamping today oops i need another sponge in there don't i've got the wrong mats i realized that my ink pad wasn't very good now this is going to cause me problems because that isn't right up against the edge of there right um okay fingers crossed that's what we can do great thing about stamping up paper does have two sides okay let's try that again anyway as i was saying that my ink pad needs re-inking but i am very very loathe to do that while i'm preparing for a video i have done it before where i have over inked and as they say once bitten twice shy i'd much rather sit here and stamp this several times till i get it right rather than trying to work with an over inked pad um i think they're almost there yes that's beautiful and the other one i need is for my sentiment when stamping up retired these plates i bought several and it is so nice to be able to have separate plates for different things i'm working on i have three of them set up just outside my studio which i'm working on for a class in the mail and it's so nice i haven't got to keep on setting up my stamps that's nearly done let's just give the merry a bit bit more beautiful there we go you shouldn't let your these two magnets get as close as i just allowed mine to get if they snap together chances are they'll break right let's move that that clean those later let's close this one let's just clean myself up a bit i was clumsy i don't know where i got that little lot from okay all right now what i'm going to do is i'm going to die cut one of these i'm not going to do all of them because it's a question of lining up i don't know if you can see i'm going to bring this up really close to you there are two dies for every stamped image here one of them is to actually die cut the flower out and then the other one is to actually emboss veins onto the leaves okay i think you can see the embossing can't you which is why i'm only going to do one now as a demonstration okay i'm going to do the big one it's going to be easiest to see i think now what i've done on the back of mine is coming off is i have done a black mark across here that's gone across onto the outside one as well so i know how to line these two up so what i do is when i'm lining it up this one up onto here i keep that into my fingers so that i know that that is the one where that's got to go okay so this is the one i'm watching which that looks like try turning over the right way there we go that was lucky okay and then this one you pop it in that one i really must use some permanent markers for this rather than whatever it is that's coming off now that has gone in into a good position straight away and it never ever does that so what i was going to say to you what i do is i can't find my oh let's use my scissors i normally use my paper piercer and then i will just push these into the center because quite often i find it sits up against the side on one of them it doesn't matter it's not the end of the world but it does look nicer if you can get it right so let's just cut that so okay you can see the uh embossed marks there it may not be spot on but it adds depth to your to the actual image and particularly if you're building it up as a flower as a 3d flower so what i do next with that is i use my what color did i choose in the end bumblebee and i use the pen end and i just color in the center of the stamens now this bit here didn't print out too well stamp out too well but it doesn't matter because i'll be putting another two on top of here now before i start layering all three together like that i take my index finger put that in the middle and bend the two sides up okay let's get my finger out of the way yeah you can see what i've done there and then i do that and that as you can see it gets easier more you do them okay and then i do the other two and then just put one little bit of glue in the middle there and build them up and i finish up with this which is what i'm going to use on the front of my card make sure i've got the front yes i'm going to put that on here somewhere i'm not sure yet where but i'm going to fussy cut this and i just follow around where the font comes and there really isn't any right or wrong to this at all i like to leave a nice bit of very vanilla underneath let's cut that bit off okay as you can see i don't go in and out precisely the only thing i do be careful of and i've done it there so i will come back in a moment i do make sure that i don't have any pointy bits that's sticking into my hand there let's try that again there we go um you see the pointy bit there above the t i don't like that so i'm going to round that off that's better i want a little bit there as well remove that one there we go have i got a color here that i can pop that on so you can see it there we go oops so that's fine i'm happy with that and i'm going to have that let's just move that to the side because i need to glue it on here now all i need to do is decide how i want this i'm inclined to say in the corner for this i don't want that wonky no want that straight you could do that with dimensionals if you like because you've got depth here um i don't think i will i'm going to go straight for tombow and the thing is this is already quite thick to go through the post here in the uk this will go through as a large letter because of the thickness of it but if you do make it go too thick it will have to go through as a parcel which really is not on when you're sending a christmas card now also don't have to worry about getting that straight either oh lovely makes me feel so relaxed and this i am going to use tombow as well so just a little bit as you see i haven't used any leaves anywhere here and i don't think i'm going to right there we go i think i'm happy with that let's see what it looks like if i close it up this is beautiful ribbon it is really so soft very very soft and i do like to leave quite a bit of ribbon on the end because the person who's going to be open opening and clothing this may not be a card maker and therefore may not be very comfortable keep doing bows especially with ribbons okay i'm going to leave that there so there we go there's today's project what do you think about super i'm really really pleased with that i hope you are too hope you like it um so let's i'll close that one up and open this one i think there we go in fact i can't get much else in the screen can i um let's just tie this one up see if i can get it into the corner this ribbon by the world way is one of the ribbons for the new ink covers misty moonlight and again this one ties easily but then it is a narrow one which obviously they are normally easier to work with okay so if i can pop that one there and that like that you get the idea many thanks for joining me today if you have any comments to leave please put them in the box below the video to open the box below the
