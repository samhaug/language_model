well it's been a few days that i've been noticing a few of these leaves that are starting to perk straight up and some of them are starting to claw so i was told to add a little bit of sulfur to this so i did go get some micronized sulfur and laid about a handful underneath the plants and scratched it in well just this one and hopefully it helps out now i did lose one durbin poison earlier in the year to this issue there's no mites on this plant this one's just got me baffled but it is starting to look at this starting to canoe or claw oh there is one aphid so i'm going to do some more inspection on these plants i didn't know if this could possibly be a disease a fungus um a deficiency you know i'm just trying to rule some things out um i did scratch down into the dirt as far as i could soil's dry i don't know so anyone's got any suggestions tips hints if this has ever happened to you before let me know see check it you know i was thinking that it could have been a nitrogen toxicity but you know look at it it's it's not green green green green so so if it was a nitrogen toxicity these leaves would be like super green dark green let me know", "UhR58rpzaCc": "[Music] one what's up this is another episode of squared talk this is your host loris and my man ro what's happening I'm here I'm ready to go I'm ready for this special report on a strand a species a genus a phylum if you will that of cannabis that are very few people know about well we're gonna be talking today about the largest producer of cannabis in the world which is the continent of Africa which most people have no idea no when you think about cannabis you don't necessarily think Africa other content no no most people don't and in fact Africa has so many what are called land race strains these are strains that have never been contaminated that have allowed to grow around each other and whatever region they in combined with the soil and the sunlight and the conditions and the time of year they harvested and the other plants they bred with on their own I guess one of the it's it's it's like the last bastion of untapped land race train so you have strains that haven't even been discovered yet because all the strains in America and Europe they were running out of strains I was actually watching something on Canada and they were saying how Canada can't keep up with the demand for cannabis so much so that they have to shut down the the operations for some of the dispensaries and places like that to like four days a week because they can't keep up with demand because soon as they open up there's lines around the bill they can't keep up with demand they don't even with all their massive indoor facilities and you know all the corporate infusion of cash they still cannot keep up with with demand so Africa is the future of wheat they're gonna be there they're gonna be heading their Europe mostly Amsterdam you know they've been going to a couple of countries to get basically import cannabis so you think about that you know that it's it's very interesting but it's logical I mean anything that grows on the equator with direct sunlight year-round would um you know would be a vibrant potent product whether it's you know pineapples and mangoes or cannabis so it makes perfect sense and it makes me wonder how come no one is um try to develop that before now I mean you know why would people want to throw it in there uh you know in an indoor facility with the grow UV lights and stuff rather than put it in real soil in a real environment and make the best product they can make because again once the corporate people got into it you know it's changed it's changed the game because they're now pushing out the little people who lease to grow it at home and you know if you're in Humboldt California they grow it out in their little farms and backyards and you know they have now corporations it's huge facilities lights and people in jumpsuits and scientists and and it's just not the same you know you know that's akin to like trying to grow potatoes in a fact you know in a you know you know in an indoor facility with special lights and guys with a you know you know jumpsuits and stuff like that no one does that for any other crop we don't run out of potatoes running out of cannabis up in Canada why don't you grow it like you grow everything else well with the case of the African strains they can't grow it like they grow everything else because the African strains are the African strains because of thousands of years of natural cultivation you know and the environments that have adapted for the local strains of these cannabis plants and because of that you cannot rip it's next to near impossible to replicate that in a lab even if you dig up to specific soil it's in and take it over then a minute you take it out of that environment you grow on something else yes true there's a lot of a lot of uh you know roots and herbs you know medicinal things like that that need to grow in a specific region for those specific properties but people grow them there you know you know what I mean whether it's uh you know mucuna hunt manuka mucuna honey or you know yeah you know I'm confusing Manuka I'm sorry or maca root you know it you know maca root has to be in the mountains between believes at Peru you can't even make them grow in Idaho but it's a tuber like a potato but you can't take it out of that region so they grow in that region so it's just amazing it's curious why no one ever thought of doing this before you know growing it in the regions where you could really cultivate it you know year-round and really produce a lot of it ya know there's that to logical it makes absolute it's it makes absolute sense and it's not it's not even something to me that even needs to be explained it's it to me it's common sense you know but I think the the problem I'm seeing you know here in this part of the world and what I'm also seeing on the African continent is that certain people a dominating this coming into this industry and they're coming in with corporate money and corporate know-how and is snatching it from the people who've been doing it for so long and who deserves to be reaping the benefits I was at the spark event spark cannabis networking event in Columbia Maryland yesterday and I met a guy from a company called Shimazu and they're here based in Maryland was actually a multinational company a Japanese company but they test cannabis for contaminants and because again with all these corporate hacks coming in and they basically mass producing cannabis there's all kinds of contaminants and unnatural things that are being put in it and these guys basically test for you know everything under the Sun including you know contaminants and as one of them was saying to me last night he was like and I and I you know I broached the subject I say you know it's gonna come with its we're getting to that point now already even at this early stage where we have to ask where is the source where is this cannabis coming from the CBD oil you're selling me or this THC fake cartridge you're selling me where did you get the cannabis from who grew it what they put in it you know it's funny you mention that because I stumbled upon a story the other day of people smoking TAC vape cartridges that they think they're illegal cartridges that are mostly been used in states where it's that THC vaping is illegal but there's some new ingredient that's being used some new oil some thick oil they're using two in a cartridge to suspend the the THC and it's producing an inflammatory respiratory disease and people that's akin to pneumonia and people are getting so barely sick and being in the hospital for days with what looks like pneumonia if their lungs are full of fluid to the point where they they're having to hook them up to oxygen because they they just can't breathe on their own the respiratory system is not working on its own so you know it's um you know at that that service that you just scrub is very important especially with stuff like that happen to people you know you think you know it's almost harmless when you're vaping you know don't even sound like it sound like some nice Star Trek let me sound like a cigarette right just this little device you just puff on it exhale all this smoke and it seems harmless but um you know you got to watch out because there's a lot of people right now they're in a bad way with you know ammonia we'll take you out they've also even seen new conditions new diseases one of them is called popcorn popcorn lung where the lung has these basically would look like pimples growing on them and again this is attributed to people who vape they've started to see you know the effects of and we still in the early stages of vaping it's not like cigarettes where you can say okay we've had a long time to see the adverse effects of tobacco but already we're seeing this popcorn lung problem you know showing up yes now is it because we are our technology allows us to detect this stuff quicker than it did when cigarettes were an issue or is it because it's the chemicals are that bad that they're they're they're ravaging people's bodies faster you know I'm saying like in a you know 40s 30s 40s and 50s you know people kind of thought it was bad for you but they had no proof and it wasn't until around you know this late 70s and 80s that they could definitively say yeah this [ __ ] is killing you so I wonder if now with vaping I mean it kind of just started and we're already having problems is it they you know cat scans and MRIs and stuff that can pick up this stuff and you know those little cameras they can put inside of your body that pick it up or is it [ __ ] that bad that is happening way faster than there was cigarettes I think it's definitely too technology we have much better technology in terms of detection now than in the past but I also think that there's also I think even more so sinister chemicals because we know we now know what's in tobacco and but with this with this with this new plant was not new but this this new industry I should say we're like I said the corporate heads are getting into it and everything is becoming scientific almost like the food we have flavor crystals and enhanced tastes you know with with with with whether it's your bag of Cheetos or your McDonald's burger you know where you can it taste the same and it gives you the same euphoric effect like when you eat it you know that's all done in a lab it's all scientific and you're seeing the same thing now happening with with cannabis so I think it's a bit of both definitely yeah yeah yeah I just would hate for you know something happening on a legal side of things to to you know paint what's going on on the legal side of the house but I guess is inevitable yeah yeah but I think that if we nip it in the bud now or at least try to address it now or recognize that okay this is what's coming we can find ways to to circumvent this there I was reading about a guy who the guy who invented the gelato strain of marijuana and California and you know he is a well-known name at like MJ Pez con and you know in the cannabis world for making that that strain like even rappers and artists have made songs about gelato like that's how big this thing is and he was saying how he even can't compete with with this but what he's looking to do is do the supreme branding model where I don't know if any people listening familiar with supreme supreme makes one-of-a-kind products or they'll make like ten they'll make a helmet there was like a bike helmet or supreme logo on it but they'll make like 20 so but then each helmet costs like $1,200 but because there's only 20 of them you can now take that helmet and resell it on eBay or somewhere else for like five times the price you can buy a sweater that's like $400 when it comes out because again it's limited and you can sell it for $1,200 and people will line up to buy it and they only have a couple of stores around the world mostly in Western countries but he was basically wanting to do that with his strains of weed where he comes out with products and maybe even strains where there's only a certain limited amount so that of course increases the value so that's his plan to combat the corporate hijacking that you know that's going on which is kind of interesting what do you think well you know it it returns it back to the culture you know it I think it just keeps coming back to the culture of this thing and there's a definite cultural expression associated with cannabis and THC and now we're seeing it grow and legitimize itself with CBD which is a whole nother you know demographic of people but you know if you try to separate this thing from its culture it I don't see it working and so you can follow Supremes model and do that with with cannabis because it represents a cultural expression I think that's where people should focus and I think that'll keep the of the corporations at bay because they can't duplicate culture you know I mean I don't know if anybody I kind of follow I don't follow but I check out various people blog sites and websites and in certain YouTube channels one of the biggest things going on right now this is gonna sound like a complete non sequitur but I won't bring it back home in a second one of the biggest things going on right now is the fans of Star Wars or Star Wars movie they are completely at open or with Disney for what they did with the last Star Wars movie and how they treated Luke Skywalker and what and what is being leaked about the next one is coming out right and it just shows that there was this culture that was established way back in 1977 with the first movie and and it's become part of people's lives I mean you know they they show it on they used to show it on Christmas for Disney bought the rights to it people have shown their children it's this whole thing it's this whole cultural Express ounce silly but it is a real cultural thing with this Star Wars and it's international and if corporation bought it and is you know for all intents and purposes destroyed it to the place where the fans or the people that represent that closer are rejecting it and in open conflict with this corporation and so I think the model that you're describing with this some gelato stream then he's establishing this cultural expression with it I think that's what I think that's what you have to do with this because it is such a um what's the word I don't know it is just a cultural personal expression with this that it is it's how it's going to be very difficult to corporatize it long long term in my opinion they let me they may make some progress but I just see it self-destructing like what's happening with Star Wars what's going on with Star Trek now now it's starting with that the Marvel movies you know I'm saying now it's starting I remember when uh back in a J day when I was a big whiskey drinker Jack Daniels lowered their alcohol content and it affected Jack Daniels sales but it affected the culture of people who participated Jack Daniels and that's when bourbon took off because bourbon was just some old Kentucky back would think that nobody was into but when you know the major player Jack Daniels started to disrespect the supporters in the culture of Jack Daniels which was very much a culture you know that's when bourbon got started because the day we're like no we're not you're disrespecting what we're about we'll go take us to somewhere else III don't think that I don't think a cultural expression around things can be overlooked and when the bean counters get older something just are crunching numbers I don't that that's you can't factor that and that's an that's saying intangible that can be measured with the human experience but they can't with it with a you know Excel spreadsheet hmm well like I've always said cannabis is not corporate it is a culture and in branding when you want a brand something your first goal is to create a culture around your product or service and that culture is how you create a brand and you want oil tea you want that rabid loyalty like what Apple has like what supreme has where it announced a new iPhone tomorrow and people are lined up around the building to get it supreme comes out with a new sweater shirt or pen or you know whatever the hell they thinking about coming out with and they just slap supreme on it and people are lining up to get it that has say you know do with creating a culture that has to do with brand loyalty and each one of those things are interconnected you can't have one and it's a sequences if you tried to do the sequin if you try to do it out of sequence and your sequencing is off it's not gonna work yeah and it is exactly what it looks like the supreme does it looks like he just put a label I didn't think it was a real company I thought it was just guys saw it first on Instagram and somebody had a shirt two white shirts and one was on the left and it said this shirt cost 1250 and I had no name no label no brand oh just a generic white shirt this shirt on the other side another white shirt with the word supreme written on it in red cost 200 so I just thought okay somebody's just put in the name supreme just like they're looking for a name to just give it just give it a brand name give it something you know just stick it I had no idea it was a real actual company that was selling limited edition products so basically they come out with something and it'll only make a small amount and so so they're basically there's not enough to meet demand and that scarcity creates an intense interest and people you know start trampling each other to get it and that also the resale value goes up because there's only a small amount of their mate you know does go psychology of sales and and branding and how you know with with human beings it's you really it's all about getting in their head I mean I don't care what you're selling cuz to me there's nothing special about supreme I mean I'm concerned the first time I saw it it was a skateboard company right didn't it grow from being a skateboard company and they were making his teach t-shirts and stuff for you know they were making skateboard decks or a wheels or something and they were making t-shirts to go with that right and then how they got started and then they kind of became like they were legitimizing the skateboard culture by taking it into this completely different direction and and and making products outside of that in the head I started I'm not sure like I said when I first saw it I saw it on Instagram or one of those pages you follow for business and they'll show you like you know business ideas or business tips like each pulse is a business idea or a tip and they had one on branding versus brand versus generic and like I said on one side it said blank t-shirt twelve dollars on the other side I said supreme t-shirt $200 and I just thought it cuz cuz even the design of the logo the look it just looks so basic does just amazed me is nothing special no so I thought okay somebody just created this to just make an illustration as to say okay yes one has a brand one doesn't come to find out as a real company so I don't I don't know what the the the genesis of supreme you know was I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm pretty sure it was a skateboard company making skateboard decks and wheels and the name has started making shirts and bumper stickers I think on a West Coast I'm pretty sure he came out the West Coast and then they kept it just was the way they just kept developing products and pushing it and making it like exclusive even within that skateboard realm it started off as its exclusive thing that was hard to get but you had to have because that was a cool thing and they just pushed that and so once again is that it's that culture that it came out of that supports it and it blew up to where it is now because of the legitimacy of the people who participate in that culture and if it and when it loses favor in a world of you know high fashion and exclusive items to own it'll go right back to be a skateboard brand and they'll still support it because I'm not sure if it was a skateboard brand but I def because I this now with the people that line up to get it everybody from all other cultures whatever something comes out they all trying to buy supreme so I could the people I saw were lined up in London they didn't look like they skateboard at all no but it's grown it grew out yeah cuz I'm looking at up now with skateboard company but it just they pushed their products outs away from that and marketed it as like what it is now you know and then their foundation was those skaters that you know had to have it is it I'm just trying to make a parallel into what the guys doing with a gelato it these cultures of what makes you know with the difference between uh really the Marvel superhero movies and a DC one is that the Marvel cultivated a culture in an experience and a loyalty and integrity and a promise that they were going to lay this whole thing out in the way they've never been seen before and people know that I think one one looks comic books were colorful and fun and you know it sucks you into another world and you know you made it it stimulates your imagination Marvel translated that from comic it's it's basically a live comic book DC this stuff is just dark it when you look at no but with the movies what one is what is bright and one is bright and where Marvel and and and fun and interesting and better character design but a casting and then you just have the other one on the other hand which is DC and it's just dark and it's just it's just not as interesting and it's just a complete letdown in my opinion I'm not a fan of the DC universe if you even want to call it that because they're subtle they're sorely lacking when it comes to they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to comparing them to Marvel asked for what the last ten years or ten plus years they've been coming out with these you know with these movies it reminds me of uh when Star Wars go back to Star Wars when that came out you know I mean I saw that in the theater when it came out and then everything was trying to jump on that bandwagon because it was such a hit but it didn't have any integrity in it it wasn't really taking a chance it wasn't really investing anything you know Star Wars on the surface is his goofy movie but it is a real story they're the first one and it's a story that's universal that you can really buy into but everyone so yet star chase and yet all these goofy Oh everything was just trying to get make a dollar off of it and when I look at the chance Marvel took with you know the first Iron Man film and and even the way it ended with Samuel Jackson and Nick Fury and it just said we're gonna lay this whole world out for you over years and that's our promise to you we're gonna lay this out and treat it with respect and we're gonna honor it we might have to make some changes we're gonna really respect this and show you something that you've always wanted to see to me when DC jumped on they were like look we're just gonna cash in we're just gonna throw superheroes out there to you know cartoon show that has I think four or five seasons it was on in the early 2000s that entire show those did the real cartoon heads or real comic blue heads know what I'm talking about that entire show is better than every single movie they've put out in the last ten years I'm so serious and it was a cartoon but it was just very well done and it was it wasn't dark it had great humor it had great voice actors the stories were farming it was it was that was that is at par with the MCU that's how good it was yeah and then you look at what they've done with the movies it's just it's just abysmal you know the DC stuff that DC superheroes were always more lighthearted and more you know All American characters Marvel guys always had like real problems and real issues and stuff they were almost not even really like superheroes they were like normal people that could just do some special stuff that's that's what this cartoon was like though yeah that's a like a Superman is me he is nothing he can't do so you gotta like you know put people he cares about in danger but you know one of the hallmarks of the whole DC thing was that you know it was almost wholesome all-american apple-pie you know wave the flag storytelling and characters you know protagonist but when this corporation wanted to go make a dime and jump on a bandwagon or what Marvel had done they didn't even take that a consideration they just we're gonna copy what Marvel is doing but ours is gonna be dark and grittier cuz that sells right dark and gritty earth and they just completely [ __ ] the bed and did a fan base that was already there ready to give them money turned away and now they're just disillusioned because the thing they love the most of this has been defiled and destroyed so you know the exact I mean that's I'm trying to draw a parallel between you know Star Wars and Disney buying Star Wars I'm bringing it back Warner Brothers trying to do what Marvel was doing you've already got a can and CBD in cannabis you've already got a built-in audience and a culture all you do is respectfully participate yeah but there's something about their corporate mindset it can't be respectful if you can't dominate you don't want to do it you know that cuz even the latest spider-man movie the one that came out this year they've already messed that up because Fox I think is fighting Disney and apparently they've put a hold as a moratorium on the movie in the movie has now been put on hold indefinitely and the movie you know left ended on a cliffhanger because again it's the MCU and Tom Holland who is the guy who plays spider-man has no idea what they has a job or not because they frozen the whole thing they don't know yeah and even they even talking about going back to the Tobey Maguire days you know of spider-man like you know so again I know all that is in corporate you know corporate BS that that you know that goes on when you know people come in who are not really about the culture and about the art they just in it for the money you know and unfortunately that's what I see happening with cannabis yeah it's inevitable but I mean at the same time there's myriad examples we just talked about how these corporations just they don't get it they [ __ ] the bed you know like there was a talk of remaking one of my favorite films in the world Big Trouble in Little China they want to remake it with the rock you know say like can you just the movie is aged well I mean you watch that it mean it you know - him using a pay phone that could be today there's no need I mean these guys aren't think of it thinking of anything original they're not establishing a new culture they just want to go back and rape everything that ever came out that people loved it was something else they wanted to remake and it was just like no whywhy are you doing this you know so I mean I think you know it's inevitable that they do this with cannabis and CBD but I think it's inevitable they'll [ __ ] the bed and and the people will be able to reclaim it and move forward you know it they they're there their thought process and their vision is so limited you know and I think accountants are completely taken over every aspect of entertainment that they just can't see the human touch and a human quality that makes this stuff work and makes it magic you know there's a reason why magnum p.i was a big deal and Simon and Simon wasn't not to [ __ ] on Simon and Simon was okay but it was no magnum p.i because you know they caught lightning in a bottle you know and it was it it is still of this magnum p.i suit you know a fan favorite to this day Magnum it's automatic killer intro though the music yeah yeah you know look at magnum p.i look at Miami Vice you know you got some guys and I am addressing real cool who would care but they created this culture people still said and I always say Miami did not look like that when that's okay Miami was not like that in 1984 no but by 1989 Miami was like that show that's so made Miami Miami was not debated or the world and citizen Miami and Miami grew to reflect that artificial world to this day to this very day Miami is still just be Miami Vice the TV show yeah so you know the cotinine they try to make a movie we cut Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx and it was the drizzle but but my point is because they completely betrayed the culture of what it was the movie was nothing comparable to the show other than there was some two cops in Miami you know so I don't think the culture of things can be discounted because they're proving that when you ignore the culture end up in the people who love that you're just you're just gonna make a mess yeah there's any solace and this is that once they get done you know screwin it up yeah but you can have it back yeah that point is too late who wants it back at that point I mean that's just that's just that's just a disaster at that point and they trying to you know can't shine [ __ ] and that's basically what you're doing at that point it's not gonna work let's go ahead and plug in our sponsor since we're already have more than halfway through the show yes yes folks time for a quick story time brought to you by our friends new maroon Naturals you can find them at WWE

business of cannabis so let's talk let's talk about something more fun I think we kind of went into the doom and gloom a little bit so where to god I always do that that's my father when I apologize I do that I do it but you need to know so let's go back to cannabis in Africa the future of weed where you have strains like Durban poison which is from South Africa Swasey cold which is from Swaziland Malawi Gold which is from Malawi Congo red and Congo black which is from the DRC or the Democratic Republic of Congo strains that are very very difficult to get in this part of the world I think Swasey gold you can buy that I think they have been exporting that to Europe and I think you can even have even seen anything for sale here but Africa is the largest like I said in the beginning to show the largest producer of cannabis in the world and get this only four countries are participating in the cannabis trade South Africa Zimbabwe Lesotho and Malawi these are the only countries that are participating in and and South Africa is the only unique one because they passed an act called the Dada Act which allows for possession of marijuana for personal use so basically the police find it on you they won't arrest you you won't go to jail and that has now sprung up cannabis expose the only cannabis expo on the continent of Africa is in South Africa where you will find cannabis companies local like there's a guy who brews a cannabis beer called Durbin poison that's again from the Durbin poison strain from South Africa it's a larga and he brews that in in South Africa apparently just to talk about some history they're also very big on hemp because when the Dutch came to South Africa and settled down there they used to make a lot of their clothing and a ropes and a lot of those materials from hemp so it's actually for them it's a return to something they used to do before was outlawed and so you're seeing ropes and and and and clothing and and I didn't even know that you could make cement from hemp by taking the stem and adding lime juice to it and when it basically those two mix it can form a cement that can hold bricks together I mean so hemp is an incredible product and I think hemp is probably the most revolution is more revolutionary than marijuana because there's so much you can do with a plastics clothing ropes cements which I just learned about and again all this stuff is biodegradable so I there was on the news last week China shipping back all the plastic and all the plastic bottles back to America and Europe and they're like yep we're not gonna be the world's trashcan anymore and Europe and America don't know what to do with these plastics now you've seen turtles and whales and all these sea creatures with straws and plastic stuck in their noses and in their bodies and the some of the fish ate and plastic like the salmon is eating plastic so your salmon dish it your favorite restaurant is full of micro plastics because again plastic does not degrade but yes one product that makes plastic that is biodegradable that's not made from petroleum and that product is hamper so this is this is really amazing and you can see why they've suppressed this amazing plant you know for so long because the petrol dollars are definitely at risk because a lot of the plastics and you know things that we use that seep into our food and you know contaminate the sea and all that is made from petroleum fossil fuels and it's it's it's not good for the environment doesn't break down well yet we've had this plant that you could make plastics from all this time and the powers-that-be have suppressed it well you think about on that wrong no you know it's it's um it's it's funny because I always reference the title of the film back to the future my area subjects when I talk about stuff and you know I never knew what that title meant back to the future sounds oxymoronic like then he makes sense but now being much older and putting the world into a greater context when I realized what that movie was saying was in order for Marty McFly to have a future he had to go back in time and correct some things and bring and get a better perspective on what the past was about and again and embrace some tenants and virtues of the past and bring them forward to have a future and we're really at a stage in our society where we're gonna have to go back to the future reading go backward and embrace some of the things we were doing 100 200 years ago and bring them forward with a 21st century mindset in context you know hemp but as you said that was used for you know everything the riggings on ships sails you know in fact that flower was in I mean it was used for everything and there's no reason it can't be used now there's no reason it can't be used in industry now there's no reason that my laundry detergent can't be in a hemp hemp bottle so to speak there's no reason why and then you know the thread and my shirt can't be hemp again there's no reason that we can't go back and reimburse on that was so since I died anok product with so many industrial uses and have a great quality of life without destroying a goddamn planet and I'm not one of these you know leading heart go green types no disrespect to y'all that's just not what I do but you know it's there's no reason with the current level of technology that the free flow of information exactly that we can't go back and get some of this stuff that used to work better then in a [ __ ] now and make a life in which we don't have to worry about what's in our drinking water you know because I don't know about the rest of y'all but every day I wake up this [ __ ] is like a bad science fiction film you know and I'm tired of it yes I'm tired of hearing the next problem that sounds like it's right out of Robocop you know there's no there's no reason for any this week we can have a very clean lifestyle in which we don't have to get poisoned by the very air we breathe and the water we drink in the rain for Christ's sakes yeah yeah yeah we we have everything we need to solve most of the world's problems and one plant that can definitely aid in a significant amount of the reduction of that is is hemp and again hemp is the sibling of marijuana whose parent is cannabis because they're people who still think who don't know the difference between the two of them and think they're one in the same but they're not but the hemp is an amazing an amazing plant but these are these African strains is one that's super rare called Malawi Gold I mean where if you were able to even get your hands on it you could charge thousands of dollars for seeds because it's it's it's one of those landrace strains it's super rare and it's also it's at Eva most of the African strains of sativa strains which is interesting and most of the people benefiting from the African strains aren't really in America Europe is benefiting because that's where a lot of the export is going I see South Korea just opened up or allowed a dispensary that because they do I don't think they grow it over there so they're importing it so the import export market will if exporting if you're in one of those countries but importing if you're if you're in the West or you know Asia or whatever those markets are you gonna be huge for the African markets because the African markets have strains that the world has never seen before and so far a lot of the farmers that produce this stuff it's subsistence farming so they're not really even making anything off it I mean they and they have buckets and bales and you know this stuff and and there's still also the stigma that because a lot of these cultures a lot of these countries because only like I said Malawi Lesotho Swaziland Zimbabwe South Africa there's still very much the stigma of to use your phrase ro wacky tabacky and you know if I smell this thing there was one farmer I saw on Vice this was and I think Swaziland and she can't stand the smell of it but she grows it because that's how she feeds their family and she had tons of this stuff and the other ones do grow it but they don't have the context to you know to export it to the South Africa with these Expos and all this stuff they have now there's a lot of mostly the white South Africans who come up to Swaziland and the zoo too and you know all these are the places and coming by you know the the the different strains of marijuana cuz they're setting up businesses so again you kind of see the parallels between that and you know what's going on here in this part of the world where a lot of the African American community most of the cannabis entrepreneurs are in jail you know and then now all of a sudden somebody I I was talking to last night at the spark Expo was saying that and he was he was a Caucasian fellow and he was saying he recognizes that you know the unfairness of that and the fact that that is a problem and the fact that you have people like him and many others who are now in it legally you have all these people who were you know put in jail some of them are still there for possession for sales you know but the African market - you're seeing the government's basically allow the the farmers to farm it for export but there's no local trade going on so they're not making what they could be and should be making in Assam crazy ship you know what people are gonna have to you know you know I understand the Golden Rule do unto others and as you would have them do unto you fool me once shame on you fool me twice I ain't getting fooled on more times but um yeah I don't know if you well I'm sure you do but I don't know if the listeners remember some maybe too young in the 1980s when Japan transformed himself from being making cheap transistor radios and cheap automobiles to being such a corporate powerhouse that the term in corporate takeover became synonymous with a preemptive strike militarily like the Japanese became so good at business that it was a kin to war and America was afraid of Japan as business I remember and the Japanese had their guys reading sunsoo their executives reading Sun Tzu every morning before they went to work they would practice kendo and swordsmanship and in American executives started getting into this war footing to do war oh but just on a battlefield of business and um I think one thing all of us are going to have to understand is that anything worth having is worth taking and anything that you can make money with is worth taking and if you don't position yourself to one protect what it is you're doing and to going to attack against your competition oh you know you ain't gonna have it for long cuz we've tried it the other way we've tried to be so goddamn friendly in business we've tried to just make eke out a living with stuff I'm telling you the way this world is going if you can't protect what you have and go on the attack and try to crush your competitor or just put them into a position don't get started don't do it yeah you know if you're not playing to win if you're not playing to dominate don't even play the game it sounds harsh it sounds so harsh and cruel and out of this [ __ ] combative it's the way of the world that's why every nation has an army or defense force as weighing a whole country of people out here just chilling they got a couple guys in the back with some guns it's unfortunate but there's always gonna be somebody coming to take what you have or slick you out of it and if you have a great idea listen it's Dirty Harry all over again man's got to know his limitations if you have a great idea great make your product well find somebody that can protect your stuff and go on the attack when they need to because they will need to you know and you hear you talk about you know what's going on with these farmers in Malawi and and and Swaziland and they they're not yeah they're not protected and I don't even think they know they need to be perhaps they don't know they need to be practicing they did I think they do because some of them can see but some of them also recognize that they're facing stigma because there's still stigma from the colonial times where they were like oh because again when they realized they had to suppress marijuana those stick that we didn't we didn't invent those stigmas no those stigmas were invented and opposed and not just there and on the continent here in America there was a time when marijuana and hemp wasn't illegal and there were certain people who saw it as a threat to their industries mostly the fossil fuel industries and they say oh no we got a we have to suppress this and one of the best ways to do that is to culturally suppress it well it's like oh you know you smoking that wacky tabacky and you know all the other terms you pothead you're this year that and this is a gateway drug and all this other crap you know so it's a it's the same game being played on another continent but you know that takes that you know along the lines of you know protecting what you have and being able to go on the attack another another tenant is you've got to control the narrative if you're if you grow cannabis and and and and some entity out there saying well you know that's a gateway drug and it's in it potheads and yada yada yada then focus on something else it does right you know you can clean your toilet with coca-cola yeah pine pine oil you can also clean your battery yeah car yeah with the battery terminals with coca-cola so if tomorrow the the Journal of American medicine said look the sodas you know soda is killing every goddamn body you know soda company to come out say yeah but did you know you clean your toilet with it but control the narrative of your product and work around what the impediment is narrative lies I guess what I'm trying to say through these examples is listen if you will come out hearing in getting business in and sell something you've got to get dynamic with your thought process you got to protect what you have in on the case you're gonna have to go any attack and you're gonna have to control the narrative this is a this is a dynamic game you can't just sit back and do anything because either you're gonna be barely making a living what if someone's gonna take your stuff you know pretty much pretty much and so for everybody out there who wants to come out with a cannabis product cannabis a CBD oil prod to create a narrative they're so far out of the box but but but productive and can illustrate people why they need this product you'll defeat the stigma attached to it you can think of every product you love that's what they did cuz you only need half the [ __ ] you buy but they gave you a narrative that induced you to to need it but that's the power of branding and that's the power of psychology and that's the power of creating a culture and which leads to creating loyal customers around a brand so that's the secret right there it's all branding branding is strategy and it's it's psychology you know next time we're going to get into because we're about to wrap things up here we're gonna get into sales funnels and growth hacking and and and a new way to grow inbound marketing lead my magnets the new way to grow businesses and social-media followings cuz you know you're dealing with all these algorithms that you know before it used to be you could you could use an algorithm for a year or two now an algorithm to barely last six months and then they've changed it and that's mostly because of the marketers because they've you know well the market ears as they call them in Europe who you know they they basically effed everything up and that's why Facebook and all these companies keep changing their you know there's but that's is for next episode that will be our topics anything else you want to plug row before we before we get out of here how much time I have yeah you got a couple minutes late okay watch this right quick well I just want to say this I've been walking this earth for pretty good stretch of time and well I've seen a lot you know and I'll reflect on life and try to boil it down to what's really going on and I keep coming up with the same answer try as I might to deny it I keep calling the same answer this [ __ ] is war now when I say war I don't mean tanks and helicopters and punchy sticks and ak-47 I mean one person or a group of people trying to dominate another one through through intent in action right so if if me and Laura sir hanging out and Laura says okay let's go to a strip club I said what I really don't do that bro no come on man and he gets me to go that was warfare and he just won right he didn't have to you have a tank he used his subterfuge and he browbeat me and used peer pressure and all the rest of it and psychologically got me to do something I had no intention of doing and probably got me to buy a couple of drinks in a mix as well so all I'm saying is that every aspect of human behavior and interpersonal dynamics it comes down to a conflict a war might not be open war may not be bullets flying but someone is trying to take what you got or get you to do something you have no intention of doing the best friendships are built upon mutual respect and wish that that subject has already been broached and now we're not even gonna try to do that with each other we're gonna go do that to somebody else so I'm trying to say this that if you have something worth taking it will be taken if you can't defend it please view all your business endeavors as warfare please view all your relationships protecting the people you care about as warfare there's too many people out here trying to exploit victimized you get in the game because that's gonna make this world a better place when righteous people take just an aggressive stance as the unrighteous people I am done all right right on time all right people we out", "Aw1rmZBXCWs": "hey what's good everybody jp here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a taste test cannabis pre-roll review we uh we recently visited the grocery dispensary g-r-o-w-c-e-r-y uh here in los angeles and i picked up a couple pre-rolls so i went in there i said give me the freshest drop give me some of the best of the best the budtender i forget her name but she recommended two of their most freshest and popular house strains we've got the durbin poison right here and then we've got the tri-fi cookies from right here as well so the grocery coming in with their own house brand indica pre-roll for the tri-fi 17.93 um produced on 1229 so that's pretty pretty recent and then the durbin poison um what are we looking at here 25.67 thc produced on december 7th and so these are really fresh today i'm only going to be reviewing one of them we will have a second episode where i feature the second uh pre-roll um for now we are going to start off with the durbin poison this is one of my favorite strings this is the strain of the year in high times back in 2016. i've sold a lot of durban poison i've tried a lot of durban poison i absolutely love it and so i'm confident that i'll be able to identify if it's not only like an accurate strain profile but you know i can kind of give some perspective as to the quality too uh cannabinoids at twenty eight point four nine percent it says sativa um packaged by high pack www.highdashpack.com there is a little qr code for you to take a picture of to see the test results and some other information but for now we're going to dive right in the way that we do the taste test reviews is going to be slightly different from the west coast we tour you guys might have heard me say one hit review two hits you know three hits occasionally this is an entire product review we will be filming the entire review in terms of the whole pre-roll smoke um it might take a little bit longer but you guys are more than welcome to fast forward to the end of the video or just check out the comments in the description there all right so we are getting some sweet piney flavor in terms of the scent this is what the pre-roll looks like i personally really enjoy durban poison i've smoked again a lot of this it's not packed too tightly the dry hint is citrusy sweet sour with a nice trapinoline or pinene profile i'm going to give it a like shout out to have a sweet high distribution for the lighter all right you guys so in terms of this pre-roll dry hit tasted delicious the first hit tasted good i don't necessarily know what kind of paper it is i'm getting that raw paper vice but it's not it's not listed it's not harsh it was smooth first two hits first eight and a half there's very very nice light sweet flavor i personally don't think that this is going to be very much of a harsh smoke it's significantly more potent than the other pre-roll it was roughly 11 more cannabinoids it's delicious it's energetic it's kind of clarifying in terms of the high it's clear-headed i don't feel the racy heart attack anxiety happening german poison has been known to give people anxiety it's just it's one of those sativas that actually works as a land race train land race means it's one of the original strains from the geographical location as to where it originated from i believe durbin comes from a region in africa which gives it a very racy sativa desert type of cannabis qualities um reaching for the sun sweet light kind of citrusy not an indica not in the mountains not dark not bushy this is going to be a light light green it's delicious i absolutely love it absolutely love it see if we can't smoke do a little bit i want to know what it's like down here it's easy for the weed to taste good up at the top but after the smoke a little bit the profile does change some of the resin might burn down the paper could could cause a change i see a little bit of the resin here kind of going down the paper so it's terpe it's definitely terpe we have a 10-point review system in terms of the categories you can get uh individual points in each of the categories uh we got a hundred point review system in terms of like the west coast we tour and things like that and so the way that we're gonna do it for the taste test um i'll give you guys a hundred point taste test review you guys have to read the full article the full the full description to get that information um and the reason is is because when you guys go hang out on our website there's tons of other content and so we can only deliver so much via instagram linkedin you know social media so got to get you guys all that information on the website it's delicious it's not burning here's a little color in terms of the ash is it white no is there some white yes but for the most part it is slightly darker um it may or may not create a harsher smoke people definitely say that the darker the ash the harsher the smoke but i've had super turpy super flavorful cannabis before flour pre-roll you name it and sometimes it just gets really resinous the terp glands just really like leak or drip or kind of diffuse through the flower through the joint and sometimes it's harsh sometimes the turpiere the flower the harsher it can be obviously you want to get a good dry good cure to remove the harshness to remove some of the chlorophyll and things that are going to still be remaining in there in terms of various plant chemicals and things but this is a quality experience and as a nine dollar pre-roll i paid 18 i think 1850 1860 for the two again full grams when i start to think about a score out of 10 i mean obviously the joint isn't all the way through i'll probably cut it this video short a little bit down to when it gets right around there past this bulk middle area well we got presentation we've got a peel we've got color taste smell potency uh more information you know i really like having the qr code there i'm gonna check that out after the episode trying to think um would i recommend it i i really would for a nine dollar house pre-roll this is very potent i can understand why this is one of the more popular products at the grocery you guys can see how to spell grocery right there as i mentioned earlier g-r-o-w-c-e-r-y uh they're they're located over in kind of like um west l.a um this is probably the best way to describe it i don't exactly know the area too well being that i'm you know new uh to california are still relatively new but i really enjoy really enjoy the inside of the store it's a beautiful location uh the staff the security very friendly the uh the outside has is it's not too dirty or messy it's not too like you know it doesn't have a trap vibe at all um yeah i think i think score out of 10 and score out of a hundred i'm sitting at a 90 i'm i'm sitting at a 94 and the reason is is i want to know what kind of paper this is i think that contributes to the experience it's not a branded paper over here in terms of the filter the tip so i want to know a little bit more information in terms of that but taste test i mean this is what i want on german poison this is what i want it's affordable it's sweet it's sour it's piney and so if you want a very clear-headed energizing euphoric sativa durbin poison from grocery is gonna be for you less than ten dollars super deal make sure you guys check them out score out of a hundred ninety three maybe a ninety four um final score 9.3 9.4 that's where i'm at i love you guys for so much

provided the genetics for biscotti and gushers alright not only that I hand selected smoke through many bags to find those to fee knows the group gave me the fee knows I went through them all I found him and when I found him I named him and biscotti and I named gushers not only did I select them and name them I went on a worldwide campaign with the [ __ ] and popped it off I rapped about it in my songs I brought it to the artists to athletes to the elite smokers and you know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select to name to blow this [ __ ] up globally everybody knows about biscotti because of me and I'm not no longer participating in that and I can't grow myself and I have it and I can't use the names for anything then why would I [ __ ] with it why would I smoke it and it's nothing personal to the group hey man do you guys do your thing it's just what I mow and people have to respect it because I'm not putting in work to that I don't benefit off I've been I've been grinding for too long in a Wii game is the Wii game and business is business and like I said no disrespect to them boys do your thing mate flex on them as much as you can but I ain't [ __ ] with it now with that being said Gary Payton serial mo yeah chopped liver the floor London cello cheetah piss a whole nother right about to hit the market a whole new flavor profile everything from mints which is you know by sea junkie shot to see junkie from the runts crew yeah from grandiflora some powers up from cookies big menus coming new flavor profiles coming all work is all worked a new work that's the new work so the same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "gTO-bVzkZlo": "so I'm doing this video because there's just not that many places where you can get a pretty summed up decent knowledge about th TV and the strain Durbin poison as well so I recently got some drivin poison and it's a really interesting smell it's much stronger it has been reported to have 1% THC v which is basically like an additional cannabinoid considering how small amounts are found in other strains so it's 1% which isn't really that high but it does change the effects massively it's been called the espresso of weed it's 100% sativa straight from the place of Durban in Africa and just as a sort of experiment really to see if there are any differences you could notice and I think suddenly the race car cannabinoid which is the nickname given to it is quite appropriate it does set in much quicker yeah it's a it's it's a different kind of look as well but it's interesting because th TV it works with THC in a different way so it changes the way the THC binds to the receptor for one I think it prevents it from rebinding continuously so it just binds once does its duties and then disassociate and then it's not allowed to keep keep on stimulating so that changes the way that THC works with THC V itself is a neutral antagonist for the cb1 receptor and that's that's something that pharmacies have not been able to replicate when they try to do what THC V does very well which is prevent the reward from food it seems to do and when pharmacies did that they made Rehman band and that accidentally caused suicidal beliefs and ideologies so they had to very quickly pull it from the market after finding out that it seemed to suppress a lot of the rewards from values in general which made life quite depressing clearly so this is a new potential therapeutic for obesity or and diabetes as well might be good for pain perhaps it's it's of ensuring to a shift to the default mode network which is the resting state when you're not doing any tasks of your EEG activity so it shifts that base activity towards more executive regions like the prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate gyrus as well I think and a few other odd places but mostly the prefrontal areas and that could explain why lots of people when they try Durbin poison they have this feeling to clean their room or tidy their desk Hoover their stairs that kind of thing we did to me tells me that a lot of stoners or people who smoke don't have tidy rooms or perhaps they just really liked hiding in their room especially so I'd like to know what someone might do if they had to tidy room this note don't point we shall find out I I don't have a tidy room unfortunately so maybe I will do it a few days it depends oh good this time so yeah it's it's really interesting hi that's for sure it's quite expensive difficult to get hold off for now but it has been around a long time and it has been given this title but now we can finally see what the cannabinoid profiles are yeah there is there something else about th TV it may could work with terpenes I suppose it has many medicinal properties I so sure but yeah be the neutral antagonist idea is really interesting because there are just not that many of them around I haven't seen it before a new tonight agonist has 0% efficacy at the receptor exactly right what does I mean so yeah I'll find out the details of that at some point but yeah just as an experiment it's a really good string so yeah hopefully this could be a treatment for motivational disorders like depression and things so it could be really nice to see to strain to encourage that sort of high childlike mind state that some people get when perhaps the first smoke and see more of that you know going out and creating something making a ramp but completely  it up that's the kind of thing I'd like to see more instead of the sort of couch lot kind of style to it

the jar this i don't really talk about the smells too much out of the jar but this one was a beautiful beautiful smell out of the jar i mean open the jar and i smelled it i'm like oh my goodness i can't wait to try this and what is it this is something called durbin poison and it's from a cultivator called up north and we've reviewed one other up north strain and someone made a comment that up north durban poison was good now over all these years of trying flour durbin poison was never good for me i tried it a bunch of times and i never found one that i thought was magic ever and so those are not flowers i would usually buy but because it's been so many years since i tried it and because they have better cultivation better everything right now uh and it was a tip flower i decided to give it a shot so today is going to be durban poisons day and i'm telling you this thing is just so beautiful unbelievable so let me load my one more scooper into vapor cup straw i got two in there and i just put one more in there and we're gonna tamper i just love this thing there's no amount of don't love i can't wait to get done with my daily responsibility so i can enjoy that incredible i'm going to stick it down in my vapor cup and just that amount of flour can last you 10 minutes crazy so anyway we're going to get back to talking about durbin poison so it comes in a box with all the information and this flower has 27 thc and it was packaged on 1 20 21 and i need to get my uh magnifying glass these texts are getting smaller and smaller something's going on anyway and it also comes in a nice glass jar and so we appreciate that and so we're going to check it out today so i've got this cup set to 325 let me just pump it up to 3 30 i really like 3 30. and so when i do these reviews i reviewed the flower the day before and today i'm just doing a short video about it i don't want to get super stoned because i can't give you the information better but today it's durbin poison's day so it's ready so let's check it out durbin poison at a vapor cup at 300 330 degrees let's do that again so i really like jack herrera and jackyar has a very specific jackareer taste and this flower is like a jack herrera plus i'm not going to explain it more than that you know what jack herrera tastes like this is like a jacquard with a little bit of a pungent finish and it is very smooth and wonderful actually this flower was an absolutely fantastic vape this flower also had great focus and that's one of my main things i like is focus and this flower actually has it this flower is medium strong and it was a little hazy to me meaning it had focus but you still had some brain fog but it was reasonable i love doing it so we're looking for the best at least the best of the flowers that i'm looking for which is heavy flowers with focus that can grin us out that can give us the perma-grin smile and what do we think of durban poison by up north i'm giving this flower an h65 this flower it was good has 27 thc i liked it but there are other sativa flowers that i think are even better than this one so it rates in an 865 which means that it's better than an average flower and it's good if you like up north and you like uh focus flowers this is a really good flower to try it's a good one i'm the doctor if you want to see vapor cup you can see it at vaporcup.com read the reviews i'm telling you everyone's got their own reason for loving this thing i've got mine too it's just changed everything i do about flour i get to use it much more times during the day i love flour i love this thing and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see all my favorite strains they're on wheat entertainment i really uh tried a lot a lot of flowers and i'm telling you if you follow those lists you're gonna on the road to better flowers thanks for joining in the flowers are getting better because all the tips thank you very much for the tips if you got one for me post it below the video i'll be back tomorrow party on my [Music] friends", "FGM-TR4YIzo": "good morning it must be 7:10 because I don't have a Slurpee so what's going on out there we are going to have we're gonna have a short show today we're gonna cut it down to 15 minutes because we actually have to get on the road to get up to the FM CC conference today and we're gonna be in the Big Green Bus so we got a lot to do to get ready to get up there so we're gonna have to cut it out a little bit early we need a start timer we should start the time yeah right now I just take on there so I don't have like a bunch of cannabis news to talk about today because I mean there was some some news over you know the past couple of days about some nefarious doctors that have been circulating and stuff like that and you know I don't know enough details about it to go into it but I would just say vet your doctors and make sure that they're good doctors and that they're not just well the doctor you also want to say clinics and doctors you cannot pay for referrals right it was there was one that's less linic right there's a there's a patient brokerage act right Florida and one clinic I saw a post and this is free advice for everybody here regards to Varna but it was an actual post gettin $25 to refer patients to us and it was like it was like qualified referral like a bunch of marketing kids right like that didn't know anything I just like oh let's do this how come I was doing infernos seems like a no-brainer but also guys working in the dispensaries do not take backs from doctors it's a major problem in this industry and they're starting to investigate and they're starting to find out in people getting in trouble there was a news report recently I think it was out of Miami Miami Herald about some new stuff in the industry doctor Doran yeah so just be careful out there guys there's laws and make sure you know you're doing okay key states there with doctors they you can dress yes and we're hopefully putting together like a list of doctors that we trust say Go Go trust going with dr. trust where do I find one now I know okay guys I can trust them we know a lot of good ones so we're putting a list together to spend a lot of work enjoy meeting people throughout the state and yeah so I'm so bad as my little freaking hot flashes a little bit and you're drinking iced coffee yeah I know which is Dunkin Donuts is that where you went this morning did you get a doughnut no no no that's impressive although Dunkin Donuts have you ever seen them make coffee at Dunkin Donuts when they put sugar in the cup they use a scooper like none yeah like red scooper and they don't like take a scoop and then put it in they level and they go like this so it's like like it pushes a whole bunch of it in there like it's like oh and like that whole like sugar like bottom of it yes are we convinced for a time that Dunkin Donuts lace their cups with sugar because I would get black coffee in the morning on a gym like a big guys black coffee I was on this kick for a while where I wouldn't even do pre-workout so I wouldn't even drink a bang or anything I would just need a black coffee and I would go to Dunkin Donuts and I get this tall black coffee and I'm like this is swinging like this and well first when you order it I'm like I'm like black like no sugar no sugar just black no cream no cream just black so no sugar no cream oh my god just like can you pour the coffee in the cup and just hand it to me so hey so and then I drink it I feel like it's sweet I'm like they gotta put something that's good this shit's coffee because they're wanting people to come back alright or cocaine or something like a sweet crack so are you rolling that rolling so this is some atlas from fluent which is Durbin poisoning there have been poison what a coincidence I just happen to have a whole lot of facts about there but not absolute German poison is one of our streams that we like to look for yes it's actually one of the more sought after strains and once we start getting into why anyway once you start getting into the reasons that people use it you'll understand why so the biggest thing about Durbin poison is not that it comes from Africa but it's that it has a high concentration of THC v right and THC v is it's known to be an appetite suppressant but it also is known to help focus so it's this is like the focus strain some people not me because I don't have a lot of experience with it but some people say that it's comparable to using adderall for anxiety right and the thing about this is that it actually decreases anxiety while increasing focus and energy right which is like way better yeah so it's a really energetic sativa but it's not racy and it doesn't give you anxiety as a matter of fact I love my music for anxiety THC V also helps with diabetes and blood sugar helps regulate blood sugar it helps like we just said reduce anxiety attacks so it's great for people with PTSD or anxiety and actually one of the more promising things is that it helps with Alzheimer's and that it has been shown to help with tremors motor control and even it works for me and great nations I thought of that like tremors my hand drummer isn't like oh god so it's a well I think and the focus and then the other one was probably worked for me I don't know if it's bone or cartilage but it actually promotes bone growth so that's it's being studied for use with osteoporosis so th t v-- what does that even mean it means tetrahydrocannabinol Canepa baron Pavan I don't know but but if you made a th CV medicine huh what would you call it I would call it Babar it it looks like a pharmaceutical there right you can hear you can hear the commercial yeah if you don't take if you're allergic to the Lorelai versus don't take lyrica if you're allergic to lyrica what good for allergic to what Thanks this that Captain Obvious should be in those commercials so what is the terpene profile wait for more national commercials yeah they're gonna be greater the Kentuckians that are in there um so the most prominent one is Chuck pinna lean turkey no lean sounds made-up to me because it just sounds like like the overall overarching turkey but it's actually a real terpene it's real fruity and it's you can find it in apples it's it kind of gives you like a fruity kind of aroma but then it's got some Mersin in it which is kind of your your staple cannabis terpene that's got like that kind of herbal you know cannabis flavor also found in mangos effect right right and then there's a sim us amine I've never heard of that one it's the first time I've said that word out loud I'm actually gonna make a blooper must try to pronounce all the turkey and I mean that's it and that's a minty it's got like a minty flavor and or minty scent and they use it a lot in perfumes I was not aware of that but yeah all that you know all of that just from one strain and the THC V that's in there mm-hmm time is a very center taste oh me too mr. tired this morning late last night very cut the end off was she saying it's 721 awesome what does that give us four minutes he hasn't been like that oh no I hate the morning we're happy to see you guys yeah I know what we could do honey oh yeah it's ready meant to show that honey cat from Florida - hey buddy today yeah I came to the Valentine's Day event and brought some honey for us speaking of focus right so this one is be fluid be fluid be fluid and be flu contains Kaminoans flavonoids and specific terpenes such as nursing trip in Turpan all turpan all oh no I'm Elaine pine bindi I don't know beta-carotene to deliver a powerful anti-inflammatory boost there's all-natural and tastes delicious and that's the beef fluid so this one helps you be fluid the root cause of pain inflammation is to be fluid that's a big bottle man yeah so white label it we've got a black there's a white label black nail all black label is extra strong no the bigger viral whoa that's a Black Label Black Label is way cooler and that one is um pumpkin Palmetto honey oh my goodness gracious yeah freaking Palmetto tastes like pumpkin I'm sure it does now is that like bees that pollinate both pumpkin and like how do that how does that work this has a thousand milligrams of CBD in it I don't know these pumpkins I have no idea what makes it pumpkin is it like pumpkin flavor in it or is it because I know that some beers are right it's like Palmetto honey is what oh yeah I mean like your teens there's something about it yeah and then honey itself I mean the reason that CBD is great in honey is that honey has got so many Bennett it's almost like cannabis it's almost like cannabis because there's all this stuff that it does that's great and people don't really understand why all the time like I used to eat honey when I was diving I'm so that's why and it didn't impact like my blood sugar but it's got a bunch of sugar in it but it doesn't spike your insulin right weird it's like my insulin oh why you know because I can feel it when I would take like post workouts I've had sugar in them enough I could feel it I could feel I can I could feel it like in my in my body cuz I wasn't any sugar at all anything like that at all so like this didn't impact like that and I was using it while I was cutting and I was still losing weight and they're like helps with allergies are so much better for you it's just you have to eat them earlier in the day or in the morning or you can eat nothing earlier in the day although I'm using it to sponsor I'm clean I feel like my arms getting bloated Archer you know like oh my god you could go on a diet I'm using testosterone cream because I'm having some changes did you rub it directly on your bicep and you watched your bicep grow inside and I swear getting like bloated I'm like oh my god I feel like good we're not selling I'm sweating so much it's not a bad idea I think I'm gonna lay off him for a little bit oh it really is so much more I don't you need a balance it out with the progesterone I didn't even know we had any I wasn't using it but it actually helps me and like not be so tired during the day you know but then we smoke weed and that's got all the phytoestrogens in it like Floyd I've actually heard that it's not great for testosterone production before but I chose not to believe that fake news that's that's that's America now we can just decide what we want to believe yeah it doesn't fit my narrative smoke weed so it must be us bastard that's it goose testosterone so I don't know about you I feel like it's 726 yeah thank you so much thank you the shark song will be live tomorrow we're gonna live from the events we see and we're gonna do Saturday and Sunday special editions - yeah well either big on the expo floor tomorrow all will be in my got they're interviewing people I want to talk to patients and why like me on the street how does cannabis alveoli all right we gots the rug all right guys hope to see you all out there", "5AEBxOdGj1I": "[Music] all right september that means a new box you guys know the drill i won't go over it let's see what's inside rainbow pride outside we've seen it before probably see it again i'm your rolling tray brand materials q cue angelic music if you were one of the lovely lovely people who took advantage of my referral code and got me a discount as well as ourselves make sure to take advantage of the chance to win your next box for a dollar that's pretty cool i'm certainly going to enter um it's really easy you just have to post a picture of your box once it arrives so check it out nothing to lose a lot to gain we talked about the add-ons last time won't belabor the point and everything else is brand materials so what's in the box we got pre-rolls we got flour and we got two vape cartridges it looks like as usual uh i'm gonna start with the flour so you guys want to see some sick close-ups here we go first one by cypress cannabis cypress og and indica at 23.2 percent so on the high end not as high as the thirty percent that we saw from the excellent uh indico by chicha's dash last month but three grams high potency and uh looks to be really fresh green nugs so let's pop this guy open it's tamper sealed which is always nice to see child safe and very potent smelling now it's piney it's green not lemony not chemically cleaning product and really yeah like cheesy dank not diesely much at all a couple out here um besides just the quality of the flower i mean if you take a look at this guy it's it's clean i love to see these glass jars um and i love to see all of their like cool little logos this guy looks like a smiling uh bud himself um solid blue color packages and distributed yeah nothing surprising there in terms of branding materials didn't get one on these guys so what have we got here well first touch right i always like to see whether it's dried out dry on the outside but very sticky on the inside i won't go so far as to call it moist but at least properly cured um what you don't want to see is you open this up and you start to pull on it and it it crumbles and creates a lot of uh small bits and dust almost but this is it's holding its integrity very well and when you look at the inside it's as frosty as the outside light green color some orange hairs very dark overall looks really good um should be should be something worth trying um so far i haven't been disappointed by one of these strains yet so there we go second guy northern emeralds another eighth this is durbin poison and it is 21 thc 0.4 percent cbd and 25 total cannabinoids they rate it as an almost pure sativa so there we go and a very similarly strong sativa this one attractive packaging minimalist uh sort of cannabis leaf diamond logo and look right into it and you see a lighter green color and a little bushier honestly so let's uh let's pop it open all right now you love to see it packed all the way full very orange with the hairs doesn't look like it's been manhandled too much um oh stuffed in there pretty tightly see we can pull out all right so this is sort of what i was talking about when i was saying bushy right they're not as dense and compact as you see uh sometimes and not sticky at all on the outside and that's not a bad thing you know um but it is a difference to note a little crunchier a little crumblier yeah not as sticky not as dense on the inside but you may notice really well developed crystal structure i have every reason to believe this is going to be pretty uh potent and uh durban poison which you also see in uh the hybrids i think girl scout cookies has turban poison in it so uh pretty well known strain um just by the look of it i kind of wonder if it was growing outdoors in terms of products not much about this one either so just some good old-fashioned outdoor grown probably northern california durban poison sativa very fragrant floral kind of scent citrus but lightly more like grapefruit or something than like the pine salt heavy smell you might associate with some sativas very light just like the colors kind of like green so this is like the most stereotypical sativa i think i could imagine right light green flowery smell probably going to be uplifting you know intense high behind the eyes some pretty cool uh hairs coming off of these so hopefully that looks good on camera because it's pretty intense looking out in person but different not the same um as the indica that i already received from cyprus so two very different strains an eighth of each and as always i'm pretty excited to try it so that's the loose flower all right pre-rolls we've gotten between two and three every time and this time it's no different got a couple different ones take a look at one at a time the one that draws my attention first is by cream uh cream of the crop was one of the sort of flowers that we've seen before you notice this guy it's um the same sort of branding so i assume it's the same company minimalist in terms of color but very uh ornate now rise to the top twenty percent thc so fairly strong not like the um lola lola ones that we got last week 26 cold water hash infused but these are also infused you can see here four gram or four times 1.3 gram infused pre-rolls so this isn't just one let's pop this open and take a look at it so this is an interesting little alien uh looking device but it appears to hold as they said four pre-rolls i've got our little sticker on there getting used to seeing these um this is a new one there's an arrow on the top but i assume i'm going to have to slide yeah and then there we go so that's a slip little thing um a lot easier than having to squeeze but i don't know if that would be as good for somebody with like thumb issues but not too hard so looking down the barrel right four pre-rolls and not only are they infused but if you will take a look at these they are coated in what looks like some keef or at least otherwise powdered material um these will be a real kick in the pants anytime you're mixing different forms of cannabis to create these infused pre-rolls you're playing with fire so to speak okay so let's uh let's put these guys back where they live [Music] all right so that is actually i mean that's the amount of pre-rolls or material i would expect to get in pre-rolls in a given box so this is a big pickup once again cream genetics this box of magic in your hands contains four cream cones feature our premium canvas hand dipped in hash oil and keef deliver a smoking experience that helps your mind and body ascend oh and this is this is kind of cool so there's a taste like feels like perfect for listing there and i've mentioned this before but i really think this is the next step for the industries to begin telling the consumer what to expect from the product because there's a lot of variation but as we get better at reading and refining these strains i hope that we get more precise in what we can say that they can do or not do i'm that's awesome this is this is this is cool uh look forward to trying one of these but that's not the end of our pre-rolls which is pretty cool as i mentioned we got two more first one up is going to be sunday driver and indica by one life all right in this very tropical uh little container here now i believe i actually have yes yes one life superior cannabis premium cannabis it's grown without shortcuts cultivated with care nurtured for quality superior taste of roman consistency a result of our meticulous attention to detail our mission is the art of storytelling okay so they're colorful storytelling it's pre-roll but it a full gram it looks like which is nice another great pickup this is the artist edition you'll see down here on the bottom and no other information about the strain besides that is once again a sunday driver so see if we can take a look nothing too complicated there a little pop top and this is a hefty cone all right i love when they're tapped in at the top like this instead of being uh you might see them twisted the twist can be hard to light so um i'm glad to see more brands moving towards this besides that i mean pretty generic looking um nothing i wouldn't expect from a nice pre-rolled cone so spark this one up sometime yeah all right and last but certainly not least a very intensely packaged taylor's quality rolled sativa blend pre-roll coming in at 14.9 thc and no cbd it's got a much higher quality glass container unlike the other ones we've seen so far and a very earthy uh sort of organic farms looking logo fire for less says their sticker um and it appears that their logo is an acorn so this is this is very uh back to the earth granola crunchy and you know you kind of want to kind of see that from the canvas brands right so let's see what we're working with here all right oh so now here's a good comparison for what i was talking about this is a twisted end right here in an otherwise very similarly shaped cone so when you go to light the end of this you're often gonna um have trouble getting that like because there's no air moving through or around it um you can snip this off uh or even you know just hold the flame to it for a little while but when you pack down the tops like that you can draw the flame into the cone and that usually lights a little easier they used a raw cone to make this and probably raw rolling papers based on the kind of brown color so really sticking with that organic earthy sort of vibe a good brand choice for that now do we know anything about these guys we do not all right so taylor's quality rolled sativa clocks in as my sixth pre-roll since it was four from cream of the crop and one from one life and now this one from taylor's quality roll so big uh pre-roll pickup this time for me compared to previous boxes now last but certainly not least the vapes uh i love these i already busted one of these open because i vape all the time i love it um so we'll start with that guy now this is a shape of package that i've seen before because it's rove they're one of the biggest uh brands in cartridges uh for a long time now but this is not their normal black packaging um this is plant pen this is rov x neptune valley so a little sustainability feel to it and a very attractive cardboard outside featured farms premium cured resin super sour diesel from neptune valley clocking in at 95.7 percent so strong um in the past when i've got rove cartridges uh they're very dark looking liquid it's very viscous and i have years ago now i had issues with them clogging up on me but this one so far so good uh you see to open it there's a little button on there just press that in press on the other side slides open so inside here we have our cartridge and we can see ooh rove reward qr code on the box and cartridge use and care instructions and like i said i think they used to have a problem with clogging but uh these instructions explicitly say not to preheat or overheat so i think they're pretty confident in the viscosity these days and you'll note it's really really light colored it's not an amber oil this is green ish gold completely translucent and you can see right through it you've got a nice rubber stoppers on both ends of this and probably only questionable thing about this cartridge design is it's got a metal tip which isn't necessarily the nicest thing against your teeth but maybe i just shouldn't be gnawing on the ends of my vaping cartridges as i said 95 strong um this one came with a little bit of dry mouth when i first used it and i think that's just indicative of the overall strength more than anything strain specific so yeah a a high quality rove cartridge is my first one this is about a half gram of oil so and does rove have anything to say for themselves pure strains featured farms is rose signature 100 cannabis terpene line encompassing the freshest most pure strains directly from our top cultivation partners all right so this is similar to i assume cream of the crop um their attempt to appeal to a more discerning customer base and i have no complaints i i love uh i've been trying high quality products so another big another pickup for me okay and the last thing i have comes from irvana which their tagline is for every ounce we sell we plant a tree so this month a lot of more earthy sustainability focus products i don't know if that was deliberate or just the mix that i got but that's the theme that emerges so take a look at this this is not your typical um vape cartridge box one it's all cardboard and you can't see into it and two it's kind of like slick buttons now they say it's 100 recyclable and sustainable so that probably has to do with it it looks like it was folded a lot more intricately than you usually see so what do we have this is blue dream all right a sativa nine point three percent thc point two percent cbd so let's see blue dream percentage there remove this sticker and it looks like we pinch these sides see what's in there and once again they're slogan about trees and here's our [Music] cartridge look at that you tracked a little guy in a cardboard sleeve [Music] okay so how cute is this got our protective sleeves on there another clear very light yellow looking oil vervana branded on the bottom hard plastic green tip and it's a ceramic cartridge which um in theory burns a little cleaner i don't know um that i've ever noticed a huge difference in the quality of a ceramic versus the more normally wicked vaporizer cartridges but that's why it's a little lighter colored on the inside if you notice so blue dream a sativa almost 90 thc another one that's probably gonna send me straight to the moon uh and not be very sedating uh which is you know sometimes what you're looking for so there it is right our final one if we would like to sum up this month was two vape cartridges two eighths and six pre-rolls so i mean this is one of the bigger pickups i've gotten i'm really happy with it everything seems strong and of quite high quality so knocking out of the park nightclub

subscribe if you enjoy my video", "8B5JHPBj-qw": "[Music] well guys welcome to the CCC I'm Shane dam and we are back for a stranger view today a little double strand review a double strand review we've actually got two really really nice flour samples here to check out for you guys from the herb shop and carros that's right I stopped by the herb shop the other day they literally had this stuff literally just came out of the back and got done curing like as I walked in there it was really fresh stuff and I just broke down this Durban poison they were literally taking off the last of their old batches and bringing out the fresh stuff so this is like the first of their weed to the shelves from their new grow and I gotta give him props man yeah I have here in front of me the what they're calling kid cush I couldn't really find much wrong though yeah there's nothing about kid cush anywhere online I talked to one of the guys there and he gave me a little bit of background on it it's basically and it seems dead on when you check it out it's basically a some kind of variation of a pre 98 bubba kush yeah it honestly just looks to me like some of the best 3 98 I've ever seen doesn't as far as the structure you know it could be the closest thing you're gonna find online if you actually try to do a search for kid Kush is like the Oregon kid blackberry cush and because of common words but we've smoked a ton of blackberry blackberry with using California we've smoked a ton of pre 98 Bubba this is that pretty much any boat it's got the it's got the structure you know it's got the super caked up like pre 98 98 on roids yeah it's got the color mmm is on steroids for sure yeah as you see that this stuff is just absolutely covered in frost probably could not be clicked anymore I would love to see this this particular flower it's just as far as extraction I bet this would make some awesome oil yeah probably full melt as well but it has a ton of tiny little heads that instead of like bigger heads you know it's got a ton of tiny little heads yeah it's not real oily so that you'll might not be too well - good good but it's another one of like on the plant like Bubba it's another one of those ones that has you know real frosty and her leaves and stuff like that so that kind of helps make up for that trooper hacking but the trim is super all I'm trying to say is this stuff is just absolutely beautiful to look at which is because of the way it shines yeah and what we got two joints rolled up here I have the pre 98 no no kid oh and then Dan has some bourbon pointer important obviously this is a sativa dominant it smells kind of like a XJ 13/9 Jack Herer but it's a little more sweet where's Jax a little more spicy you know at least that's what I get from it it kind of tastes similar to like a xj 13 super frosty though the dry hit is super super hazy you know tell me how business Michael white gummy bear mm-hmm that's Mike that's super like I mean it smells like artificial fruity but just super super fruity and like citrusy yeah it's definitely different from the the poison that's more definitely more hazy more Jackie but I love that Turkey that makes good oil it's just hot yeah I was just gonna say oh I was just drooling over that what kind of oil that would make but I would probably if I had my choice of a problem to see just one first actually yeah just cuz that sweet sweet candy smell like this would probably swish really good for rosin two balls in there and both of these both these strains I don't know I didn't see any kind of test results or anything on this but I would expect really really high THC so real fruity yes this is this is pre 98 through and through I don't know if they said it was a pre 98 cross meaning 398 millions of something else or if it was you know just a particular cut or you know if it's just bringing onion or whatever you just said there's some pre 98 in the background but that's all I'm kidding true and through that derma is really sweet though we got to basically the reason I picked these two strains one because they look at us and two is good good for video purposes because they're complete opposites we got a heavy in deke over here we got interested he was dominant over there this is gonna give you a complete different kind of buzz and that would give you so it's kind of gonna be interesting to see you mixing the two oh I'm sorry about these ones this one's better in the d'haran I'm gonna be honest I don't know or maybe it's just such a I don't know maybe it's such a different change in the palate like that one has a more that one has a more full flavor but this one has a kind more of a sharp like fruity flavor that kind of lingers a little bit longer it was just so we're going from that like hazy you know Jackie taste to this like real deep bubble taste you know yeah SS like complete opposites as far as smell you know flavor case you know that whole profile and then the medicinal effects and just the effects the buzz it's just completely it's definitely 398 - I don't look at all I'd also kind of reminds me of like a really really really good sweet master Chris almost you know like it's like almost kind of like a pre 98 with a master condition there yeah I love don't be shy to come it this way I love the lime green look at this this here in the Durban yeah I love I've always loved be like this that's just as light lime greenish could be tasty though I gotta say both of these are manicured really really well I got to give props to the to the growers and the trimmers on these parlour you know you can tell it was pulled just the right time it wasn't all beat up in the turn process yeah and I like when I hold a bud up like that and I can still see the hairs sticking off of it you know what I mean it hasn't been sitting in a turkey bag hasn't been moved from one bag to the next it just makes it feel you know it's just nice to have something that feels so direct from the plant you know you are just like fresh medicine you know yeah and the Cure on that bubb couldn't be any air I mean the trim on that bubba couldn't be any better and the curious whoa like i said this stuff they literally had curing in the back like and bringing it out to put it on the shelf as i walked in so I was pretty stoked that I was able to get a fresh batch of their stuff being it this is the first stuff I found on the show from the herb shop I have smoked their flowers before they usually do have pretty good flowers they grow up in any coach that's pretty nice as well me personally I would rate the bubbler just a little higher I've always been a good guy though I've always admitted that so I mean the buzz on the pre 98 has always been really had just Bubba in general you know it's just another another one of the coaches master has been one that has never really hit me as hard and that's probably for a lot of people that's probably why it's faded and brought the popularity Alonso og imbaba are just always gonna be staples because they they always get the job done yeah we're gonna rake these I mean I yeah I mean that it's hard to hate on yeah I'm on good weed you know especially alcohol our attitude because it's hard it's really hard to find weeds it's not super dry day and like a lot yet that's one thing I was gonna say like this a lot of weed maybe this good but getting it this fresh from a collective is something that is pretty hard to time to make that possible yeah so that's definitely a plus if a lot of people grow really good weed and then they get lazy with the cure of the trim process that definitely didn't happen here so yeah we bring the ashtray until well oh well but uh this is some long wait ten out of ten yeah we're bait I would say time for sure thank you guys for joining us for the other video that's who I am you know who he is I'm Dan see you later [Music]", "5uqjclblkLg": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this one gram cryptochronic joint from alien labs the people decided it was a slim margin but alien labs pushed it through so yeah let's go ahead and see what's going on here uh so we got alien labs of course crypto chronic indoor pre-roll and let's see one gram so that's all the info we know there let's get to this testing panel here let me put it back here all right crypto chronic coming in at twenty four point five four percent thc a and o nine t there's all sorts of numbers on here total thc at 21.97 percent though that's the one i'm used to seeing and cbd at point zero five percent so uh yeah that's that i don't see the total cannabinoids on there necessarily so uh maybe i am missing that completely so if you guys see it let me know but this is packaged back on nine nine here so we're coming up on halloween so just a little over or under two months right now so yeah about six weeks more or less yeah i'm not here to do math i'm here to see what's in this j but speaking of math this was 20 bucks out the door uh from hyperwolf and i believe i've seen it on catalyst menu at the same ticket now so pretty cool i'm glad that they're coming down a little bit i remember buying a j not too long ago for 30 bucks that was a little pricey so i'm glad to see these at uh you know just 20 bucks out the door feels a little more appropriate um all right so yeah there we go the seal is off let's crack this tube i've never smoked crypto chronic so i'm not exactly sure what to expect flavor wise get this angled down just slightly there we go um but yeah let's do a crutch check real quick oh actually a nice crutch a little just a tiny bit weak but yeah not at all typical i would say it does feel fairly tightly packed and there is a weird vein or ridge right here uh so i don't know what that is somebody else my boy dude doing things had a joint with a similar ridge that's the only time i've ever seen it so i don't know what that is if what's going on something in the packing process or the tech there but uh that's weird to see a vein basically in your joint uh but the material doesn't feel incredibly tightly packed maybe a little bit right here um but yeah the crutch is good so that's awesome let me go ahead and get a dry pool this one almost has like a caramel like uh like a caramel popcorn kind of taste that's how it hit me at first definitely like a grungy sweetness there i really like that so i probably will like how it smokes we'll see but let's check out this material i guess this stuff is just extra [ __ ] that made its way out of the tube i'll leave it on there but let's see what's inside of here so let's take my tiny scissors and make her work our way down next to this vein i don't know why it's there again that's a little weird uh we'll see if that denotes anything once we open it up but i don't know it almost looks like the joint was like vacuum sealed afterward which i know it's not a fully sealed up environment but that i don't know what would cause that little ridge there it's just kind of weird it's like the extra material got all sucked together there um all right so there we go down at the crutch let's pop this stuff out there it is you guys a little bit better of an angle here there we go perfect and i should still be worried about my phone overheating uh but you know it's colder now so i'm not so concerned but i probably shouldn't be dilly dallying when cutting these things open all right let's go ahead and see what's in here what is this purple this is a nice color to it it's just a little hint of purple and a sea of darker green here and let's smash these down i already see a tiny boy a couple tiny boys little uh tiny passengers no big deal as i say typically when i'm going through the material itself um you know i mean unless somebody's doing this exactly with this material they're not gonna they're not gonna find what i'm gonna find you know so it looks like there are just you know i mean it's not awful they're not like big stems at all but there is this stuff which is just kind of looks like just tiny tiny tiny stems so i don't know what kind of material they start with um it's looking okay i mean i'm not finding any big offenders in here just little tiny like memories of sticks i guess you can call them that here i'm gonna try to pull one out here see if we can even if you guys can even see it but this is the worst i would say a fender here it's there's a few of these it's not really significant um but they're there so i'm just noting it but yeah so you have to zoom way in so so it's like it's not lumber free exactly but as you can see kind of if i pan over there's other instances of material or you know material like this like where it's just these look i mean next to my finger it's almost insignificant i mean it's hard to see so so um yeah i mean it's not passenger free but the passengers that are in here are acceptable i would say they pay their dues they're not stowaways uh and yeah i mean it's just what's to be expected in a pre-roll um so i mean i could probably go through this fish all those out but if it was me and i was grinding this up i mean i would throw that in my joint too i'm not going to spend i'm not that meticulous when it comes to rolling my own herb it's like you know you grind it up you throw it aj this material looks decently ground it's a little finer than i'd probably like but it's looking okay let me go ahead and get a sniff on these grinds so i got distracted sound like somebody was outside my window um it's there is a mint that really came forward i would say in this smell first uh but there's kind of like this sweetness it's not exactly cream but it's like a sweetness and maybe a slight vanilla to it uh it smells really good i like it i like the dry pull better though that hit me more like i said at first like a caramel popcorn so that was interesting but yeah it's got a good smell to it so i'm definitely gonna smoke this and you know not too many offended offended offended passengers that's what i'll call them offended uh yeah nothing too offensive in this material nothing that turns me off exactly so yeah let's go ahead and get away and if it comes up to 0.9 or more just giving that leeway on my janky scale uh if it comes up to 0.9 or more we are golden um yeah my only criticism really is just those kind of kind of passengers and you know the fact that it's a little ground down but let's see here let me get you guys over to the weigh station all right can i get a good angle on it yes there we go you guys can see that so let me get a tear here tearing it out all right so we're looking for 0.9 or more let's go alien labs let's do this i have a feeling you're gonna be fine well let's see will it be generous that's the question all right we're at 1.1 so yeah a little generous a little generous not overly generous not jungle boys generous but fairly generous especially because there's stuff left on the paper so i mean yeah this is up to you if you are cool with what you've seen here you're down with the ticket i'd say go for it i smoked uh i can't remember which one oh it was the alien mints because they're taking that off the shelf i smoked alien mince j it smoked excellently so yeah i have no doubt this will smoke well so i'm going to go ahead i'm going to give it an a plus i'm not going to give it an s rank but an a plus an a plus just because i have that extra weight in there too so good job alien labs can't wait to smoke this", "ylvS8sRuokk": "durbin poison is a beautiful sativa with landrace genetics that trace back to the Rift Valley of Kenya it has a rich sweet spicy caramel taste and an aroma that smells a licorice with citrus and minty undertones Durban creates a soaring sativa high that is very clear and cerebral medically it is recommended for patients with epilepsy multiple sclerosis and other seizure related illnesses one of nature's true gems Durbin poison possesses unaltered genetics come see this perfect landrace sativa for yourself at any of the clinic locations", "sT4Hs1f_3G0": "tarantulas we got them back from gonji gold it's been one of our patients favorites for a long time but ranch Allah is a infused joint it's a good top-shelf cannabis with hash and oil so it's extra kick in the joint they come in green and blue the difference between the green and blue the green our greenhouse grown and the blue are indoor brown and blue ones go for $30 at the door with taxes and the greens go for $20 at the door with all taxes we're not traveling up now besides a covered in with the keep the oil and the key smells we'll get this one is purple Queen Latifah there's also kirova number four it's a real nice hybrids got Keefe distillate Sun grown bud other than that just real glue testing out 19 percent so definitely pick one hose up this one for candy jak2 sativa 22 percent as well this is the indoor the one we're smoking right now is a greenhouse grown a greenhouse grown purple Queen the purple queen is testing out over 27 percent it is a definitely got some cake fire oh yeah get my nose tingling my toque and enjoy hey that's a good joint if you passing me your sheet is I was like tripping there's person and smoking it's very smooth you could definitely on the purple Queen you could taste the purple flavor I don't that's the first time I've had purple queen but I'm not too familiar with the strain I haven't had a lot of fun I had it before this but definitely has reminiscence of a purple strain if you if you like those like you know kind of a granddaddy or maybe a great day I think my favorite thing about it so far is how quickly it's hitting me yeah it's into it and definitely feel it so the Keef on this joint if you can really see it it's a really light which is really rare to find sometimes it's really green but this is real light Keith which is really really good quality the oil on there too is is seem to be clears that's that's real nice it's not dark or brown door or anything like that which you don't want smoking really nice as well it's burning even all the way through and it hits really great to the tarantulas are all tested by can a safe that's the company that test these products making sure that you're getting good high quality medication with no issues they do this directions here says directions light taupe and Anjali so we're on the last part we're enjoying right now and it's good very enjoyable that's a good joint we just got these back recently we had to add them for a while and now after sex like the best joint in the house right now I mean I'd like smoking our pre-rolls we have a lot of good ones but and this is the greenhouse 1/2 this isn't even the end or one he's good to I'm stoned you know there's three of us and we're not even finished if they get the whole joint itself is over a gram and its entirety with the flour the oil and the key so it looks like this is a purple Afghani Hindu Kush me ain't my favorite thing about it so far as how well it's hitting usually every time I've got that joint this guy oil and keep on it and all that it's usually it runs it's pain and they asked to to have it burn right and this is burning really nice and even all the way through so very pleased about that mm-hmm and for our patients that like the Knockouts and what was the other ones we used to get galaxies the galaxies joints maybe we'll get those back one day I don't know right now I believe they're still waiting for compliancy issues but those were a favorite this easily is as good as any one of those that were ever made and this is bombed very comparable I would say have to try the end or want to see if it's how much better it is that was an outdoor Olivia this is the greenhouse okay that's where the greenest word green is greenhouse the blue is an indoor and they come in a variety of strange they keep tit all the way down to the crush to its keep all the way I'm not much left here yeah but there's an you can see from starting to getting this thing burned all the way down right at the very beginning it seemed like wasn't a run but it didn't I mean you can see it's really even from the beginning to the end this thing taste is good and this is towards the tail end if I'm not smoking paper probably still don't taste good still weed let's check it out this paper that was it as good a nice feeling any night oh yeah definitely but a body high and a head high but I feel good and then like I don't want to go run a mile or anything but I mean I feel like I could do something though yeah I'm very mellow I was energy chill yeah but I definitely want to do something a very good feeling up very uplifting I could good they'll enjoy doing something right now I don't know that's nothing another one right now but definitely smoking another one later for sure yep that would be a heavy one for some of the new buyers by their self I think like I don't think I can smell all those to myself that'd be that'd be too much picture itself if we had no plans for this today then when would be solid yeah but first people many people that was pretty good it was a good head change oh dude check them out tarantulas", "ql7vsOA6G9s": "you durbin poison is what it's called not this dove and and it comes from South Africa and there's a lot of really cool the reason why I notice is because I've been working with South African strains for years and they have a lot of promise to me that's where we found the THC Valley v levels or we wanted it or we could get it out the concentrates we make from it or special I have 15 South African strains I breed with myself so I have quite a bit of knowledge on Durban poison and the strains that come off of it Durban itself but what we're buying it as is a hybrid real Durban is an outdoor plant but these Durbin's now that we're growing is a sativa that's been indoor iced and regular Durban poison is about a 10-week indoor it'll grow outdoors really well here it'll harvest before winter gets bigger buds outdoors grow difficulty of Durban is about a - it's almost rosy so that average flyering town for Durban is about ten leagues wild urban gets about 10 foot tall tamed Irving gets about six to eight foot tall the average yield for government poisons about eight eight ounces to a pound pros and cons of Durban is it's very good quality genetics cons is the link to the flowering town Durban poison that has a lot of similar strains in Australia but I don't know if I mean America other may be seen on in a Cinderella 99 is kind of close but it doesn't have ta CV [Music] you", "-Ow97uDqoZI": "okay cool so today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we've got this 2g double pack of strawberry wedding cake from sf roots via ease uh he's dropped some money into my account so i was like all right let me just take advantage of this let me just buy a bunch of joints from places that i haven't heard of before i've seen these guys on ease i don't know if i've seen them in a shop but i was curious so i figured hey why not let's check it out together so here we go we've got sf roots we've got whole flower premium pre-roll so that's what we're looking at here and it is infused i don't know if i said that earlier but here is the deets if i can zoom in on this little area here hold on there we go all right so this is coming out the total cannabinoids of 22.93 thc at 20.28 zero cbd and this was packaged back on july 25th we are mid-november now so that is a few months about four months ago this expires i guess next year according to this there's the batch info etc i think that's all the information keef infused light pre-roll whoops keep infused instructions light inhale enjoy all right cool that's that so this is a double pack of 1g joints inside supposedly let's see what other info we got on here strawberry wedding cake government warning watch out they're always watching some distributor yeah and that looks to be it so all right i just didn't want to miss anything there so my haste to get this done before my phone potentially overheats because it does that on these longer videos so here we go so this was 20 bucks pre-tax i believe so for two 1g joints that are infused that's not too bad depending on the material inside it says whole flower premium come on guys come on out pre-rolls there we go whole flower premium so i don't know what that's supposed to be i guess i'll save one of these to smoke and i'll try to smoke it and talk live about it on my patreon maybe i'll do a live or something but this one's going back coffee's working right now let's see all right so this is what we got so you can see a little bit came out already just was hanging out in the tube i guess maybe made its way out of these js it's a little heavily packed at the top but the crutch doesn't appear to be too weak the bend is happening up further so that's not too bad decent crutch let me get a dry pool it's got a floral sweetness to it it does not taste bad at all i think that's that wedding cakey kind of sweetness in there so that's cool it's not tasting too bad it's not super pronounced though i'm not trying to mislead you nothing on the outside so i'm guessing there's going to be extra keefe basically on the inside and now you know i'm not one two oops let me get in focus there i'm not one to be all about the thc percentages that's not me man let me zoom in i'm so far away you guys are just seeing my hand basically you're not seeing this masterful twist this masterful spiral cut that i'm doing that's totally intentional all right yeah it's having a hard one today the coffee is running thick there we go all right so this is supposed to be a full g i guess it's a g with the floral material our plant material is probably would be more commonly said and the keef but we're going to find out what else is in here it's looking a little dark it did say it was premium but it didn't make any claims i don't believe of being indoor yeah nothing left in there all right so there's what came out there's a little bit better of a view on it so yeah it doesn't make any claims on the tube here it just says whole flower premium pre-roll but it doesn't say it's indoor or anything like that so no promises made it's looking like it's greenhouse to me uh just from the color alone but hey that could just be the color of the nug maybe i'm wrong on that sf roots feel free to chime in so it does seem that has these chunks here of uh of keefe so it's infused i guess but it's kind of chunked up together there in little bits let's see if we can find any unwanted passengers in here the material is just looking fairly ground i guess this is probably a big chunk of keefe there we go fairly ground down um not atypical for pre-rolls in general but i'm thinking that if there were there's a big chunk key right there uh if there were any passengers that they would have been finely ground two little bits and looking something like that so like there's just a little tiny evident i mean you know this i don't know the quality of the flower that went into this i can't say it says premium this is a little piece of a seed pod right here what's this guy i don't know chime in what do you guys think what that is it looks it's too small it's just all ground up it's too hard to tell it could just be a little piece of one of those like tiny premature seed pods here's a bigger piece of lumber so so yeah it looks evident that this was just kind of ground up i'm sure they used some kind of fruit futuro machine or some other mask grinder and they're mass packing it but the material itself didn't taste too bad on the dry pool let me get a sniff on this you guys take a look in there but yeah you know i mean this is two 1g joints in one tube so what can you expect for that but yeah not smelling anything fantastic just a little minty a little musty just plant like you know overall plant that's what i'm getting off of this so so yeah the taste was a little better than the smell but let's go ahead and get a weight on this get the scale kicking over here you guys just admire those little piles of keefe and i'll smoke the other one and we'll see how it goes why not you know it's not like i'm not super turned off by this material but it's just you know it seems like it's fairly evident that this is not indoor especially by the smell too but but i mean the color was my first my first um indication i guess but all right let me zoom way out here here we go getting the way on let's tear this bad boy out all righty teared you guys can see that perfect so if this comes out to 0.9 or more just because i like to give that a little bit of leeway with my scale 0.9 or higher then we are good to go gets a pass you know i mean it's like i'm not again super stoked coming up to 0.8 let me re-weigh got a little bit of dust here there we go retail i'll just do it again for safety's sake but let's see it might come up if it comes up 0.8 maybe it is a little shy maybe the other one is 1.1 because it is two and one tube you can't say there's not much okay there's point nine so all right let's give it to him it's a pass it's a technical path um not an s rank i would say it's kind of like a i'll give this like a b or a c i don't know it depends on how much i like this student how much i want them out of my class but that's what you're getting 20 bucks plus tax for two of these that's just the contents of one so you have the knowledge now use it to your discretion if you want it if you find it for a price you like go for it", "bI8E9GkF2bE": "are you a marijuana

subscribe click that bell so you guys get on fight every time we upload and uh yay", "US6E6S1FhDM": "what's up YouTube this is I saw images back with another product review I did one of these earlier today they're probably gonna drop at the same time or within a half-hour 45 minutes of each other so I haven't dropped that one yet I'm gonna drop that one in a few minutes and then I'll drop this one short they have to so this is another mary's medicinals review this one is durbin poison i would show you the other one but i got rid of that one today no because it was bad it was really good I could have kept it from my own but I already have stuff for that so I figured I'd hook somebody up so this one is durbin poisonous a sativa I don't have any more of the information delete Li next to me at the moment my potency is THC seventy four point seven nine percent zero CBD production date is seven 1919 and it's kind of spatch number used by day psi lab tested on seven twenty nine nineteen test batch number in national poison control number it's a label if you want to know about the other one go back and watch the other video that I'm gonna draw up to shortly says contrary to a popular relief it's made at the same place that the platinum beeps carts are made up [Music] that one's from Saginaw so once again the bottom not like a little pull tab piece pull that decide the only difference between this one and the other one I had is the other one had a black tip this one has a white tip this both I know my room is dark at the moment I still gotta get that light not very dark the bubble is not moving super quick so it's not watered down liquid whatever the situation is so let me look this up to the bomb battery take a few rips and let you guys know how I feel about this one I'm not getting any real predominant flavors from that at all I think you can tell it's just an old card like that kind of flavor like some basic oil without a lot of Terps well then give this one a go the other one was good was actually really good so we're gonna see what this one's all about it's not bad that's pretty earthy though it's pretty damn earthy actually as I said I'm going to the sweet flavors so the next review I'll do I'll probably enjoy that one a little more just based on what I feel the flavor is gonna be the sugar cookies one was really good great flavor this one isn't bad at all just personal preference I prefer the the sweeter flavors versus the earthy tones I said that in a bunch of them but this is not bad I would definitely recommend this to people I'm gonna say they're two and home right now and the products I've tasted the potencies there and at least the sugar cookies I thought that [ __ ] immediately was really intense I drove to my friend's house I felt pretty pretty [ __ ] baked no I don't support the I don't promote smoking and driving you know you can still get a DUI even though it's illegal I'm sure there's still a gray area with all of that but DUI is driving under the influence so this is something obviously drove on I made it safely I didn't swerve all over the road I know not a drunk so yeah I would definitely recommend that to somebody - a lot of people actually as I said it comes down to flavor preference a lot of people like this kind of flavoring more than the sweet ones some people wanted to just taste that straight wheat excuse me not the nose again yeah Mary's medicinal and there's - an O on this channel so far I'd recommend them I'm gonna get my hands on some more the flavors and just keep trying then I'll look into some of the other companies and see about testing out their stuff but Mary's medicinals give it a thumbs up very tasty just something that was just a little too woodsy for me so I personally probably wouldn't buy this one again for personal use um the sugar cookies absolutely I'd buy that again and again nothing bad on that one flavor taste everything was there but it's as I said it's not a bad flavor it's kind of like Mars og wedding cake any of those other ones from platinum it's just got that that type of taste to it yeah pretty hot I can feel it I'm a little high before I did this video I'll be honest I can definitely feel like the kicking it up a notch being a sativa I definitely feel like through my frontal lobe right here I got the foreground of my forehead yeah I wouldn't sound like super uplifted at the moment pretty sure I was smoking on the indica yeah it was an indica a Skywalker OG I was hitting that on my club and a little bit ago that wants a straight indica so doing that before doing a sativa you know I kind of riding out both feelings at the moment but yeah as I stated there to when I won this journal I definitely recommend Mary's medicinals so far unless I can find some research stating otherwise well I'm gonna say they're all good but uh I'm gonna run I got some xbox overwatch to play relax kick it hang out with my boys but yeah if you guys don't mind smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment below she'd chat about anything just depends on what you want to talk about or if you even want to talk if not just like the videos just like the videos whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better at the end of the day and if that brings a smile to your face saying I [ __ ] this guy dislike hey glad I can even help for that split seconds so peace to [ __ ] out guys you never fantastic weekend and I'll see you guys in the next video", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "KZlR-Lu63F4": "all right y'all welcome back new routier thanks for stopping by man so quick little update this is that Durbin poison I just wanted to show y'all I'm about to have to scrap this whole plant so I went on a little trip was away for four or five days and we got loads and loads of rain in the process this plant has just took the [ __ ] and so if you get in close you can see it the blood rot is running I got back and discovered it I cut off everything that was rotten and so that's been a couple days ago now and we're loaded with it again so it's like it's gonna be a complete loss that's what you get fellas down here in Oklahoma this time of year we got a lot of rain and I went on a trip you know ones unable to take care of these this planet like I need it to bud rot full effect", "RUF6G8_GiaE": "hey guys welcome to this video um what i'm going to do is just going to show you i've got a couple of plants here that are all from uh dutch passion um who actually contacted me asking me well we started conversation anyway and they said oh would you like to try some of our genetics and i said well how about for outdoors in the uk what have you got what do you think will work and so they selected selected a couple of strains for me and uh i'll walk you through them um the these are both the same these two here um so these are auto durbin poison um all the same age uh the the medium that these are in is is basically it's a mixture of a lot of stuff that i had um because this all sort of kicked off at the beginning of lockdown and obviously couldn't get out and can buy things um i like to recycle everything anyway uh but it's also nice having fresh new compost and new cocoa but anyway so what i did i just i just mixed mixed up all that i've got lying around basically so there's a mixture there's old cocoa in there and there's perlite and there's compost i think that's it basically a couple of different peat free things sorry waffling again juice so here we go so auto derben poison um been in flower now for about four weeks i think roughly uh as you can see excuse going away um for those that haven't grown outdoor before and when you see sort of in indoor buds um outdoor can look a lot different a lot airier you don't get the full compact uh buds that you get inside so much but it doesn't mean that outdoor weeds no good as you can see this is looking all right um i haven't topped these uh i've talked about this before i've topped autos outside before and then the weather's gone [ __ ] like it is now and then they end up getting stunted so i made a decision uh not to top any of the autos um so yeah anyway going really nice a little bit of color on there as you can see uh this one this one's more colorful and you can see some really nice uh deeper sort of purple colors in this it's interesting different strains sorry same strains but different seeds can produce very different plants there we go so yeah really happy with these going really well um i think i choose the right size root power she wasn't sure if they were going to be a bit big uh they might have been a bit big but yeah so it's all going all right so there we go so that's that one and then move around to here down um so this is an auto duck you see by the leaves uh it's kind of like a stealth weed um the little duck shaped leaves now this one is tiny um my kitten was very i'm sorry my kitten was very kind enough uh to piss on this when it was just a tiny little seedling and it has been stunted ever since at least i thought it was stunted ever since um so what i actually did i popped another seed which is this one here exactly the same hasn't been pissed on and you can already see it's going to be like a a normal sized plant rather than a stunted one like this so yeah so that's cool looking forward to that it's not been pissed on that's just you uh and then this one this is a photo period again was sent to me by them um this oh god is it white snow i'm sorry snow bud so i've got a couple of different snows on the go at the moment so this is snowbird again chosen to to do well outside in the uk um i haven't topped this which maybe i should have done i still could to be honest i topped all the other photos uh because they were getting really tall but this was a lot shorter at the time so see nice nice leaves on it it's grown really well um yes i think i'll just leave it to be honest uh i'm not gonna light dapper or anything like that if i did then

subscribe i'm eq same brad time same brad channel later y'all", "f8NgqcA-964": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another video guys we're currently driving right now man but i thought i would pick up the camera for once and just do a vlog or something where i'm out on the go because i'm currently out on the go guys and um i'm just gonna go to the dispensary right now bro because i actually ran out of everything i mean i have some wax but i'm not trying to smoke that wax you know when you have some wax and you know like man i don't really like it too much i don't want to smoke it that's me right now so i'm currently on my way to the dispensary strains my favorite one of all time you guys already know the vibes so it is currently eight o'clock at night a little bit later on in the day i usually like to get them done in the morning but it is what it is you know we didn't have time for that and we're on our way now so hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video man i love you guys all i appreciate you guys i've been in a really good mood lately just trying to be positive and [ __ ] like that so yeah guys write up the likes on this video before you guys get into the real content all right i appreciate you guys and let's get into it oh holy shoot dude there's a fire bro what the [ __ ] yo hold on you guys are gonna hear a lot look you guys cannot see that but there's a [ __ ] fire there's a car set on fire bro hold on [Music] all right i know you guys just saw that man prayers out to whoever you know to whoever is in that accident hopefully the person is fine and hopefully it was just the car that was um on fire man but there's been a lot of accident um lately guys if you guys drive bro or you know i feel like everybody drives nowadays but just be careful man remember who remind whoever is driving to be careful always pay attention to your surroundings because even when others i mean even when you're paying attention bro some other person may not be right so you always got to be aware make sure that there's nothing going on around you and if there is you know you got to got to be alert got to be alert all right guys so i'll catch you when i'm at the dyspo hey guys so i just got here literally placed my online order quick status bro they came out with my stuff right here i'm gonna show you guys what i got but i'm obviously not gonna smoke it on here because i have videos to make with this the loud pack got some ice cream cake they switched up their um packaging for some odd reason they got this little plastic cheap one and also i think it's been a minute since i've tried uh raw garden so i also ended up going out and buying uh the supposedly their best half gum that they have right now because i didn't buy a full gram piece i was like you know what bro it's been a minute since i've had raw garden and what if i don't like it anymore what if i don't like it alright guys so we got our [ __ ] the only reason i didn't get more is because they said that tomorrow they're going to have another drop at four o'clock with brand new flower brand new rosins and stuff like that so i was like oh snap i'ma just come back tomorrow not waste my money today so we could get some fresh stuff right but we had to pick up something for the night all right guys so i also had a joint rolled up for myself real quick before i dipped out so i'm gonna go ahead and just smoke this on the way um back home honestly to keep me awake and um yeah i'll see you guys when i'm at the pad every day all right guys so we are back for part two of this video man because i literally got back home that night and then i was like yo i can't i haven't i haven't done a review on the raw garden so i can't open that for this video i can't open up the eighth because i was going to do a strain review or something like that and then i was like all right so i have nothing so i just [ __ ] off the camera when i fell asleep that night i was like whatever it is what it is all right but we're back at it we're gonna go back down to strains because like i said they have a new drop of flour so i'm hoping that i can get some of that new flour but before we dip out we got the lido's right here l-i-t-t-o-s as you guys can see right here um disposable thc cartridges one gram super super fire you guys see me use these on stream literally all the time i got two of them right here and i'm gonna go ahead and take some hits for you guys real quick because honestly man there's nothing better than just being chill and relaxed literally 24 7. that's i feel like that's the main reason why i even smoke right cheers oh my gosh i literally just hot boxed my whole freaking car with those two hits right i mean with those hits right there oh man that freaking hurt a little bit so that being said i'm gonna go ahead and drive back down there man gosh i love driving but i hate driving to the same destination more than once in a week because it's just like gosh man i just hate it i just hate it all right so let's go ahead and we'll catch you guys when we're there all right guys so i just got back home and i'm gonna be explaining to you guys pretty much all the stuff that i got for you giving us a breakdown of pretty much why i bought it how it looks and all that good stuff but before we start that you already know we gotta gotta we gotta take another couple hits off the lido all right so we're gonna take off a hit off of this one first and we're gonna take another one off of this one yo cheers whenever i hit a cartridge i always feel obligated to at least take one blinker to be honest tonight though i feel obligated to take two blinkers because i was looking back at the footage while i was editing it and i was like dude i literally went like three or four minutes without not even chiefing a damn single thing so i was like bro i cannot do that to the boys right so i gotta make up for all that lost time so we're gonna go in on blinker number two bro these disposables literally are some of my favorite you guys know me i do not mess with a lot of different things everything that i bring to this channel is 100 you know like things that i rock with so cheers on blinker number two let me try to get 200 at least 200 likes for this video for two blinkers all right yo cheers gotta get the lungs ready man when you take back to backs it just creeps up on you whether you think about it or not it'll creep up on you so [Music] cheers [Music] all right i'm nice and big now i'm not i'm ready to talk about the products all right so first off the main reason that i ended up going back to strain is because they had a new flower drop like i stated earlier this one right here is a kosher dog if you guys didn't know kosher is one of those strains it's like for me at least it's super super turkey like if you could get a good kosher strain like you'll honestly be in love with all the terps that come out of the strain all right so i ended up copying an eighth of the kosher dog this is a strain specific house brand and it is sitting at a total 26 thc i know you guys probably aren't going to be able to see that but it's all good this is a hybrid it's one of the most fire strains in my opinion it has a history of being like out in the cannabis industry for a long time it's one of those og's trains right so next up on the list we had to go with some wax for sure i wanted i've always wanted to try this brand so i ended up copying it this is the buddies three bears og i don't know if you guys remember three bears og when i had it in the raw garden cartridge it blew me away that flavor so i figured i was like maybe this three bears og is gonna be just as fire so it is one gram of live resin dab and this one is sitting at a total i think all right 79.98 almost a full 80 so not bad at all right and if i actually open it up for you i have opened it up already let me go ahead and show you guys how it looks super super white as you can see right there and it doesn't really look like light resin in my opinion but you know i'm not an extractor what do i know you know i feel like every time every month now they come out with new different products that i never even knew about existed so last up on the list guys we got the alien labs sherbasio batter this one right here is one of the ones that i've had several times before i keep purchasing it because it's actually really really good it had the terpene profile on this strange herbaceous just super super potent let me go ahead and take it out of the box right there so i can show you guys how it looks it kind of has like this is a batter remember and it does have that battery texture but honestly whenever i dab it it kind of gives me an essence like i'm taking a live rosin dab it's super super terpene it captures the full cannabinoid profile of the alien labs on sherbasio itself so honestly that's the main reason why i keep going back and copping this one this one itself is sitting i believe sitting at a 75 total thc so all of these products are all around 70 tc which is kind of the normal nowadays i feel like things don't really go higher than an 85 nowadays so it's all good so with that being said guys this ends out our late night dispensary run i hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did do me a favor drop a like drop a comment and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys we'll catch you in the next one", "u-6vdIFCSvw": "good morning YouTube universe it is press and Pete the press and puffin I am here with a new one for you I have done one of these in a while G leaf concentrates I'm not gonna lie I'm freaking nervous as hell about this review because I've been hearing bad [ __ ] all week about this latest drop a G leaf and how their concentrates have tasted like ass or chemicals or what-have-you so and that's diamonds that's butters that sugars I've heard them all this week so I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna lie I'm nervous so anyway triangle cush cured butter did some homework on this one it is kosher cush blue power pusher cush crossed blue power so sounds interesting it is a hybrid you know G Lee's labels are basic so we'll just get into it it is pretty fresh broken at the 16th this is packaged April 6th so it's pretty fresh I mean it is cured but still THC 1.79 THC a 65.4 6c BD 0 CBD a 0.17 Carr 2.0 5 v humulin point 701 a little all point one five nine and limonene 0.09 nine so not too shabby for a cure drug you could see I haven't cracked into it yet we are going to bust it open together is my wake and bake is is my dad for the day get me going this is new so I've had issues before with their jars they flop around in here get tipped upside down I've commented on it before in the video and it looks like they've come up with an idea to combat that now granted it is creating more waste but it stops your concentrates from flipping upside down inside this jar a little bit of paper packed on top now normally I'd [ __ ] about the waste however I would rather deal with that a little bit of paper then have my expensive ass concentrates upside down all over my [ __ ] lids so that is awesome kudos to G Lee for that I will give you guys that good job you keep that kind of [ __ ] up that's good that's thinking that's using your head I mean I'm sure there's other ways to get around that but hey you came up with a solution good job I know as you can see this is dark it's a nice chunk in there nice big fat chunk let me turn this light on maybe get a better color is brown it is dark it is cured great it is G leaf so I'm not surprised the real test is going to be how it smells and how it tastes so let's give it a shot cracker open doesn't smell bad it smells like typical butter doesn't have much of a nose to it my lights are flickering a little bit must be they're warming up LEDs got to love it so let's break out the G pen connect in my luka glass rig from luka glass at world's finest vape shop in Bridgeport oh yeah all right we're gonna take a nice fat dabby here because i need to medicate and curious how this is gonna taste it does smell really decent for you know what it is nice little glob idubbbz [Music] not too shabby okay we'll stick her in a busted-out for the tank cap that back up sorry I get a little OCD about stuff sometimes alright let's warm her up Cheers mmm it's going for the reheat you always get a better flavor with the second one it's not bad little grassy little earthy but it's good I mean I can taste the cushion it's definitely got a cushy taste but I lucked out guys I got a good batch I'm just gonna say I don't know how the effects are yet we're not getting into it yet we're just starting I mean I am get a little bit of sweat going but it's a little more I'm wearing a hoodie and I'm dabbing so oh yeah so um no throat burn a little bit of a tickle but I already had that to begin with doing my dabbing yeah a little bit of a tickle no burn nice taste oh yeah I like this I'm gonna have to go in for another one mmm I'm glad I got this I do have another one to review that I bought that one has me even more nervous and that's a live sauce but that if it's as good as this I'll be happy great let's get another fatty on here the other fatty for daddy haha oh yeah look at that big [ __ ] we're going in hard son it's one of them days my dispensary has modified their hours because of this pandemic so I used to be able to go before work now I can't go until after work so that sucks but at least I'll be able to place an online order it just sucks I wanted to go before work after get it out of the way at the end of the day I really don't want to drive an hour and a half two hours when I've just finished working so just saying alright let's warm this back up but it's bad boy get fired up what oh yeah so hopefully you guys got your stimulus money um hopefully used it responsibly paying bills and whatnot essentials if you got medicine whatever you needed but hopefully you didn't waste it I spend it frivolously my wife and I paid off bills caught up on things yeah we were responsible with it hashtag adulting i know scary what we do and we get older how much more responsible we can be can be I said can be yeah I like this butter that's good stuff I mean it's cured but still that's a sweet spot I'm right where I need to be now for the day well folks I got a call that one a win all day triangle cush cured butter by G leaf outstanding it's a nice hybrid it's good middle-of-the-road it seems not too heady nice body pain relief anxiety relief I got both I'm chilled out not too wound up but I'm not couch lock still motivated to get up and do some stuff I got some things to do this weekend it's gonna be a long week long weekend but awesomesauce I'm happy so I must say $60 for the gram that's a better price I'm tired of these $80 grams 50 and $58 half grams [ __ ] that [ __ ] but I'd like to see this closer to 40 yes but instead of 80 I'll take it for 60 for a whole gram it sucks but it is what it is it's better than nothing and it's better than some of the other [ __ ] people are paying for so I'm gonna call it a win triangle cush kosher cush blue power it's good stuff folks it is what it is I'm over here reaching for my mouse to operate oh so that tells you where I'm at after two

"toOYpkpsrKA": "[Music] yo what is up guys up on togar back here again and welcome to another video on that in today's video I got a stronger view of something golden strawberry let's not waste any time man before we get started with today's video let's take a quick toke let me know if you guys are cooking along down in the comments section below let's get Lidia like a titty in this video and

man Louie whoo all right guys so in today's video ooh [ __ ] that was a little harsh all right so in today's videos haha I'm so sorry guys all right in today's video we're reviewing Golding strawberry if you guys don't know what's going in strawberry is what it is it's strawberry coffee makes what country cuz it's a it's a really good string man I've been smoking on this for the past two to three weeks now funny story my grandfather if you guys were wondering yes he does mohkumat and I do smoke pot with him my grandpa he's been getting the string for a while probably for the last couple of weeks and the past couple of times that I have like sauna in but then hung out with them and visited and all that like he's always pulled this woman strawberry stuff out that's in the jar right here and I remember when it first tried it did well look so far I tried it I started he let me smell the drive straight up man has a really strong citrus strawberry smell to it and then it has like a back layer smell of kosher push to it it's a really nice [ __ ] smell and the [ __ ] high and everything the high it's a whole different experience it's really heavy heading I absolutely love the strain that's all I can say and that's all I'm going to say until I get my official review after I break down to three categories so this is your guys's Bruce watching this my Ustream review I like break it down by three carboys which is high taste and smell I don't really carefully lunch because I am visually impaired man and you know I'm not what I waste my time and try to you tell you guys what I think how I like it hella can get like some [ __ ] like you guys can tell like yourselves like this is something looking stuff it's super Chris relief but let's get into the string review man and let's start off with smell before we start off with smoke let's take a toke alright guys so [Music] I did kind of go off about no even yeah right off the bat when I opened the dark straight up I smelled strawberry in Citrus and the plastic all mixed into one it's a [ __ ] bad-ass taste I hate not bad I smell [ __ ] I'm stoned alright like overall me I'm like holy [ __ ] like good smell it's like it's something else man I'm like I I don't know how to really explain it because like I'm stoned but all we can tell it's [ __ ] like pieces like it's something that you never smelled before it's some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] so right off the bat man I'm going to get smell I'm 5 out of 5 right off the bat so let's go taste let's take a hit to that man I packed up the big fat ball just for this video so I can get extra [ __ ] up and I can edit it like it this shit's like amazing like I love it all right now this week let's take another pill [Music] [Music] alright so taste or did I say hi no taste all right so that takes man to be honest this is it's really good tasting like it's uh you know it's a real classic taste and I know that's not like everybody's cup of tea like that Oh Jeannie kind of like push like that typical limpid cutsies but I love that case I kind of like that like it's dirty indica taste it find out that kind of sounds raunchy but yeah I'm not make it trying to make it sound air here and Big Mac but yeah the taste is the classic like photo cheese but it is but it's like kosher to that cursor to change with a point I would say like like I ain't cheating you so I'm gonna give this gift piece a five out of five man so let's go on and we left last category what unit is high and let's take a nice big I strip for I and I got a lot of good things to say about that yeah tell cute [Music] all right so for high man I the THC percentage on this it's 28% it's [ __ ] high hello some really get a [ __ ] man and holy fella be the first couple of times that I smoke this like I fell straight [ __ ] asleep and I usually smoke this before but like I do not recommend this I was like a daytime time this is definitely like a at home chill ninth time highs like totally [ __ ] high the first rip man you take the free strip of the day and if it's Devonian strawberries right it's a potato for hours and you own like lose track of time man like it's a really nice [ __ ] high really relaxing like I like really it would be really good for someone that 2015 it's really like an uplifting high like really nice just super [ __ ] relaxed and you're like I like this is like a nice high I'm going to give this a 5 out of 5 and overall I'm going to give this train a 5 out of 5 I would get this time and time again the downfall that I have about this drink it's a little bit expensive where I got it I paid 150 for the half but it was all worth it man because this [ __ ] super high quality plague and the smell to tie all of it and the lytic speed like it's super clicking crystal you know so oh and all this is like a little gets ring and it has my stamp of approval if you hit it again and again and again like I would probably get burned out on it if I just beat only like in that but you know if I go to the disco and I don't see anything but like I would give back like 106 you know so this isn't this isn't like a disappointing stream i don't but that's going to be

that good [ __ ] okay okay so let's go ahead and talk about the taste the taste is piney and pungent got a fresh earthiness to it but it's very piney at that first pint taste and is easily as well the smoke is busily to the smoke actually smells good yeah pretty good the taste is pretty good what do I get a taste I get a taste mmm and we'll come back to the taste structure but I give it a four it's a lot of nickel size tight birds in here I only got this one Bikram the trimming and all that good but you know you know I am tripping on that this is still some quality flour yeah most of the birds are like this size but it is packed with try colors the bright orange hairs I'm in the bright orange pistols on it like these these little suckers are packed and I'm saying they are packed so the structure of the bird I give it I give it a four and a half looks I give it a five I give her five they dance they dance y'all sticky - oh [ __ ] they stick you to so structure and look on the but the structure I get a little and have looks I give it a five ship the real real good it's just some little purple looking buds in there to the smoke up it is smooth you know I'm saying I didn't call sperm in I give it a good the smoke right now maybe a four and a half it's not it's not giving me t as not giving me that throat wrap that I like but it's smooth and it's tasty sort of smoke right now I'm gonna give it a four and a half the effects right now not super heavy not super heavy okay more real subtle basically I'm calm you know my shoulders dropped not tensed up at all so it does provide that relaxation so you know yeah so basically this is a good strand I would say this is maybe a good adversity Boston Harbor City was a good waking bait a good daytime strand Oh what would the test lab analysis real quick all right so total THC a it's coming in at 0.65 C bb-8 come in at sixteen point five to see BB is coming in at zero point two four CBG is coming in at 0.14 for max active THC 0.57 max active th CBD 14.7 for total active cannabinoids 0.38 was bringing you to a total of cannabinoids 17250 I'd be wondering how to hide a how to get these numbers because it's weird to me yeah it's very weird so THC a is at 0.65 been at the bottom it says max act of THC and 0.57 Matt CBD dismisses at the bottom it's a max EBP fourteen point seven four but look at the top is saying CBB 0.24 I don't know how they come up with these number what I recommend Durbin poison I would I would I know about it end of this blunt I know I'm gonna be filling the fix more the smaller my blunt gets you know I'm gonna show you a [ __ ] they are white not a whole lot just a stirred so you have to see a little bit of the risen something blunt yeah that way but yeah it's Durbin poison coming from an industrial hemp thorn everybody should know this company by now it's out there now plenty plenty of plenty plenty plenty of flowers yeah plenty of flowers now go ahead shoot down shoot over to

back y'all be cool [Music]", "J40U6akTHNs": "[Music] what is up y'all p2p and today we're doing a video of the osmo pocket one of our newer cameras we're gonna be using and uh yeah so this one might be moving around a bit no not really too stationary type stuff as i mess around with the osmo while we're filming and stuff but yeah but today guys i've got the skittles punch buddies cart review for you guys you know as always it's the but not as always but as it's been recently we've got another liquid diamonds buddies right here maybe we'll go for a distillate next time we get buddies but yeah they're working with about 70 thc on this one 74.72 total cannabinoids and uh you know an indica strain so you know it's definitely right up the alley for me so uh terpium profile let's go ahead and look at that we got an 8.56 percent profile not too amazing but nothing too low either uh you know some mirror scene in there karyofleen and limonene let's see back in there for y'all hope you all can see that yeah without further ado let's get this video started the right way and the way we always do with for those of you at home if you are packing up your dabs getting that already or you got your cart pin already ready right there right next to you i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit of this and i'll let you guys know what i'm tasting what i might be feeling [Music] creamy uh sweet sweetness there not too creamy i guess but um almost like a tart sweetness there um not too much of anything else you know that limonene that's in there i'm not really tasting it as pronounced as i did in that banjo cartridge but um i'm getting very very light hints of it so it's not exactly absent all the way but it isn't as pronounced so that's all the flavor notes i'm picking up here let me go ahead and take another hit for you guys real quick here and let you guys know what i'm thinking that one partially went down the wrong way [Music] so that hurt a little bit so what am i picking up there so now the limiting standing a little bit more you know i'm getting a little more of that limey citrusy kind of taste but it's still like again i said not as pronounced i'm not sure if you guys would even pick it up if you weren't really trying to hunt for it like i am and you know the only reason i'm really hunting for is to see if i could taste the terps that are listed here in the back you know i use them for the most part but um you know for a straightness at skills punch i was expecting more of a sweet kind of uh taste to it a lot sweeter than what i have here um but it's still not too bad so far potency wise it's okay so i've had i have hit this card a few times this isn't the first time recording this video um but uh yeah it's it's not the craziest like buddies card i've had you know this is indica it's pretty relaxing i wouldn't say like other ones it's sedating this one's more relaxing and mellowing which is too bad at all maybe that's just how the strain is but you know i'm assuming it skills punches across of skittles and purple punch so um me personally i was hoping that this would hit a little bit harder on the indian side but it's still not too bad though 74 total cap noise isn't it's not crazy a crazy amount of uh you know cabin rates and as we all know you know the higher capital percentage is actually what you want to look for rather than a higher thc percentage i mean you know thc percentage is also very good to look at but you know you want more full spectrum stuff more cannabinoids [Music] and once again i'm getting more of the tones the sweet and limey tones as i hit it more i think this is something that you won't taste much when you first hit it but um you know after like you sesh with it a little bit or maybe you know when you're sitting there and feeling like 2p hits and you'll taste a little bit more on the second third hit which is a little bit rare because generally speaking we normally expect cards to get harsher or darker towards the end you know but uh that remains to be seen with this one it's not to say that once it reaches the bottom it's it's gonna still taste better and better you know what i mean like it could definitely do what i just talked about before um yeah in terms of high impotency it's very mellow you know i definitely i mean i can go out and talk to people and hang out while i have this but it's definitely not really not no energizing yeah that's all i have for today's review guys i hope you guys enjoyed this quick little informal one and uh yeah i hope you guys bear with me while i still get everything figured out with my green screen set up with new cameras and all that stuff but i want to thank you guys for joining me and always and kick it in here so if you did enjoy this

as [ __ ] but um yeah this one is actually pretty [ __ ] nice so y'all know I got a little pink panties you know but unfortunately my King Louie that I originally was pulling on it just out of the [ __ ] blue stop pulling so pretty much like no none of my batteries were able to get a pull from it like at all so I was just sitting there up [ __ ] creek without a paddle so now what I just thought of is that since my panties are getting a little low no homo it might be time to top it off a little bit King Louie got a eighty 4.08 CHC and a point 19 CBD and pink panties has THC of eighty six point five eighty six point 55 and the CBD of 0.68 so I mean I'm not gonna go ahead and completely mix it even though I [ __ ] it man we're gonna do it one time for the one time [Music] we're gonna mix as much as we can I mean I was gonna try to get it fixed you know but I'm at the point where it's like you know I ain't dumb I know how [ __ ] worked so let's go ahead and try some [ __ ] get all these little excess so it don't go drip drip you feel what I meant to look for at Dollar Tree that I completely forgot was a pipette but it's cool all right so that's about as clean as it's gonna get it's gonna smear on whatnot regardless so let's just set it somewhere stable [Music] and I thought of a couple couple of names between the two I've been thinking you know either between King Tani's which I'm not really too friendly of I mean it can work King or my favorite [Music] gets topped off write down F topped off right there right now so this can go down and click always self bet again I the thing is the sink that was loose like milk it would have spilt all right folks so that's all that put that back then we topped off right now you know I'm not just going with the new flavors sit on top and not shake up with the wrists well what is what is that what you gotta let that bubble flow you see where that bubble flow let that bubble okay let it flow two times or two times so you know it's mixing again we gonna test out this pink Louie here we go I'm sorry I'm sorry you have a voice cracking at all I was like that was legit you saw here first you heard it here first the voice cracking all King Louie and pink panties for the new movie in honor of the new movies and honored the movie that's coming out not gonna say nothing else cuz yeah y'all whoo no no it was nice I'm sorry you got to go back at it [Music] alright guys leave a comment down below which name you like better King panties or pink Louis my personal favorite thing Louie [Music] definitely like because I know y'all I haven't seen that yet some of y'all don't forget to share I need to see y'all in them comments comments looking a little dry right now and don't forget to share cuz we got to grow thanks for

this is the pen they gave screw on now it's a push-button you guys the temperature gauge all the way maxed out of 40 we're gonna take it to 35 and see what happened turned on least Cushman's to be honest not much them said that's so in that 707 Baxter just came out last was so nice man 707 to wax the court Raju's powerful this thing here I don't like it it has that fake flavoring just good for making so many cartridges that I do I just I got a rule I don't like that taste anymore like I like the original flavor like if I make a cartridge with just regular plain no flavoring original and you get the string taste I like but then you go throwing that Terps in there man the fainter whatever I'm not even getting like lit I'm not one of my favorites but you know what it is and to be honest with you this year our F sub Davin s stuff only the grassroots triple distill yeah me too I just that I don't like got pen at all I'd stay away from it the Clementine one that was 80 some percent was good that one they're not so good but we're gonna dab a little bit of RS Oh birthday cake I'm totally [ __ ] sober like I hit that thing three times just as a fake [ __ ] taste that last one [Music] [Music] [Music] scholar and a banger baby I ain't burning my throat very very annoying but we have the grassroots are us Oh triple distilled you can dab this you can't and it [ __ ] you off I brought the seal of my [ __ ] sober just hit a pen five times from a dispenser area and didn't fill them very disappointed with that time very very now the other one the Clementine og pen that one was [ __ ] good but this one here actually let this sit over top of that warm up a little but it's so thick like it's hard as hell to come out of the needle down through a half gram yesterday very distant you guys wrong hit that subscribe on hit that like button hit that Bell baby I", "3L2JecFMHXE": "hey what's going on guys it's I stay grinding and I'm back here for another video for you guys alright guys so I'm gonna have my girlfriend in this video to help me out with this review now she never smoked weed like probably the last time that she ever smoked she probably took a hit like a couple months ago but she never smokes now I know this is a little bit off topic but I just wanted to show you guys in my new shoes that I got it's not first woman she does the other one got to just so you guys know I got I got both pairs but yeah this is my first pair of easy this is the new uh the new statics and yes these are legit um these are the most expensive shoes that I ever got let me know what you guys think of these in the in the comment section down below I think these look really dope I like how these transparent how the stripe transparent I don't know man these look freakin sick like just look at the stitching in these shoes man these are freaking dope and these are freaking comfortable guys alright guys now let's get started with the review now I've picked up a selective a bait rijckaert now this is the first time of I'm ever trying the brand select I've tried brass knuckles I've tried a lot of brands I tried a lot of different cards most of the cards honestly that I've done have been from the streets because cars are stupid expensive in the dispensary man super expensive like I only got a half gram cart and I'd only want to tell you guys how much I spend because I know she's gonna get mad yeah man this this this cost a pretty pain let me just say for a gram of this stuff and the dispensary is going for over a hundred bucks now this is a half gram now the guy in the dispensary told me that yeah he's some that he picks up from the streets as well but he told me that he really thinks that these are worth the price so I don't know the dude in the dispensary convinced me to pick this up and as you guys could see in the back right here um I don't think I could read that this has 0% CBD which is kind of kind of lame but it has zero 0.67% cbn but it has ninety one point 7 percent THC guys that's freakin high cuz I know most of the cards test around 80% I don't think I've ever seen a card testing at ninety one percent is the highest THC percentage card that they had in the that had in the shop now the packaging looks pretty nice looks really professional shout out to the met men in Las Vegas they are freaking dope a suspense are you very professional they have their shirts tucked in man like very friendly friendly dudes in there man they convince him the bodies expended a scart and there that's how friendly they are but yeah but let's open it up Oh see how is now she's gonna take a hit guys so I think she's gonna be she's gonna get pretty hot cuz I don't even know him the last time she smoked was was the last time you smoked it's because what happened with her she's in the smoke we have a baby and she didn't smoke during her whole pregnancy and after she was pregnant for nine months she had a c-section and I wanted her to what they tried to give her opiates and I want her to take those I children ought to take them but yeah I gave her a hundred you're supposed to they say four like a beginner or someone who doesn't really smoke they should take like 10 or 20 max 30 milligrams I gave her a 100 and she she tripped out like she had like a like a psychedelic experience type [ __ ] so here's the half gram select vape cartridge I'm also gonna let you guys know in a few days how long this lasted me because I'm gonna try to make this last because I spent a lot of money on this guy's that's most expensive car let me just say on the streets I can get a whole gram for cheap and then for a lot cheaper than what I paid for 1/2 gram of this but I'm very curious to uh to see how this how this tastes now on how high it gets me the tip looks pretty dope yeah the tip looks hella dope like I've never seen a tip like this I'm the dude told me that these are these are like hard to refill as well the guy in the dispensary told me that these are actually the number one carts in California and Oregon like he pretty much the when he said it that these are the pretty much the best cards on the market better than brass knuckles he was like yeah these are way better than brass knuckles yeah pretty much she was just making it seem like these are like the got it cards now I have my pen charging over there and let me just go grab it and I'll be back shout out to us I have another review of their of their wax pen review that the link will link to that will be in the but yeah they hooked me up with some bad news just so shout-out to lose their dope I like yous they're cheap and they're reliable that's that's that's the best thing about loose a lot a lot of the vape pens they break very easily but loses a good brand that you could trust alright so have the card on there let me just turn it on that's one five times all right cool another card is on you wouldn't try it first I'll let you try it first you just try it first yeah you just gotta press the button yeah bro that was cloud bro you saw that dude this smell is that was that was a little ass here but I was cloud bro like that's when he come over here come over here damn bro a little he doesn't smoke you guys better be high another one want some water babe what about it I'm gonna get her some Gator [Music] yeah I think that that concludes the review guys that's perfect I'll be even taking a hit but I've never she's hitting cars before and they've never even been that bad what do you think before I try this like what do you think of this it's make harsh on your dope if you haven't smoked what's more good rude alright let me try this now some missing I don't even know I had the yeah I had her temperature up pretty high though how did I like four point too much on mine down to three point eight all right guys Cheers no I'm just playing on my person girl 420 but he's dull damn bro straight-up tastes like you're [ __ ] taking a DAB out of them tastes like you're taking that dab bro just tastes like a dad dude damn dude that [ __ ] is kind of kind of harsh on your [ __ ] I want to come it actually is kinda hard roll - it tastes strong - I think she's more this is more like what just make her throw her like it's like it's like a instant hits me I think what is this a sativa oh yeah this is deficit even that I could just hit it knocked it just as pretty obviously kind of weird in red but this is a sativa man ninety one ninety one point seven percent THC guys damn just less than eight percent more and this would be a hundred percent yes Josh hurry shuttle - I've heard is that [ __ ] always fire deep like the flower always had with your I've heard is always fire so I mean I think the big question is you think this is worth more money compared to the other cards yeah I agree with the guy the guys look like I said the guy in the and the medical shop told me that he thinks that these are worth the money and I'll show you guys how much I paid up this cost $60 for a half grand I know guys it's crazy alright guys but thank you guys for watching this video please hit the like button down below if you guys enjoyed

problem is because net flies i put nematodes in the dirt still didn't help about a week or two and that was about it but i still got about a mother another month before these are ready but we'll let them try as you can tell the nitrogen is coming out of these but they're completely getting burned up and that's not from the light or anything it's just they're completely yellow and dying out like these so i don't know if it's the fox farm drive minutes i'm using them i have to try something else go back to my synthetics my bottom nutrients what i'm used to but we're going to keep going organic until the very end of this grow at least try it out but i think it has to do with mostly because the nets flies in here but keep her going let's see what she does out there but there you go wrong buds you know they're getting big going around here and just cut the tops of these off because i've seen some people try and they said they make the buds fatter i really doubt they do we're going to try them out just for experiment to see but like the bottom half it's green and luscious just going through there looking just not the top half and i've been using a straw net but i don't know if i'm a big fan of these grog nets i don't like that i can't move my buckets around before i can water them they're completely staying still not a big fan of this i'm just going to go ahead and and use some bamboo sticks and some tie downs like i used to [Music] until i get everything down but next season for series what i'll call it will be making seeds trying to give it a good try see if i can do it or not [Applause] and i've been using recharge every once a week just to try that i think that's what's keeping these girls alive oh well [Applause] a lot of microbes but we'll see how she does i think i got about four weeks i think i've already said that but until she's ready maybe i think it's week six flower yep this today starts week six flowers pretty sure but super skunk and durban poison from what's on the bag says eight to nine weeks and a good time people are saying if you have a infestation somewhere give another week to her so give her a month four more weeks it won't kill it but i'll keep checking the trichomes they're still pretty clear even though these buds look like they're getting done triathlon is still clear on air all right guys i'll keep you updated you'll have a good week if you have any suggestions let me know take them off there ain't no wrong answer for me all right guys have a good one", "V06XrnacWA4": "here what up what up though was going always good it's your boy briefed on [ __ ] andrewy we back with another [ __ ] video so what's up man I appreciate y'all coming down to the sites today on this beautiful [ __ ] Friday it's Friday evening right before the Sun go down you just wanted to buy about which out a little bit it's gonna be a different video compared to the other ones the other ones that usually vape cartridges or whatever tonight we got a [ __ ] pre-roll right but [ __ ] the pre-roll first things first if you're not 18 and older you can get the [ __ ] off this page right this video is for patients 18 and older who enjoy the use of cannabis right so yeah man make sure to LIKE follow subscribe to everything the snapchat the YouTube make sure to sub man I need them like something even if subs up 80 percent of the viewers any sub man come on bro I love y'all man hook it up man just hook it up yo I had a shitty Friday two subs would make me happy I'm not even going from sweet subs and I'd be like hi my day was cool but but anyway man I understand at the end of the week you know we feel drained you know we just want to smoke inside [ __ ] so I figured what better way to safe with the homies and with the subs and have a nice little pre-roll sesh man and why I'm gonna get into why this was so important to get I don't want to say employee but why I felt like I needed to get this right so you know a couple of the subs a couple of the homies that were like yo let's get a video of you smoking some herb instead of smoking depends which I understand because a lot of the homies they either you know the end a lot of the homies of the subs are even in different states that they just can't sash or whatever so that's what I'm here for you know I mean that's what I'm here for the vibes bro always I'm always for the good vibes and the cool like soul music are soul R&B around all of that I mean because at the end of the day bro like I said it's Friday we Melo went down we're getting ready for the weekend we smoking me chilling and sometimes we need that person to Bob but sometimes that person ain't there that's why I'm here man so I appreciate olya right so without further ado let me get into why I chose this strain and where I got it from and all of that so this is Durbin poison by bro it don't say but I know it's gotta be Durbin poison the labs is there is real so definitely a real product 19 point 43 percent THC 0% CBD and yeah this is from Lake Colt I got this from Lake Hulk in downtown LA which is conveniently right next to the Staples Center so I went there the other night to go copy a superb cartridge because they're one of very few dispensaries that actually carry the product and me and my uncle right since we was kids we used to love like smoke movies smoker movie stoner movies the weed movies just that weed humor and one of those movies that we watched was the watch and there's a scene where Chong pulls up in like a little scooter right and he said he was driving the [ __ ] all the way from Humboldt County and he has some Buddha that he wanted to sell the snow and he pulls out this week this kind of weed this kind of weed but out of his shirt pocket he pulls out a little nub of Durbin poison he's like yo I've been driving since Humboldt County off of this you describe this from Africa it's this it's that so me and my uncle my G my uncle's like three years older than me and him would just be like yo we got a smoke that [ __ ] one day mind you we're in New York and we just started smoking me I don't even know if he was smoking at that point so it was just a mission to get this although I did see a all the eights of this they were just too pricey for me at the time they were like $60 from up north up north the brand is up north I'm not sure of my flower up north flat I don't know what it was but I don't know too many brands that actually have Durbin poison so you know I saw it and I was like you know what this is the closest thing I'm probably gonna get to actually have him like Durbin poison so let me just cuz it's also what I mean by that is that you can't find this anywhere like it's you know Durbin poison something that's like it's a unique strand it's almost like a blue cheese the blue cheese in the constraint like there's some strands that you just cannot find for whatever reason so I was very excited to see this I was very excited to smoke it like I felt like I would when I was looking at this I was like bro I'm getting high just looking at this so I had to copy it it's only a point 7 gram so it's not even a full gram but it's cool I don't need a full gram I'm a smoker I'm gonna try to smoke all of this which out at night so let's crack this [ __ ] open I already took off the plastic and because I had to when I copped it I had to give it a the dry taste and all that so boom urban poison 0.7 got a shit-kicking Wow I can't supremo's we can't really tell nice little point 7 and the brand a knobhead just says premium infuse cannabis sativa blend that's it and the manufacturing date it doesn't have a brand on it nothing it just has that so yeah I know the brand let me know put it down in the comments so yeah before I spark this up man shoutout to y'all shoutout to the homies I've been kickin this out it's homies I've been smoking with which a homie which a boy and all of that I appreciate it bro yeah I mean I'm away for you how to get you a little smoking 10 Susan apparatus his way to God done rolling up so you can smoke this with me yeah man today was rough I'm not even gonna front like I'm tired as [ __ ] I'm not even done working like after this I gotta go paint a bathroom ride don't stop me and grind don't stop hi man like I said this video is for patients 18 although he'll enjoy the use of cannabis this is Durbin poison from an unknown brand I have no idea but I got it from litko salut kids damn that [ __ ] tastes good I don't get nothing crazy from it like I don't get like then again I didn't set in but I'm talking about as far as taste it don't taste any different from like a haze or you know it doesn't taste like Jack I don't have that that part that that's that spicy peppery sativa feel to it don't have the smoke good though this is Kate this muhfucka chicken right now and one thing I've always learned roads if the ash and white it ain't right get the resin on it smoking on that [ __ ] like that man put a puff of give on that $10 but it wasn't bad for 0.78 Durbin which you can never find is I it's a vibe though I'll tell you what some free roses don't come out smoking good though remember I spent like $25 on a pre-roll banana cruffin by Kenneth E Kenneth tech Kenneth one of those higher brand top-shelf we brains and they got spent like $25 I had the caning cold blast hit all that had the Kimber oil that had like all of that it was beautiful I'll let that [ __ ] but I said it didn't fall apart but this [ __ ] just didn't like the way this is just like yes cool I'm not I'm be honest with you sir it's amazing like when you're a kid and you have these these dreams and aspirations and then when you actually get there it's like hi okay this is cool I guess yeah I mean so should I have ran to got this nah but I had to smoke girl my uncle - man shot it's my lab shout-out to that [ __ ] kids you know and he on probation right now so you can't smoke I'm smoking for him but I'm letting him know it ain't it ain't gotta go get to Durbin I got a green eyes but then again who knows because you know 20 minutes after I turn this video off I may have a totally different outlook on life like wow like I should just really opened my mind that doesn't wicked [ __ ] like it could be but I doubt it yo my uncle's always [ __ ] on me because I got the vacuum ones always always always right cuz I always like inhale like with a force but I realize you can't be doing that on other people's blunts and [ __ ] too because then it canoes and then you gotta go like this and then like this and it's not a good look but I'm just a smoker bro like that's what I do I'm just I do this this is you know I mean I smoke yeah I mean so I've learned I can't please everybody but one thing I do not do one thing I do not do is wet up the bloom I don't be sucking on Alby like there's nothing no remnants is of my DNA awful blood never knows was crazy saliva like when I pass you the joint is gonna be as dry as it came out of the package you dig so that's one thing you ain't got to worry about with me I don't chief like that I don't hog the Blanc no I don't have actually I pass it quick to keep it a stack well I take my boom gone next I'll be smoking like that like chiefing like that which I do though because I noticed a lot of y'all view is y'all guys seen you which I'll be wetting up the blunts with them with them lips oh yeah I'll be rolling it too tight what'd I do man put it in the comments broke everybody's Yoder's everybody got a floor today [ __ ] bro nobody's gonna have it all figured out everybody got the only [ __ ] like something off I'll just roll the best blunts but the [ __ ] be to doing or you know I mean them she's be all wet up some uh [ __ ] is can roll a fat ass joint but you know this you know I mean everybody got they [ __ ] but yo this is I'm not even gonna fun I think this is actually kicking him right now yeah I didn't really think this is kicking in and I think it's touching paper because it's starting to get a little harsh so I'm putting that out I'm done with that 27 to the face now I'm feeling medicated right now I'm not even fun I'm not even going front I'm a little bit more better now than I was when I started the video keeper this diet right I'm not gonna say my world is I opened by any stretch but maybe that [ __ ] wasn't as bad as I thought it was cuz I was [ __ ] on that for the first like ten minutes but now I think I mean I'm not trying to take you out no longer this has been a dope such as if now I feel like I can go for another 20 minutes foot most people only watch up to three minutes anyways so don't matter I did one of just sets which I smoked that Durgan because I had planned on doing that like two days ago so I

some vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "0bwlPmIyNmE": "YouTube YouTube what's up assha boy mmz back at you another video is the lady's Durbin

poison and it as you can see there has ninety three point seven percent THC which is the highest cannabinoid percentage I've ever seen in a cartridge and yeah I just wanted to get documentation of this little experience here I'm about loaded up my my battery with with this new cartridge and see what 93.7% THC does to my brain this ought to be interesting well I am loading the cartridge up here excuse the wobbly video I'm trying to film while screwing this cartridge cap on here have a look at the new office I haven't really shared that with YouTube yet but I'm kind of kind of proud of it I've been working on it a while it's still work in progress you I got my got my dogs playing poker tapestry and you know some other [ __ ] but uh yeah at my workstation you know my rigs my dope ass paint job it's good for tripping out while I'm well I'm doing my thing in here okay we are ready to try all right tastes damn good definitely like the taste and I'm feeling it hit now I'm going to take another hit that's [ __ ] excellent that is holy [ __ ] in the cat you gotta try some of this this shit's [ __ ] excellent do you even know what I'm doing up here I'm getting high as a [ __ ] dude that is 93.7% THC and the cat and I don't [ __ ] around it is extra good I'm gonna be doing this all [ __ ] day all [ __ ] so according to the cartridge this is supposed to make me feel energetic and focused so that's good cuz I got [ __ ] to do you know yeah it's a sativa which you know at this that this percentage of THC at 93.7% THC it doesn't matter if it's a sativa or indica or what the [ __ ] it is that's just that's just [ __ ] amazing it's really good and I'm not coughing a lot and I've noticed because it's so pure I think the more pure you get the less harsh it is on your lungs and the less coughing you do so yeah ok folks will we're coming up on 5 minutes for a [ __ ] select elite cartridge review video and that's yeah that's getting a little long so I'm gonna play some [ __ ] video games and maybe you drink me something and yeah I highly highly is the keyword here highly recommend picking up select elite durbin poison with a ninety three point seven percent THC that's that's got to be a new record", "L9_-cTISkxw": "yeah hi guys you go again and start a week name they decided I'm going extra week and the Durbin poison which is here that is a Standish orange orange trichomes and not too many at the moment but like to see that done of where it's going to be like you know by Friday but then like 20 percent I think is okay so that's that's what's going on the and on the other side the peyote cookies that's that's not showing any orange at all really but they are very young cloudy tray corns here they are very very very is very frosty very cloudy trichomes there yeah they're looking really nice really really lovely would recommend the pody cookies II seem to have a lot of trichomes a lot most of ever out I think but yeah something light of the lights been hanging 40 said yeah go to meet a tent to me the hi tent and it's been hanging 40 centimeters from the top since the start source it says it says a lot about the the cree cob 35 nineties they are [ __ ] there's an excellent light it's on yeah and be opus I used be a prison and molasses molasses once a week I used about 20 milliliters in 10 liters of water once a week and I used bo-buddies bloom Bo peas grow and the but in the bureau biz but in solution horse as well so yeah that's where I used I did put a little bit of epson salts in to notice there was a bit of a magnesium deficiency even though I was using cal-mag so I tell no I know I just always seem to note some magnesium deficiency I don't know why it was ordinary tap water and it just doesn't seem to have enough magnesium in it or enough calcium very nice and there I think no this would be the last time you see them they'll be coming down on Friday and I'm taking it all down on Friday the the peyote cookies would have had enough to play then as well I keep well I'll check them and on Friday but the Durbin poison would definitely be coming down on Friday and that would be the end of this growth and then sadly new one just after that I think and go on a game for a while at I saw some yeah anyway guys thanks for watching and thanks for the lokes and the in the comments and I'll see you next time bye", "7l-3_WKJfII":

for PTSD arthritis and both my knees and ankles social anxiety and a few other conditions you can learn more about through watching the previous shows on this channel this is the productive cannabis connoisseur a channel dedicated to medical cannabis patients and adults 18 and over so today what I want to talk to you guys about is a strain called dirt and poison I looked up the review of it on wiki leaf which I really have been enjoying that site so you can check out what the leaf and see it for yourself and all the other reviews that they have on there so yeah we're gonna be smoking on dirt my poison and before I get into reading the review I'm gonna load up a ball with this like Spacey looking glass bowl I have that really like it's really nice after I do the review read you the review for luckily what I do if you do is just in general is I'll give you my opinion on what I think the strain does for me personally so which I feel like sometimes it can be a ninja individual thing you know the strain that that you prefer you know I almost lost for words there Cheers oh I didn't even show you the German poison hold on that's not fair so yeah it's different poison right here beautiful dirty poison mmm this smells good too it's got a sweet smell let's try that again all right it goes Cheers I'm not sure how far I'll get on this review so it might be a two-part video show so okay feel free to stay tuned for the second part if it runs out it runs out so dirty poison is 100 percent sativa Durbin poison as a pure sativa grown in the South African port city of Durban it has a sweet earthy taste to it with a piney almost grapefruit aftertaste upon exhalation this taste carries over to its smell as a strain as achieved worldwide fanfare for a sweet odour truly a pleasurable aroma Durban poison buds are rounded and chunky and feature a thick trichome coating that covers the majority of the plant many people hold urban poison as a personal favorite both to spark creativity and to help them stay productive throughout the day the strain is associated with a general earning energy boost mental productivity and increased social ability some even consider it the espresso of strains due to the clear-headed and invigorating high it provides Derman poison is effective in treating anxiety disorders such as a DD and ADHD bipolar disorder it may even prove beneficial to sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder also known as PTSD many folks also swear by German poison in the treatment of migraine headaches during poison is quite the enduring strain as it has a long and storied history its origins date way back to the late 1970s in South Africa an ambitious young man named edy Rosenthal was seeking a new strain upon securing a variety of seeds he returned home to America and began honing in on inbreeding the lines which possessed his favorite growing characteristics add later past the Durban line to one male frank to further solidify the strain Mel's main goal was to grow play that yielded the highest resonance content with the quickest growth time mel had taken ed strain and after several generations now possess what he called his a and B strains with mel preferring the a strain mel frank passed on his beeline to sam the skunk man from amsterdam sam took seeds of the beeline back to amsterdam with the goal of again reducing the flowering time the goal was to get high-quality strain that could finish outdoors in the rather short time of the Dutch summer this is not to discredit the strands versatility derman poison can be grown both outside and hot weather conditions or inside under grow lights and yield good results in each scenario although it is favorable to grow them outdoors as a ceiling height can limit the planets potential some different poison plants grow up to twelve feet tall these needless to say the plant still remains a global favorite to this day with over decades of history and favourable reviews it is even one of the main building blocks of the modern cannabis DNA pool it is a strain that has been mixed with nearly everything and is likely a part of the lineage of some of your favorite strains I guess I've read all the way through so yeah that's Durban poison for you THC content the highest can go to 25.5% average will average would be sixteen point three percent as far as THC content goes for German poison so the medicinal uses that suggest for a depression and the effects are energetic okay so I'm going to tell you what I think about that review I think that reviews are awesome it's very in-depth and detailed it tells you the history behind urban poison it tells you accurate characteristics of it because if you look at this indeed the buds are around it like they say it is rounded buds like they say and it does have that earthy taste to it that I really like about a lot strains does I have a sweet taste to it I agree with that I do agree with the fact that it is very energetic strand it's a hundred percent sativa so just let me know if you're not really a fan of sativa then maybe only have a tiny bit I mean a fan of the the effects of sativa like if you don't want to feel like you've drank an espresso like they said then have only a little bit or you can mix it with the indica and that's what I like to do with a lot of strains sometimes like with a sativa I'll put a little bit indica in there and then it may balance it a bit yeah so it's definitely I could see how we'd be good for a DD and ADHD because it definitely gives you that focus I'm not saying that I have either of those conditions which I don't I have dyslexia so that as far as concentration and being focused I feel like it's helping with that a lot and there's not a lot of research out there that I've seen about cannabis and dyslexia so I'll probably do another show about that soon I've done I think a couple of shows talking about that so yeah so thank you for joining me today

community and as you would expect if something's going on in the Vegas cannabis community some hot product is going on I want to know about it I want to review it I want to rate it and I got my hands on some of these tasty tasty Royals by Wamba doodle extract here we go daddy I'm gonna do them one at a time this so you'll see you'll see the three flavors listed myzel toe Durbin poison king cake and white widow I personally chose those I won two of them in a in a contest from wampa doodle Thank You wampa doodle oh yeah and then I I bought one because I uh you know good you know you you want to you want to repay good luck with good grace it uh it keeps good karma so I uh I got those ones and we're about to try wampa doodles Durbin poison Durbin poison is a sativa this is the cart I was got excited I took the cartridge out I'm so sorry but I had to just see it before I put the camera on I hope you forgive me here is what they look like whole this is the the king cake isn't that's just that's just beautiful and it's got some of the stats behind it right there that looks really good right there womp a doodle people use just fine and this is the 1i we're trying right now Durbin poison and the cartridge is very similar to the to the Jazz cabbage cartridge it's got the three little air breathing holes there for you looks very very similar I would be surprised if it was just wasn't the same cartridge so that tells me one big thing about wampa doodle and that is uh that they're gonna go for for the extra they're gonna go with with the class because uh this is a steel glass cartridge container and you know these are top of the lines so that that already gives me a vote of confidence even before trying the oil so but you know you never know until you know so we're gonna give her a try right now here we go number this is Durbin poison it is now they're oils are triple distilled they're a dis elite triple distilled icily they reintroduce the terpenes from that batch so you're gonna have the flavor from the terpenes of the buds and on top of that you're gonna have the power and potency of the distillate which is you I mean you're cooking with like 90 percent it up as far as I concentrate so that is super badass so let's try this Durbin poison let's see what it's rockin with tonight mmm I'm tell you I'm excited whoo Wow ooh man has that earthy flavor that you that's a very Durban poison he Durban point is very like oh it's almost decently there's like that diesel Chron so like it's got that earthy diesel II flavor man big time like right in there man it's like I put my whole mouth into the buds that's really good the high is settling in really really good idea as you can see I didn't even take the biggest sake because I I know these cartridges man and you can [ __ ] yourself up taking like I'll try to press the video take the baby's head no so that was pretty good man that was good let's try it again let's get one more good hit for the video and then I'm gonna raid and I do have my set odd 3.7 which is very conservative again you can really taste like that that discipline oil taste is in the back of my throat like I know that'll taste cuz Pat pen makes the oil that's pure distillate and I know that like there's there's that just to the flavor in the back of my throat it's kind of like that like base oil wax enos not waxy right but like that really like oily oiliness flavor that's in the back of your throat but then you have like that earthy decently like gasps like like that decently flavor from the terpenes so that's really really really good and then the high like is very like it's it's very it's great it's got that good sativa burst as you can see I'm getting very chatty so that's really awesome I would give it from a flavor standpoint I would give it a nine 9.20 we have a nine point two maybe even a knife point you know I always feel so weird about writing it right on the point because I sometimes you need to think about it but I would say saying nine point nine point three one say nine points and I'm very conservative in these ratings because I always leave room for you know something new so nine point three on flavor which might be the highest rating I've given out except for at and then uh as far as potency I would give it like a nine point four so we're rocking we're looking at a nine point four nine point of a nine point three point five I mean just a great oil this particular flavor very very good I and that's probably more of a taste thing because I you know I appreciate like that decently earthy flavor but it's not necessarily my favorite like my favorite flavor would be something more I would say like something more like like fruity would be more of my like my jam like maybe like a lemon like a lemon cush or like like a strawberry cough I kind of like that flavor but so like a lot of this is subjective but so but that's but a great oil great potency great flavor I'm gonna say it again wampa doodle extracts cartridges they're getting hot people are noticing them I got my hands on some you're gonna want to get your hands on some to go and get your hands on some why aren't you doing it right now the [ __ ] great talk to you later", "dsK5tTHvn1w": "hi welcome back to another episode of Top Chef and here we have the third harvest of the Durban poison this is the first of the

that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs we believe that all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing the medical marijuana strains 100 og kush bubba kush and durbin poison these three strains consist of an indica sativa and a hybrid that vary greatly in their effects this can give you an idea of the versatility of medical marijuana as well as the effects that similar strains would produce so let's look at these three strains when choosing a medical strain it is important to consider the uniqueness of a strain in regards to its individualized cannabinoid and terpene profile as a medical marijuana patient you should be knowledgeable about strain types thc and cbd ratios and the medical applications of all cannabinoids and terpenes you can find resources for all of this using the links in the description having this knowledge allows you to treat your symptoms with the appropriate cannabinoids and terpenes and with the other effects that meet your needs eliminating unwanted side effects choosing a medical strain is the most important part in effectively treating your symptoms with medical marijuana having this knowledge will help you find the most effective medicine quickly so if you are not familiar with these topics i urge you to check out those links even if you are familiar with these topics there are still some helpful free downloads beneficial to all patients today i'm discussing an indica sativa and hybrid strain which can give you an idea of the general effects that each of these strain types produces all of the strains today are high in thc high cbd strains are a non-intoxicating way to use medical cannabis and are widely popular among medical users as they do not produce euphoric high effects high cbd strains are growing in variety but still less available than high thc strains high cbd strains still produce the generalized effects of indica sativa and hybrid strains as in being energizing relaxing or a combination the three high thc strains today are bubba kush durbin poison and a hundred dollar og kush bubba kush is an indica strain that is very popular for its relaxing qualities similar to other pure indica strains it is very relaxing calming sedative and will probably induce sleep bubba kush has about 20 percent thc and less than one percent cbd with this high thc and low cbd 20 to 1 ratio it will produce euphoric feelings bubba kush is associated with deep body relaxation and couch lock or the feeling of not wanting to leave the couch bubba kush has a sweet spicy taste like coffee and chocolate it is related to pre-98 bubba kush bubba kush is known for stimulating appetite and aiding in sleep patients report it is effective in treating insomnia sleep disorders post-traumatic stress disorder stress nerve pain depression arthritis attention deficit disorder nausea pain inflammation muscle spasms and multiple sclerosis these are not the only conditions bubba kush can treat just those reported effective by patients bubba kush has been bred into many different strains most of which are powerfully sedative indicas on the opposite end of this spectrum is durbin poison a powerful popular sativa strain like bubba kush durbin poison also has twenty percent thc and less than one percent cbd however since it is a sativa strain the effects are very different this speaks to the importance of strain types and their effects durbin poison is known to promote energy focus and creativity durbin poison is a rare strain that suppresses appetite in addition to thc and cbd durbin poison also has thcv and cbg thcv is the only cannabinoid that suppresses appetite or reduces your appetite other cannabinoids don't increase it like thc but they don't suppress it either like thcv does it is rare to find a strain that actually suppresses appetite more strains are being bred to have high thcb but as of now they are not widely available if you need to increase appetite with energizing effects other sativa strains would be more suitable the appetite suppressing effects of thcv may be preferred by patients treating pain who don't need to increase appetite some patients see the increase in appetite with a lot of medical marijuana strains as a negative according to patient surveys so durbin poison would be a good strain to eliminate this increased appetite however if you are treating an eating disorder cachexia cancer hiv aids or other treatment side effects durbin poison would not be the most effective strain to meet those medical needs this speaks to the importance of considering all of the cannabinoids and terpenes and the uniqueness of a strains profile even small amounts can influence the overall effects of a strain as any cannabinoid or terpene at .05 percent is considered medically active you can find a complete downloadable chart of all the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis and their medical uses using the link in the description durbin poison gets its name from where it originated in durban south africa it has a fruity taste and smells like berries patients report durbin poison is effective in treating depression fatigue migraines attention deficit disorder stress and bipolar disorder it could treat other conditions as well these are just the most commonly reported the last strain i'll discuss today is a hundred dollar og kush this is a 50 50 indica sativa hybrid stream with very balanced effects between energizing and relaxing making it very popular sativa dominant hybrids are usually energizing with calm tones indica dominant hybrids are more relaxing but not sedative but 50 50 hybrids like a hundred dollar og kush are very balanced a hundred dollar og kush originated in california as a phenotype of og kush a hundred dollars was added to the name because when it was first available it cost a hundred dollars for an eighth a hundred dollar og kush produces euphoric effects with 24 percent thc and less than one percent cbd it is known for happy relaxed focused feelings that are good for being social and creative a hundred dollar og kush is a truly balanced strain between energizing and calming patients report that a hundred dollar og kush is effective in treating stress pain inflammation attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder fatigue nausea gastrointestinal disorders muscle spasms and increasing focus these are based upon patient reports however this strain could treat other conditions as well this can give you an idea of the effects other strains of similar types and with similar cbd and thc ratios will produce it is always important to consider the unique profiles of individual strains it may take some trial and error to find your most effective medicine use the link in the description to download medical marijuana patient logs that can help you keep track of the strains that you've tried and how they affected your

stuff like that I was like really am I getting the best value for my money because usually I spend money on distillates and stuff because they're easier to do and control and dos but I always like the rolling effect you know of a traditional dab where it's like oh you think you're done with one hit but no you got like a couple more and you know what I said if I can get the purists leg forms of DAB you know why not you know plus its 7:10 and I said you know what it's time to really look at these more and say are they worth it and the short answer is at $40 no unless you stretch it out versus traditional dabbing um I will say this though I was personally surprised um I got this for 36 bucks today or 34 because it was on sale for 710 and it's the Cresco lime sorbet definitely smells like it let me tell you I'm definitely a lot more hints along but I would say for me this is about 5 - worth versus the 20 they say but really all I can say is an indica and let's hit it now I've done dad's of war and stuff um I usually press my own from the flower I get to stretch out my flower a little more and this is liquid live resin oh man there might be more than just sleeping okay you know what I'm decently surprised on this if I was gonna be on a lot worse but but yeah this is usually about what I dab right about there from my press and usually when I press I I finally figured out that the amount I had to press which is 0.7 but it's point eight before I press it into a pot and press and that gets me about like were presses that are at least viable but anyway cheers guys gonna hit this out of um my titanium vaporizer right here move you guys back a little but Cheers you know it's really hard to there we go I mean it's Deb what more can you say [Music] I will say this liquid librarian is not really meant for those high temp tabs that I'm used to these are more for low and you keep going then the one-hit dabs I'm usually used to I like it you know do I say 0.5 is $40 in this in this form no at best 35 or lower but definitely not hot bad I mean definitely try it lime sorbet by Cresco look at why present point 5 like I said though I will give you an update on once I finished this and Oh almost forgot on I'm not finished with it yet literally got like a couple like like literally be smooch left in it but I can give you a salt we're eating for 50 bucks no anything under 50 bucks any honestly if you get the golden valley punch get it on sale it's nice and all but not worth 50 bucks and you know how and it's more in you know that's just how I feel but if you can get this for under 50 bucks the golden valley punch definitely give it a try I liked it it's not a ten out of ten but on more of like 9.5 so definitely try it out if you can I like it you should too

week or two weeks and give it a really nice flush Durbin poison strain is 100% sativa and it originally rains from South Africa and it it has trouble growing in some colder states but when you're in

up some edibles these are the blowout special of nine dollars but with our medical discount comes to 831 so with those two items our total came to 35 10 so just for a quick reference on the gummies I've been eating these gummies about one at least every one every afternoon afternoon maybe two a day and I haven't had a seizure in four days just saying okay but on Durbin poison there's a is a strain that I always get but I just wanted to show you this one oh here's the particulars on it so the CBD nice and high THC as high as normal but this is all another one that I'm also not gonna try to pronounce it but it's a 18% in this batch this one is also high at 3.5 and of course the one that's in most most rings that's a 2.2 so it was very high in the terpenes really good in this terpene itself is one that they say it was really good for the seizures and all neurological problems neurological pain so imagine that may be another reason helping bring back my seizures saw back to the 1/8 so I have it in this reef - container has a rubber coating just an old ball metal container play ball came gentle thing as you can see here I put the label from the other bottle one a-two Durbin poisons it's a Street sativa so and open this bad boy up of course I got my little moisturizers in here but I just wanted to show you this one because this one ain't is actually just one bud so it is there and we'll just slide around here may even get some better views of it overdo it so let's put that light back there with the camera around so you can get some better pictures this way yeah so they're from poison I wish I could smell this other way so really actually describe the smell is actually smells a little like cow poop but with in a flowered field so if that makes sense because it's still got a real floral fruity smell but very very earthy that's I guess what it what I would describe the child food smell from so so here we go and then so let me put the little lens on here and get a close-up and we'll take a look at it that way so here we go now let's move it up here I'll move the tip up in there first you can see it's actually kind of dark in some spots so some I've had has actually been almost purple so dark so yeah you can almost kind of see that one there almost looks black but uh I can't get the camera in there close there but yeah then there's the orange hairs if you look there it also has these on top of that purples it has like a green hair sometime never really seen another buds but yeah it's kind of a good example there well if you can see there's orange on and then there's a group like a yellowish green one next to it so kind of strange but okay let's put it by the stem here I don't see it take a look at the stem cuz they can get a good fry look at the frosty something ok so there's another one so I'm actually going to break a little piece of this off so we can get", "4SMCglLt82E": "all right sup yo we're back and we get another smoke CBD strain

one of my most popular videos one of my most viewed videos is my pax era review so I thought I would come back to you guys today with another medical marijuana video my video today it's going to be along the same lines my packs cartridges are made by drip concentrates I talked about that in my first medical marijuana video link will be down below basically I did a full comprehensive review on the pax era and the cartridges I had at the time just to update you guys like a little bit later on I still absolutely love these like love I use them now pretty much solely instead of flour right now I basically have three devices with three different pods and pink starburst my favourite straw nana and bubble gum same flavors I talked to you about last time I still love those and I'm tried and true to those flavors that I like but today I'm gonna be talking about something along the same lines same company drip extracts also makes concentrates and extracts a day at my local dispense are youing a buy one get one for olive drip extracts so I got some crumble and some honeycomb and I'm gonna be showing that to you today so when you buy some concentrates from drip that are not the pods the PAX pods are the C cell pods it comes in a little box like this and you open it and there is your little pot with this one happens to be Durbin poison this is Durbin poison it is honeycomb Oh honeycomb is so nice because I picked two kinds of extracts that you can put basically on top of a bowl of flour because I personally am NOT a huge fan of using the whole like dab machine or whatever like you can dab machine using a rig I think it's a beauty I did for a really long time and I think that the butane is really bad for your throat if you don't do it the right way or you overheated or whatever and I basically just had a really bad experience after using wax for a really long time out of a rig and I think it's best when you just put it on top of a bowl not changing anything out of my normal routine I'm just using the same balm and the lighter like I normally would but yeah this tier of extracts was $30 and for a gram and um it was buy one get one so I got two different strains I got fruit cake crumble and durbin poison honeycomb this is a hybrid and this is a sativa so I actually tried both of these and personally the flavor of the fruitcake I'm not like a huge fan of but that's okay to each their own another patient that had tried this told me that they actually really liked the flavor so I guess it's just like personal preference I don't I don't particularly like it but I know people that do so it's not necessarily bad it's just not my taste but I really do love the Durbin poison it is so smooth and like it's not flavorless but it's it's good I'm not a sativa person I was never as a taper person but the pink starburst which is a sativa dominant hybrid has been absolutely like one of my favorite things in the whole wide world so because of this I've been more open to trying different things because I had so much success with the pink starburst so because of that I was willing to branch out and try this full sativa Durbin poison and I actually loved it so what I'm gonna get into next is actually showing you how consume I'm going to be consuming the honeycomb basically what I'm going to do is take some flour right here I have purple punch strain from I bought this at muv but we're gonna be taking a little bit of purple punch and just basically clogging that hole at the bottom like so really like a little bit in there you can't see but you can see it's the hole is clogged and then after that we're gonna take the Durban poison have my spoon here I'm gonna take it out and grab pretty decent sized chunk right there and this is a technique that my bud tender actually told me to if you're gonna put it on top of a bowl of flour this is the most efficient way you're gonna put the concentrate in the middle so we're gonna make layers the first layer was a little bit of flour and then that ball of durbin poison I put there and then we're gonna make the next layer up a little bit more flour and basically when you light it it kind of cherries know you get the most out of your extract inside a bowl so right there there's the flour on top so as you can see I'm done with the bull and wow that was so good it was so smooth and just it was so good so my review for the turbine poison is that it's so smooth and so tasty and it really left me feeling energetic which was nice because it's really good for the daytime like I definitely wouldn't recommend it at nighttime if you have insomnia because it is it's pretty late now and I'm awake because of this but I definitely would recommend this for a daytime strain and the extract is really really strong really powerful and I just I like it a lot so I would give this probably like an 8 out of 10 because it is a concentrate and they are a little bit harsh but that's honestly just like the nature of using concentrates because like they're obviously gonna be a little bit harsh they're obviously gonna burn your throat but yeah that's about it thank you guys so much for watching if you want to see any more medical marijuana related videos please like this video comment subscribe I really try to listen it's like feedback from you guys like for example my last video somebody told me I work on the sound so I'm working on projecting my voice cuz I was being really quiet in the last video so thank you to you guys for your feedback I hope you like this video I hope you give drip extracts a try if you are an Arizona patient and you do have your medical card let me know what you think I hope you have a great rest of your day keep smoking", "OE7vAqt9_Dg": "alright guys welcome back to another 420 strains reviews this time I got some dirt and poison here I'm going to show you guys a little bit of review this stuff I like all my information I'm telling you guys is off Leafly comm check them out I don't take credit for it by Durbin poison this is the stuff I got here this beautiful beautiful well trimmed bud besides that little piece right there but we're doing a little review on this for you guys let's see if I could put that somewhere here's like all every single one of them are really good-looking buds and this was breaking off like look how just perfect that is it's like a perfect butt right there [Music] very dense very delicious this is a sativa like I said beautiful snap see if I can get this to focus there we go look at how crystally that is on the inside the scale of a bigger piece to break if I have a bigger piece right here I got 7 grams of it guys but like every piece in here is just beautiful just absolutely beautiful but this stuff is just amazing like you guys see that money shot ok we could drop that piece let's try to get that there we go that's some good stuff right there guys be a durbin poison let me see here I'm ugly flee like ah guys effects energetic happy uplifted focused medical purposes it's used for depression stress fatigue pain headaches which actually makes sense cuz when I smoke it it's usually when I have headaches the negatives is basically as any other sativa dry mouth dry eyes dizzy anxious and paranoid the dry eyes dizzy anxious and paranoid is very little but dry mouth is really good like really high up on the list it has an earthy sweet peyote taste which I could taste in this its most popular in Portland Oregon Denver Colorado Las Vegas or Los Angeles Phoenix Seattle Washington Colorado Springs you

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] like yeah all right yeah I right peace love and light I'm back once again today I want to talk about a very controversial subject or plant matter that taken over the United States of the world right now and it's cannabis cannabis is something that the majority of our people are using recreationally medically and what I want to do was just dispel some of the myths about ten of us and talk about some of the good things and some of the balcony's what we have here is my mother plant this is Durbin poison it's originally out of Durban Africa it was booked into the United States and the 75 column in this calmness that worked with the hi Time magazine they brought it over because it is a pure sativa hybrid it's not mix it has a very good yield anywhere from 8 ounces to a pound per plant and it usually takes about 10 weeks for it to come to fruition when you can actually harvest it what I'm gonna be doing today is that you can see she's very pushy so that means she's eaten a lot and I've had I've been holding her in [ __ ] now for about eight weeks I've been holding her [ __ ] now for about eight weeks and that's because I feed a pool close on top of her and I'll explain to you what that is also later so essentially I'm gonna be pruning her and basically what I'll do is I'll just take off these big water leaves I'll take these big leaves and what that will do is it'll redirect the nutrients of the plant from these big leaves into other smaller leaves or other parts of the plant that could use them even the stem making the stem stronger and making all of this really really strong so when she goes into bloom she'll be ready to go right so one thing about campus and how it affects our community is of course a high usage of it but what people have to realize is just like any other thing that you're going to take them to by the way the food was herbs or whether it's from superbugs you have to be aware of what it is actually doing to your body and with that being said we have to know how these masks open and a lot of the companies actually move to differ I actually moved out there to number four to learn more about it before it comes down south when it does be prepared to be a party business a big part of the market that's going to happen in the South one day hopefully so like I said a lot of us are using it illegally and just ingesting whatever it is we get and not paying attention to it so I came up here to learn about it and learn how to cultivate it learn how to grow up organically we can grow it vegan to where you know you don't use any anything like compost from them use that create your own compost to you know feed the plant and help it grow healthy yeah so Sheila I'm gonna flip around so you can see her totally I'll keep her veg for about another month or so and so her babies or clones can catch up that way I could throw them all into [ __ ] at one time and I can tell the light cycle so there's no confusion confusing the planet because literally what you're doing is when you're growing indoors which is what I'm doing is you're controlling the atmosphere I'm provided with the co2 she needs I provided with the water to means I actually provided with the light that she needs and I'm using metal high light lights and high pressure sodium lights which gives me the full spectrum of the Sun well I suppose we can duplicate on earth without actually having them outside in the Sun or outdoors bro process so right now what I'm doing is I'm running her 18 hours on and then I'm running her about what six hours off and that's what's keeping our engage if I run her along the lifecycle you know actually a shorter life cycle which would throw her into bloom because it'll make her think that it's springtime and should we get to produce flower and then you know I let her flower for several more weeks and then and then I harvest but let me show you a clone a clone or a baby of hers that I pulled off of her when she was maybe a month or two younger and I pulled off some clones so I couldn't replicate her symbol to which the grandmother even though they used to do what she had houseplants she chopped off a piece and put it in some water and to the roots then we pod but let me grab one of the columns for you yeah so what we have here is a clone of the model plan yeah beautiful and she is probably I say this plan if I'm not mistaken is about a month and a half old and I literally snipped her off when I snipped this plan off I promise nipped up about this much and I routed her they have put her in I'm actually growing these plants in cocoa 100% cocoa and then I'm feeding them a cocoa base nutrient very good new shapes so with that being said I'm gonna go ahead and get to Poona her and you can see what she looks like now and once I finish you actually see what she looks like I'm gonna snip off a lot of these leaves so we can concentrate on the stems and the stock you know really strong before okay so I got my pruning shears and I so we just pick them up and actually these leaves our excellent source nutrient value help to fight the common cold and other illnesses that you might have blood circulation high blood pressure sort in all you do is you take a handful of these leaves and I think I'll do that later and show you please and I can do this for one I'm throwing them inside and I keep my girl very clean so we don't have to deal with pesticides spider mites thrips or any type of p.m. which is powdered mold because I can total environment very good cleanliness it's super important when you're cultivating counters I can show you how I make my tea with it and I'm actually in Atlanta I worked at a barber shop in Union City actually it was a Jamaican restaurant right next door and I went into the restaurant and I had a terrible cold coffee lots of phlegm and it was an older elder Jamaican lady in there and she called me over and she's like what's going on this is for I knew not to eat dairy products or drinking anything like that because that dairy products of milk is what allows disease to grow in your body and thrive to make you sick because they they live in that mucus that you get from milk and if you investigate what the milk really is you might stop drinking it but nonetheless so I went up to her and she said we were back home in Jamaica I would make a tea for you out of a marijuana leaf and you'd never have a cold again unbeknownst to her I was growing marijuana at home I had a harvest at home so I went home I'm sure I'll be right back I went home and I brought her a bag of leaves and she took him in the back and she stood them up for me she steamed vermissa and I guess a pot and ten minutes later she whipped me out of a cup of it put some honey in it and a few other things I'm not sure she put in there for seasoning and I'm sure and I drank that tea that she made from the marijuana leaves and I've never had a cold again I've never had a cold again I think that a long side would change my diet and taking some things out of my diet that contains dairy products ice cream things I love to eat I had to really sacrifice you know things there amazing to my palate that I ate for sheer delight no nutritional value I was eating her because it tastes great like ice cream so after that I got the tea I drank it the coal went away in a few days and I harvested my plants and I collected leaves and I made tea and no I think not just from the leaf but the leaves help me fight and break down the mucus and then by changing my diet I kind of eliminated mucus in my diet just basically a bunch of pups you know what I mean and it's really not good for you so that's just one of the benefits of the cannabis now another thing I learned coming out here to deal with is that they do sell what they call recreational cannabis and they sell but they call the medical grade cannabis and you do have some people like I say that growing vegan and actually grow it you know pure cleaning way a natural organic way and it has very very good additional values but whatever what I got out here is that a lot of these dispensaries really having a regard for your health and it's all a money game and they'll just have different sides of the century both sides medical run-time correct and a basically selling the same thing on both sides but if you don't get your medical car you better discount than you would if you didn't have it right and the way you know just when I research to find out that it was a farce in some some dispensaries I'm really arguing that though it's because the th levels are so high and when you understand what makes the THC levels so high of course it's great environment but what happens is this plant for example when she gets when she goes into bloom it's like the mating season for the plant so she's starving for the pollen from the male plant and part of her attraction to the male plant or for the pollen that's why through the air is to produce THC which makes it sticky so when the pollen do float around someone a problem does float around that actually stick to the plan and fertilizer not fertilizer [Music] the process of creating more plants or creating seeds takes place yeah and so once the pollen hits the plant and the seeds begin to generate it stops producing THC the THC levels drop way down but a plant that has no pollinating it has completed the process will actually have better medicinal values because it is it's a complete situation the family and everything exactly sometimes necessary and relationships to have a child you know to give the relationship purpose so it's the same thing with the plant when the plant is pollinated by the male seed the male plant then it will create seeds and that's when it creates a lot of the medicinal things that you need some additional components that you need for a host of things off the writers you have people that have pain joint pains or or even help you stop seizures there's a lot of medicinal value in a marijuana plant so so what they're doing is they're starving or they're they're actually not allowing the plants to take its natural course for the sake of higher THC which just gets you high it really is nothing medicinal about THC itself so that right there in the cell you know me coming out of there honestly my whole purpose to come out here initially was to grow a lot more to make a lot of money but once I got out here and began to understand more about the plant and see how the plant was being exploited it kind of my homegirl from development I'm lying what I think is right it kind of changed my outlook it kind of changed my purpose so at this point I really want to tell people understand the plan because I think it's essential that people grow their own plants because that way you know exactly what you're smoking you know exactly what you give them and you don't have to worry so much about whoa what do they put in this plant so make it so big harm you actually harm units that have helped you there's nutrients out here that will actually stun or stymie humans ability to reproduce you know actually deposit those same nutrients in the plant into you and cause you all kind of reproductive issues that you might not want will be aware that's even happening because people aren't being educated about it but I think it's also a big missed opportunity for our people because I don't see a lot of us out here getting involved in the business and I think it is due to lack of education about what it is you know most people have the same thought process I have they just want to get hotter you just want to get higher but we really have to be careful and we really should get more involved in the whole cultivating process so we can decide what it is that we're putting in our bodies and we can decide how we want to use it and what type of weight you want for medical for recreational I mean I don't think anything's wrong with recreational use of it but I think you know like anything else you have to you have to do it in moderation you know you can abuse anything that potentially would be good for you make it be a problem I'm growing this particular strand dirty poison it's a it's not a hybrid it's a pure sativa out of Durban Africa I really want to really focus on genetics of different plants at harvest up and crossbreed them and create my home strains and really really have control of what the benefits are from the plant so that's where I'm at with it right down learn even cultivate learning the business of it all so it'll take care of me and then I just love taking care of plants I think this is my B and then you know originally coming from Alabama both my parents and parents you know grew up in a time where you didn't really go to the store for much at all you know they grew it all in their gardens around their farms just for a few things so I really want to get back to that because I'm not gonna only cultivate cannabis I want to cultivate a lot of vegetables and things that we you might have seen me on here now in the future with some lemon plants or some avocados peppers some heirloom tomatoes and I think it's important that we do that and collect our own seeds I really really really get back and control of what it is we're eating happens over diet so if you live longer healthier more prosperous life yeah so I keep on pruning I don't want to do too much so basically I'm just trying to get all the leads that are really big and it could be potentially blocking the light from the other leaves yeah I can't wait actually allow it to go into bloom and take you guys to that process as well and I would I am gonna let her go into bloom I have some clones of her some things that I could not murder so I can continue my massive growth but I'm gonna let her go into bloom and I'm a pollinator and I'm gonna actually create some seeds that are creating some babies and I'm gonna harvest all the seeds and collect them and then what I'll do is I'll get another plant and produce more seeds I think I'll get something like I'm gonna be a bubble cush or something like that and which is another high yields or popular strain out here and cross let's see laughing creating you know [Music] this is a help control how much nutrients or how often I have to Peter because these big leaves they they eat a lot of nutrient which causes to me the feed of my life around it's really not necessary right now because but I want the happiness for these branches to get strong getting really strong because when she goes into bloom the bugs will be so heavy that the branches will actually just bend over and break and a lot of time that's because people rush them into bloom you know before the stems are strong enough because there's some time with her like I said she's been around for almost three months now so generally three months you can you can you can start from a flower morosini and at three months and be blooming than in harvesting but I just I just really wanted to get strong so the buds will be strong she won't be stressed out the branches won't break so I just wanted to show you guys this process or idea just so you can see it makes me never seen before and we'll continue to talk about this a little more later and I don't answer some questions if anyone has any I'll just leave my information we can email New York make comments in the chat it's a lot smaller a lot thinner I'm sure you were again after a day or two because normally after you prune them they have a tendency to you know to wilt a little you know you know I don't want to do too much cuz I don't want her to go into shock you know and that's a problem because if she goes into shock she could potentially start flowering right off or she could do what they call they call it her mouth and have you shock them too much so actually become male and female and pollinate herself because of all the stress that she's going through so it's like it's like having a child and you have to really take care of her you have to the better to show you have a feeder at the giver of life make sure she has enough hair make sure she has everything so I let her sit for a couple days and I'll come back and show you guys all right now I think I want to take these leaves it's beautiful leaves on the table and go ahead and see we can make some nice tea so I'm gonna take these and I'm actually going to make some tea take that down [Music]", "KzVKfkx2_yc": "all right coming to you for 4020 rfo 20 what's up 20. i'm broadcasting why from what pier 39. off these

me i'm gonna try to block this thing off right uh let's see wow and uh", "NroPl1nCiuc": "hello everybody wonders oh yeah well you purchased today I've got some shatter and we got some shake I've already opened it you can see it down here but we've got a half ounce of sweet Island young sativa and like I said I've already opened this and there's little buddy in some shaky though but I wanted to show you the numbers on it so CBD testing at 0.8 the THC at 20.8 Kerry Faline is at 3.1 and this turbine no lean I guess that's how we say at Turpin h\u00e9l\u00e8ne that's awesome for my neurological conditions and really really amazing with headaches I've been an experience and some really bad headaches and that helps a lot with it the third terpene here is maya cream and that's at two milligrams so get down to opening this up here you can see they're kind of nuggie but there's some a lot of shaking it - but you can see the container it's just full of orange hairs and of course they're all muda they could see it there's quite a few there - so look at it this is actually a really tasty strange world fruity taste and you can see all the orange hairs in that spot like I said there is some gonna get some stems and such this is the shake here let's pull up some shake just so you can see what it actually you can see yeah there's a little stem there let's say but there's so many hairs aren't hairs in it and crystals and let's just focus a little better but take a couple towards the window here maybe we can see a little better and I guess not really but there we go so they call it shake because the this is what um actually they have a automatic trimming machine they said and this is what comes out sometimes you'll see there's like a little strains from and this isn't like a string or anything it's actually part of the hemp and it gets caught up in the machine at terms of buds they said so this is why when they have this in the machine when they clean it out and instead of pushing that through the machine again and getting tiny buds they'll put it in one of these containers and sell it a shake and as far as the price goes here's a receipt from today you can see that the shake sweet Island skunk on my medical discount it was fifty dollars but the medical discount brings it to 46 we also got some Durbin poison shatter and that's on sale for 15 bucks so with medical discount that brings it down to 13 85 then we got some kanji gummies pineapple indica and they're ugly 18 bucks medical brings it down to 1755 and I get my senior discount takes another 10% off knocks it down seven dollars and 76 cents and we paid with five dollar bills forty dollars worth that gives us one pre-roll for a penny so our grand total well it's 69 eighty three and five dollars and seventy seven cents in tax burn it to a total of 760 so and just to show you what the shatter looks like there's the shatter all golden kind of looks like a little Swiss cheese thing so and to give you the numbers on the shatter it's a turbine turbine poisoned strain so the THC for the whole thing is three hundred and eighty five point zero five CBDs testing at one milligram the lime amine which gives it a nice fruity flavor is testing extremely high at fourteen point twenty five and once again this is the Turpin Holly which helps me a lot and that's just at seven point three five and carry clean is at two point three so and like I said this is a shatter comes a little glass container and a little cap and there it is half ounce bacon shake sweet Island Scout and half gram of Durban poisons shatter", "2paHb9SVXpc": "hey guys welcome back it's a good smoke report from top shelf tonight we have the Durban poisoned indica phenotype oh yes right guys so just for a quick update on the statistics we have the Durban poison sativa that was in the previous videos smoke reports harvest you seen all that I've got the final tally here we've got one two tree jars total of 70 grams from the two planets we got 38 Browns from the first one 32 from the second to announce two ounces and a half not too bad haha from the sativa now from the indica we have a grand total of 42 grams weren't were so we got no here more than a half here just for some sampler notes for you guys take a look at right sowing told we got in around 115 grams we still have three more Northern Lights number 5 haze mist to go and then we'll give you the grand total so whatever further ado let's get down to the smoke report for the Derby poison indica phenotype right so let's just zoom in here give you guys a look at the sweet nooks there we go the jars there now let's get some samples yum-yum so she's perfectly draw it out now and yeah lovely and frosty yeah too close there you go perfecto so what we're gonna do is grind some up blaze a joint I'll tell you all about it okay so I'm gonna grab a couple of these dogs now they're bare webby just set back up over here well I'm gonna get one row with you now okay okay one of these nice dogs here okay oh yeah she sounds nice and crunchy perfectly dried yeah mmm very similar aroma to the a sativa perhaps it actually a little bit more fruit it's excellent oh yeah so I'm literally chomping at the bit sample here so now the moment of truth is she gonna be crunchy get up perfect nice piece over here this was another plan that was a pleasure to crops just a little bit this point of the year that I think she these girls probably got a little bit crowded that was by the Haze's I'm guessing Oh beautiful that's like you're very different finishes Eva it's a hell of a lot more fruit kind of berries in there not getting that a media licorice aroma just yeah overwhelmingly fruity okay zoomy not that yeah guys look at mmm-hmm oil burrata that's got one of these boards and just showing you how Kristen E she actually is okay precariously balanced this camera you just give me a moment okay get a good look at her there show you how chrisley she is on the inside too no I got that sticky icky okay now there's one I roll there right so that's lighter up or hope and berries we're hoping through oh she's a smooth smoke that was delicious mmm what actually say she's pretty smooth but more about conventional sort of smoke I'm not getting the the berries I'm not getting the muck at 90-year licorice mm-hmm she's smooth but bring very mild I would say in here mmm definitely different doesn't have that kind of skunky you know generic kind of flavor this is mmm I can't quite put my finger on it actually it's different very different nice and smooth but yeah bit mysterious I have to say overall I probably prefer the sativa phenotype no needed to yield better she actually I think has the edge on the flavor here mmm I still give this girl Tom's up there's some premium quality stuff definitely some nice smoke mmm so yeah very pleased with that some nice fine Durban boys to different phenotypes fantastic plenty of jars a dope I can't complain hmm that's just seeing a little bit more flavor commentary go true I still can't quite put my finger on it mmm she does go on it it's a smooth smoked I'll give it that very very smooth mm-hmm that's a strange kind of pain taste on the palate hmm I would recommend most Athenee I wouldn't say she's exceptionally potent nor would disappear it's good kind of mellow kind of relaxed and smoked I don't have to say isn't it it's quit that the sativa was quite a clear high and you know it was relatively long a duration but wouldn't be too overpowering this I'm definitely feeling more of an indica vibe to it not really picking up much the fever here at all definitely good show that smoke I think hmm so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna keep these boards loose cuz I need some smoke oh yeah I'm gonna enjoy these and Emmalyn do let these babies cure for in around 30 days is about the perfect time and like I said once a week take them out or at the very least take the lid off let them air out for 15 minutes at least once a week and do that for 4 weeks hmm then you will have some perfectly cured top-shelf bullet okay guys I'm gonna finish up mm-hmm join me Dora

sliding flip packed ready to feeling a little faint about that [ __ ] gap we took actually took two I redid the end the [ __ ] whole intro once took a dive [ __ ] we drop the [ __ ] down there and after didn't like the way it looks to do it again we're ready to dams in technically but you guys only saw one now we're going in on the [ __ ] fastball grip for this dirty poison using a beautiful teaching show and glass Blind Melon chitlin [ __ ] also a daily Ripper let's get it guys you can really taste the pine almost [ __ ] sour on the exhale really super [ __ ] dankey it's killing me gays

guys know what time it is it's time to [ __ ] drop that knowledge so we got this dirty poison pure sativa THC levels up to 24% South African Landry's so right off the bat this is where I got confused I've had a land race before I wasn't necessarily sure exactly what the [ __ ] that even meant so I went and I did my research land release is just a way to [ __ ] identify a strain that grows out in one certain place totally naturally delish it legit from Durban in South Africa that's where it was grown that's where it grows naturally today other [ __ ] examples would be like Afghani whatever else you could think of that thank you no it grows in that one location it's adapted to the climates and I even got info on how this [ __ ] made its way into my hands yeah this pure sativa originates from the South African port city of dirt urban in the 1970s an American cannabis activist named ed Rosenthal discovered the original strain in Durban and he brought it back to the US so he actually went out there looking for [ __ ] cannabis seeds he found this Durban poison out in Durban he brought it back and bring that [ __ ] simple but he actually had to go out to Durban to get it that's where the [ __ ] land race comes from like I said the [ __ ] scent I got I got really tiny [ __ ] overtones hearts most [ __ ] incredible look tiny spicy album sweet candy it's [ __ ] intense they need to invent a [ __ ] smell smell vision this stuff is unreal I wish I could just send every single one of you guys a little chunk for this Durban poison I guess get you smelling your smoke gun [ __ ] powerful strain that twenty four percent THC so people [ __ ] love it whether you're just recreational or hear a [ __ ] medical patient it's definitely got it it's got both sides of the spectrum whether you want it or you need it it's for that [ __ ] good we're just gonna be a pack what's up guys so the camera just [ __ ] cut I totally lost my [ __ ] place and everything all I remember is we

smoking along let's get this bum [ __ ] just rippling I'm not sure the brand or anything of it just two crazy little straight to say I said [ __ ] if you guys watch it I'll show you her Lois pickups

the YouTube Watchers even the only ones who are going to get to see that until I [ __ ] pull them out and show them off like crazy which we're going to be doing right away I'm killing myself for not [ __ ] using those things but if we just add this [ __ ] delicious I didn't mention the taste or anything and I'm pretty sure that that's where we were I just talked about the aroma and then the camera cut and then I lost my spot [ __ ] up and now we're back then we're going in on the [ __ ] straight to Franklin [ __ ] super daily driver everyday Ripper had it for years hopefully you guys are smoked along if that's the case that's the [ __ ] that's going to be the third bar second down so since its appears to team up [ __ ] hits hard with a strong head high great for creativity outdoor [ __ ] activities you feel energized you feel focused [ __ ] a wonderful strain all-around effective for treating depression anxiety chronic pain nausea so of course it's got medical benefits like all others but it comes down to the select few I gotta say we've got a few [ __ ] longer already tastes amazing smells amazing [ __ ] looks amazing I gotta say I love it I highly recommend it [ __ ] super unique strain you guys can ever get your hands on it snaps that show so this is gonna be our [ __ ] final blogger going back over the Blind Melon chitlin can you see it you guys watching get it [Music]", "I_Kff_1jWeM": "i'm just uh checking out my greasy grapes with the lights off i just turned them off for a second so i can look at them this one had bent over so i guess it got too heavy and i had to tie this green thing on it to hold it up but as y'all can see it's nice let me get a closer shot and this was another one that bent over up on me get a little closer he's got about two more weeks then they'll be at the ninth week that's all he getting but it looks good that's all the greasy grape well this one is the ice cream cake this one got about uh four more weeks this no this is the this is the ice cream cake yeah they got four more weeks this is the g3 it got three more weeks gonna let it go to eight weeks uh the durban poison this one got until next thursday and it'll be coming down just giving y'all an update on them well i was supposed to be making a video tomorrow giving y'all an update on all of them so i guess that's what what this one to be but as y'all can see they are looking real good this is how he's looking the ice cream cake looking good the durba i mean this is the g3 strain back to durban which would be coming down next thursday not this coming thursday but next thursday just today is monday nice fat colas on here these are big ass nudes right here okay y'all that's the end of the video i gotta turn my light back on i just flushed this big one right here with uh 15 gallons of water i know i gotta do more than that but i did it like that so i can uh uh for the last two weeks i'm just gonna feed the water and that [ __ ] just about take care of it hold on one second let me turn my light back on okay i just turned it back on i guess i got to warm up first but there you go in my next grow i'm going to be doing some zookeys across between girl scout cookies and garu gorilla glue number four i got the invasion already so hopefully they'll be big enough once these are done to come in here and i'm sorry i still ain't made a video of my other tent i got two plants in there and guess what i finally got my spider former sf4 thousand i didn't even make an unboxing video because i was so eager to set it up and i had took my other leds off of it and put that sf4 thousand and immediately the plants was reacting better to the sf4000 than they were with my other led i had so that's a good thing so so far that sf4000 gets uh thumb up thumbs up so yeah everything's looking good so far i just fed uh my other tank yesterday last night because with that sf4 thousands uh own over is drinking up i mean drawing i mean is it drying up the water or is the plants just eating more but i fed them two days prior and then the dirt was already dry so i'm gonna have to up my feeding on them to every other day or check them every other day and see because these i did every three days or when i came in and seen that the dirt was dry the pots was light you know that's when i fit these but they are looking good turn my fan back on before i forget because i will forget it'd be mad as hell i have did it before and uh left out fed him or did something made a video and forgot to turn the fan back on and come up here hours or a day later and realize i didn't turn on the fan not under this big light yeah i know it would have killed them you know but up under my old led i did it before so there you go let me spin out a little bit there we go so i don't know if you watched my last video and uh how they was looking on my last video i can't tell if they grew any bigger but uh they are looking nice they are looking nice this one today had no the uh ice cream cake today had made its fifth week and that week five them nugs are huge for week five so hopefully they'll be looking like these right here or those in the back uh at week seven so we'll see i can't even stop the video because i'm just amazed on how good they looking and everything like that but i have no choice i gotta vacuum the rest of that water at the bottom of my uh greasy grapes because like i said i just flooded them i mean flushed them even though they got three weeks left i still flushed them you know you know my durvan poison i seen that the the leaves start yellowing i took a wild guess and said it needed some cow mag and i also gave it some epsom salt a teaspoon per gallon and you know i've been using my cool bloom and stuff like that but that's cool and cool bloom it plays a big part in them but he's a real big part i ordered me a dry hanging that thing i got a hook that uh started hanging there moving some stuff around in here so i can hang it i don't know if i'm just going to trim my stick that's my baby she in here she screaming to see her daddy but uh her mama took her from me hey get my cigarette out the bathroom but i'm gonna end this video y'all i hope y'all like what y'all see uh like comment and share uh thanks spider farmer for finally sending my lights so far i am pleased with them uh i'm sure i am going to make a video um with them plants today i promise you i'm gonna make it today uh my lights come back on at six so remind me send me a message around six o'clock to remind me because i'd be so busy with stuff working and humping and all that type of stuff you know so on that note mickey wiggy out of here", "bFmCP57FTxU": "so back to the gotalk wit sativa bye stay medicated this is a good one that learned from right ear man I usually only grow strains dominant and in the cuffs when I got this plant to a larger size I figured out it is a very sativa which I have no practice with I'm currently looking for some advice because this plant is in weak set or seven weeks in the flower according to the research I've done I know they can grow well sort of 12 weeks the pH is right Neutrik nutrients are measured lights are 3,500 K I want to know if the buds look normal or is this plant essentially a waste of time that plant looks weirdly in looks like a haze almost oh yeah it does but if the leaves don't look so good guys we're looking at a plant with real thin family who's coming out of a real wispy bud in general for seven weeks in the flower yeah and that's a big plant but I mean you're definitely a I don't know I get respect for you looking at your setup as far as your grow man it looks like you did spend a lot of time on that thing to get very little out of it unfortunately yeah well he didn't did he say what him going for genetics I think nobody hooked him up any city didn't know to it was just that it was a sativa right there guys we're looking at this plant likes the pit look picture of the whole plant you're right Scotty like this bud it's a beautiful grow setup nice trellis and everything like that the sativa stuff like you definitely could have trained this canopy out a little better you could have done some I don't know what man there is a torn of tops on that canopy it's just the wrong variety and that's yeah through it is top of the variety but when growing sativas do be ready for knowing to train more he said you have a limited ceiling knowing when to top or top like sometimes if I do I know this plant stretches like crazy so I'm a top it you know to like not two feet sometimes depending on the size of the plant down like eight days before flower which I know sounds aggressive but if everything's rocking right for the certain strain it would work so you got to know the techniques or you can throw a sativa dominant like eight week or eight or nine weeks train yeah I just want to end by saying it's important to know your strains it's important to know what you're working with kind of going back to that auto flower thing that I was talking when you have experience like he was an experienced guy indica grower and yeah I'm just looking at all the different strings even look at this one I got bunk that not bunked out but maybe bunked out this is my wedding cake right here little popcorn buds man this is my flow right here and I mean which one's more fun than grow so that totally depends maybe the popcorn buds are they dense I thought popcorn doesn't I don't know right I'm just okay my point is that you gotta know you're strange you gotta be able to talk to other people like seats here now I'll give a shout out those guys are always cool when you get something from them it's vetted he's not gonna bother to get a whole bunch of seeds and push out a whole season for him yeah they're gonna piss people off he's got to be growing Bank man anyway I just think be really careful as you as you select your strains if you want to grow a sativa go find one that's gonna work for you man they've got plenty out there that are eight nine ten weeks of TVs they're [ __ ] crazy in there your frame work with some of the breeders too I'll just to give an example they give a lot of information we talked about on the show Duke diamond luckily yep he's been in studio a few times lives in Colorado we've had the opportunity to develop a little bit of a friendship there but he put stunning information on his packs and as far as seats here now is over on the YouTube comments i won of this post what Steve said here he goes seeds here now is number one lol I've had one transaction with them and my seeds took two days to arrive I called an ass about the freebie with my order and my other seeds and they were there two days later eighteen of eighteen popped which is awesome that's obviously not a guarantee but they do have man if you have a problem with your [ __ ] call them up and that's one reason we recommend them and don't forget coupon code dude ten yes dude 10 at seeds your now we'll hook you up I recommend because they deliver but beans a good guy he's part of our crew he totally gets what we're doing he jumped up to support us man so I'm all day you see just the other flip side of this is we have seen a fair amount of grow talk dank nugs in different things throughout the years whereas like just a bag seed check this [ __ ] out but man I have to shoot it is a crapshoot I agree and if I take all that time and money to power my lights and effort to be in the grove and all I don't know what I'm doing yeah invest fifty a hundred bucks I'm having really solid genetics that you can work with and build on", "R8v7IQXN0rk": "this insane glass grenade is actually holding an 8 gram joint hi friends welcome to that high couple where

strength Durban OG is a sativa dominant hybrid and it's Durban poison cross with og cush so two really wonderful strains in this and this is a great day time medication wonderful way can be and I was I was able to wake you make with this I hit this midday if this in the evening and also right before bed and it was good the whole entire day except before bed because it's energetic kind of kept me up for a couple of hours but it's energetic its uppity it's very um upbeat and think it's a pretty positive vibe you get with this and to put you in a good mood its euphoric you're very happy and one of the things I like about this is it's a really good strain for if you have to go to work if you have things to do whether it's crafting or cleaning house or cooking or working on the computer video game whatever it is you're very focused you're very in tuned and involved in what you're doing time seems to just go on weave around you you don't really pay attention to it you're very caught up in what whatever it is that you're doing it's creative it's very wonderful for your daytime smoke the only things I could find wrong with this was that there is crash with this and there's also munchies and cottonmouth so you might want to keep an eye on that have a bottle of water which you just to kind of keep things comfortable and that's just about it but the crash that comes with this isn't even hard course it's small kindness client it's like if you've got strong willpower you can get through it there's no problem but if you don't have the willpower to fight through the naps all you do is just hit this again because it is energetic and it kind of takes you right back up so if you start to get a thought you throughout the day took it up a bit you know it'll put you back on your feet this is a really wonderful tasting strain it's almost like a fruity herbal tea it's a very sweet earthy taste to it and the earth in the sweetness is like a fruity very sweetness so it's it's really Pleasant really great a really good social smoke if you've got like friends over and stuff then you kinda wanna keep the conversation flowing and the by I'm happy really wonderful strange so yeah I would definitely get this again and I put this up from health for life so it's good stuff", "7uY6FK8hCvc": "sup guys doing another 420 update here the other day we did a video on that durban poison

know how many days yeah y'all could see that right there finally come up last night that's the durban boys are not there so we'll definitely keep y'all updated as this little thing grows I just want to let y'all know it finally surface so now the growing really starts don't forget to Like comment subscribe", "2s_vCm0vbxo": "but I got that [ __ ] bag on the aisle story at the [ __ ] bag hey instead of making a regular video where the cameras facing me the whole time I'm gonna turn it around and make a point of view video because I figured for weed you guys probably wanted to see like the bud more than you guys want to see my face and just be talking you know sometimes they'll come in packaging where you can't even see this part you know so you guys want to know where you're getting you guys want to know this smell the taste heart breaks down stuff like that so I have a list I'm gonna give you guys like a 1 to 10 scale and at the end give you guys like an overall rating and yes go based off of that just in case you're wondering also I'm gonna give you guys my price but of course my price is gonna be different than your guys's just because mine is gonna be way lower than most of you guys I'm not sure there's too many other dispensaries that have the precious I have around here I've seen these go for like 35 bucks 40 bucks I got this [ __ ] for $23 anyways don't flip the camera around start a first person you angle see how this works alright guys so this is the first point of view angle feels kind of weird doing this and the reason I don't like doing this is because it really kind of blocks my view of [ __ ] because I had to have the phone so close to my face but I'll move this [ __ ] away alright here we have the Grizzly Peak gelato number 45 indica so just to start off and give you guys like a little 360 view of the jar just you guys know how it looks like all around all right here on this side this is premium indoor flower and this company is based out of Oakland California so I explains like the brazier here on the front usually preak Grizzly Peak and breaks the power of gelato number 45 in the code with the bear claw on top right here has seals cut that open I can't get downloading but let me break the seal real quick I'm gonna say you guys look right here on the right so you guys know I always say for the people out there there are you legal states this one's for you that was a pretty weak ass shield but you guys got it holy [ __ ] all right hopefully you guys ain't seen my hair cuz I should have [ __ ] up but I just realized that here we had to July bro 45 honestly it says indoor Chicago with like greenhouse can't lie damn that [ __ ] like it night guys got a bit of liquid it looks like and me for $23 I cannot complain a dub for Neath if some crazy-looking [ __ ] that pictures you guys saw in the beginning of the video or if I haven't put in the beginning of the video the picture I put now this was $23 and to be honest in that patient it looked a lot more crazy but 423 books I'm not like disappointed you know [ __ ] so stamps stems are huge so that's what makes me think it's BRE house but I mean unless they're just some okay going in door but sure that God not but I mean this is like new house to me all right as far as let's go the first thing I'm gonna judge I'm gonna give the packaging a solid nine out of ten just because it was $23 and usually most companies when they get to that low of a price they won't give you a glass jar you know it's kind of plain it's cool how they have all the designs around and they have his little window so you can see the bud there's a huge sticker down here sometimes there's no window and you can't see [ __ ] in there so I like how they designed around this little window so you still see your bud before you buy which means you know they're not ashamed of the [ __ ] they're growing and as far as trichomes go you guys can see for yourself there's a good amount on there and there's a good amount of hairs and prep also so it's a good mixture of all three I'm all three i'ma give them a solid nine or eight and a half guys I'm not gonna lie to you I'm judging this off of greenhouse okay I'm not gonna judge this off an indoor because to be I'm like come on let's be honest here this is not look like indoor like and once you feel it this is not for like indoor feels like greenhouse so this really is indoor they're not tripping but I'm judging this off the greenhouse and not for density these are pretty dense nuts even these small guys are pretty you know filled up I was if you see buddy it breaks down cool as far as density goes guys I'm gonna give this a solid nine I'm gonna just break up a nug with my fingers you see kind of how it breaks down for the people I mean I use a grinder most of the time that black one that I have right there but for the people that use their fingers I'm gonna go ahead and do that for you guys and like I said these are some pretty dense legs and not gonna buy this batch feels a little bit wet - OH you guys saw it firsthand but [ __ ] seed some [ __ ] seed breath the seed so that I my damn you saw that breath some people so for some people has gonna be a really big turn-off and they do not like seeds in there but but honestly it doesn't really remind me as much funny is that as I was mentioning that the butt is a little bit wet this he literally popped out but now all that's really left is to taste the bud and gave you guys my final review so I'm gonna just break down the bud spark it up and give you guys the final conclusion so I just broke down the bud with the grinder and one thing I noticed when I broke out the foot is that it comes out really really fluffy so for the people that have smoked back was just like that I'm not sure this is too much good but to be rolling with because it's not sticky but you forget that rolling backwards I guess I should be no problem right he tugs down I broke up some baby legs and I'm right in the line gave me a good amount of weed that compared to this one 1/4 paper gave me a good amount nice to have some last night so I wish I had to scale with me but I don't have one so I couldn't like BC not how much they really give us I'm pretty sure it's always on the table I'm pretty sure he's never hooked up but not in life sometimes it just feels like they'd be giving me four grams 4.5 that's crazy man like what's one company that hooks it up a lot Dom primo yeah they give you a lot of but I don't know if it's just like seems like it's a lot but every time I buy from them they always seem to give me like a good we I always wrote like three extend those or like to extend those and like a regular joint such like that you know like it gives me a good amount of wheat for a that lease but yeah just want to note that it was a little bit fluffy when I broke it down not it's a bad thing but that's also another thing to know when we're doing we do you know so yeah she's willing to join up came out pretty good this but was pretty easy to roll I was gonna be cuz usually it was sticky but it's a lot easier just great just because it catches up with this up you know and the kind of rolls by itself almost can't lie huh for $23 pretty sick cops definitely made me watch how Martha strain so I'm gonna be reviewing this more you have some pretty cool flavors the one I want to try is called wildlife that's that [ __ ] sounds fire but I'm talking it review that next actually I'll get like a quarter next time so I heard you like two new strains the THC percentage on this by the way was like around 19% or I think it says 20% over here but yeah it says 20 almost 21% 20.9 on this I said 19% so now did you go to spark this up and let you guys know how it tastes I'll show you guys like the ash leaves and all that and yes alright so I'm gonna just parked the joint up real quick give you guys a little review at the beginning of the joint so you guys can know how it taste taste compared to to smell stuff like that yeah maybe this video will make you go up there and copy worse today now - he's good yep smooth yeah so far as eating why - guys like pretty foot away so they guys have the ash it's pretty white there's like a little bit of black in there but I married a very very very little so far tastes [ __ ] amazing this is some real [ __ ] gelato right here I am only like a quarter of the way through headcheese but smell [ __ ] crazy when spark get up tastes even crazier [ __ ] what else do you want man price $23 buy two of these for under $45 a little bit over $45 - big 46 47 dollars with the change no buy yourself an ounce for 188 dollars looking at this for like three weeks now and I just been debating on company and when I went to go get those two cars Lydia [ __ ] you might as well try you know if this caught for sure but if you want to get more so I'm gonna be trying out more flavor so be expecting a a lot more videos of this company so I'm gonna just end the video there no he would often the good note do I recommend this [ __ ] here the most I would pay for this about $40 that's like half of my comfort zone just because I was probably how much you guys would pay and that's how much I would imagine it goes to 43035 around there yeah if it's anything under 40 for sure cop and don't really I'm saying anything over 40 just because at that point you could cop something like her over you know yeah guys is gonna be the end of the video i'll play some unreleased playable kardi for the end of the song - started

good stuff that's where that's what everybody's looking for right there is those nice trichome organically you know what I mean you can see the crystals on my fingers which is always a good sign how's the feed going sleepy if you don't mind me asking bro can you see it alright or am I too zoomed in or you can set that down there and see if you guys can get a better look at it yeah I know I know some people say it's great some people say it's glitchy it's weird you know well not as fantastically grown cannabis I would say guys end up like I said big shoutouts to this this is a Teva so we might get a little bit of energy from this I actually have Durbin poison seeds but an auto flower what's up Kate Magnus thank you so much for tuning in and hopefully if your plant as dark as this did it look as dark as this because I you know every grows a little different everybody does it a little bit different I would assume that where it's grown you know the in Colorado here you know it might be a little different looks good to me guys I say we pop it in Yoda and smoke it what do you guys say much baked we'll get put cannabis in pipe we must and smoke it we will alright guys I'm looking a fatty here guys there's a big little stem in there someone to take that out once I get bear with me guys big shout out some mixed up calm guys don't forget to like and share them on Facebook guys if you guys are around I know that it's sleepy I know that you guys have heard this story a million times guys but please you know get your friends and family involved guys get to know your people and spread the message about cannabis and cannabis entertainments crystal poling I can't see you thank you so much for tuning in to this live feed and we're doing a little strain review for the guys

out that if you're in the 50 to 80 I'm gonna swing around here and put you guys back up okay so real sorry I'll remember that and so we are smoking some of that Durban boys and it's gonna be absolutely yummy I I would imagine so that's right what do you guys say if this would be the time if we were Facebook live and right now that people would be like flooding it with love guys and you guys would just be packing that bowl right now but you know what YouTube doesn't have that option so let's just go ahead and throw a few comments up there guys and I see it how many people we can maybe get into here I know the inviting and I know it's a little different guys but maybe we can get a few people in here I'm shocked it's a little but people already know this start just sleeping mokosh man big shout out said everything that you guys do man I love that you stopped in brother man give cannabis guys when I smoke cannabis I don't know if you guys get this but sometimes it hits me right here I don't know if you guys know that feeling it's kind of like you know like you get that a more relaxing I'm sure you could pull a bigger hint and caught it it's not as dry as normal buds would be in Colorado which is a good sign which means they just cured them right which means they're grown right and means they put a little bit more love into it California or Colorado peers are a lot different than California peers yeah they're a little wet you know what I mean sargent sleeping my cush man you know about that I'm sure down there and Florida dude you're probably getting hit with that kind of sticky moist weed and Colorado usually it's pretty dry so it's nice for a change not to get all dry super dry bud and and just rip through it you know Yoga definitely helps with the dropping effect with the cannabis as well you know with the pipe that you put it in for me personally the way that it hits too because some pipes are really rough some pipes are really tough you know and Yoda is a smooth pipe man you just got to get used to it it pulls a little thicker than most people because this holds a lot of smoke so you got to remember that and get to know your pieces as well I feel like when smoking flour me personally guys and I don't know about you guys I like a nice smooth cannabis taste where it's rich it's just like you just you can tell I was been harsh lately I'm not sure but why I've noticed that I choked more than I used to choke dude it you know people might be spraying their plants or doing something crazy on them you never know dude it's it's hard out there because you guys don't have dispensaries and that's the number one thing that we're trying to do with the ganja lovers can attainment that support recreational and medical use guys so you guys can go in there and get it you know and youtubers right now if your YouTube in for the first time onto the guns lovers page guys hippie Komets it's kind of a late night review guys the Durbin poison

world I have never filmed my expeditions because of course it was almost a secret and it's time to show the world how we start from scratch how does a seed company should work and where does he obtained his stuff that is grown outside that's why we decided to go to all different regions to show where the original Malawi gold comes from [Music] [Applause] how are you yeah very good this isn't a good care of a sir Malhar is a very very special African country I guess what makes it special is the wildlife the beautiful scenery but most importantly the people it's one of the poorest countries in the world I think it's the number in the top 20 of the HRD P which is the highly indebted poor countries also very friendly country they marketed as the warm heart of Africa one of the reasons that I already for a long time wanted to visit Malawi is that I grew up in Africa and I'm a strain hunter and I know that one of the best sativas grow in Malawi [Music] an expedition like this especially Malawi is only possible with four-wheel drive cars because it's rainy season it range between two and four hundred mils a month I am I had I think 25 phone calls and 15 emails with the manager of a measly long-wear and in the end we arrived at the airport and instead of it Toyota Hilux 4x4 they gave me the Corolla the long walk the longest walk the old weeks for nothing we get a one and a half to two hours walk program officially we start walking we get to the first location we find the group that is supposed to guide us to the second location and on the way we start discovering that the two hours are becoming three the flat side area is that where it is and the three hours are becoming four is it up the top or in west work all the way down to the rhythm and the heels are getting steeper and steeper and steeper look the most important thing to know is that if you are not sure about something you have to let us know tell us we take you're not sure it's fine but don't let us think it's one hour and then after one hour it's another 45 minutes and then after 45 minutes it's another hour and a half because it doesn't work so watch the whole day the walk was like longer than six seven hours and we had to go back in the dark and we did it make it sometimes that's what it takes it can't always go good sometimes you have to just keep walking for nothing [Music] good morning this is Franco I'm waiting I'm part of the crew that he's waiting for this to four-by-four sir city and how high are the plant high in the second day we started driving and meet a very very old contact of me called Isaac he brought us to a really tiny tiny village high up in the mountain and you set up for a while talk to the local people made our connection see this plant this plant here is ganja plug John it's his plan the minty one the minty one yes in a sativa and then we only had to walk 500 meters down into the bush and there was a huge huge field of five six hectares in Malawi [Music] yeah [Music] Sammis coke man we find your stop make [Music] [Music] some serious really the size of the crystals short Shyamalan unbelievable no it's marvelous this is very good this generation to catch a sheet now you don't see this in Africa normally so many Russian on the plans how many people you need for this to work because there's a lot of work 15 people you have from the village to clear all the weeds and that field really impressed me because it was for me the first time that I had the chance to see the Malawi Gold growing in such a scale so I could really see many special characteristics of the plants on a big scale on a good volume for statistical watch this is monkeys don't eat heavier and gets told it's funny and the baboons is a problem they take a lot or because I can see everywhere a little bit baboon dementia they then they make party if you go into an area like Malawi and you meet a lot of people you see grows for 20 years you see grows for 10 years and she grows for one or two years most of the time they are a little bit scared and not allowed to say to you from the family or the community how long they grow as a straight hunter you really have to make sure that you know who is doing what because often you can see that the not so good grower is also the guy who hasn't obtained the very good seats too gross next year crop dramas in Malawi are very resourceful people they are very poor people there are people who have used everything they can to maintain their family and the children there is one why the quote marker is that this coke yeah it is rare just like code you can't find it in other way or another can and this with just a little you can take much man that words makes them good growers the need for survival these guys don't know nothing they don't know to speak English almost but they know things about the plants that are pretty amazing did you ever try to be fertilizer to the plant yeah that the talk all the users fertilizer yeah some of them are already so advanced they actually pull their mails some of them are so advanced that they actually know they have two phenotypes in their field even if they don't know the meaning of the word phenotype in English hey when did you plan this when did you plant anywhere between 20 January and when you harvest May May 20 May 4 months yeah so you for most of harvest you can", "xqgGSQRkzuY": "what's going on people what's your boy captain crush beard with today's straining today today I will be reviewing this wonderful Durbin poison this is the last of it the last of the last of the last this is the last that I had from Tacoma wellness this stuff is sitting at about 26% so I'm really excited to try this so this is a hand rolled I rolled this those of you that know me know my arthritis is horrible and makes it so I have great difficulty doing this so what I've been using is strain-specific RSO and that has done wonders for my arthritis so I was able to hand roll again hand roll a perfect cone blunt cannabis has really done wonders for me but I'll also say is that those of you I think that I am just some you know stone half-dead party Punk not the case I take care of my body in many ways one of them being I have IBS subsequent to my PTSD so what does that mean that means at any time I eat anything I bloat like a whale anytime I'm stressed my face puffs up my stomach puffs up i bloat and I canti because basically what I what I say I'm full on stress so what have I been doing as of late so as of late I've been drinking this got your attention now right so these are chia seeds that I have puffed with some hot water and then I stir them until I make sure that the consistency as you can see is not clumping it's almost like a syrupy consistency right and I stir the heck out of that until it cools down just a little bit so it needs to be warm to drink and then I drink this every morning I've been doing this for about a week now I do this because again I have really bad IBS and PTSD bloat that I get in my stomach to where I can't eat meals at a time sometimes a couple days at a time so I drink to you seeds believe me it works my little buddy trying to protect me as I said Aaron's mower so I'm gonna talk about day absolutely nothing I slept all right hello thank you handsome I appreciate the protection I don't need it though this fool anyway having that said that's sparking lovely already I probably won't even need a smoking old thing I'll probably smoke a third of this and be good Durbin poison so Durbin poison is an excellent strain for me it's one of my top five not because it gets me suited because it gets me moving excuse me those of us that have dealt with serious injuries shouldn't say serious I'm still gonna stand those of us that have dealt with injuries to our back are spying our musculoskeletal system our knees or ankles deal with arthritis deal with dealing with the chronic pain I've found this is like instant [ __ ] it all it allows me to realize okay I have [ __ ] that I need to get done I realize that I'm in pain or I might be this is going to help alleviate some of that so that I can be productive so this is my get [ __ ] done strength day yesterday we got a chance to venture outside of DC for an afternoon and an evening and I got to go see Amish country I grew up near Amish country so it wasn't much of a feat for me but it was pretty fun for my wife for her sister so for my sister-in-law and my niece and nephew so we got to enjoy that and then we got the drive home last night and come back to DC where I can medicate but what I've noticed is the entourage effect more so as of late since I've switched to the strain-specific RSO and what I mean by that as I'm using RSO that is strain specific I'm gonna go ahead and say that again so I'm getting like Girl Scout cookie ara so I'm getting well they're not calling it that because it can't be burner you know it's not not proprietary or whatever so what form cut cookies or whatever they call it Mara so I'm getting I'm trying to find some like really really heavy indica RSO now I'm working on trying to find one that I can blend into my own edibles for me at night so I'm still searching anybody have any insight I'd be really happy to you were yet to say but you know I don't have much else to do I got to talk to a couple professors today to make sure that they've gotten the information from my DRC to know that I in fact do you have disabilities I'm not making this [ __ ] up and I need concessions made so that I can get my schoolwork done other than that I'm gonna making my chia seeds yeah skis I'm tricking my chia seeds and just enjoying the music from the birds this morning y'all take care stay safe keep it legal y'all one love all right take care", "yzjpObllRvQ": "we're away welcome hey babies today on green light we're going to talk about the origin of strains like this one where are you from she's not talking where are you from she's not talking luckily we have an expert we've heard about sativas and indicas and people are starting to I think yet kind of the basic idea so now we're taking it another stuff and like where do these come from and how did we know we basically kind of have to go backwards in time to figure out where they come from sativas are usually kind of from the equatorial regions in because it's literally because of India you know the Hindu Kush region like where r OG Kush and Hells Angel originated from it's like taking your own family tree and be like this is grandma and who's grandpa people use different strains for different things so some people might use an OG Kush to make a plant more weighty or they might add in a tangerine for flavor it's like genetically creating the perfect baby exactly yeah just our little girls here oh hi little girl gotta keep him happy she's so smart that's what she said--oh smart she's a brainiac she's a brainiac brains are chunky cherry malawi uh what does he carry malawi yes yeah like an ice cream or something yeah yeah this one is actually an amalgam of about six different strains and you almost get even the savory node of like a cherry pie crust out of it yeah when it's cured up it's really interesting we do have strains such as our durban poison which is selective Roland race where electively yeah it's basically where they had a batch of durban poison or basically local strains from south africa and they took the best phenotypes and basically put them together to make durban poison you are getting very nerdy and scientific silent I kind of like it okay so this is a durban poison right very popular yeah I mean about it why it's so popular I think it's really affect you know it's a really really clear headed sativa test high in a THC V which is basically just another compound achieve seeing a different shape that actually can like suppress your appetite a little bit a lot of people believe that they all make you hungry yeah so that's not true not true so now we've learned about the origin of strains Nick you're yes your boards have mine and he's humble you're watching green light I'm Aaron we'll see you next time", "ecn7WXiZjG4": "okay I'm back I kind of shut that off well it was a close-up I broke the butt up and there's kind of a real good close-up and see all the crystals in there hope so that one job but yeah it's pretty good really crystal e so there's one little one and you know gets a few more up here for you so like I said there's the orange chairs deeply I'm fine now and there's other ones that are kind of white crystal II and it's really strange so pretty so there's the Leafs that kind of a dark color to it once again so crystallize so that's one on to another one so here we go with the what I call green yes or more yellow but definitely nice so and here's the purplish black color and I was talking about there's an awful lot of this purple I also got the strain one time called purple Urkel and it looked just like this oh not lesbian Durbin poison south african strain I'm not sure it'll research much history of that but I guess I'd there's those dark colors that guy's one down another one here yeah it was so nice don't you look at that wow just amazing you see the shiny crystals Wow its flipped over the others like that I kind of push it up in there okay let's get one more then let it be so this is a big one and kind of see the stem where I picked off the other ones so let's try to get in closer cursing it too much say here it's kind of a picture of the leaves may be okay we're grins to the tip of it there it is I see all the twists it up a little more chairs there and there you go different poison close up I'll show you what a mess I'd meat to the poor thing so there it is there blue poison from Silver State relief thank you", "i8hUpYuT0rM": "[Music] [Music] so what I'm going to do with these here is I'm going to be taking the tops and then the bottom ones ripen up a little bit so it's my second harvest on this land lies our prescription drug coverage to get the benefits you deserve call the medicare cover jump line no Joe named private call the secondary's going for a bike ride today got one bud down helmet size the simple layout of disease the belts second pressure student and media it looks like it has done some kind of apparatus on the back for the day it's my morning snow these two and see how far along with trichomes are I never did that yet it's very hot it's very humid you wear a lot of clothes the idea that they would wear some sort of ceremonial clothes exactly like having pressurized a something is who we got here perhaps something worst of all time left in Japan and was very everywhere in the red from dust created 12 figures as [Music] [Music] [Music] this German poison strain right here is really awesome people because it's a powdery mildew resistant to mold and mildew resistance [ __ ] asses there a truth that to me with people's about the exact nature of them we burn with extraterrestrial reserves and secondaries that would normally be like popcorn [ __ ] what up armament Patriot pain farms with a crypto roger going Michigan I smoked some Durbin and awesome can't fire a couple weeks ago it was probably disturbed and poison but the top colas welcome to the stream Duane Milne made some during one of my favorite year for sure there's already a harvest and then top colas and then we took them to Camp Palooza and sold some we smoked tons of it and this is the plan that was left and right now we're come down or secondary taking some of the station work on based on years research I was outside picking off release trip in the big book but started raining so there's all these positive enhancer I should've been out there getting so much [ __ ] you know so I just inside this morning Gary I'm going to collect pollen one more time say that's why I'm hoping it rains actually then I collect this pollen one more time and then down the mail plane so what I'm gonna do here is I got the secondary Harvey's going on with these little secondaries and [ __ ] little harder buds and stuff and then I'm gonna do a third virus on the ones that are left and then anything left on the plan I'm gonna send it into rematch no be a whole bunch of little tiny buds and [ __ ] left on here someone sent us all back in the rebate and then keep this plant growing and for as long as I possibly can we got cuts and stuff like that but I just want to do a little project with this specific plan Robert Burton pretty sure territory yeah they can't fire with dope I just posted some of the footage I had I was really really really wasted it's bonfire so I didn't get too much footage so I got enough I missed a lot of the people singing yes do ruins good the durbin I took there probably wasn't quite as mature as this one he's here because this one on so I cut down Durbin on July 8th or August 8th I mean and then I brought it to the to the can include the right so this one has been growing since the 8th the secondaries see that wasn't even cured or not and it could be so much better so I'm going to cross this drain with the Afghani the pure indica UFO researchers or to see what we come up with and you want many consider to be the oldest civilization of the Americas the open located 170 miles west of belated need the Gulf of Mexico that people fly but so I have this little teeny tiny tiny bit of the golden poison laughs I think I'm gonna smoke it today with you guys on your men that's why I've got enough you know you might think it's kind of a waste you let it grow a little bit but that's my second year we found sad thing is what it is well if I would have known about the dirty poison trust me it would be a monster playing outside right now be anything as I could possibly have his mother's like just a lot of cool fall colors going on though their culture there was a priestly caste they knew the earth was round you guys here's like to be heard you can see people mysteriously they love the planet researchers believe these she went to space as ancient art oh my fur monster and extinct but it actually big anticipation which I really wanted to do we church though on Sunday morning at that bonfire browse to wasted researchers disagree like weird monsters exactly respond [ __ ] tons of [ __ ] minutes they have elevators little fairly shaped little Betty would have new new growing monsters on this one in sauce they'd flower time but you know when you do this second you can do two or three harvests and [ __ ] and then reinvent your plant right so what you gotta do is you you fede fede fede fede fede right and then you harvest your top once you do your flush and then you harvest your top Colin's you know the ones that are all stick in the ones that are all sticking up real tall and fat right and cut all those off and then this can be normally like your popcorn [ __ ] real fluffy larkey right but then what you do is after you cut those top colors off while you're processing we dry it you feed this pitch again you feed it your flower new insects and then these start getting chunky and harder it's you know they may or may not get big and fast but on they will get harder and not Murphy and then you can choose when to pick them you know so on the secondaries I wanted to wait like two or three weeks you know I'm saying and check the trichomes you know kept forgetting the chats check the trichomes but they're right now they're probably like 50 or 60 percent amber so there should be some pretty strong [ __ ] hopefully this does but yeah you got to feed it and then flush it again and then harvest and then feed it again and then get the other little baby ones to start growing could be polluted man's interpretation and then flush it again and then harvest it again it's fun little process fun little game it is the earliest known representation of the feathered circles god-like figure known to both the all my furniture and my 19 is the picture of a warrior wearing a helmet and he's with this feather burnished would you know he's awesome on America and the fact that he has that little kids maybe what that's symbolizing is this person is adopted after all for investigators however Monument is regarded as evidence suggesting that there really was contact with UFOs in the ancient past monument 19 at levente shows what many people believe is a representation of a human figure in a spaceship of some sort yeah there's one seems to be machinery it really does look like something that's being constructed I think the fairly normally these these ones here would be tiny little [ __ ] bugs down here they're not massive or anything like that but you do get more for what you had breathing here definitely not anything flew to the Olmec would have been better this is sort of bird so again it appears that they're exactly what they saw which is a pilot of a feathered serpent an aircraft high-altitude aircraft spacecraft listen yes you have oblique or one of these pressurized suits according to UFO researchers the idea that ancient people that imagined a travel scenario as a requirement of protection is significant evidence in and of itself is secondary is someplace different so now if I undergo a season or a greenhouse I would try to do this outside where ancient civilization under saying where you can move all Harvest a couple times like in Cali they can do it and stuff like that but our weather changes pretty fast up here on us so I won't be able to do it she got nice and purple thanks outside experience I was okay we were just the only problem was you know we paid a lot of money for things that we did not get that was the problems that no other net there is no animosity or sudden anything like that you saw us at right next to all the people can't please us it was always good you know I'm saying it was just in the end we had a lot of people coming from a lot of different states made people's coming all the way from Massachusetts that paid a lot of money to come there and you know do their thing in first of all the people that didn't show up that's not anybody's fault but you know we can maybe do a better nicer but uh you know just the whole point and like you pay all this money and you make a deal and then the deals that we made and kept like we kept communicating you don't say and we kept communications up we visited with you know the people a couple times and and everything always stays the same except for when we arrived when we arrived we did not get the things that were promised to us for the money we spent and that hurt a lot of people that came from so far hey you know I'm saying it hurt a lot of people her everybody because it was like man we just got like our dick stomped in the dirt the event was cool oh the event was nice I had a good time I think my people had a good time I was just you know in the end it was just you know when you make a deal you should get what you paid for it or not well yeah it was cool other than that though dope time we all had a real good time you know we got to be together and hang out together we all went to the cup - Donna Clio and we all got together for that event also but only one of us had a beast and the booth wasn't big enough read your text after your lackeys is important article book but we all went to the cop and then we decided we're going to go to the Detroit cop but and we're like oh let's go to camp Palooza so we went there and we all decided to go there only so you want those now big mugs yeah there's no hard feelings though I mean it basically it goes on Michigan German states you know I'm saying everyone's gonna come down this you gotcha mid-space because we were the ones that held that for our peoples you know I mean so that's the only only kind of issue but hopefully all the people that were there understand and know what's going on we're on the same page it's not a big deal it was our first actual event that we had all had booze we all had an opportunities we all got the meet people we all got to be involved we all got our names put out there as Michigan's misfits and individually you know what I'm saying I mean look it going Michigan [ __ ] comes in here you know from yeah he [ __ ] the misfits we still had an awesome time you did yeah they [ __ ] us over a little bit but it wasn't that huge of a deal it's just you know it's just a deal's a deal when you shake someone's hand you give them [ __ ] you know twenty would we give them twenty two hundred dollars I mean we expected exactly what we're supposed to yes but you know we don't want to keep griping on the bad [ __ ] you know we don't try we're a cannabis community you know saying we don't try to focus on the negative stuff we try to focus on the good stuff and the good stuff was the difference between the cannabis cups and cantaloup the was there as camping we all got to hang out we all got to chill relax talk we didn't have to feel rushed like at the top speed I felt rushed the whole [ __ ] time even though I was stolen barely even said three words half the time like dude I felt brush everywhere I went it was terrible and can applause gave us an opportunity to AAM's human civilization really told to get with you guys in the future hell yeah we want actually like so Goliath and I I would love to do a cannabis event for ourselves you know Sam and that would be [ __ ] awesome pyramid-like structures I really likes to do that been trying to find I found somebody with a 14 acre property but I really don't know if that would be big enough elven big enough like might be although religious scholars would be the ziggurats really is mostly for spiritual purposes but I want to have a candidates event where it's like where people don't really have to have boots you know you can have a booth if you want to sit down and chill but I want people to just walk around with their [ __ ] bags the [ __ ] weed and be like here's my [ __ ] you want some like old school parties man you don't eat beans that would be dope but you got to find private as property like somebody's yard type [ __ ] yeah we had a great time though other events you know the little mishap stuff I mean it I think we had a great time I know everyone is at that bonfire had a [ __ ] blast like that was a time that we all cherish and we love young okay we were working just for you to be on that way it was always I thought we did that was there just whereas most reputable reapered smoke research oh yeah yeah right the back forty pence is unfortunate like so glide has big property but not that he almonds attached to the back of his house kind of things on there's 42 acres like right next door you know I'm saying is for sale and stuff and we keep trying to like look into buying it but the land would actually need a lot of work like you guys would [ __ ] kill yourselves walking through that place it's all like it's weird it looks like a burn and there's all this like shale like lime like flat rocks like real flat rock everywhere but it's broken up into like billions and zillions of pieces so walking through there is like treacherous man just roll your angles on every [ __ ] thing so that would have to be there you'd actually have 10 bulldozers come in there and cleared out a stupid [ __ ] but yeah trying to find something trying to find some of them B don't beautifully precise some more hanging out an event school and stuff but then you know we had to be somewhere at a certain timing kind of thing you know we had to go do stuff it was fun to actually be involved in do it but man I like to just relax and chill you know and then like a big party like you know how like the electric forest runs right you might have boots or something like that but the people I watched run through the electric forest they didn't really show booths or stuff like that I think it's just like people that run around and have their stuff you know and then you find people and you go hey man can I get some of that you know what I mean that's like the party I'm talking about just a party man we're all just walking around we can have bands come in there can be a cover charge for sure you know it's not like people have to be in a booth and selling anything you know there could be people that they want it to be you know little vendors and stuff that they want to come there and do that but it's like not one of this wouldn't be event like that would be just like hangout kind of camping party big [ __ ] yeah just can't be in Sochi a yeah yep yeah man just camping and hanging out [ __ ] getting high you know people need weed they'll be playing weed smoke but also plenty of things that can be purchased of course because you know it's a it's it's a it's a legal here so just like when we go to these events if you're on private property I mean maybe I should check into more legalities of this but if you're on private property you can [ __ ] seriously like donate your lead to any [ __ ] anybody as long as you're on that private private property that's why we can do it conchal and Cleo and our Clio and we can do that Kenan Palooza you know it's private property you can't just go stand on the street corner and go hey man you me weed you know well you can but you have to have them come back to your house questions yeah I had a really fun time I was more worried about like other people having a good time hounds and the people that would wander around some some of us that were with us they went to sleep kind of early you don't say but that's their schedule you don't mean I don't expect everyone to stay up all the [ __ ] time like I do yeah you know but yeah the people that came out we went to the concerts a couple times and man it was [ __ ] awesome that those bands just all [ __ ] night long and what was kind of cool was you could kind of hear it out of that a pavilion thing but it wasn't like it was rocking all the neighbors you know so that was kind of a cool little different thing secondary's yo is dope though yeah I got an uncle jesse's number from there yeah if I knew can't loser again i won't i won't be doing the food unless it's guaranteed like at least three thousand because that was the only only part though like paying for that preparing for that you know getting everything ready and set up like right now I have gallons and gallons of cannon butter nothing I can do with it you know Sam I mean people can only eat so many edibles around here so that's the only that was the only downfall was just not enough people came to the camp there's nobody's fault in understands maybe though the advertising was enough to fire but you know it is what it is that's again where you take sometimes you know it was not a cannabis cup but it was canvas event rate and coming by weed it figured more people come out but see it's hard it's really hard to do when you know you're in a legal [ __ ] state area and this is all farming up here dude so now all all over the place a lot of places are farming so you know everyone that lives around their gross weed you don't mean so they don't really need to come and get me but I saw that Hustler's going through there you know those people that come up in there they got three or four people standing behind them with bags full of weed and they'll come up and give you that whole hustle about from out of town and I came up here just for this event and I only got twenty bucks to spend but what's funny is if you you know be in Michigan's misfits and said how we sad you've got to hear those people go from booting the boos of ours telling the same [ __ ] spiel you know what I'm saying yeah yeah you can email me my email it was a winter room cousin with smoke fire earlier needs you legal everywhere yeah when it goes legal federally that's when I'm really gonna [ __ ] party because that's you know then they if they make it federal eagle and then limit your plan account that would be [ __ ] dumb but you know I just don't want any kind of any [ __ ] of any job trying to come in my yard and tell me I can't [ __ ] draw a plan that's the stupidest [ __ ] I ever [ __ ] not even they won't come in here guard and say oh you're this big dealer your supply in the whole [ __ ] Northeast Michigan with ganja so they don't say that they come in and say you're growing weed we're cutting it all down and now you're in trouble wait hold on so I'm not as big huge drug dealer by your standards I'm not corrupting anything I'm not tax evading anything on doing and growing a plant and I'm in trouble that's [ __ ] that's [ __ ] I'm sayin [ __ ] out Nora tell ya yeah that's why I went Ohio gets legal oh [ __ ] and you understand I'm from Ohio I know it exactly what's there I know exactly how she runs I know exactly how it works in the underground you know rich in Ohio Oh cousin you got that hurts man you know who I can't wait to come around we had a guy with us white point genetics he get all of that dude and see what he's got because holy [ __ ] he had some bomb-ass read that truffles cute it was blue raspberry truffles oh my god and it fooled me I thought it was Durbin poison I was like that's my Durbin they're like I'm and that's the trouble so I'm like [ __ ] so I gave it back to white point I gave a bold choice and I go you tell me which one is the truffles and then he was like that one's the trouble so I'm like holy [ __ ] I'm like that's crazy I was wild yeah but the UH the stage it cannot Palooza was [ __ ] that was legendary I don't know who put that together I don't know who set it up but that [ __ ] was awesome oh you know what I gotta take a [ __ ] big neither she all right talk about just I was gonna be back in like three minutes where the shoes is it most of the exclusive truth discovered in the cuneiform tablets reveals the Sumerians were actually visited by lynx-o extraterrestrial believed that the Sumerians words will cure them about extraterrestrials who had visited the Sumerians share knowledge even seeded human society as we know it by breeding with humans and actually producing a hybrid race for a decision the Anunnaki came down here to do some work to do some mining for ball to find things that they needed in their civilization when the work became too intense for them they couldn't handle all the work they decided with Ashley workers in citizen and they took the genetics of themselves apparently create physical bodies we now call modern men the Sumerians believed that you mine gold that's very very interesting if you think about it they read that into us we still have that fascination to this day but the real question that we want to ask about the Anunnaki edge do we take these stories to be a little bit trigger okay or do we take them as stories that the Sumerians their culture if we're gonna take them as literature we have a lot of questions one question relates to extraordinary similarities in the artwork of this Americans are the owner of Mesoamerica in Sumerian depictions the Anunnaki guards home for appears to be a small bath with a handle how's it possible that strangely similar bag is being held by the Olmec astronaut as a vente you see in our case something in their hand what is this object Perseus next civilization it is an object or objects that are almost identical perhaps as some theorize in extraterrestrial intelligence and sharing this information in both civilizations direct connection between all that in sumerian civilizations as UFO researchers theorized they had existed a very different period of time but nonetheless is it possible at this time maybe it's a coincidence this suggests that these really are talking about was saying extraterrestrial visitors does the evidence suggests that the Olmec and Maya were visited by the same list so-called stardom is known to the Sumerians as the Anunnaki and if so what were extraterrestrials have to gain by these felicitations the UFOs are an advanced alien civilization the mayor here the 21st century it's absolutely logical to think that they probably been here for thousands of years they could essentially be watching the growth of humanity when they stick around and research us that model that's a big question mark maybe their agenda is to see the natural evolution of young species maybe that is their mission of this oppressive governments around the world including in Mexico and know that our civilization they haven't seen by extraterrestrial landings in the ancient past if so what else are they not telling us an inherently mysterious phenomena which we are we are also dealing with government and military obfuscation and see Christine and that's just the fact we live in an era in which there is tremendous amount of secrecy still one thing is clear the Sumerian tablets do offer clues to the future if they are to be believed there is a prophecy that some day the Anunnaki will come back they return to claim their property claim their mistake and the harmony with the people appearance we should see about actually why's abundantly clear is that the plastination of otherworldly visitors and their likeness throughout ancient history is not something that [Music] information is transforming what people believe extraterrestrial spacecraft the government hiding the truth July 7th 2003 11 18 p.m. a NASA Delta 2 launch vehicle blasts off from Cape Canaveral for error is an expert bag opportunity [Music] they don't try my new bonnet today

yeah NASA NASA knows that shit's real NASA be known [Music] two months things claim to keep clean as clean as a scientist claimed that electrostatic charge particles in Martian dust and some so how do you pick up chatter with the tools so you gonna keep this part here these people news was perhaps a base for any terrestrial technology there this was cancer a stopping off point on the journey to earth UFO researchers have even gone so far as to raise the question of whether or not the rover has been secretly outfitted with ultra advanced technology from an unknown source Turner's not only one

Manchus welcome to the twisted house welcome to the twisted Misfits peg was what a [ __ ] is going on we're trying out this new [ __ ] claw Cyrus what I can bond I got one still got some [ __ ] in there last night should what's the role people stale bomb smoke make you choke you haven't tough just in a long time damn bro I toss dress mean water water the corner monarchy order to learn or [Music] question your nipples and everything yeah oh that's why you're blooming late because you're still feeding veg nutrients bro you have to switch a muscle so to ignition ignite flowering great you gotta go and get yourself some bat guano get you some background on it's high in phosphorus blast it with that [ __ ] top dress it and then water it in it and then boom over nice you should have [ __ ] dish it off pop and then you want to switch to low low nitrogen higher phosphorous phosphorous and then like else you can have like lower potassium at first cuz that in the beginning a flower you want the phosphorous to get that stretch and stacked on on right then later on you need that high potassium to build the [ __ ] the fatness [ __ ] get all them resins going in shares yeah phosphorus is very most ingenious well it's all depends bro what you got in your soil backwoods you know some plants will go but some plant seeds there's two [ __ ] stubborn you know and you need to [ __ ] kick him in and if you're not a flower yet man we live in Michigan I know you boys live down south so I don't know exactly how late you're growing season is but for me around August 15 when I wasn't seeing flowers I was tripping like hold off man that's not good because you got think about it October 13 is the full moon so two months would go for me I don't count exact days in the months but roughly two moons you know that's how it goes on Indian Way will be from [ __ ] you know August 13th to October 13 so by the 15th when I didn't see blooming I was like aw [ __ ] house for the full moon you know that means so like oh [ __ ] so we gotta give this [ __ ] brawling so we night it with the phosphorus there's some I still haven't hit yet they're not flower you know you haven't taught Justin's June

given his and his ideas 85 it's entirely possible that he was influenced by outside forces here yes I like it I don't like how long these pieces right it works of course you know I love the color

flying saucer seen here for the first time on national television is Walter house video recorded by the disclosure project a UFO research group as these nice the 1947 Roswell press release story that I've given to me almost leaner by Colonel Blanchard do they in fact that we have enough possession of lying saucer it was found on a ranch up north as well newspapers and radio stations a stranger the very next day the military retracted the statement he did not believe that that press release was legitimate he believed that the original intention prostate essentially medgar one [ __ ] yeah so I got some primal punch last year I tried to grow all of them and not among pop so I went to the cup in a Clio right went over to ocean grow and Stan met Bader and then made for one sitting there I'm

also for the revenge mirror for decades the US government has shown a fierce commitment to keeping from the public what UFO researchers claim is smoking gun evidence of extraterrestrial visitation inherently mysterious phenomena which we are we are also dealing with Lewis government and military confiscation and secrecy and that's just the fact the United States top-secret security clearances are designed to be ironclad the unlawful disclosure of such classified information is punishable by steep fines and up to 10 years in prison yeah now has a technology to take e.t knowledge to travel to the stars which was also reported to say there are UFOs and there are UFOs the rich apparently use the phrase hand-me-downs talking about things like stealth and drones as the hand-me-downs presume from extraterrestrial was very rich claiming that our most advanced aerospace and military technologies many he himself helped develop were originally engineered by extraterrestrials she's were also shittiness from space shuttle program the drone there's a real track record here if somebody was being involved with almost every highly advanced aerospace in space and into the list of high-profile confessions is lieutenant colonel philip corso who is once a part of the US national security state a decorated veteran who served in the Eisenhower White House horrified witness accounts shot the UFO research community take courses probably the single most controversial legitimate genuine military use a colonel for the end of his life in 1997 published in the book and the video recorded by the

we do regarding the theme that runs through an awful lot of these skies that embassy said that confessions that are helped made from somewhere else other words we didn't get to this point incredibly advanced technology without somebody else intervening or you have OB surgeries one question remains if the government is with all the evidence pointing to otherworldly contact how long do they plan to concede truth to think that this lie can last forever is the height of foolishness it's coming out we're never gonna be ready for the truth leaders although many regard these so-called confessions as questionable there was an astonishing event and which gathered for all to see and hear reputable former military and government officials and scientists and a first ever press conference in Washington

telemedicine concealing for decades in contact intervention with UFOs recently many more children stepped forward may 2001 a first-of-its-kind press conferences held at the National Press Club in Washington DC military intelligence and in some cases had an experience here super heard he talked about the literary coverage by the CIA in particular cases over Alaska since retired employee was a manager for the accent evaluation investigation division and they soon Callahan's testimony regarding what came to be known as the Anchorage incident involved that UFO encounter over Alaska with a Japan Airlines jet chopper 17 [Music] promptly ship the government question had been reported by the jaeil flight crew who said that as many as this meeting and all evidence of the Anchorage incident was confiscated and callahan was told by government authorities not just that there was never disclosed nor discuss the government a retired Air Force radar controller also appeared at the conference my name is Michael Smith while I was assigned to final fault or gap there I put the radar site and they were watching him on the radar that was Iranian about 8,000 feet it sat there for about 10 minutes and then slowly descended telegraph dog the radar was going on for about five ten minutes when it's totally read here that the stationary big Swede earlier was miles away stationary you know we're there about ten months and redid the whole cycle twice more officer Smith of air force protocol and reported the sightings to the North America arrow states the events demand or know that once again the government stepped in to ensure the incident was kept under wraps as they keep yourself need-to-know basis on one of the most dramatic testimony came from officer Dan Willis had top secret documents nobody listening is overbroad what about Brahman Chancellor 14500 top secret clearance to security glance County near Alaska was caused by the secret Bishop reporter the greatly blowing the British foreign political object constantly emerging out of the ocean shot into space at about 7,000 the UFO was tracked ugly and the sightings carried by people officers on board the ship in Alaska Willis immediately reported the seconds superiors the scroll bar to discuss it one after another of these people got off control the assembled members of the media you know this this is not just hopes this information we experienced in terms of range I'll tell these stories various different secrets that are being kept our news government at different levels at different times ways what you see is a very consistent secrecy cover-up conspiracy by the US government to keep us from Nelly women are Mexicans now as the mainstream press began to research and report on the incredible testimony given of the covers the public began to take notice but this dramatic new UFO evidence was soon over shell origins partnered months later 9/11 and all of this was suddenly no longer knew what was in tor society if evidence taking evidence exists these questions about how this line has corroded and infiltrated and damaged the very institutions that we have relied on the truth and what might the repercussions team or government responds with the reality of the existence of UFOs and number traditions one that one centers for 36 months and is no will be slower like a nut he's like a and so someone asked me the other day like what strains I was excited for what strains I'm like you know really my on so I think what I'm gonna do is Tang Tang which ones I like which ones I walk through you'll see a big sign there's a marker a there's some that really man they got my renounce would put second according to UFO researchers evidence from deathbed confessions and prominent scientists indicates that UFOs may actually exist and suggests there may also be serious security implications while there are many who do not believe there has been any alien contact from UFO encounters to the end I do believe from time to time they do come back and they spread knowledge do are these are they extraterrestrial be wait till Lord Shiva comes back to earth and sees how good as the weed is is

always doing all kind see dog sheds and [ __ ] that we oh I don't know how [ __ ] you find that we don't but next season I mean I'll test anything [ __ ] yeah but I got off a busy plate from now until next outdoor season I got a fee no hunt all the [ __ ] that I created so and I got to do a great project for date knowledge some work right now I'm working on breeding projects to indoors list of like Deborah foot can do I'll test anything I love toys Linda strains me honor if you want you to give you my email and uh if you'd like to hit me up I'll definitely [ __ ] I'll definitely test and [ __ ] up I have to do a seed run in Mars hi Joe for my sponsors but I'm gonna do after harvest good about [ __ ] time man we're delighted you're good go what a pork garden good life growing house [ __ ] you in so I saw the man you need to [ __ ] your bank Green Brooks you're like one of the [ __ ] master men you're like one of these to me you're like the hidden master you know you're not like we're not popular out there like [ __ ] you know like TGA and all that stuff but then from like the people I know from YouTube dude there's a couple masters that I I consider masters and you're definitely one of them everything I've ever got from you was [ __ ] great dude - which great stuff I am a [ __ ] on your strings to tons of them from all kinds of different evil disruption some of these trying to give it second third harvest off this planet does Durban poison right here so you've got 100% Afghan myth male and it costs a hundred percent indica male Afghani has all those so we're gonna do some breathing with that for show stories they've seen witnessed experience where these contact me modern meet me at a restaurant show me something special so they're 300 number two it's a beast out there it's a trained beast that prove knows you tonight's definitely Big East big all based so very welcome to come clean this little [ __ ] up you know if you see like inside this plant right just you like little [ __ ] like like this little stuff down here all these little [ __ ] nodes and stuff right so I'm not gonna cut those off on my final harvest I'm gonna leave those and imma let them rebadge out and those will turn back into branches trying to find the nice hard secondaries black Reynold crazy I know I was showing a [ __ ] I forgot I had it bro I was looking through my seeds and I'm like wag Brian oh what's the [ __ ] subs just talking about a white rhino and [ __ ] and I saw that one and I was like son of a [ __ ] I should have planted at this summer I forgot a head though that's what I'm definitely gonna be kneeling here next in the next time I knew some seed runs yeah but I'm gonna try to stabilize for the rest of the year I'm gonna try to stabilize stabilize a couple of strains that I created it and see if we can pick some phenols out of it we'll do a live feed Oh hunt and all that stuff I'll have like my pick off Goliath come over and have him do a pic and then we'll do a a youtube pic of course you guys can't smell it or nothing like that you can go based on looks or whatever I think it might be a little fun interaction interactive series we can do and then we'll see what comes out at the end you know might be good [Music] yeah revenge oh yeah yeah yeah these these here so the first time I pulled the top colas I just I wanted to take some mechanic blues with me so we had all all cloudy embers and I know we had a couple that were amber you know I just due to weather there's nothing like that right so on the secondary harvest right here these are all [ __ ] almost [ __ ] hammer there's like a lot there's new ones too but there's a lot that's amber on this so we're gonna pull these ones and see how these ones are and cost-plus them out of turbine poison so we're gonna take these down and smoke on these then we'll let these little baby ones here like all these little ones we'll let those ones grow for another couple weeks let them get plump again plump these ones up and then we'll harvest all the rest of the top shed basically all the purple stuff and then whatever's left we're gonna rebadge you know rebadge it out so I only had one seed of this one seed I've got clums and stuff but I like to try to see if I can keep the plant alive I think it'd be pretty cool like 2020 2020 Mon I pull this [ __ ] around I'm like yeah I'm like harvest 8 yeah we have cloud yeah yeah absolutely yes still awesome I wanna see and that's killing land rate so I know I only have one see not like [ __ ] so I couldn't [ __ ] it up and I got clones a bit we're gonna revenge this one out though and we'll use some [ __ ] with it yeah one scene just can't wait to see we're gonna cross it with that [ __ ] Durban poison see what comes out that's gonna be nice or I'm sorry the Hannah's sister put trying to cross with the Afghani in the coffin is hundred percent sativa see what comes with that these buds these secondary buds are nothing to sneeze they had their mouth bigger anything just trying to get some bud in my bag you know had I known how [ __ ] awesome this one would be I would have grown it into a big plant on to date this is my favorite I'm absolutely in love with this for their poison weaponry like to me the high is perfect it's not that [ __ ] punch you in the face and I know this is sativas your guys bald for signs of sativa go smoke tangent tell me how punched in the face you feel tangey is sativa honest a 100% to and it will not give up security area is a location where traumatic projects between US government extraterrestrial say facts this is the researchers who contend don't worry has been a hotbed of UFO activity during maneuvers that I know he's either there metal craft or its owners I personally witnessed unconventional crafts being escorted by might not compel others I've heard other sources that in my way the glue that's in the area these type of craft not me all military there's no way that the military can account for all the sightings of the time getting them going on here that cross everything and finalement yeah I need help I know right and so there was a plan kind of that taught our I mean Texas og had and I we came up with you know to be able to find like-minded breeders with high plant counts that we can start doing projects and using their plant count you know to the benefit of the coalition but it kind of never never happened like that there be cool though I think their cannabis show said he's looking at at harvest time we're looking at 96 new strains so how the [ __ ] you're gonna feed on that [ __ ] okay it's gonna take them [ __ ] 10 years that's that's extreme that's a lot of new flavors last year I did roughly like 20-something cheers for 22 oh man we missed 420 so what up Katie I heard a dude and you never showed oh don't you hate that [ __ ] so Joe all right let's folks weed since we miss [ __ ] 4/20 send them a [ __ ] [ __ ] we get our nectar collector TV people cheers canteen 1999 watered down the order called 105 in three one zero three five are good to get legacy killer back on that 20 M in five three one zero three five we know the US government has recovered through various means Soviet meat and coffee I managed to reverse-engineer dirt but look at something like stealth yeah to smoke out it has such a funky Everest Mount oh my god caterpillars bro [ __ ] I just picked about 150 caterpillars off my [ __ ] no let me let me let me put that battery inchworms there the inchworms they're the ones that have like two little grass bruise on the back of their [ __ ] body and then like four or six up front and they fold it in half and all that weird [ __ ] those are the ones I'm getting caterpillars the army tent ones the [ __ ] we were getting last year I have not [ __ ] seen an army tent where army since June we are getting those inchworms like them on [ __ ] dogs yeah I just go and they go it's wrong wrong you know I'm saying so yeah black magic yeah did I get hundreds of them out there those little inch worms the army tent worms in my opinion or a lot worse because I haven't seen those inch worms really going in my bud much they seem to be on the top or on the leaf and they're just being stupid they're easily to pick off for those army time worms are the ones that like if this is your bud they like rapid eating you're [ __ ] buzz like a [ __ ] blanket and that they web all in there and then they start to eat and plant material and poop and all his air and then spam they turn into a [ __ ] moth and fly away and then your butt gets butt rot you have no idea because it's so the Leafs are like they camouflage you you know I'm saying because you got your butt on top and then all the Leafs start growing down you know from there so so much [ __ ] gets covered you got really I pulled my whole butt out like I'll pull my branch legs fold it out and then look like oh man it's a [ __ ] the purple ones I found a pink one today I don't know what the [ __ ] it was even but it was pink you know we got green ones yellow ones orange ones enough on the paper yeah purple ones maybe your weeds purple and that's why they're privileged because for instance I always find these things eaten like my white hairs right and I have bright ass red white hair cloud there they're like fuchsia which I was thinking maybe that thing was eaten on those and then came over to my other one oh yeah every morning dude I go out there and do my caterpillar cake and then as them out there normally mouths are like just all day [ __ ] around tinkering and stuff but started getting shitty out there may be bugs run in so instead of having my [ __ ] get all wet like I said [ __ ] let me just come in here work on this stuff but yeah normally I'd be out there all day just pick it leaves still doing branch selection still doing some training pulling through stuff through supporting stuff and then that find some [ __ ] the worm it was there was like hundreds a fit and then you know the the [ __ ] ants went work in the all the predator bugs went to work out there the bugs and [ __ ] and now the aphids you might find like one on an entire plant when you research even if you have looked on your whole entire brains like if you only have one 8-bit per branch like you're doing good that means your friends or boats are merging no bugs are no that's the best but dude you're outdoors you know without the brain and blasting all the damn time or any meat oh you know maybe next year something I'll look into is the nematodes you know like how men dodo bad there's this year they worked really well for them so maybe we'll look into that for next year so I think we're gonna let the rest of this one go [Music] conventional or no select filter from the 1599 that's a heck of a deal laminate brain can they [ __ ] although I think the rest of this we're gonna let go for a little bit another couple weeks maybe like September 15 all the work is for around September 15th or so somewhere around there will cut this down and then put it back and rematch [Music] put them in back in the remade John Sam the rusty it's got some kind of those are test plants we test our spray on and [ __ ] yeah test the spray on those plants and then if they pass and don't get fried up or anything stupid like that spray our big plants so far so good [Music] here's the story mountain coffee roasters supposed to reconfirm UFO researcher Dave Rosenfeld as seen and heard reports of so many astounding spacecraft in and around area 52 to suspect that somewhere massive property at Dugway proving ground he believes their existence could alter human history forever I personally witnessed my saucers disappearing janitor working around my conclusion is that there's a military space bug waiting I don't the gaming community but is there proof genetic of such cleanly investigators say V Evans lives with a message you know crazy is I have plants that are growing in rocks that I never for the first time on national coach shows a previously undiscovered mysterious rock formation on the Martian surface though this is the NASA Mariner 9 image from the surface of Mars mount rain even here Mountain cluster here they valley the area of interest is this cone shape [Music] the Clone official page where the we've got a little bit of weed right here that's we need this away if I gave this to Pharaoh he roll this up into like three [ __ ] joints I bet you what about Michael Wallace have you ever tried an outdoor plan after harvesting beds like dig it up throw in a tent know what to do tutto from my state go down I did the same thing though I had one that it [ __ ] on Kaiser whatever plush I planted like four of the same plants and one one five gallon bucket three or four of nine all night whatever I put it outside it died all the way and then came back and flowered I went to revenge no it's the biggest plant outside if I was you know bucket that's bruising into the ground so that's pretty [ __ ] school where do we did you said where did we get out my brayer back go get that we so we use our does the evidence suggests that there you really does function you know as those are right the things for Christmas ornaments that's what I like to use the hangman ganja if the evidence is credible as UFO researchers believe what else is the government possibly hai tang my god information from scientists changing the conversation about ulo seconds does this provide a new perspective on the government's involvement with death of another we're Dave Rosenfeld there is no doubt that UFOs are connected to top-secret activity area 52 and leaves he's got to there's many times we gone there were sky watches we bring all our equipment up there pigeon and when I don't wanna o'clock in the morning and then also receive about my miles okay each flashing light beam of light like static electricity Dave describes what happened next he took this time shul never before seen photo at night down second time that fire we watched work five blue lights come down and completely surround this game left they were watching excuse that being shut off they took on it's interesting you back in it yeah you you what's the simply attention yeah I'm gonna hang this [ __ ] up once we're gonna pop them on beard on fire beans like [Music] [Music] [Music] you're tall Foundation don't is proving to treat and reduce the risk of DVT or this put this if there was something post the video chopped some buds what up grow man oh there was something there's something else I was gonna save with me and I got stoned and like these for God should be seen first sorry dude I suspect will change people's mind about the whole phenomena that one such diamond infant was a report by the CIA scientific intelligence department following a wave of UFO sightings over Washington DC today this would normally be little tiny popcorn buds not saying that the biggest thing in the world but to do the Second Harvest man it's so worth it if you have time in space you know this easy is when you know this was how easy was by the time I chopped it down everything outside was basically going in the flour so all I had to do is Stadium flower piece boom his easy is - I don't have to take up any space inside I don't have to keep climbing right I don't have to do [ __ ] I'm flirt outside I check it every once in a while I feed it once a week and just come back we got a box a box of Bud we have few stragglers let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] please big-nose nipple things we're gonna crack sucking on fire so beard on fire is an ocean grown right it sounds like just another free prints working credit Sesame is so much more than for headaches would kind of texted me just give the power to take control of your credit and just think about all you can do is break credit so I don't have to drop off the grid Michigan now just plain old water here grown from the cup gravy what up let me in I'll have four strains building websites not much work can be done what a mojo how bad can be more we leave so here have beard on fire that's because it's just the right temperature where liquid water could exist on the surface so for a video they have no idea that a hundred years after they achieve the science and technology progresses into the future 150 years this one now this one just has characteristics we'll see so we want to scare far exceeds a scare for my presidency about you why people say you scare only old seeds but are you doing this scratching off that show show a little bit playing in the water what am i sorry for 28 streets which problems so I cut down the some of it but now we are scary things beard on fire get [ __ ] out of to beard on fires and I'm gonna do these different than I normally do so I'm gonna leave these for 24 hours in the water and then they will go into a you know to more later for video beers times the base on fire going through your time-space on fire that makes weird on fire Peter gone fighter so we have some of those pops this is gonna be for the Mars hides row grow series Mars hydro grow series so we're gonna put this up as a safe if you visit why the Commission's then we keep it safe oh [ __ ] I didn't know I had this bag we were just come from hill yeah we got dams but see the dams I want to like do a [ __ ] monster rip of a dad but if I do I'm afraid I might chick pence and blow boogers all over it straight at the same time saying some kind of little scared but we love the dads man sorry I got a GDP I can chop up to toy soldiers like wow I just got weed for [ __ ] days and years knows Levin weed over here in this bag right here is donkey punch so it's baboon times tangerine dream times purple Urkel and then this one is pineapple Larry which is kind of Express times thing clear yeah I forgot Edna's there's a little jar of it sitting on the floor over there now smoking down the tube is big this is when I created those breasts I'm Stevie Larry it's [ __ ] sweet itself smells all pineapple II gotta see if that GDP is dry now when I if I pull a CBP out on live camera you guys gonna promise me one thing don't laugh at me Terrell terrible it's basically a stick full of calyxes there's no but is what investigators are focused on we might even like because it was made from a ship care from a ship man y'all saw Rainier routes ocean grown genetics my guys man war I was looking at one of those and I was going to come back by the time I came back they shut their boot down gosh is yes it wasn't meant to be but uh yeah I got the beard on fire from my grow or one ah that's history pinky only Hoshi drone and stuff I had was Death Star and I crossed it with gelato split as if they're receiving some sort of energy transmission absolute information from some higher source whether that higher source is the Sun our Sun God as image or whether it's actually a spacecraft is having and it could be already belong to sweet treats of his parents x-rays and CT scans and teams that's not normal because he was alien man I can what up scrappy often love what I make those cookies challenge to do and making video soon yeah we do a challenge oh yeah Mossberg really super super [ __ ] business bro Cheers [ __ ] stoners fucking's donors oh it's no pineapple and like skunky it's almost like onion like pineapple hyung you know Monica's weird I like challenges my challenge is coming up it's going to be one plan to run season South Egypt's royal faculty could be connected to interstellar beings it seemed far-fetched it's making you opposed to three thousand-year-old remains Reese's peanut butter cups to give up losers do you love Reese's Pieces well if you got a feel for you get one free inside", "Ltyg4SnTAQY": "hey y'all EQ here just got back from the defense went to collinsville this time day have went downhill very fast from the last time that we went so I am supporting the rise in Effingham and only the rise we probably won't go back to collinsville they did have they did have this it's the Durbin poison you can see it's a sativa and got some pretty good numbers and was very I'm very curious because they said that it smells like lemons I'm curious to see if that's actually true but give me just second I'll get her open as you can see it's all still absolutely closed and perfect give me just a second all right we've got her open and their show wow that looks really pretty that looks like Christmas tree nuggets let's see what that looks like outside here oh really dense so we think that looks good I can smell the lemon in the citrus but this was on the that's right here was on the bottle the inside but that was pretty cool pretty crazy this first time I've seen anything like that but got a really good smell smell the citrus I can't wait to taste it but this is Cresco labs i think let's go yeah Crisco and a neat little jar but I think I need to do something else with their jars I smell something that shouldn't actually be there and I don't know if it's the sativa I don't know if it's them putting it in these jars and the jars having a smell and then it getting on the weed but only time will tell as always I can subscribe I'm EQ same Brad time same Brad Channel later y'all", "2VPxJJOanVA": "[Music] hey as going everyone is good tonight yeah we're here from this beautiful world well I haven't done one of these no and I would like to do a canvas review tonight this is some stuff that I grew myself legally here in Oregon it is recreational 21 and over for adult use here as well as medical so have my medical card for about five years or so now I'm just going on going everything else off but um I just saw in the intro it was a real nice crystallized keep you looking but I don't want to handle it too much but you can kinda the light here is not real I don't think it's gonna give me a crystal-clear look but that's okay so let's go ahead this is a Durban poison it is a definitely a something egg it was a feminized seed that I had used and it brought me about probably gave me about Oh two and a half ounces off the planet indoor grow I ground my tent so now we can grow up to four plants at a time per household not per adult in the house so I mean there's two adults in the house but um this is my job go ahead and kind of give it a whip [Music] it's floral very floral very floral I don't know what kind of flowers but it's very floral to get that floral bouquet of flowers kind of effect to it in the eye in the nose kind of a little bit of a pepper also some black anise even comes out a little liquorice he like smell it's very to the nose very pointy very good I mean though that smell goes right up in your nose and you can really feel it the resin it's very resonating in the nose I mean yeah the licorice really comes to get quite a licorice I know I always remembered urban being more of a licorice like smell that floral herbal herbal skunky yeah it's really good it smells good let's go ahead and pack some this and take some off this crunches real nice it's been nice and crunchy it's been cured for a little over a month now I'm straight-up just putting it out and I'm gonna grind it it's probably not the best way to do it but that's just how I'm doing it now so all right let's get the smokes like it's burning white somewhat a whole lot I flushed it maybe two or three weeks with water of pH water last two three weeks very floral on the out on that like when you're blowing it out on the draw it's very floral very peppery that pepper it's very peppery with a spicy pepper a floral you get more of the black anise the the licorice like smells in the nose kind of heating in the throat not burning just kind of like hot dry and the throat it's very key it's very nice that pretty pretty quick effect it happens fairly fast and what I feel this is a this is a sativa dominant strain in fact I believe it's just sativa period it's a pretty sure cuz Durban poison I want to say as a land restraint coming from South Africa believe so kind of interesting it's a if if grown right and I believe I've grown this correctly and let it you know let it go to its maximum on budding and there anyone on the hot before harvesting flowering stuff I had some nice big fat colas of it you know maybe inch-and-a-half why not - not too great but not too bad it was nice and full thick fat buds that weren't going anywhere you know they were [ __ ] there they were solid you can barely they're very dense and they're dense now you know it's I'm pressing hard and it's dense as hell it's crystallized it tastes delicious world don't shoot what man I really like what I get out of it the feeling I have is more of like oh it's more of daytime you know kind of a happy I need to sleep I probably shouldn't have done this strain but it does kind of give you creativity in the mind you know you want to sit down and like right now with my playing guitar or something it's late you know I figured I might even um edit a video or something you know it's it is pretty late tonight right now though but um it's making me all Chinese eyes you know I definitely I mean I might have Chinese eyes all the times but but really from the smoking it's really doing it um real dry eyes a bit of a cottonmouth going on though nice feeling overall it tastes really nice honestly I'm not like saying he hated me but I think I could have trimmed this better I'll knock myself for that I think it could have been a little more white in the burn it's a little dark talking flushing and stuff like that and I grew it overall but a though the butt itself the strain is awesome overall out of five of five five five bud I would I would give this four buds for four point two five buds [Music] [Applause] that was fun right on well you guys have a good night if you have had this dream before let me know

yourself stay safe and stay healthy Cheers [Music] [Music]", "63kHpyYJznA": "a little Durbin poison here for you some close-up shots it's just a smellivision look at the crystals my goodness Christmas tree look at I'm just grabbing random bugs off the air to show you an old urban poison there's like I know I get this all the time but you know what this is a straight-up sativa and although it's only tested on at 19 percent THC the other terpenes are so high and actually the CBD is really high in this one so this batch that's why you got to go from batch to batch you never know which batch is gonna have what because it's nature so here's another one all right now I'll take the magnifying glass out so you can see the what we got there's a half ounce shake sativa hopefully you'd see that pretty nice buds a real blue color to it I think the cameras picking that up but um it also has orange hairs but also a lot of yellow hair too yeah you can really see the blue in these guys here yeah so Durban poison this is a half ounce baking shake from Silver State relief once again great little product here's the particulars like in 1921 for THC CBD zat for butter polling that's just on i-84 very Faline on four and Mike green at 1/3 so good medicine and there's the price also they're running a deal if you see there's dollar exchange for your pre-roll Sour Diesel in one cent if you bring in fives or ones to pay for your purchase anything over $40 you can get this pre-roll for a dollar so it's our purchase today and once again Durbin poison everybody knows it there she is great stuff enjoy you know shut this video for ADA or 20 so have a good one bye", "IX5dj0SfQDQ": "well it's time to do another video here and um unfortunately the mailman hasn't arrived yet it's with my stuff so um wait a minute what the hell is that it's the plate of pot and it's got eight items on here and it looks like one two three four pre-rolls and four three point fives um well let's go through them i guess we've got edison ice cream cake we've got weed me mandarin cookies uh ignite crescendo that's a pre-roll no idea what that is scotia lemon dory then we've got canna farms super critical uh silver haze or something like that then we've got captain's choice it's some sort of mysterious sativa blend of pre-roll then we've got another new lp here dixtra green houses i think that's what they call it dixtra something like that um lemon pepper spice and finally we've got ignite gg number four pre-roll oh my goodness this is very exciting eight new items on this plate of pot right in time when i ran out just giving a shuffle here so it's all nice and random super random and here we go i'll take anything except a pre-roll please no no it's the captain's choice oh maybe these will be good i don't know we'll see it's the captain's choice here it is it's the captain's choice sativa blend uh 19 or 195.5 milligrams per gram uh and this is two pre-rolls in here for a total of one g and let's see here united greenery so that's who makes this that's who the captain works for and we've got the date is november the 3rd of 2020 so not too bad not too bad so if you're wondering why i got these four pre-rolls on this plate of pot here um when i made my last order i had like 20 bucks left over so i thought you know what i'm going to get a couple 1g things but there's not many of those around anymore so i thought i'll just get 20 worth of pre-rolls and i tried to get stuff that uh we don't normally see as flower right so this one here right you don't even have the lp doesn't have anything so i mean or the brand that's why i thought it'd be cool this one here for two dubs that are each supposed to be half a gram this went for four dollars and 38 cents which is not bad um for two half grams supposedly half ram joints we'll find out soon first we're going to check out the scale here because uh that's what we're gonna do so like on my last video we're gonna do it a little differently here we're gonna put this on zero it out because somebody suggested this and you know in my mind this would be technically slightly slightly even more uh accurate so here we put that on 50.00 perfect perfect see look at that [Laughter] i guess that's cool anyways let's open this up and see what these things look like and way holy shit oh my god that's not even a i thought that was a flip top i've been trying to flip it like this that would pop open but nope that's the hinge they hid the opening over here somewhere oh boy that is a little bit difficult to open but there we go we got it and hey you know what these are actually out of all the pre-rolls i've seen these are some of the nicest looking the filter isn't insanely huge it's big i would go half that size but that's it's not half the size of the joint like those quest ones let's see what they each weigh with filter because normally we don't check it with the filter oh my god 0.8 that's good what about this one 0.8 also wow that means that these might weigh the proper amount let's find out let's empty these in here and see if it makes uh oh and look at that nice little spiral we'll see if it makes it a gram look at that i just pulled the filter out all nice oh very nice and now i should be able to just just sort of go like this and empty it all here look at that 0.49 i did get a couple tiny little bits out so you know that's that's fucking close oh my god i've never seen one that was so accurate i'm impressed i'm impressed let's try this one i have no idea what strain is in here though that's a mystery [Music] there's a little bit in the tip come on get out of there come on get all of you come on oh my god look at this they actually did it the captain did it all right so i went and got this nice box and i'm gonna check out the uh we'll check out this stuff here with the microscope and see what kind of stuff they're putting inside here see a little stem right there hopefully that's the only one right well let's take a look at it we got this nice box it's black so we won't get a lot of reflection should be all right so one thing i didn't think of when i was getting this box was how tall the box was it's pretty tall i can barely actually know what i'm going to turn the box around and i'm gonna put this thing up on here and check there we go i figured they were so here we are looking at the captain's choice this is what the captain smokes when the captain's looking for a sativa apparently um so you can see some chunky trichomes in there you can see it it does look a little bit like uh it reminds me somewhat not as nicely of but somewhat like shred i i don't know if uh can see some bits of stem here and there you can see some trichomes they're kind of cloudy and chunky looking let's see if we can zoom in closer that's about as close as i can get without it getting all horribly blurry oh there we go a little bit nicer there yeah so that's kind of what it looks like there and you know i don't see a ton of stems i see some little bits of of stem and leaf like you can see right there the big reflection you see all the reflections shining so much off that pretty sure that's a leaf right there and so it looks okay it doesn't look as bad as that one time i got the pedros from color that pretty ready to roll garbage that stuff was horrible but this looks okay it doesn't look as good as shred but it looks okay so hopefully it is okay and i'm gonna go try it and then i'll be right back so i just got in from trying the captain's choice sativa blend oh sativa blend i didn't notice that before interesting at 19 so i first out there when i was trying i thought it was kind of weak but um after a while uh it's sort of sort of a creeper on there and it sort of kicks up to like maybe just below a medium for the high so the high on here is uh it's all right but at first it kind of was like it felt weak but there's a bit of a creeper there and it sort of creeps up to maybe a medium maybe just somewhere around a medium maybe just below a medium to a medium that's kind of nice and it's kind of like uh it's got like a i guess it makes it kind of alert sort of um sort of really awake it's kind of woke me up this thing it made me really um make me feel really awake and stuff i don't feel like energetic or anything but i feel really kind of like i could go and do some sort of physical activities or some shit um yeah so that's kind of all right i guess not that i want to go do anything like that but you know i guess it's okay it's okay it's a nice it's like kind of like um like a clear-headed kind of a buzz maybe not clear-headed but it's kind of it's not a couch lock at all we'll say that and yeah but this stuff is quite dry so i don't know if how it would burn in a joint or whatever there was absolutely no flavor no flavor at all and there was no smell too so that you know that sucks for both of those things unless i guess some people they they like it so it doesn't smell so i guess for you that will be okay but the high on here is okay um the weight i'm surprised actually had the proper weight on here for um pretty much for both of them they came up to well combined it came up to one and uh yeah and it was actually packed really nicely in here it's a probably one of the nicest pre-rolls i've seen so far it was a little bit large filter but it wasn't insane like some of them and as it came out it was all nicely packed it had it felt like there was no hard spots or anything like maybe there would be really good air flow through there there was no no hard spots or anything that was all sort of nicely nicely packed so yeah you know for five bucks and it's okay there's better for five bucks but you know whatever it's uh it's the captain's choice so [Laughter] if you like captains and maybe i don't know who knows i wouldn't i don't think i would ever buy it again but you know i had five bucks to spend and i spent it on this and i don't regret it because there was nothing else available so i would have had to have spent well i would have had to have less stuff so i don't regret it because it just gave me more stuff to try there how old was that i wouldn't buy it again though anyways though that's the captain's choice um this uh seven more things on the um what is that called there so we got seven more things on the plate of pot uh come check it out hit the subscribe button uh in the notification bell it'll tell you when the next um one of those videos goes up and that yeah that's uh that's all there is for this well we'll see you later have a good one i just remembered something that i wanted to add in here real quick because i just remembered it i was just stopped recording but anyways when i was saying there was no flavor in this there was no flavor but there's a little bit of an aftertaste which is not the best aftertaste and it's a taste i know very well and you guys probably know very well it's the taste of when there's a seed in your joint you're smoking it there's a seed in there and it burns that taste it's very unique taste that was the there was a slight aftertaste of that so i don't know if maybe a seed or two got ground up in this also maybe who knows but i did have slight aftertaste of of a seed you know that's unmistakable aftertaste it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was and then when i realized that i was like oh yeah that's that yeah anyways just thought i'd mention that because uh yeah anyways see you later have a good one", "VG6eB32624I": "hey youtube Alex here back again I figure out miles I'll shoot the video and show you guys this el hell are German poison cartridge I got same day as these coast cookies I had that that was very good so I figured I'd open up this also sativa LLR cartridge it says Durban let's get it open though I'll put it on my pen to let you know what I think about the Derby should be pretty good it's only seventy percent THC but these are cartridges from Cresco or absolutely fire I'll show you the stats there in a second my favorite mouse would get it oh but I liked it I liked to open everything on camera that's what I do so I'm seeing it for the first time you're seeing it boom nice pretty good filled up pretty good to the top sad let you see this up close here's the Durban is distrain fresco get the focus the best I can give it right there the mouthpiece circular take this little rubber piece off and I'll let you know what I think of the Cresco [ __ ] - the light - nice color oil all right let me get my focus I'll put this on my head I use that to pop okay yeah put this on the pen you know you know what I think let me show you the stats - I'm here so about the shaders - yeah it's like 70 percent THC test you have my focus do if you hit to this and I'll let you know what I think what it tastes like all right spill it on the bed now you know when I think of the Durbin now Durbin poison is one of my favorite strains it's up there with my top 10 list for sure I do like sativas a lot they said a gorilla glue Durbin poison because they were a few that I liked Sour Diesel well that tastes really good it tastes nice wow that's impressive that's one the best tasting ones yet no [ __ ] this Durbin tastes really good Wow good enough tasty oh yeah I think it's really good that's nice that cherry wow this tastes better than that cherry Wonka and I thought that cherry Walker was delicious that was a cherry sweet cherry taste this is up put my finger on it like earthy but yet sweet earthy taste it's really nice man I'm surprised how good this tastes but then again I do like the flower of Durbin's really good I don't know if I had any to guide some durbin shatter and I had some that stuff man it's hard to keep remembering of all the stuff I had let me know what you guys are smoking on right now in the comment section I'll probably post this video a little bit after I post the East Coast cookies video because I have been smoking on that so I am pretty buzzed off of that and so I just want to open this up to have something to hit so I can hit this what I haven't to worry about I like to excel I can do my videos I open the product up as I open it I'm open it on camera you guys see it as I see it so I don't like to hope that stuff up and then smoke and then do a video afterwards I like open it up so I could be surprised just like I was with that ship around the edge of the lady I was surprised but hey you saw it just like beat you know this is pretty good it's filled up to the top not much headspace it's pretty good filling sativa Durban I'm pretty sure it's German poison it just says Durban though but yeah fresco top-notch stuff LLR live resin cartridges are probably one of the bests on the market right now and it tastes really good and it might be a little bit maybe the crypto fish that I had before that's tasty I taste so good I might want to go grab another one of these farts grab another durbin that's delicious man definitely recommend that one for sure Durban man tastes good Wow I am out peace Durban poison fresco [Music]", "xO6AgFvglvU": "okay we're about to enter the 11th week on this dirt in prison this is the 11 weeks in seed and I kept I taking two out to harvest it's kind of weird I don't know if it means it's a genetics or what but I don't this well out of the scenes that I had haven't cared two of them are fully right and ready to be harvested yet the other one some of them have even built ended here yet the altered so I'm not sure what's after that now I have increased the amount of dark hour lessons last week buh-bah giving it [Applause] need 13 hours of darkness and 11 hours of light to speed up

opto-video okay these are the two plants that are ready for harvest I took a good look at the chrome the buds they look very ready to me you can't see on this of course but when I looked at him there

this durbin poison is perfectly cured i must say like it's it's not super dense it's not like a rock but it's dense you know and um like it's got like a little spongy give to it like let's hear that little break a little crack yeah it just like breaks up perfectly it smells like i'm at a gas station right now pumping that like 91 octane like definitely get you some of this shout out to doze off definitely like they definitely are you know know what they're doing in there they got this up to 27 thc and i believe like .05 cbd which is you know significant and um but yeah now we're about to take it to the laboratory give this stuff a real tip man this is so so pretty just like look at that but yeah these are just the little buds um but yeah we're about to take it to the lab and give this a full strain taste test so welcome to loud pack reviews brought to you in part by strain tasters shout out to your boy milano over there at strain tasters but today i got something special for you guys doze off durban poison this is uh this is not a lo this is not some lightweight regular dagger that durbin poison this is about 27 percent well it is 27 and 0.5 cbd it's a heavy hitter you'll guys see see get a better look at it in the cat in a cannabis close-up but um man i'm i'm pretty happy with this um it was about a 40 eighth you know um we had to get a little hit in real quick um man the way it broke up though i'm really happy with the cure process the smell oh my god i wish you guys could smell it man what like i don't know if you guys would like it or you know but it's super gassy like super gassy i'm talking jet fuel you know like i guess that's why it's called durbin poison that real like the odors it tingles your nose and like it has a very unique cushy sort of taste it's a sativa you know normally i smoke indicas i like indicas you're more relaxing but this you know relaxes me too i mean i you know i guess i do feel energetic in a way but relax at the same time you know and um like i'm gonna give this my my my my grade i'll give it a nine like just solid you know i'm happy with the the appeal of what it looks like what it smells like how it smokes the price you know even even the packaging like it says it says those off and it it's got the orange and it makes you feel like you're you know chilling looking at a sunset or something so i'm pretty happy with it but um yeah shout out to shout out to nugg that's the nug in sacramento that's the club that i got this from i forget i forget the bud tender um but they're they're all very nice there they're very nice there i i highly recommend um visiting them and you know making it you know getting you some herb you know but um until next time it's your boy leroy", "8xi6JrT6pH0": "okay cool today in the name of what's in my pre-roll we have this eight gram grenade xxl infused pre-roll from napalm with originals flower so uh this is definitely by far the biggest joint i've ever gutted i'm not sure how i'm going to deal with that i have some ideas hopefully this all pans out but yeah let's go ahead and just jump into it if you're watching this on my patreon page thanks a lot i appreciate you being a patron it means a lot because this thing was [ __ ] expensive sorry to use some foul language there but uh yeah it was 150 on the menu pre-tax uh so thank you to tropicana for making this happen giving me that 15 discount got me out the door under two bills but still very expensive nonetheless uh but yeah let's take a look at this tag cause i'm interested in what we're gonna find here um so we've got eight g's it says seven g's of originals indoor flower and 1g of live resin and it says lift tickets infused rolling paper so i guess there is a g of live resin mixed in with the flower we'll find out together um and then also lift tickets are infused so that's like more live resin in those papers so in any case that's what's going on here with this label let's see if there's what's on the back okay this is the actual testing panel here just came right off that pin and this is what we got in here so 28 to total thc and it does say 7g a flower 1g of extract southwest caregivers here and when was it made back on 8 26 so not too long ago were just coming up towards the end of september now it's about the 20th um so yeah not too old just under a month about so interesting let's see originals og rolling paper by lift tickets so that i don't know we're going to find out together but that makes me wonder is the live resin just what's in the paper because lift tickets is you know it says rolling paper and then flower by but doesn't say concentrates by so oh but wait oh oh ingredients never mind hold on cannabis flour cannabis extract live resin diamonds cannabis extract live resin infused rolling paper alright so that answers my question of course there's the government uh warning they're always watching um so yeah we should find some diamonds in here as well as the flower and then of course the rolling paper is infused so maybe i'll be able to save some of that maybe not looks like quite a bit of cb oh never mind i was reading that wrong i thought it was 11 cbd i was like wow that's a lot but uh point one four five percent cbd so not too much compared to the thc in any case let's get into it and see what's good i'll take this tag i'll put it over here i'll move my sticker because i imagine there's going to be a lot of flour coming out and so this is it let me zoom out you don't need to be that close this is the pin here is the seal so you see you have the official napalm seal um and yeah i mean i think that's it i don't think i actually pull the pin that would be pretty cool but but i think i just twist this off so let's go ahead and watch the seal break together or if it yep there it goes and you can see that it's got that kind of amp anti-tamper seal stuff there stuck on the jar and here we go it's ready to come out let me zoom back out drum roll in your heads boom there it is damn this thing is huge uh definitely again the biggest pre-roll that i've ever gutted the surface looks a little strange just before i pull it apart i thought i'd zoom in on that and i do want to get a dry pool and not neglect that because there's no going back on this one and how the heck oh maybe you do have to pull the pin no i don't know maybe not do i just we're finding this out together i should have did it say pull pin on the instructions to use no no okay uh i don't want to break it but it doesn't it's like stuck in there what the [ __ ] hold on hold on here you get to see me mess with this thing and be a total idiot let me try to pull the pin no okay it doesn't work all right well it's in there it's stuck in there and it's like if you spend this much money on a j and you can't get it out of the cap like what the [ __ ] maybe i gotta unscrew it all right okay i'm just there we go okay i don't know what i did there i think that was my fault so pardon my retardation um pardon that my use of that because i can't erase it and we're live in this video so i'm sorry for saying that but yeah that was my fault i think i i feel like is this screwed in or what what what's going on here this looks like porcelain i should have probably read to see what this is made of but looks like a nice tip it smells great i gotta give that to the originals the uh i can smell the ogenus from back here so let me go ahead and get a dry pull on this real quick and it pulls just fine like i feel like if i lit this up it would smoke perfectly it's got that like really nice it's almost lemony it's like yeah definitely a lemony um maybe minorly gassy but i get more of a freshness off of it so it's like yeah but there's definitely a fuel in the taste too on it so i'm gonna enjoy smoking this flour for sure it's got a great taste classic og so maybe the originals you know i don't know it's it's it's definitely uh on point with a lot of very popular ogs i'm not gonna comment more than that but it tastes very good um all right so let's go ahead and get the right angle on this thing because there's no going back here we go with this here looks like this is where it was actually sealed together so here we go snip snip snip now this is a barrel and i really am curious about how they put these together because it's just like this big tube and i'm like is this you know i mean are these all made by hand hand packed most likely at least like do they cone these out at first how do they do it so let me see i'm going to try to actually cut down the middle here i'm going to try to preserve the paper as much as possible maybe i'll be able to roll it back into a j let me see oh there we go here we go i'm just going to open that up there it is there we go all right awesome well there it is it's coming out in a big old barrel because that's what it is in here all stuffed in oh man i don't want to lose any of this material so i'm going to be really careful as i pat it out of here come on now come on now come on now here it comes all right here we go is that no no i'll be honest i am on the lookout for seeds only because that is what i saw in another video where somebody had opened this up oh special k i just i'm glad the paper caught all that only one tiny tiny little piece managed to make its way off all right cool so the paper is pretty much intact i don't know if we'll see if we find any of those diamonds in here i don't know what they're supposed to look like this stuff smells so good though it's really awesome i definitely love the the smell i'm getting so let me go ahead and get more of a centered view here as i go through this it's a lot of material as i was saying i don't even want to breathe too hard because it'll just go everywhere um so let's see what we got in here already just a little passenger there so far now this is going to take a bit it's going to take a bit but i i don't uh don't see how where the diamonds are exactly and uh you know eventually um if napalm sees this video let me know what i'm looking for exactly because i'm not seeing it i'm seeing a lot of this though which i'm just suspect now because i've seen that other video special k i believe is the user that put that out and there are a lot of these little tiny looking pieces that like are not seeds because i keep smashing them and they go away they're just very suspect you know so but uh the material itself i mean i kind of like the grind it's not grounded down to nothing um so that's good it's got a good consistency it probably would have smoked pretty well but it does have the occasional passenger man it is just so hard to go through this much material though to be honest i probably should have put it in a rolling tray i think i think maybe these chunks i keep coming across might be something to do with the live resin i mean it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel like a concentrate by any means uh when i'm breaking them up but i'm just you know finding these little clusters in here and uh and yeah so i just want to be thorough this is probably gonna feel one of the longest joint videos also i hope my phone holds up uh heat wise because it tends to overheat but yeah i just keep seeing a lot of these little bits of things so i i think those might be the diamonds i don't know i can't say because it just feels like herb when i'm when i'm busting them down but they have a c like shape so it's very uh suspect in that way but not yeah not a lot of passengers really you know i mean i've come across a couple here so far there's just so much freaking material in here and so let's break it down you know we're talking about what 150 bucks pre-tax um so that's a quarter so and i mean you've got a g of live resin so i'm not sure what that goes for concentrate wise um but yeah breaking it down by its components what is what are a couple weights maybe like uh 80 bucks you know let's say 48 yet each right and then you get a g of live risen whatever that runs so this really isn't too bad considering that they constructed it also and i mean i am kind of going by more store prices pre-tax etc but uh but yeah i i wouldn't say it's necessarily super overpriced because there is something to do with this construction but as you can see it's not free of defect you know i mean there are a couple and i mean it's just so much too i'm used to just going through one gram so this is seven times the amount of material that i'm used to going through and it's like i can see as i'm doing it there isn't too many but there are just little tiny pieces that are suspect it's got a good consistency though i've really got to give it to that because yeah i'm sure this would have smoked awesomely um just the way that it's got a mix of like really finely ground stuff and uh and really big chunks in here and it just smells so good yeah it really does have that classic og scent sweetness to it um like the lemony citrusy sweetness with that fuel in there yeah i can't wait to smoke this stuff but uh and i just brushed those stems back in there so i mean i'm not seeing anything crazy i'm not seeing any seeds you know i mean that was the question after seeing the video that was released not too long ago would we find any seeds there's nothing sticking out at me you know and i'm checking as you can see i'm checking all these little bits as i'm coming across them but i really don't think we're going to find anything but i just want to be sure because yeah you can only make this video once and i mean you know yeah i have to say this looks pretty decent i came across a couple stems but you know stuff like this here there's gonna be there we go there's another one over here so i can pick these out you know and there's probably going to be a bunch more of them you know not not a supreme amount because i you know otherwise i would just be doing it right now but as i go through it i'm sure i could find more of that we found that bigger stem so there are some stems in here just a little bit nothing crazy again especially when you consider the price point you know and the and the work that goes into making something like this now i don't know what kind of material they started with maybe they get a good deal on lowers or whatever you know but uh yeah can't really see anything to complain about in here um but i'm not finding those uh we're gonna weigh this out right now so it comes out to eight g's they must be in here i guess like but i'm not seeing what i would suspect are the live resin diamonds or whatever so anyway i'm getting a notice that my phone is getting hot so i better move along and get this weight off uh because this is again a really long video um so let's go ahead and get the scale going i'll move you guys over there here we go all righty and there it is and you can see that pretty good from right there so let me tear this out yeah i'm gonna try to corral all of this material in here it is again more than i've weighed out before so i'm hoping this all stays in here be cooperative here we go oh all right so there's some left on the paper coming up to 7.7 and i did there's a couple crumbs out here but not a whole lot so that is what the weight is coming up to you now if it's supposed to be not including the paper then so be it uh it's going to be kind of a pain to pull this paper off i think oh let me try it hold on i want to give it away just to see if it comes up to at least here we go here we go all right i'm throwing the paper into two so you", "mdqV728E-ug": "[Music] what's up pop peeps in sugar I'll pop mine for 20 and we are back for another product review video before we get started popping so let's do our little thing that we call SML we need you to subscribe and while you're there I need you to hit that notification bell and also just like me because I'm pop mom and you guys already love me anyway so make sure you're going in that love but Ananya to guys today I know have been one like a total hiatus but maybe about a week or two now just because of the holiday break so I appreciate you guys hanging in there making sure you go to my videos as soon as they drop on leave Wednesdays I appreciate it I came back with something bigger this week guys I have Peck woods not to be confused with back woods this is tactless this is packwood's dot la is out of Los Angeles and I am so excited so be the proud owner of three of them I have all three pack words from LA they're now at planted 13 so you can get packwood's in nevada now at planted 13 so shout out to shot planted 13 that always hook me up with the latest that comes out I got all of these and Nevada from them they have an exclusive one called alien og so I'm excited I have all three so what I want to do today is just do a simple product review with you guys I will include all the links to Packwood's la comm so you guys can go in a site find out with new strands that they're coming up with but I'm just excited about the company so what they have done is infused rolling papers that look like blood papers and they're not they're a handmade hemp wrap paper that they put a vein into it to make it look like it was like an actual plant wrapper this guy's is special because they did three different infuse menteur this they have a concentrate in it they have a premium flower and then on outside they dust it with Keith so I don't even know how strong this is gonna be I don't I don't know how many puffs I'm gonna be able to get all I know is I'm gonna be a little out so I don't want you to judge me but we're gonna get into this I have three brands here this one is the alien OG hopefully you can see that this one is exclusive to Planet 13 once again shout out to them they are sold out maybe out of this one you guys have to call them and see this one is called GABA and this is a hybrid so is the alien og so both of these are hyper some remember hybrids want to keep you nice in the middle that way you can feel the head body high but not too high now this one the purple one is called purple punch and this one is an indica so today I'm not going to smoke Invicta I'm also not gonna smoke this particular hybrid Agathe I'm gonna go for the alien og because I am an alien and I want to get a shot off the plane 213 because this one was exclusive you might not see this one on the market I'm not sure so I wanted to kind of give my review to them as well what I thought of the one they made just for planting 13 customers so we're gonna get into this I'm gonna remove these two to the side so first of all I'm going to just talk about the packaging because you my peeps know when I do a product review I go there I go all the way there first of all I love that this can't break I do know they're going for $60 at the shop so they have $60 here in Nevada we can look up and see what they're going for Vegas but this is $60 so for $60 to Graham would concentrate premium flower and they keep one outside that does an amazing deal and I love that you can't break anything so you don't have to silver fragile because I mean your product is fragile but I love the date took the time to kind of like really design it where it's eye-catching as well and even if you see it inside of this place like it's playing 13 they have done the displays so beautifully so shout out to the pack was marketing team in LA y'all did that it also kind of reminds me in a weird way of a Kylie lipstick if y'all agree with me pop peeps just tell me that in the comment it really does it has that whole trippin thing on the side so this is really a good packaging I I'm impressed with packaging didn't even think that so you just roll it off it's a roll and I hope my camera can get to this so let me come up I want you guys to really see that when you first pull it out and you can really smell it the scent on this is I just love the smell okay so if you can see them holding my hand up you can see the key fits nicely dusted on it outside this part of it is a glass tip so it's gonna allow you to like kind of burn it evenly so you get a nice draw every time you pull that's what the glass tip is supposed to doing this is a nice sized glass citize I would say that's a couple of inches I don't know if you can see that real close up but that's like a two inch glass that's really nice to me it feels like if you had a mini cigar in a way so I kind of I love the feel of it it's nothing to it but to do it we're gonna get into it anything I like that's a blunt or the palm rolls or anything like that I like to light mines with the hemp I know this is a little piece of this is hemp rope I like to light it with that that way it gives me some type of control instead of letting my lighter control everything so that's how I'm gonna do it so choose the you pot peeps shot the Packwood's LA and let's get this alien og from shot planted 13 let's I like to inhale just to make sure I'm pulling everything I must say lighting getting I thought the pool would be happy they go be a lot heavier and it's not it's really smooth and I guess it has something to do with the glass tip now I can tell if you can tell I lit it wrong in here but it should have a nice even lip and because that keep us on the outside it shouldn't burn through fast that's what it shouldn't do if you find yourself in you lit it the wrong way just let it take its time and let they kind of like let it breathe and it'll evenly start to burn around so what I like is that you don't have to put the whole piece in your mouth it burns real light you can just put your mouth right on a tip just like my shirt be on the lookout for shop pop mom for 20 years oh I got that weed weird I like this a little dude not sure what premium flower I do know that the concentrate is nice and to keep this not even coming off on my hand I love that so let's talk a little more in depth about this back once I got my smoking hat on you know I've seen Rick Ross smoked this I've seen you waka flocka the baby little baby what's that other baby skittles baby I don't know one of them other babies they've all had this and now I'm hot moms at it I gotta do this I need a friend shout out to any of my papi friends that want to come share cuz I don't know if I'm gonna finish this this is this is a lot I might have this for the next couple days it's two grounds one person should have to finish this off seriously what did you say when you hi you just don't know what to say I guess you say that [ __ ] was good huh no I hate that y'all see me like this cuz I'm gonna be rolling I don't even know me get anything else doing this is too much this is probably not the best product reveiw to have done

you guys know let me know what you guys think down below before we start would you buy this for 185 before we even light it look at it it's a grenade YUM you can pull the little thing and boo sure let me know down below what you guys like this baby of them so ready we are in the tent as you guys can see I don't bring it back and it's about to get night time for you guys cuz I know a lot of you I wanted to see the night time so stay tuned see if it gets night gang [Music] keep down please smoke everywhere we go [Music] let's go baby fam we got the joint lit as you can see it is ripping you guys you guys see the cherry on that thing I think it's back what you guys think about it yes I really like the tip that it has on it it's like I never seen a tip like that before but I'm really liking it because it keeps all the Scooby Snacks we're coming in your mouth and we also noticed that you don't have to get a hella hard like I thought that you had to be like you know how like when you roll hella fat you've got to hit it hard know that one you can hit it regular like a regular joint and it's hitting really good yeah I'm hitting it way too hard it is pretty heavy you guys there's hella [ __ ] weed in there I mean what the weed included but the tip is pretty heavy left away the tip itself see how much it that's some Gaston I didn't even know there was constant rain there either I just see like the celebrity spike scenes and I was like in aware how much to smoke on what should be cat he was saying that bringing a joint like this is like bringing like a bottle oh yeah like okay it's like usually when you go see like a family friend or just somebody like that's important to you bring him like a like a cake or a bottle you know something for like this nice gift big Oh join make sure if you have it comes to your size I mean if you ever go see your friends you pull up with one of these and yeah and if you live in a set you better keep its rental in your pocket in case you're looking up saw yeah it's kind of running a little bit late yeah that's the only thing that I'm trying to figure out how would you stop that or just [ __ ] probably start lighting the other side once I feel like you need to have like [ __ ] yeah look we did it work to catch it up old fashioned hello saliva you know stop the look going out right hopefully that works let me know what you guys do to stop your plants from running put it on but so far what do you guys what do you think I'm highest luck gets high in here it's boxy to be honest with you I'm gonna give mine to pee I'm not gonna if I go it's its exhibits joint the [ __ ] flavor is could be more flavor II like I've been smoking some SF cultivators wedding pie $61 out the door testing at 31% that [ __ ] is way better way better than this but I mean I don't know maybe maybe I maybe it's the concentrates too though I'm just doing a little bit of flavor yeah I mean honestly I'm gonna keep it really guys I feel like it's not hitting like a hundred percent it could be I think if you roll do be better but yeah you know I don't like the fact that it's running so bad I think that's like my main problem with it and yeah I feel like I'm wasting away I'm so high that I'm just like [ __ ] you know but it's like if I were to rolled it I'd be more pissed because it's like damn you exhibit homies these are hand rolled them I see them making them I'm pretty sure I have no idea what is each test bet just a big flex guys we're smoking a [ __ ] $184 joint what let me know if there's things that you guys feel like it's just for the foot I feel like designer is just for the Flex you know I know bass quality to this testing at 27 percent by the way pretty high 27 percent concentrate don't see any wax running or anything like that either so I'm not really sure where the concentrate is in the joint I mean it is like white ash though all the way yeah it definitely does the job oh yeah let's play baseball you know what I was thinking is that like it's a big guys joint you want it to last you how long Lee I don't know I didn't set a timer but it's feel like I'm going kind of fast yeah yeah you right sure it's eight I mean there's still no cuz it's hella fat but it's like you think you'll be just custom ah don't underestimate you guys and then I just want to remind you guys to go cup some lady where a wave emerged a very explosive second exclusive that we got the sweats on Ted I got them on today real one make sure you guys go cop it going real quick thank you guys for supporting us shout out the whole way and we appreciate you guys for getting us here we got bigger things coming you guys oh my god looks like gonna burn your lips I know follow me let me like the other side back because I really like easy burn me I have bad luck burning myself with it I bet you as the video when it started it was not that smoky and now it's like the only thing I don't like okay so we're getting to the end what are you guys thinking is this what is $285 honestly it's not $1 i'ma tell you why you guys polite you could just get so much weed with that money you could just roll so many blunts that just getting so much higher I don't know that's my s what I so I think creating for me was worth it listen out listen up so it's a pandemic I can't come to accept that much I only hang out with them so much I only have so much time so we got to get hella [ __ ] high in a short amount of time [Music] want to get hella high in a short amount of time that's a good way and there's a lot of money well but it was worth it yeah it was worth anything I think I would buy it if I was like gonna go see ya like a friend that I haven't seen him tell along and like your city just said you're gonna top the whole chain because this thing was a [ __ ] but she doesn't really need a [ __ ] damn I feel like I'm hella re inhaling all the smoke we want some water free I got you Brandon thank you like really even higher we just

tonight's episode we're gonna be doing extreme review on some durban poison so if you guys saw a couple clips to go a couple videos ago it gave you guys a sneak peek or an up close shot of this durban poison here we went out to locals can a house or recreational pot shop that we normally go to and we went out there they happen to have a menu now one that's actually uh you guys have ever been to a fancy restaurant and got the fancy bucking you know menu and [ __ ] they sit there and open up well they've never menu there they could open up you can check out all their strings and [ __ ] and they have like you know 20 30 40 50 [ __ ] that hundreds of strange but like anywhere from 20 to 50 strains in different price categories i SAT there I looked through aids and stuff and I found some durban poison here and before we get into our strand review i'm going to show you guys a quick close up shot of this package and also read what's on the package here then after that will actually get into the strain review of this durban poison so you guys see there it's actually in a plastic container you guys notice one of these little medicated or [ __ ] medicine pop tops which i [ __ ] hate i love glass by hate your [ __ ] little plastic pop tops put this in your pocket and well they're going to read but as you can see they're got the package there durban poison all that good stuff got some weed in there re so it's gotten read broke quickly what it says here on the package and then get into the strain review of this durban poison here so like I said this is durban poison so that locals can a house producer was Rainier acres this is a three and a half grams this was harvested on 12 23 a 2015 so about over a little bit over three months ago potency analyst says that the total THC in this is 18.4 percent THC and then it goes into TC itself is 0.7 percent CBD is 0.1 percent thca is 20.2 percent and then of course at the bottom there has the barcode and stop turn down the music a little bit then of course it says at the bottom which I probably haven't read this before on the show but I'll read it here this product has intoxicating effects and may be happy to farming this product may be unlawful outside of Washington State and then of course oh [ __ ] just about dropped it what does it say here premium cannabis Washington State Rainier acres so that's what I was reading there that's damn that's what it says all right there's party so it's gotten get into the strain review I've durban poison so automatically go with the price I'd start off with here and i paid forty bucks for three and a half grams so right off the bat we're gonna have to rate the price eight three out of five that's just an average price of an eight or no an eighth of some cannabis here in washington state all the way around 40 bucks for three and half gram such as pretty average that's not a great deal so three now or three out of five for the price for this at durban poison here so next up we're going to open this [ __ ] up here we're a smell it we're gonna see if it smells good as well as if it's very strong very pungent log package weed here so here we go guys just open this [ __ ] office even smells like I get a pine lemony diesel sweet smell there's a sweet lemon pine and diesel smell you smile a little bit of pine a little bit of earthiness a little hint of sweet lemon god damn this [ __ ] to smoke really good and just a very very strong skunky almost deeply smelled there's kind of a funky type of smoke but they'll be very strong very loud package me this [ __ ] burns my eyes as well as my [ __ ] nose how strong this [ __ ] is holy [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] pungent [ __ ] weed hmm this [ __ ] here when you smell like gives you that staying face that oh [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that but again in good with holy damn so the smell test of five out of five great smelling weed sweet time sweet lemon with that funky diesel strong skunky smell to it and don't be very strong very pungent very loud package lead so all the way around five out of five to the smell test so next up we're gonna pull this but out here and that like I showed you guys are to give you close up shot above the entire eight and as you guys notice there are all buds like this here I wouldn't call them pop corn dogs because I noticed you know a lot of people complaining about having stems in their weed so what I uh I've seen pot shops or producers actually do is sit there take a full bud you know a big top bud and then start breaking it down into little butts like this so you guys actually don't get stem when you buy your product you get more weed than stem but what I notice here is that all the buds are perfectly manicured the density is just [ __ ] ridiculous like super rock art no flex no nothing and then on a scale to dress up to dress to freshen to dry is just [ __ ] perfect like got to freshen not too dry and not too loud like the [ __ ] music but straight up all three categories categories Jesus Christ I can barely speak but all three density skeleton fresh teeth dry as well as the manager job all the way around a 5 out of 5 all these bugs were perfectly manicured no lead whatsoever I didn't find one leaf on anybody at all and we're down to the bottom here and manicured job like I said just professional 5 out of 5 density and five out of five broad card and I'll skeleton fresh you drive perfect and it's a little bit sticky just a little bit that's perfect so the bud is just perfect all the way around probably the best but I've ever had or you know the best looking but are the best all the way around bud I've actually purchased at some out of pot shop so next up we're going to load this [ __ ] up here we're just going to smoke a bowl then after we're done smoking our bowl here we'll get into our a official review here of this durban poison and then of course will at the end of it will include our green space test what it tastes like on the first hit or after greens taste test see what it tastes like after a couple hints and then of course the high and then the official review of the durban poison here so enough talking hopefully that didn't take too long holy [ __ ] already eight minutes trying to make this a little bit quicker strand of you and real quickly guys before we get into that I want to show you guys my new bowl I guess you could say I've actually had it for a couple years now but I went and cleaned it up there because I noticed that up this thing here or this bowl piece the number one W it has a large hole in it so when I go to smoke out of it I have to have a screen in it so if I'm using a screen I normally have to keep the inside of this kind of dirty or kind of resonated so then the screen will actually you know fit in there and have something to grip on to you because when the glass is all clean like this the screen and the bullets just going to flop all around and because the hole in this is a little too big that'll suck bleep through I you know I can't completely one hundred percent clean it but I did find this [ __ ] here and this one here are the small hole in it as you guys to see I was able to 100% quickly clean it and what I noticed also is it actually looks a lot better on the green bastard than the old one does so look at that I'll check that out so fancy tell you that that looks nice doesn't it see that's a new one and then there's old one clear that it looks like yet why it's dirty hey guys you guys see there since the ball already popped out small hole there but got that all cleaned up there so you don't have any resin taste or anything like that when we do our interview so enough rambling on and [ __ ] hope you guys at home IRA smoking device little guys were joining herb you honey all the wives hashkee shouted colorable whatever spoke down can discuss Oh Jonah with me and as always to get hit challenge guys hopping up all loaded up every time you see me check it as a marriage of water i want you guys at home to smoke along and do the same so enough talking let's get the smoking try to find a song here and then get to smoke in and toast guys here we go durban poison screen review never smoked during poison ever this is the very first time I've actually ever had some durban poison in my entire life sir we go guys to have been smoking on it so enough rambling I need to find a song again to smoke okay I'll take that one [ __ ] it re go guys sorry you can get a close up shot here oh thank you guys are what a justice here let me just a little hit feel like that's just up too high hopefully that's a little bit better all right let's go ahead and take a big group here so I definitely got the Greens taste us and after green to his desk gonna get the smoked up and see what kind of how we get do what kind of shot harwin take one more hit here that ball piece is just so much bigger [ __ ] milk sup it's almost like having a little mini ashcatcher attachment on to it holy [ __ ] I noticed that there was much splash back or nothing I didn't have much water going up into the [ __ ] uh type of the mouthpiece there think there's goods are better air flow with this one the holy [ __ ] the difference in the bull peas just a little bit different right there just getting a little bit bigger one that ma'fucker just completely changed that [ __ ] water bike there's clearly knew I was the [ __ ] device there that rips like nobody's business holy [ __ ] well what I [ __ ] wing cleaned up o P sub cuz it just hits way better well you said what up with that well there it is alright so I was going to give to this official review of this durban poison here all right are you so first up the price was forty bucks for three and a half grams average price a weed here in Washington state has been for you know at least ten years now since I've been buying weed so three out of five for the prize forty bucks from you half grams like I said average price of wheat here in Washington State so not a great deal at all but not a bad deal either so throughout a fire for the price next up the oh my goodness the smell test there we go the smell test so it's not pretty damn good gosh with you smell really great just very lemony very piney and very easily it was like a strong skunky but it was like a super skunk mixed with that funky diesel smoke guys have ever smelled sour diesel has a really strange funky smell to it but definitely some very good smelling weed or should say some great smelling weed that's very as well very strong and very loud package weed it almost [ __ ] burn my eyes and my nose like for some reason every time I go and get some marijuana some recreational pot every single week the smell is just getting stronger and stronger this [ __ ] here very strong probably the loudest pack [ __ ] a weed I've ever had my entire life this year's really really strong smelling like I bet you can put a grammar this in your house and within about 15 minutes your entire house will just be freaking a weed with a gram of that [ __ ] just laying out on the table holy [ __ ] on a 5 out of 5 for the smell test and the next up on the bus just a 5 out of 5 across the board the density was great the [ __ ] the scale too fresh to dry perfect all the way around even a little bit stinky which is awesome as well as the manicure job manicured golf professional manicure job no leaf and also manicure job density as well scale too fresh to drive 5 out of 5 for all three just some great [ __ ] perfectly manicured and cured but they'll be a great job on that then in the green space test just a very strong cash kind of th like purity she tastes like guys Maria had the first hit of past or that first hit of some Keith maybe that greens hit a keep or something just that purity diesel [ __ ] tight stage is a very strong PTA mix with a little bit of sweet pie so 5 out of 5 for the Greens taste has definitely very great tasting of sweet as well as very strong very long-lasting on the palate I using that even as I'm talking Delphie can still taste that [ __ ] very strong Kashi sweet time k still on my palate so 5 out of 5 for the greens taste test and also a 5 out of 5 for the after Green chased us every single okay even the fourth fifth and six hit there still tastes like we had a brand-new bowl so it tastes like a brand-new [ __ ] green bowl right on top there some great [ __ ] tasting [ __ ] so a 5 out of 5 for dr. Greene States has still to taste that hash eNOS make sure that hint of sweet pine to it like I said brand new green hit are you know kids like a green hit or green sit on every single hit so far about five for the green paint and then the high as you guys could tell this [ __ ] is Duffy used to keep a dominate cuz I'm having a hard time [ __ ] talking like I definitely have a very very strong afford [ __ ] head high I don't have very much from the body high at all definitely a very strong and poor cat I so adeptly have to give a high of 5 out of 5 mission definitely got me stone in the couple hits that I did take a bit I'm definitely you know I wouldn't have to smoke anymore weed tonight I think I'd be good you know I'd be perfect even though it's me so I'm probably gonna smoke some more weed but if I you know what needed to or if I wanted to I could easily just stop smoking right now and just be good for the rest of night so I'm definitely stoned a 5 out of 5 for the price so my official review of this durban poison here this is some really [ __ ] great ship you're someone who wants some are you know you're someone who likes to smoke in the morning or maybe like to smoke during the day I definitely recommend you guys to go to your recreational black market or even your medical dealer wherever you go get your on cannabis at go see if you can get yourself some durban poison you like I say if you're someone like to smoke in the morning I smoke during the day you know like should get high and do some activities then definitely go ahead and pick up some double oh [

another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to

deuces", "IfirM2TEC9w": "[Music] all right what's going on you guys so today we're gonna be going over what three hundred dollars would get you at a one plant dispensary here in Florida I actually have two three hundred dollar purchases that I've recently made here that I'm gonna be going over and referring back and forth to here in this video so we'll actually get kind of a bonus and just see what two three hundred dollar purchases will look like but first I have been promising you guys a 420 giveaway coming up which I'm gonna be giving away this star weed right here this is actually a CBD dominant strain of cannabis and I'm gonna be giving this away as long as it is legal in your state this is gonna be a United States giveaway only if you don't want the CBD weed you can actually opt out for a medical marijuana license that's what I'll offer in return if you don't want the actual CBD weed but how we're gonna go about this giveaway this would be pretty fun is we're gonna whoever can guess the amount of grams in this jar or get the closest to it will get it and that's how it will go so over the next couple videos this will be going on until the week before 4/20 so every video will be a new chance for you to actually comment on a video and we'll leave what you think how many grams is in the jar so make sure to leave a comment in the comment section below on what you think is in the door how many grams so let's get right into it and see what we got here you guys I honestly have only purchased from one plant only three times actually a not I really wish I had purchased from them way before now because they're they're weed is just completely different than anything else I've had on the entire Florida cannabis market so far it's completely different let's check this out [Music] there's there's a lot of plastic waste here that's for sure but you know that's from every dispensary I have about an ounce and pre-rolls I have thirty pre-rolls which Allah gram he's so little over an ounce and pre-rolls and then I have actually a quarter of actual whole weed right here which we'll take a look at in just a minute as well but first let's let's just take a look at some of these pre-rolls I got pre-rolls because I mean honestly for the price you can't go wrong so let's take a look at what I got here I've got ten joints of Mac one these were coming in at seventeen point three eight percent THC now these Mac one joints are really good these are probably my second favorite pre-roll that I've had from them so far really good strain all the pre-rolls themselves have really burned good so far only three rolls that I've had that haven't burned good so far were ones that were maybe ground up a little bit too much and it didn't want to smoke that good nejoy me because it was as I think Darth Raven was one of those but it was just because it was ground up a little bit too much and that was the other gnat although joint actually smoked really good Darth Raven is the other strain that I got it's coming in actually a little bit higher this time because the first time I got it was only at a 16 percent I believe 18 percent this time a little bit higher that's nice and I also got dirty limits and we're gonna smoke one of those joints right now these this 30 lemons joint coming in at 25 percent THC I mean that is pretty good for for them I haven't seen anything felt that high come out of there yep did see blueberry muffin coming in at 22 percent but mostly everything really looks like has been between like 16 and 20 percent but it has all been extremely extremely good wheat I will definitely be buying more like I said it's come it's a totally different ball game than all the other wheat in Florida they're doing something way different I'm not sure exactly what they're doing front if it's in the soil grow or if it's in the cure but it's definitely it's definitely there you guys so whatever you're doing over there don't change it we can we can tell so let's fire one of these dirty lemon joints up I mean this has been a really good strain it's actually really indica heavy for me this is uh this is definitely one of those indica heavy strains for me I found out I should only smoke this strain at night time for me at least it makes me really tired there's just no other better name for this strain honestly dirty lemons that's that's the first thing you take I mean it's it literally tastes like a dirty lemon on the exhale especially you get this real lemony citrus taste huh followed by this earthy dirty earthy taste I mean there's just no other better name for this rating besides dirty linen whoever named the string nailed it for sure and this is just an awesome phyno of it I mean the taste is just coming through it's just amazing the chirps on this is outrageous all right so let's take a look and talk about some of the prices and take a look at some of the weed the first delivery I actually got from them was right at $300 and it wasn't my first purchase my first purchase was actually the Kim D which you guys may have seen that video it's a whole video about the Kim D but my first actual delivery was right at $300 I did get a little bit of a discount you get the 25% discount for your first time for your first delivery plus you get the $25 off if you spend over $125 so that's the goal to me especially because you know everything from them right now is delivery they only have one dispensary so everything gets delivered straight to you straight to your house which honestly I thought was gonna be a real pain but it wasn't so it actually turned out to be more convenient for me than anything which I didn't expect to go that way so pretty nice on this first one for $300 I had one tier one string quarter four to eight I had six Darth Raven pre-rolls I had ten Mac one pre-rolls and then I had Mendocino Minaj that was pretty good it was kind of low in THC 14% but again still it was it was really really good it honestly is better than a lot of stuff that I've had some truly even at those percentages so it just has to do with the terpenes and and how the you know who's picking the fie nose and all that stuff and who bred it that'll do a lot for you so sharp d the tier one quarter at when you're buying it in a quarter and not just an eighth price a Nathan's gonna cost you $68 she has kind of expensive but when you buy it in a quarter it's a hundred and twenty bucks and it just keeps getting cheaper from there you can get an ounce of this for the three hundred and sixty eight dollars it is I believe it's under four hundred dollars but when you bite in an ounce like that you earn excuse me an ounce when you buy it in an ounce it's just it's way cheaper that's nice that they're doing ounce discounts that really can make a difference especially when you're buying like that that is hitting that hit really hard real fast Wow and then you can see on here the Darth Raven one gram joints were eight dollars apiece great price I mean you can't beat that eight dollars for a gram joint I mean I was even taking these things breaking them down and rolling to half gram joints out of it and getting a really nice joint out of it and still you know I was able to smoke a good joint of some organic real organic weed for four bucks I mean not bad at all or smoked a you know break it went down smoking in a ball it was I wasn't doing bad with that at all men devasena Manoj again eight dollars a gram for a gram joint and then Mac one was the only Tier one joint that I had got for that first go-round and that was $10 a gram totally worth it I'll pay that every time so that's what I had got for my first go-round and honestly the sharp deep flower this just that was just amazing let's take a look at that actually that was only coming in at 15 percent THC but I have to give it to to them on this one this was the absolute best smoke I've had yet in the entire throughout the entire Florida medical program of them having a flower this would be my number one all-around best smoke yet hands down good job you guys [Music] I was really really happy with that one so the second purchase that I did was just over actually it was well it was about three hundred and fifty dollars here so $25 off for a delivery because I got over $125 so that knocked a little bit off so that was nice so again Mac one pre-rolls I of course I loaded up on them you can't go wrong with those the Mac one dirty lemons coming in at 25 percent THC of course that's a Tier one strain ten dollars a gram totally worth it look how far I am into the joint and I am just absolutely feeling fantastic I can you can't go wrong with that Darth ray eight dollars a gram can beat us I mean every joint you get it truly biz 13 dollars a gram right off the bat there's no tear to it or anything like that and you you you know you're getting really the same quality of weed let I actually broke one of these Mac one joints open and it's just amazing what's inside let's take a look real quick [Music] [Music] it's absolutely packed with just trichome heads and keep you can see it all throughout the joint like I said I was breaking those joints open and just packing bowls or rolling half joints and I was doing great like that and making this build a long way for the price that's it's um it's one of the probably the one of the best purchases I've made so far - really really good and of course I got some Mandarin triangle cush it's an ethos string I can't you know I can't not fight that I you guys know that I'm a big fan of Colin Gordon and I always have to pick up his strain if it's a hit one of his strains if it's available wherever I go I always try to see what is coming out it's just absolutely beautiful there are some big nugs in here - check this out [Music] [Music] very sweet with some very subtle earthy tones but mostly mostly just sweet you can really smell that Mandarin awesome awesome stuff coming in at 20.4% THC not too bad you know I really think that you know the THC percentages might be coming in a little bit lower because they're of their soil growing everything but let me tell you what whatever they're doing over there soil growing or something with I don't know what they're doing over there like I said but I hope they don't change it because it has been the absolute best flower so far I've had on the market that's no lie I really hope you guys don't change anything over there please so the Mandarin triangle cush coming in at $84 for a quarter when you buy a quarter it's a tier 2 strain but to me honestly all the tiers have been good I haven't had a single bad thing from them yet that I didn't like even with the TAC percentages being low like that it's all just been felt like I said this this herb D at 15% has been my favorite smoked yet so there's there's definitely something to the terpenes and phyno picking and the breeding and all that it there's definitely something to all of that for sure the biggest difference is to me and the weed that I've had from one plant is really the first thing that you notice of course is when you touch it and you break it open and you see it you can visually see the trichomes on this it's not like it's missing trichomes and when you break it apart you're actually left with your finger sticky like you know it's it's actually the bud stick it's cured right there doing a different curing process over there than they are at truly for cure leaf whatever they're doing to cure this bud is the correct way to cure it and trim it it's just it's not lacking and and the stickiness at all it's this there it makes your fingers actually sticky this would pass the wall test and the other thing is it doesn't burn my throat now there's something about all that but this is extremely less harsh on my throat I mean in a major way I'm not sure what the difference is when it comes to that if it has to do with it with the nutrients maybe if a plant growth regulars I really have no clue but there is a major difference in this bud when it comes to that and if anybody has any insight or clue as to what that may be that I'm talking about with the harshness of the bud and smoking it please leave a comment in the comment sections I would really like to do a video about that talk about that more in the future so for a grand total of three hundred and thirty nine dollars after my discount this is what I got a quarter of the Mandarin triangle cush and thirty of the pre rolls which of course is what is you know it's ten nine grams over an ounce that's uh thirty seven grams of weed or three hundred and thirty nine dollars in my opinion you can't go wrong with that so good job you guys at one plan I just I have to give it to you I'm extremely happy with what I've been buying especially like I said with the bud that's it for today's video you guys I hope you enjoyed it and remember to Like and subscribe if you did and remember tried to guess the the grams how many grams are in the jar each video will give you a new chance like I said to actually guess on that and I think that would be pretty fun so we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music]", "pMeXFWcpyws": "okay I'm doing a video and the strain that I have for today is if you can read that it's fitmin Girl Scout cookies absolutely wonderful strain I mean this thing smells just like chocolate cookies we'd like a little bit of mint it's just perfect very great bag appeal um hmm yeah I need a better camera you know and I will I'm in the process of getting Wenders in a budget lots of different shades of green light green forest green there's even some purple right there tons of orange hairs it's just a great gorgeous but to behold and it smells wonderful this is a very good social smoke it's something that's very pleasant you know on to taste but it's really really nice it's always a treat when you have meds that smell and taste really good oh that's good that's tasty oh man mmm so thinman Girl Scout cookies is a hybrid strain and it's Durbin poison crossed with og cush so you get two really good strains oh I love oh gee cush and dirty poison is another one that I really love pain relief and the hi are both a creeper didn't really feel anything to like I started on my third Bowl but maybe I smoked a little fast move in a hurry um but the beginning of it is that Durbin poison really shines I mean I was talkative so so happy just out there very wonderful way to start your day but I noticed that after that I kind of started coming down getting a nice very super relaxed feeling not couch locked but just I was very very very comfortable I was so comfortable I wound up taking a nap and man it was it was a great felt very refreshed didn't even have the munchies after but from what I read this is good for loss of appetite insomnia anxiety nausea swelling and severe pain and the pain relief is wonderful I love it that's it about maybe three three and a half hours long so that was nice and the high was nice too probably a good hour and a half and another maybe hour of just buzzing in and out but uh it was great I would definitely buy this again I've had Girl Scout cookies before but this is probably the best kind of stuck because I've had who ever goodness did a wonderful job so thank you keep doing that man I love when I get okay disappoint when you go and you got weed it doesn't even smell at all doesn't any taste I mean I know it's all about the pain relief and stuff and all the benefits from it but yeah it doesn't hurt that tastes good doesn't hurt you know to enjoy even more it is already enjoyable", "i5fuNWGBVhg": "welcome to marijuana etiquette today I will be sharing with you the top five rated sativa strains number one and Misha haze honestly out get this strain not be number one amnesia haze is an all-time favorite and Amsterdam's coffee shops and quickly became one of the most recognized TV strains of all time amnesia is no random name for this haze indeed under her influence you might have a hard time keeping track of you're trying to thaw while she is incredibly inspiring and creatively boosting she is one of those strains with which you can come to realize the ultimate purpose of life but then forget about it she has a unique smell that's easy to remember sweet and lemony with a balanced earthy undertone with an average THC content of 22% and Mia haze can take you to the other side after all she's one powerful mistress number two Cali miss Callie mist is a very well-known almost pure sativa strain that comes from the master breeders of serious seeds she delivers a very strong energetic and clear minded high one that is said to be particularly enjoyed by women Cali mist has a sweet and nutty taste that induces a very potent high the THC content of Cali miss tends to be in the region of 22% so you know she is one of the big players number three Sour Diesel Sour Diesel is one of the original sour strains and is one of the few sativa dominant varieties Saira diesel is behind the success of our Sara strains that have become so popular recently this smelly powerhouse is the parent of many hybrids so if you like sour she's the big mama as you would expect the bud has a very earthy sour and jet fuel like taste with pleasant pine undertones while her THC content of 16% is a bit lower than that of the other contenders she still packs a punch the high is long lasting strong and mind centered without any body effects whatsoever number four trainwreck as the name suggests she's a heavy hitter with almost 90% sativa Genetics she will induce an intense cerebral high that very slowly fades out however what sucks trainwreck apart from other sativa strains is her indica body load along with the cerebral stimulation she will almost death we find you to the couch and tingle through your limbs this rather unique combination is the reason this strain is a favorite among medical users it's a complete high with a cerebral Rush and physical relaxation the bud has an earthy pine quality to it and produces a zesty lemon undertone with a THC content of 18% trainwreck is a respectable sativa that will surely satisfy number 5 Jack Herer Jack Harris an old-school sativa dominant strain that has gone down in history as one of the most decorated and renowned strains ever named after the activists in cannabis Paragon Jack Herer there could be no other fitting strain if you're looking to see what premium old-school cannabis was really about with 55% sativa genetics Jack Herer isn't as pure of a sativa as the previously presented strains and yet it induces a superb clear potent and happy cerebral high the but itself has a predominantly pine flavor with strong woody and earthy undertones it produces a very potent high that both encapsulate the best sativa and indica effects you can expect a strong and clear head high that will leave you happy and uplifted whilst the indica affects simply and gently lower your body into bliss the THC content of Jack hair can vary between 20 to 24 percent so it is definitely a strain for those who need some power this concludes the top 5 sativa strains list thanks for watching please comment like share and

their private reserve so it's going for like fifty dollars in eight wonderful stuff though I really enjoy medicating with the student cookies and I couldn't find much information about this the only thing I know is that this is a cross between durban poison and girl scout cookies I went up looking about [ __ ] cookies and the only thing isn't finding reference [ __ ] cookies was an interview with burner when he was asked a question who's part of the cookies family and jig his name came up so I don't know if this is maybe one of his creations but this is really what this is really wonderful and really well grown whoever did this for a good job it's got a nice kind of earthy pungent spiciness to it a little bit of sweetness in there but overall it's got wonderful bag appeal a good smell good taste wonderful high and the effects are wonderful as well great pain relief if you give me with chronic pain this is a really good strain for that because it's like it does only deal with like lessening the pain kind of lowering bringing it down but also on your like you don't you do it like chronic pain sometimes you're constantly irritated agitated aggravated even you know because you know you dealing with pain constantly this kind of brings that valor you know it kind of settles the nerves chills the emotions you just kind of put you in a nice euphoric happy state of mind and that kind of stuff goes a long way especially when you're dealing with other people yeah and strangers who don't know you or what you're going into but still wonderful strange totally enjoyed medicating with this and I hit this thing drop the whole entire day wake and bake all into like evening time so like right before bed and I didn't have no problems with being lethargic or pumps going to sleep it was a really good strain for me so take a quick toke sir with the hit to like and then a screw the more on the strain the [ __ ] cookies is up I couldn't find much information but it feels like it might be our 60 for you in the car something along that line is very well balanced but it just feels a lot more comfy on the body than that anything else but I did medicate with this and I had no problems throughout the day it's a stony strain yet is functional so for me this would be like a good day type in the car I don't know this is an indica dominant you guessing because I have no idea what the what the ratios are on this just kind of quite off my own experience it didn't catch me throughout the day but I feel like if I wanted to I could the galloping cofactor was wonderful so if you've got like stuff to do or people kind of pushing you along let's go it's not a problem to like to kind of get into gear and go ahead with with your day you know it's a really wonderful strain Frank comfy yet functional you know and I like that I like that in a strain because the stuff that I need it's good for like anxiety and stress and it's uplifting enough that you know it would be good for your depression and it's very relaxing so it's good for the pain relief it didn't sedate me it didn't intoxicate me it just gave me a nice stony kind of a high and nice wonderful body butters the mind was still active so it's a good schaefer for me I would say anytime throughout the whole entire day there's not like daytime or nighttime but the whole entire day was good man but yeah it can't get comfy so maybe if you did want to if he has a pic of time if you're like real susceptible to falling asleep get to the target easy then maybe I want to see this more the evening time but I don't think so i think probably using any time of the day man i was black this all morning so even right now it's morning time token this up but yeah anyhow man [ __ ] cookies my wonderful stuff",

two jp checking in respect my region.com here in chicago illinois we just had to fix and doctor the cookies pre-roll go watch the other video this entire finger length roughly half the pre-roll was dumped into the bottom of this i could literally pour out the dust and so what we did here to give the collins aven cookies flower an actual authentic review just at least on the quality of the flower i went ahead massage it out and forced all the weed that was in the top half of the joint on this side i shook it down and twisted you can see how much paper right how much space there really was so man already failed cookies on the quality of this cannot believe i just experienced that five years in the cannabis industry i've never seen a joint do that before absolutely unacceptable here we go the way we do the taste test pre-roll reviews if you guys don't know yet is one hit talk about it two hits score out of ten three hits overall score now again i already failed this product because half of the flower had fallen through the mouthpiece into the bottom of the pre-roll just destroyed and when you pay 18 and then a 30 tax on top of that that comes up to a 25 pre-roll roughly unacceptable here we go still getting scooby snacks because they put literally just dust they just put dust in the whole pre-roll really just disappointed man it's super frustrating all right there's the first hit taste wise tastes like earthy piney gas it doesn't necessarily taste like gelato kind of gas or like a og kush kind of guys but for the collins ab strain it does have a little bit of sweet gassiness to it the ash is kind of light colored so shout out to them for that scorebox out of 10 i'm gonna give this a i'm gonna give this an eight flat it's sweet it's piney but it's not super super super delicious it's not like oh my gosh i really want to smoke this again uh kind of weed quality but at this point they've already burned the bridge because again i paid 23 four dollars for a joint that's just not worth it at the end of the day so overall 82.5 is the final score in terms of this smoking experience if it was a half gram indoor growing pre-roll for like 10 bucks but the reality is is that this is still gonna get a failing grade 20 plus dollar gram joint half of the flour was just gone disintegrated again watch the other video let me know what you guys think if you've tried cookies in chicago please be sure to drop a comment share your experience if you had a similar experience be sure to let me know subscribe to respect my region and i will see you guys on the next review love you all peace", "cTCFY628FcE": "[Music] what's up YouTube coming at you with another strain review today was looking at cherry pie cherry pies across between Durbin pause and the

cherry type vibe going on with us and I was very good and I think everybody would like house me that there's nobody that I wanted um on the drive toka has that same type of feel on it when you are burning it on on the inhale that has a very strong on sour cherry type own vibe going on and then on the exhale as I got cherry Joey type tasters they're good and that's a very good strand right here now go did an excellent job on it as you can see is very crystal a very dense sticky super sticky as you get super tasters everything I'll recommend cherry fighting anybody ever see this try is good

and there he said the one that is first to walk past the village of the cannibals usually ends up in the pot now here you find that I was the one that for the past 21 years they sought to put me in the pot but I survived I survived and the fact that I'm still here today still happy and positive about life and I am privileged and honored to have led to this battle it's our time time so our task is towards making the people of South Africa see the value of cannabis and to change the conversation away from recreational drug use into industry how do we make cannabis work for the people of South Africa let's make use of our people you know the fact that people are burning in order to improve their lives people don't want to look for handouts people want to work for themselves and what cannabis we are going to give them an opportunity to do that South Africa is the place that is the most suitable for cannabis growth on earth we have 300 out of 365 days that are considered sunshine days in South Africa which means that we can grow 3 crops in this country and the ability to make medicine from the cannabis that we grow in South Africa it's tremendous and that is what we are going to export to other parts of the world and that is how we're going to repatriate the currency that was stolen from Africa instead of putting people in jail let's put people to work on the farmers growing the herb for the healing of there are your Bushmen [Music] [Laughter]", "CHNNXN1RjbI": "Oh good morning today we're talking cherry pie this is Oscar a sweet relief in the herb nerd segment so welcome guys this is Oscar with sweet relief and we are looking at some cherry pie bud right here and I wanted to do a deep dive on this for our first video just because cherry pie to me has been such a classic strain it really has like the classic coke of pot characteristics it really seems to smell taste and at least affect me like how I imagined a stereotypical cannabis train would hit taste and be it's an incredibly smooth strain when grown properly the batch that we currently have in a story and a little bit left in Scappoose is incredibly smooth you know if you're somebody that has sensitive lungs or wants to consume something in a smoke fashion that's not harsh or coughing do seem cherry pie is a great strain to check out so let's take a peek into what we've got going on here so but I punched up cherry pie into Google it says his parents are granddaddy purple across with Durbin poison I got lots of orange hair is touch of purple smells of sweet and sour cherry pie a little bit of a stretch but it's it really is that sweet punchy just great cannabis smell and a great flavor hits in a couple minutes sticks around for hours I'd say that's pretty accurate so cherry pie and I don't know if this is accurate still because there are some ways that people are able to take a clone only strain and manipulate it into producing strain-specific seeds using things like colloidal silver and there may be some other fancy tricks that people have but clone only is what this seed finder EU and this is a very trusted site for lineage and where I go to get a lot of research but as you can see it you know as a really good smell the the floral smell shines through the the effects are are fairly even the seven points who's the grower of this puts it on an indica leaning I feel it's it's pretty close to even 50/50 in effects for me I mean everybody's a little bit different but they say muscle relaxant pain relief and saw me an appetite anxiety and stress and I would go easy on the insomnia cherry pie for me has never really been a knockout punch but again for some people your mileage may vary but I I would lean on and saw me a curing affects on this drain this is one of my favorite aspects of this seed finder EU is this lineage in genealogy and you got to put a grain of salt on this because this can be anecdotal it's it's probably backed up as best to anybody can in regards to cannabis which has a tumultuous history due to its legality in the past made it a little bit more difficult to keep accurate track of things but cherry pie like thing you've mentioned is across remaindermen poison and granddaddy purple Durbin poison bean in African sativa and we'll get into that here in just a second but as you can see it's just what it is Durbin poison is forkin Durbin poison granddaddy purple however is like it says Mendel perched crossed with a skunk and Afghanistan strain in skunker ironically is an Afghanistan strain crossed with some other landrace sativas mexican sativa and Colombians the Teemo so you have kind of already some hybridization in with the GDP granddaddy purple which makes for a really complex nice strain because what you've got essentially is a heavy African sativa with some little little bass notes of Mexican and Colombia sativa bookended a little bit with these Afghanistan in I'm assuming they're indicas there are some sativa leaning Afghan varieties but this is it's the on the indica side so you have a lot going on in there but really the only indica holding its own is the Afghanistan strain in with this you've got three other sativas and so that's where I really feel you get a nice balanced effect so it's let's dive into so here is the Durban poison and this is a South Africa and sativa that was brought in in bred never hybridized and like we said as a whole hundred-percent sativa you got a little bit of that licorice flavor in it and it's got a similar up high like a Thai string but like a Thai strain for me at least these Durban poisons can be a little racy and a little they can be a little much and they can sneak up on you too especially if they're cured properly the Durban poison is gonna kind of keep creeping for about a good 15 minutes and I know for me when I'm enjoying a joint I'm enjoying a joy and sometimes they can you can sneak up and bite me so uh does not look like there's a whole lot of lineage so just this it's basically like what we saw on the other one in that it's just a straight sativa so it's kind of interesting like see you nothing I really have a whole lot of knowledge on some interesting name strains crossed with it so that's the Durbin poison and then the granddaddy purple is an interesting project and this is it I'm not sure for sure but I know it's one of the first strains that's really kind of had like a branding to it it definitely is legendary and it's there's a lot of sub fee notes to it but it's it's been a great strain nice yielder as you can see and then um okay so they basically have kept to the same thing sometimes they'll give a little bit different history or different lineage on the base strain which can give a little bit more background but again you're looking at the that skunk which is a combination of Afghanistan II indica Mexican sativa and then crossed with the straight Afghanistan so again Cherry Pie great string great hybrid you've got a lot of history in with it you've got a lot of great land race sativas tied in with what seems to be a singular Afghanistan indica and something I really enjoy I hope you guys got a lot

today before Christmas why not make a video you can see from my previous video literally seven days and this thing has doubled in height it's going for it now that big bag is surely giving it enough space to draw everything's looking happy and growing see that just new leaves forming growing even on the lower branches you can see some more branches forming it's gonna turn it into a beautiful big plant just further a bit I can see you at the bottom she is weird patterns on the leaves also called leaf miners they lay their eggs and actually go into the leaf eat the matter and in that part eyes but they seem to be under control I've seen some ladybugs on my plants so hopefully they keep the pests at bay yeah kind of worry this is going to be another two months of full bro and this plant is going to become a huge huge thing more worried about trimming it and actually anything else whether you guys you know trimming is a big mission but just a quick update christmas time is here for everyone in south africa and yeah keep growing and have a Merry Christmas and stay well people Jess", "mKrqfPOIWSU": "yeah you guys go out there up your pre-roll game if you get it in a cardboard box and it's uh they're dry grab yourself a pack case throw above it in there let it sit for 24 hours your experience will be completely different than smoking a dry pre-roll nobody wants to do that anymore so let's let's change that welcome everybody this is anthony with boveda joined today by cody ziering with pac case how the hell are you buddy i'm good i'm good i'm coming off vacation so i'm still uh still a little bit of vacation mode um which is always a fun little area to be in no doubt uh best part about vacation is on the way their worst part of vacation is coming back to the office and seeing 18 000 emails waiting for you it happens all the time i know yeah so it's just been pitchforking out of that but um things are good yeah there's a lot going on here a lot of things to talk about today absolutely industry's booming boveda is booming pack cases booming let's get to it where do you want to start i mean you want to start with i guess how we kind of ran into each other years ago yeah absolutely this has been a long time coming no doubt um where was that i think mj biz vegas 2017 maybe yeah okay um yeah you guys what launched in 2016. just about yeah we uh we we came up with the idea very very early on like january 2nd 2016 we were still working for a vertically integrated cannabis company right near aspen colorado great experience gave us great insight into the industry and really what the cannabis market kind of demands uh and everything has come from there it was like it was one of my first very first trade shows i think when i walked over and saw you guys um it was a funny story we we bumped into you uh quite literally um saw your shirt and were like oh we know bobito we love that and we just started talking with you brett and i actually got invited brett's my business partner everybody in case uh nobody nobody knew that uh brettgelfan shout out to you buddy um brett and i actually went to that convention for free the cannabis company had purchased tickets for us and we had left before the show happened so we got to go on their dime and you know that's kind of when our world turned around and how did you how did you guys get into the space again um what was your background before pack case funny funny story uh i was working tech i was uh working for apple at the time i was an engineer um doing some annoying stuff on the phones with in between customers and engineering kind of realized that uh corporate life wasn't for me i needed a change and i was helping brett work on some website for some cannabis company uh two weeks later he said hey we need a director of marketing are you interested i jumped on the opportunities like all right we'll pack your stuff and get to colorado next month uh time to start so went out there a little bit of nepotism uh brett's uh brett's dad my dad and the guy that hired us have all been friends for 30 35 years i guess he wanted some smart cheap labor at the time and that's uh kind of how we got our invitation but a few months later unfortunately he got sick and it put brett and i in a position where we were running the show uh in our young 20s which is absurd to put 20 year olds in charge of a 15 million cannabis company but hey you know you got to do what you got to do in business it sure is yeah we have a similar story too um you know i want to hear it how did you get started please yeah no i was i was in tech as well like straight out of college um under the fluorescent lights in a cube sea of cubes and i was like oh yes i'm getting out of school i'm gonna you know work and sell stuff and pay off my loans and you know it's a big fortune 500 company and uh after about a year and a half you know i was going through started out as like uh you know basically a quote guy you know early on learning the sales process and then moved through quickly but i know i wanted to to sell and to really own accounts and quarterback stuff and i talked to my boss and he's like well that's probably eight to ten years away for you and so i'm like oh i can be patient but uh not that patient [Laughter] and uh yeah luckily family friends um one of my family friends lived down the street from my cousin again nepotism here lucky right place right time but um kate holstein who's in charge of our international business she's been uh she actually got me to sidetrack even more she got me my first job um working like as a banquet server at weddings and so i've just i've known her since i was a kid basically and she's like hey i worked this company boveda and um now we make these humidity control packs we're in the cannabis space we're in the tobacco market and we're in the music industry and i heard those three things i said cool i mean yeah i'm in so i interviewed with them long story short um you know as employee number 12 and i think we're over 65 now and that was just four and a half years ago so um really fun fun place to work similar stories here we're basically um very similar in what we do our products and our services are very complementary to the things we're trying to address here to the cannabis industry 100 peanut butter and jelly uh especially for for pre-rolls we make something that's uh great for protecting them and you guys make sure that they stay fresh and tasty for as long as absolutely possible longer than most thought would be possible exactly so anthony i mean we've been talking we've known each other for a long time but really i don't know the the story behind boveda how how did that come about what is it like tell everybody what bovita is yeah so um it's a really simple product and that's that's what uh that's what we like most about it but it's very effective and it works pretty well um it started 25 years ago a couple of guys in the tobacco business they were cigar smokers saw a problem with uh humidification one-way humidification for regulators for cigar humidors um they said there's got to be a better way to do this so they worked um with a couple of engineers from general mills here in minnesota on coming up with a product that's able to basically self-control it's not you you don't have to add anything to it um and it's a two-way controller so in a deficit environment it'll add humidity and then when there's not enough it'll or when there's too much it'll it'll absorb some too so it's it's really getting rid of those peaks and hills and valleys of humidity um and so that that technology started for the like i said for the the cigars and tobacco business and then over time and we i'm sure this has been talked about on many of our other podcasts but um you know we started seeing these tobacco stores uh selling a lot of products in northern california um to the traditional market and um there's like wow there's there's a demand for this on the cannabis space too and that was probably 10 12 years ago now um and so we came up with our our 62 formula and um you know from there the the technology has really stayed the same but we've been finding out more about how this technology can um you know not just protect weight and help you know manage the moisture content or water activity but to also preserve terpenes and trichome integrity so it's been fun to to watch how it's how it's grown and what we've learned um that's that's really fun there's a huge feast of thought culture here feast of learning love of learning um that's that's something that's at our very core um and we have a lab down in um the basement of our hq here where a lot of these tests are being ran we have a lot of partners um different labs across the states and even internationally that help run tests and it's it's really cool uh so yeah that's you know it's a bit of a ramble there but that's uh no it it it sounds super cool i mean we did we've we've been doing r d on our products for four years you know always trying to come up with new stuff but we just have to make a really interesting design and make sure it's structurally integral you guys you have to do some chemical engineering which i can only imagine just ups the level of difficulty by you know to the umpteenth degree so good for you guys it's great that you guys can do everything downstairs and run humidity tests and i know that's a great segue into what we'll we'll talk about next because you can't really run a humidity test without measuring what you're trying to contain the humidity within uh which kind of leads me on to what we do over a pack case and we make these really amazing joint cases this is one of our awesome hemp clients father obsidian but check this out we call this product a jpeg it's our flagship so you'll notice inside this is what's amazing to bovida and everyone who uses it there's a gasket seal that lines the actual case to hold five payrolls um so when you close it you can actually hear the click that's how you know it's sealed and then our favorite part not so boveda is central but we have a extra little place that you can store roaches so you can't finish a joint you don't want to stink up the rest of uh the fresh ones inside the pack that was a really cool idea um so as we were developing this the whole reason we put a gasket in there was to make sure that pre-rolls stayed fresh unfortunately in this industry the pre-roll has been an underutilized product skew for so long such an easy product to produce it's something that from a beginner to an intermediate to a super heady everyone loves smoking joints everyone loves smoking bloods and when we first got in the industry back in 2016 everyone was just taking trim that shitty extra leftover whatever stuffing in a pre-roll and saying okay good enough today now it's totally different story people use only flower premium everything sometimes they're even caviar which means that they may have a core with some hash or are wrapped with some keef and some extra little bits on the outside and can exceed retail values of over 50 bucks in fact last time i was in vegas at the show we went to a dispensary planet 13 and they were selling a can of cigar for a thousand dollars uh so the pre-roll game has totally evolved now think about this anthony what would what would you do if you went out you bought a blood that was a thousand dollars and it was dry i would immediately want to return it right and can you probably not probably not so products like that have to be in something that's airtight and gasket sealed and if you're doing it the right way you have a bill vita pack in there as well yeah no doubt um you you brought up some really interesting stuff cody um do you mind expanding a little bit on how you've seen um you know we're we're more on the you know we certainly work with a lot of companies that manufacture pre-rolls um but also you know people that are just packaging grams or eighths or quarters or ounces or pounds um but it seems you know i mean you guys have a focus on pre-rolls do you want to elaborate on how that's changed throughout like the last four or five years um you know going into this more premium stuff versus just the consumable hey you know the dispensary is running a deal and you get a free pre-roll and it's kind of just like everyone expects oh it's it's probably gonna be dry it's probably not gonna taste very good but i mean how is it where is it changed and where is it changing where is it going yeah absolutely like i had said before when we first got into it no one really cared they just took a pre-roll they were sometimes even making them in the dispensary with leftover whatever after bagging out you know an eighth for a customer there's maybe another gram or two in the jar so the manager said screw it let's grind it up throw it in some pre-rolls and now we can sell it today the pre-roll is a main sku in the industry i think it accounts for maybe 10 15 20 somewhere in there depending on the month of total cannabis sales in the entire country so clearly they're here to stay and it's a product that people love so very quickly back in 2016 and 17 when we were starting pack case we realized that the pre-roll was super underutilized it wasn't really given the appreciation that it should have i mean it's a top level sku it's a real money maker and it doesn't take a lot of money to actually start producing them so we created our product because there wasn't any premium offerings like i said everyone was just throwing [ __ ] in a tube and or a bag and that was it there really wasn't like a uh a big demand for people asking for quality pre-rolls and we didn't understand that because as pre-roll enthusiasts someone who we smoke joints all the time especially when we went skiing or out for hikes or whatever joints are the way to go um no one really had anything that was nice or worth talking about bringing home so instead we just buy flour and roll our own but it left a huge amount of market opportunity for all these cannabis companies who weren't doing something to make a premium sku that addresses a huge market need so there was an incredible amount of demand and no supply whatsoever and that's where pac case came in to fill the gap and give opportunities to companies like this to be able to sell a premium pre-roll so was pac case kind of born on the mountain per se it's funny uh we quickly came up with the idea late at night uh the second night that brett and i had ever met um just because we were talking about going skiing and taking joints before we ever had a prototype uh i had actually uh three or four joints like in my chest pocket um took a little kicker while i was skiing and totally yard sale ate [ __ ] skis went flying worst part though uh i was kind of hurt and the joints were all broken so not only was i like in pain i couldn't smoke so it was it was rough so brett and i very quickly jumped on finding someone to help us out with the design and we quite literally used our prototype our very first one which i have right here super basic shitty design but uh this i used for an entire winter to hold pre-rolls and make sure that they wouldn't break so connor was uh was born out of uh two things a we needed a person we had a personal need we needed to be able to carry joints on the mountain or going for hikes or wherever uh and at the same time we knew that the cannabis market needed it too so it was a little bit of a selfish uh build it was kind of doing it for us and then realized there was a business behind it too that's that's exactly it though i mean that's how great products and ideas are born what's what's uh what's a problem i'm facing in my world today like some broken pre-rolls and then you know there's gonna be thousands of other people that have the same problem so cool stuff i've always loved your guys products um and you guys um you have your your five pack obviously what's what's more of your consumer facing um your duo right do you have you don't have a single though because who's gonna smoke a single joint i mean you're always gonna have one for a buddy so you would think that we uh we do have a we may or may not i cannot confirm or deny that we have a single in the works um but it won't be ready for a while if in fact we're working on something uh really though like one is never enough right like two is always better than one three is better than two and [ __ ] if you can have five will have five um so it's it's what's most amazing and what i find most interesting about our product and why it it works so well on both sides of the aisle um it's a packaging product it was always developed to be a packaging product and whole allow cannabis companies to sell pre-rolls but over the course of a year or two as we were our social media was growing and people were starting to find out about what we were doing people started asking for these just like hey i don't live in a cannabis state how do i get one um so we put them up on amazon and let it ride and uh two years later we've sold you know more than 50 000 units and are absolutely crushing a thousand reviews which blows my mind and we have over four and a half stars which on a product intended for packaging that gets sold as an accessory yeah blows my mind every time 100 and um one thing that i've always loved about your guys product is that um you know you can you can customize it um you know the the business can go put their branding on it and customize it however they want um that's a huge thing especially up in canada and some other markets that um you know they can't necessarily advertise or brand do you have any experience there um helping companies really market their brand with your guys packaging technology i'm glad that you asked that anthony pack case technically is a packaging company right that's the product that we sell but really when you get down to things we consider ourselves a marketing company we give our clients an ability to brand and promote products in ways that they wouldn't be able to before our packaging may be slightly more expensive than everyone else on the market but that's obviously because it's a premium feel what other packaging can go out and say hey i sell for 20 on amazon but instead you can come to my dispensary take five of my best highest quality joints with delicious flour have my brand on it and then now go and walk around with it so we give these companies not just an opportunity to create beautiful packaging that's going to create an amazing customer experience but we also allow their customers to then become a walking advertisement for their company think about it you buy a jpack from somebody that means you have five joints so you take one joint out to smoke with a friend well you're obviously gonna close the pack put it back in your pocket again you still have four left so you're gonna hold on to the packaging for a long time which means anytime you smoke with somebody and you take that out your brand as a company gets exposed to their friend who's now likely to become a customer their self themselves yeah well and let's let's back up to a second so let's talk about um the premium aspect so and what that value can can mean not only to a business but to the consumer so your guys you go i mean let's and we can even back up to that leap down study that we helped you guys do so that by let's explain this to the the people so yeah boba can take uh packaging and put it into a um a dry chamber put above the pack in there and then we can basically estimate the shelf life or stability how long the boba packs can last how long the product is going to stay fresh um versus no active humidity control versus having a boat pack in there and then we can compare that um against the control and give you hey this is going gonna you know add an extra week two weeks a month some cases um let's should we chat about uh how that went and what that kind of means for brands and consumers as far as you know brands are gonna be able to go into more inventory and that's something that we've seen on on the boveda side is um you know a big concern or a big problem facing a lot of these operators was hey we're just trying to get product on the shelf because the supply and demand chart is totally kitty wampus and you know we've had cultivators operators say we're we're trying to like they're torn especially these commercial ones because they want to have a longer cure on their their flower and they wanna couldn't really control that quality um but then they have um people in the supply chain saying hey this dispensary's been out of said strain this amount of flour for x amount of days and like we just we need to get on the shelf it's just flying off the shelf that we have seen as i have seen personally that's kind of slowing down and people are able to go into more inventory and carry more um but our products together can help assure that that shelf life is there and so product isn't sitting for two three months and then it's sold dry that's one of the benefits of being able to use pack case and boveda together um these operators who you know think about it if you have a production team of 10 well you don't necessarily want to have two people doing pre-rolls and two people doing edibles and spread out your labor force a lot of the times it's more efficient and our clients have told us this that you know i want to put my entire production team have them do an entire run start to finish bang it out and then move on to the next project now when you do that with flour with pre-roll with something that's not necessarily super shelf stable like a concentrate or an edible you have to have velocity so not only do you have to package it up quickly you have to get it out the door you have to get it to the dispensary they have to shelve it and then they have to get it out to the consumer now that process can take a lot longer than it would take a cannabis to dehumidify and then dry out lose terpenes lose flavor lose potency and mess with um with effects right like if uh some thc converts into cbd that flower that you smoke once it's converted is gonna make you feel totally different than if it didn't exactly so with boveda and pack case because they're such a tremendous seal these producers have the ability to make an entire run of pre-rolls leave them in their factory if they have to and as long as it's properly sealed and the boveda pack is fresh these pre-rolls are going to last a lot longer which means that their production problems that come along with having to do massive runs and then making it like sit on it as opposed to doing smaller runs and moving them quicker and making a regular process makes life a lot easier for them they can sit down bang out all of their pre-rolls that they need for a month and two days and then not have to worry about the quality at all because of the protection that pacquiao boveda provides yeah and a term that comes to mind that i hear a lot is consistency um and that's that's what a lot these brands want to deliver because they know in a lot of these markets especially on the east coast where i've been working predominantly it's medicine so uh you know it's if you can the cannabis plant in the flower is not a it's not a pill and it's very volatile and so like you said um you start getting that trichome degradation and you're gonna lose medicinal benefits um and it's like you know going to get your prescription and your short your short two pills and there's an extra one magical pill tossed in there you know it's like you you want to make sure that the product is consistent and delivered same same smell same taste same flavor same effect every time and uh yeah i think i think our our two products definitely can help um in that in that regard absolutely cannabis obviously is a product that affects headspace and if you find something that works for you and you find something that you like you want to make sure that if you buy it again it's going to have the same exact effect uh there's only one way to do that in terms of flour and pre-rolls and that's control the humidity making sure that the product stays the same on day one as it is on day 30 and potentially even out to day 60s so it's important i know that a lot of people that consume cannabis for medical reasons um which there are many that's how this whole industry really started right um they need that they need consistency of dose they need consistency of effect and you can only do that by controlling terpene and humidity content right yup yup there's no doubt about that and then um you know let's another thing that i've been seeing um and sorry this is so salesy just because that's the world that i live in every day is just sales but um you know competition between brands um i i like to think of the cannabis industry as a more friendly um competition uh than any than any other industry that i've been in or or seen where it's you know really we're we're all in this together with one common goal and that's to bring uh relief to a lot of people and liberty to a lot of people um to do what they want with their lives consume what they want and um just not step on anyone else's toes but competition on shelf space um is the pack case boveda combo is that something that people can use to set their their brands apart from others is that can you take these these two common value adds and educate the consumer to say hey i'm gonna my pre-rolls are gonna probably be better in here by the time i get them depending on when they were packaged and you know i'm gonna have an extra two three weeks to go through these um with the boveda pack and then you know i have the pack case forever um these are these are things that consumers care about and are gonna want is that messaging from the consumer is that getting driven to these brands that are making these decisions on packaging yet it's a good question some of the brands who really have a premium focus and a premium attention absolutely they understand that their customers keep coming back to them because their products are so good some of the there's a lot of a lot unfortunate but there's a lot of cannabis companies out there that really don't cater to a premium market um and don't really care about the quality of their products um you know like i said a lot of them are still back in the model of 2016. let's take any leftover [ __ ] that we have let's toss it in a pre-roll put it in the doob tube and just send it whatever happens happens i don't know about you but whenever i consume something that affects headspace uh alcohol cannabis whatever else it may be i always want to make sure that i'm getting something that's quality and consistent um price isn't so much uh a concern of mine right i would much rather pay an extra 20 or 30 bucks to know that uh the quality that i'm getting is there versus having to deal with some [ __ ] for a much cheaper cost i believe that if you're gonna intake something it should only be the the best quality you know it's affecting you like you as yourself not a car not a house you and your health so for me as a consumer i always want to make sure i'm getting high quality and i think that there's a lot of companies that value my sentiment and cater towards a client like me when you have a customer that doesn't you end up with shitty product and that creates a negative loop sure you're going to get the sale once or twice because it's a cheap product but i doubt that person's coming back to you there's no consistency there's no flavor it's all dry harsh smoke it's no good no one likes that yeah and that's i think that's changing too i think as more people get introduced to cannabis i mean we talk about all these people taking baby steps i mean i was down in in florida i had a dispensary doing a visit and i i witnessed what i always knew was going on down there but never had witness for myself which was a woman that looked just like my grandma going into a dispensary for the first time and she has all of her paperwork and she looks at the the person at the front desk and she's kind of you know pretty coy and her her husband's behind her um you know they're just kind of looking around and she goes i'm here to um purchase some marijuana it's so cool to see that but there's so many people that need to be become educated on you know multiple different aspects of cannabis um but it's there's so many new people coming into it and uh that's that's a that's a big piece of the education piece and you know knowing what you're consuming how it's gonna make you feel um you know what you like essentially there are a lot of people figuring out what they like and um you know here in minnesota it's tough for me uh because we don't have um you know like we don't have adult use here so i can't just go in and say hey you know i'm wanting this today and that's uh that's something that a lot of new states are having which is is great um and uh sorry i kind of lost my train of thought here it's all good those are those were always my fate when when i was back at the cannabis company those are always my favorite people you know there were times and days where you know as just a higher level employee at the company uh the dispensary was short-handed so i'd have to go in there and maybe put a quick shift in and just talk to cool people about wheat all day it was honestly not a bad way to uh spend a couple hours outside of my normal role my favorite customers were always the older folks who really had never id any idea they'd walk in they'd always be like hey can i like can i buy some weed yeah and it's like you don't have to whisper it's legal welcome to the cannabis store let me show you what what are you what are you interested in what would you like to try are you interested in smoking something would you like to vape something would you like to try an edible it's always great introducing those people to the entire world something that as an enthusiast we've been living for decades right but i don't want to date myself but [ __ ] it's been a long time um yeah it's it's it's remarkable the clearly the direction of the country the world is totally changing our neighbors up to the north were a lot smarter than we were legalized a lot quicker and look what happened now they have five or six companies in cannabis worth over a billion dollars you ever think that there'd be a unicorn in cannabis now there's five it's insane yep ellen what do you think is i mean comparing the canada to the u.s right now um especially these last couple weeks um just these these larger operators and what what is that what does this mean for cannabis in 2021 um as far as these these bigger companies you know that and you know four or five years ago in the grassroots cannabis movement semi grassroots cannabis movement um you know a lot of it was the the buzz around trade shows in the industry was all these you know these big companies are gonna come in and they're gonna start getting swooped up and the commercialization does cannabis in your opinion cody does it kind of model what happened uh recently this last decade with beer craft beer and you know your big domestic beer is there gonna be a commercial side of cannabis and then also room for the craft cultivator um that's really focused on small quality good stuff um that's gonna be competing against you know price and volume from some of these giants that's a great question the beer model is one that is perfect to use as an analogy um i think myself a lot of these major cannabis companies are swooping up a lot of the smaller ones there's a lot of conglomeration that's going on in the industry obviously when you kind of grow as a company or you want to expand you either need additional growth space which requires additional licensing so a lot of the small guys or the guys that were in quickly did some decent growing started as a startup and made it to mid-sized company those are ideal acquisition targets for the big boys so i think what's going to happen at least the next three four years is that all the big boys are going to start to swoop up a lot of the smaller guys that's where you emerge the budweiser the coors light all the the general high volume lower quality lower price type products from that will come the grassroots movement again so i think everything is going to kind of go underground for a little while and all these craft companies in maybe three four years will start to emerge when people really care about quality and it's not so much about bottom dollar anymore yeah we have a huge canadian client that we love working with when we first started with them they had a huge huge initiative and focus on innovation it was 2018 they had an opportunity to really try and control the market with an innovative awesome product uh cost was no object they said [ __ ] it we want the coolest best highest quality product that we can provide and it worked out great for them they quickly jumped into one of the leaders positions in the industry in canada and everything was was great it towards the end of 2019 and then with uh early covid uh early 2020 uh their share price fell dramatically they were you know their balance sheets showed that they were just outlaying cash left and right for the innovation without necessarily realizing that when you spend so much on innovation it takes a long time for it to come back right roi on innovation is a year year and a half process minimum for us for example you know we started designing jpeg trio in 2018 it didn't get launched until you know mid 2019 it took 12 16 months 18 months to get the product out there so with this cannabis company even though they were so amazingly focused on innovation for the first part once legalization happened now they realize that it's all about bottom dollar and how do we reduce cost of goods so now instead of trying to produce flowers that may be tastier but take an extra two weeks now they're producing lower quality genetics that harvest faster that they can just turn around and sell and cheaper packaging and i think that's now the start of where you see the the budweiser and the the coors lights versus like uh you know a small batch brewing company really focused on delivering a delicious tasty product i mean one has consistency one has flavor yup but you know which would you prefer to drink budweiser or the the local craft beer pretty easy decision in my opinion yeah well for me too it's a time and place thing sometimes uh you know being from minnesota and uh going up to the cabin a busch light just kind of brings you back you know i love those you mean can't hate on that i'm a big coors guy i went to school in colorado spent a few years in co i love course especially like any tailgate absolutely but then you know you're trying to drink 16 18 beers potentially and really have yourself an afternoon that's not so much the case when you're drinking something that's a little bit tastier and perhaps next to a steak and maybe you're gonna have one or two very different days though the pairing is everything bingo and the season two i'm a big seasoned guy when it comes to those things absolutely you brought up uh i don't know how much time we have here ramsay um but you brought up uh kovid um how do you think that's been um impacting i guess pros and cons um your guys customers people you've been working with um you know if i can touch briefly i can just say what i've noticed is um i think a lot of these quality things sops standard practices best practices a lot of these procedural things are starting to really get drilled into um on paper and people are starting to like really figure their their [ __ ] out um and that's i think making a little bit extra room for products and services that focus on true value-add and um you know roi that you know we can bovada specifically too can can really tell you hey your flower your inventory your entire inventory weighs this today um and here's the percent moisture content um if you added two percent moisture content to that entire inventory here's the literal change in fair market value of your inventory i think those things now it's not it's not everything's not moving so fast where it's hey package it get it you know it doesn't matter if it cures on the shelf whatever we just we got to get it in stores because we don't have any and people are buying it anyway um i think covid kind of or the lockdown specifically um kind of help people really look at their what they're doing their day-to-day operations and where they can make changes have you guys noticed that too absolutely it gave you know business operators a chance to sit back and not be surrounded by the buzz of a hopping office and they actually had a few moments to think about like hey what can we do better what can we do to improve like our everything our process is top to bottom from growing the production of packaging to sales yeah um what's interesting is that you know this is what makes me happy is that a lot of the country deemed cannabis in a central industry um okay would you ever have been able to imagine that 10 years ago probably not i mean even back in 2014 but government said hey people need cannabis especially in california and all the cannabis companies stayed open so i think having those cannabis restrictions that got imposed on everybody required all these business operators to really sit back and understand how can we do things more efficiently because [ __ ] i used to run my growing operation with 40 people well now i can only have 15 in the building so how are we still going to manage the same output but with less than half of the labor staff forces you to sit back and really think about what you're doing and if you guys are cutting short you know corners trying to take a shortcut when that's not necessarily the best thing to do or neces or even necessary you know small little changes in process like adding a movita pack into your curing box can potentially generate an extra 300 000 a year for a mid-sized cannabis company it's substantial and that tiny little you know how much could that really end up costing you a couple thousand dollars over the course of a year when you can end up you know that can let you back a couple hundred thousand so a lot of these guys with cannabis you just you've been running and like you you ever try and get on a treadmill when it's set at 10 you there's no warm-up time you just have to get down and start sprinting yeah college a couple times yeah i'm not sure if those ended well but that's that's what working in a cannabis company is like the moment that your product goes out the door for the first time it's off to the races you have now an endless uh endless demand for your product and you have to continuously handle that that with good supply um and they don't haven't had a lot of time to think about it as soon as they got on that treadmill it's just off to the races full sprint covent gave them a chance to sit back take a second step off the treadmill and try and figure out what they should actually be doing yeah i completely agree um definitely notice that as well on our end um all right cody uh what's next for paccase great question we have a couple cool new packaging products coming out but that's not really what what tickles me i get very excited about the consumer market i love bringing products to people that will actually use it so we have a really awesome new case that should be launching the next five six months uh think jpac an iphone had a baby that's about all i can touch on it yeah well that's uh that's intriguing um because i think i think i know where that's going um don't wanna don't want to speculate too much but um and where can you pick these up so i know you said amazon um i know you guys have uh point of purchase displays too so i'm assuming that it's this is getting into more mass retail absolutely yeah we uh we sell in a couple different places you can go out and check uh jpac products out on amazon number one uh our shopping website

coast journal preview where we take a look at the stories being followed in the upcoming edition of the north coast journal i'm your host dave frank and i'm joined by north coast journal's news editor thad greenson and arts and features editor jennifer from mikko cahill welcome guys david how are you doing right on doing well a little sunshine out there today and got some good news friends family news about more vaccines in the pipeline so i think people are starting to look towards that fourth of july weekend as a potentially uh you know fulfilling and rewarding date on the calendar where we might actually have some degree of normalcy so hopefully that's permeating your guys lives as well fingers crossed yeah stay optimistic right as best we can do um so that let's dive right in what's going on on the cover this week of the north coast journal well this week is our annual cannabis issue so um it is about all things uh all all things cannabis news um recently um but occupying the actual cover space of the paper is a story um following up on some reporting we did a couple years ago about the roanoke park public safety department to the police department at roener park and um some cannabis interdiction activities they'd been doing that became raised a lot of questions from the article it looks like there's been a federal indictment handed down on one of the local police departments in the 101 corridor can you tell us a little bit about the background on that and kind of what brought us to this point yeah so two two officers have been indicted in the case so far um and their indictments were unsealed friday um and so that's a lot of the documentation was was the actual charging document that we built the story on but the story takes root back in um in december of 2017 when a man by the name of zeke flatton actually a movie producer was looking to dabble in the cannabis industry visited humboldt county bought three pounds of cannabis and was transporting it south to a lab in the bay area for testing when he claimed that he was pulled over by an unmarked suv and by two officers who were wearing kind of tactical gear but no badges no name no name tags no patches kind of affiliating them with a specific agency they identified themselves as being with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and um asked if he was carrying cannabis he said he was asked to search the vehicle found the three pounds and basically said we're taking these you can expect to receive a letter from washington dc and we're going to go now um and zeke flatten is is a former cop himself um and um and a really sharp guy i mean just from interviewing him he's one of these people who has a pretty meticulous memory and an eye for detail and he said that it just didn't feel right um something felt really off about the stop he noticed that the officers never ran he gave them his license but they never ran his name um back to dispatch to see if you know there was any warrants or anything out for him didn't seem to run the license plate of his car um and didn't give him a receipt for the seizure of his cannabis um and so he said pretty quickly he came to feel that he was robbed he also noticed that while they said they were from a federal federal agency the car that they were driving had california exempt license plates which didn't line up again he's a pretty sharp guy who picks up on these details and so um he pretty quickly came to feel that he'd been robbed by what he figured were actual law enforcement officers but out acting outside the scope of their duties so he made a complaint to the fbi um and to the mendocino county sheriff's office because the traffic stop happened in mendocino um and that's kind of what got this ball rolling that now um you know two pl two and almost two and a half years later has resulted in these indictments almost three and a half years later so one of the things that he said was that um it wasn't the actual loss of value um that really triggered this it was his thoughts about something bigger must have been going on if this is how he was getting treated that maybe other people were getting treated the same way so you said he reached out to federal um law enforcement but there were he also reached out to local media is that right and kind of what element did local media play in bringing the story you know the momentum that built around this original complaint yeah it played a huge role and certainly zeke zeke flattened feels like it was it was crucial that it was really the tipping point um but i guess to your first point yeah he said that he really felt like um it wasn't the loss of three thousand dollars worth of weed it was the the violation and as somebody who'd been a police officer previously i mean he kind of understood that oath of office and he also just started wondering like if these guys are so brazen that they are going to impersonate federal officers outside of their jurisdiction and stop me in broad daylight and steal my weed like what else are they doing and who else are they doing this type of thing too um so worry you know he said that he made the complaint to the fbi and felt like it was initially kind of taken seriously or whatever but he was worried that it would just kind of die quietly that it would make it from kind of the the the main fbi office to the field office and then just kind of be quietly go away and so he decided um i think about a month after making the complaint to contact kim kemp a reporter based in southern humboldt and um to her credit she she took it very seriously um and um and started you know vetting his story and making calls and one of the last calls that she made before kind of going public with his allegations um was a call to the to atf just saying hey did you have officers in the field this day in this area and were you involved in this traffic stop and um while some of the other agencies had kind of been um i'd say a little bit evasive or a little bit squirrely or not really you know didn't seem terribly interested in her inquiries um atf did and atf i think seems like really kind of its ears perked up but the the idea that somebody might be out there impersonating its officers and so not only did they they give a statement to kim but they also um immediately kind of reached out to zeke and asked if they could contact zlatan and i think he said that they were on the phone with him within an hour of kim contacting them um and then come to find out they then exerted some pressure it sounds like on the fbi and on local agencies to kind of saying hey this is something that needs to be taken um seriously and and zeke really believes that that you know kim's inquiry and her subsequent reporting really got this ball rolling um and after she reported i think one or two stories on um on zeke's allegations um the um the lead roner park officer um who's been indicted uh or former officer uh jc tatum who headed the the roanoke park interdiction team um took a really kind of interesting step of issuing a press release kind of in response to kim's coverage trying to explain away zeke's allegations um and um the fbi the f the indictment certainly says that this was a fraudulent press release in a fraudulent police report designed to kind of cover his tracks um that's the allegation anyway um but there were some things that just didn't match up about the press release and from just a journalist who's seen gobs and gobs of law enforcement press release releases it just was strange it didn't have an exact date it didn't have an exact time it didn't identify the kind of car zeke was driving it didn't name him you know didn't have his name in the press release didn't identify a quantity of marijuana seized it was just it was atypical and i think a lot of people noticed that and then it brought a new attention to this case so the uh the charges are cons for two officers tatum and huffaker are conspiracy to commit extortion under the color of official rights and then officer tatum former officer tatum also faces additional charges of falsifying records in a federal investigation in order to cover up alleged theft right so what and then also a charge of tax evasion as well oh right exactly yeah like uh al capone the tax man will always get you um so you know what kind of transpired in this investigation um that that you know what are some of the elements of the story that kind of sent out to you like that you said he was the head of a of a interdiction task force yeah and so yeah what what are some of the details that kind of stand out in terms of the 101 court or interdiction team so i think there's three things i'd want to hit on there the first it was actually not in in the indictment but was uncovered by kqed in an investigation it did after kim kemp's initial reporting in this um and they requested gobs and gobs of records from from roanoke park and and they found two things that were kind of interesting one is that roanoke park was kind of nationally awarded for its interdiction efforts at the time um for just the amount of the quantities of cannabis it was seizing and the amounts of cash it was seizing this was from a law enforcement perspective an enormously effective interdiction team um headed by tatum and then um they found that um basically when when a law enforcement agency seizes say 50 pounds of cannabis it's kind of impractical to expect them that they're just going to hold all that as evidence until the case goes to trial and so what they do in these large drug seizure cases is they hold on to a sample of it but then they destroy the rest and there's a really meticulous process they have to follow to do this of getting a court um destruction order and then they're supposed to you know um transfer the the drugs to a specific officer who's then um uh kind of ordered to destroy them in a very specific way and then document it with a destruction um with destruction documentation and so what kqed found is that for at least 800 pounds of cannabis over like a two-year period rohnert park was unable to actually show documentation that it was destroyed they had court orders telling um the department to destroy it and they had documentation that it had been handed off to jc tatum the sergeant in control of such things but there was no actual you know proof that it had been destroyed so that raised a lot of questions um then in the um in the indictment itself um federal agents um reviewed lots of body camera footage from the roanoke park police department and they were able to document numerous cases i think they identified five or six of them in the actual indictment itself but where officers seized cannabis or cash from drivers i think tatum was involved in all these traffic stops and did not provide them with any documentation did not provide for them with a seizure receipt and then also um for which the agents were unable to find any other documentation of this traffic stop so within roanoke park police records it was as if the stop had never happened it never existed there's no police report attached to it or anything like that um but they have this footage of them actually taking custody of cannabis from people um so that raised a lot of questions and then the last aspect is just the irs investigation um the irs did what seems like a pretty exhaustive investigation over several years of um officer sergeant tatum's um financial records and what they claim to have found is um hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash deposits um into his bank his and his wife's bank accounts and family members bank accounts um all of them in sums less than ten thousand dollars which and if you over if you deposit over ten thousand dollars in cash the bank is required to report that to the irs and so the they're alleging that this is very much a pattern of somebody trying to conceal illicit profits um and so all of these three things together i think really raised questions about the scope of what was happening in roanoke park um over this time period and um while the indictment is really related to two specific traffic stops in december um and um and then for um you know for sergeant tatum the um you know the tax evasion and the attempt to cover up as well i think the um other information indictment really kind of leads one to believe there might be other shoes to drop and there might be other actions coming gotcha well there's so much more in the article um hopefully people check it out thank you for sharing uh your insights on this with us um i know these officers are facing a lot of time and and it you know we'll see how it plays out and we'll see how you know i'm sure you guys will follow it down its uh path um yeah so what one other thing i wanted to ask you about um there today actually breaking news uh happy st patrick's day there's breaking news in the sacramento bee about the eureka police department a few officers communications can you tell us real briefly a little bit about that breaking story yeah real briefly um a reporter for the sacramento bee um obtained from from an unnamed source um screenshots of group text chats with six epd officers that include um just lots of very vile things uh misogynistic and um really dehumanizing language um directed at uh people that um that these officers were in charge of protecting and serving so it really raises a lot of pretty alarming questions absolutely something that we at the journal are following up on as we speak and we'll continue to do so and hopefully uh bring more of that to light well fantastic thank you yeah that's available online like like north coast journal sacramento b's also online check it out um how about you jennifer what's going on this week on the arts and features beat with you you know so for our cannabis issue um i you know i had wanted to include something about you know people infusing foods with cannabis for a while but i'm not sure if you're familiar with jessica ashley silva if you um she's written for us before she covered the guy fieri barbecue contest at the fair the sweaty meat fest i believe she called it and um i i saw that she had posted a while ago a fail and you know i love a food fail but this was an infusion fail and so i asked her to jump in and write about it and also i want to say that i feel partly responsible for this fail um i asked jessica to write about a cannabis pairing dinner which was a virtual event usually you know cannabis dinners you go and you get a whole infused multi-course meal that i don't know how you get home from but um you know when people do these really fancy-schmancy meals infused with cannabis but this was a virtual one given our times and so she cooked at home along with a chef who was you know using fancy oils and swirling things on dishes and it was you know very very fancy and it it gave her a sense of maybe hubris and so she and some friends dove into some cannabis cooking and everything was going great and then she had this very cheesy burger that was so great on this some sort of infused burger thing and then she was like why don't i just make some infused cheese and she made this attempt and to her credit she made a really beautifully formed three fresh mozzarella balls and um you know they look great if you look at it in black and white if you look at it in color and she wrote about the you know the the hubris the fall the tragic outcome of trying to infuse it because it came out sort of the color of silly putty sort of a brown gray unpleasant and um when she described trying it she was like you don't taste brown please don't taste brown please and it tasted so brown it tasted as she she describes it as tasting like dirt hay and dead plants yeah and then of course you know like a good you know growth raised in the right family she tried not to throw out food and she tried to apply it to a pizza with a lot of garlicky pesto and hope no no nothing nothing could cover the taste of of swamp from that mozzarella but um you know she talks about sort of the basics of of how you infuse food and um it was a learning experience for me to read about um but also i really like her attitude um uh if you're if you're in humble foodies you know her it was one of the admins and um she's very funny and even honestly i always enjoy when she you know blocks someone or kicks them off of the side it's always great fun but she talks about the value of food fails and most of the time on something like humble foodies we're sharing you know our successes look at this amazing rack of lamb i made look at this fantastic fettuccine i made and people don't really share like oh jesus what did i do to this poor piece of meat but here she is and she was saying that she learned something which is that okay mistakes were made and here's what she could do instead next time like maybe a flavorless uh instead of working directly from flour maybe she could use you know a flavorless extract would be better next time or you know maybe mozzarella is meant to just be a mozzarella right it has that cure maybe we infuse other things um but she you know she took it as a learning experience and she also was like well you know what i did figure out how to make some cheese so hopefully she'll be back to do that again but um yeah if you've if you've ever tried failed or tried to smile through someone else's failed infusion meal i strongly recommend it i mean the only thing that i forgot to ask her is if it's i mean i would imagine that the thc quality was still there but despite that i think um despite the effects of cannabis it didn't make her enjoy it anymore which is too bad that's yeah which you know i i get the boost of um the boost of enjoyment that people get from you know having cannabis infused foods i i totally get the draw if it's a tenth of what i experienced when i was pregnant then i don't know why everyone's not eating cannabis infused food all the time but other than having to drive um but yeah it's a fun read and you should definitely check it out and definitely not do what she did that is amazing yeah so it sounds like mozzarella should be left as mozzarella you don't need to infuse it it's kind of i mean isn't there already a high to cheese isn't cheese its own drug so it takes more and more yeah speaking of uh own drug um you did a satirical piece maybe not so satirical uh cannabis strains we need in 2021 and wish were real tell us a little bit about that because that is hysterical i'm gonna say it's only barely satirical because um so i've done this for a few years in a row and i have had a couple of people who were like so i don't understand where can you buy these yes actually there isn't one that makes you feel like a disney princess that's not real i made it up um what i what i like to do is go through and look at real strains and look at their descriptions and how they describe the crosses and whatnot and look at some of the really hilarious names that they have and i must say that one of the challenges is coming up with names that aren't already strains so you know when i was looking up like there's a there's a strain that um a fake string that is for people who are really upset about dr seuss you know if you're like really upset about it which relax relax what happened on mulberries or what was it i can't what i saw on mulberry street i have a copy it's not great it's no cat in the hat but people are so upset about not making more of them you know the ones that are out there are out there but people are so upset about and i thought well i should have a strain that helps people cope with that stress and i looked up and i could not believe there isn't already a strain called who hash [Music] but evidently an opportunity missed um and there are a few other ones that are some of them that are meant to help you through the stress of the pandemic like darth vaxxer which is sort you know sort of my little tribute to thaad who is a very big star wars fan as you can see from his background um and uh legion of zoom which is meant to help you feel more more like you're really in the room with people when you're even on screen um which i personally don't want [Laughter] but some people might you know it can be very draining having all your interactions remotely she says as she's having a skype conversation with someone that she used to sit in a studio with truth but it's fun to do so there's one um q-tips which i think was really funny about q and on and there's some other contemporary uh references but others are just more like um you know broadly uh appealing i suppose like tell us about sofa cushion uh sofa cushion is for when you just need to ride out the rest of the pandemic just keeping it mellow you know a lot of people have tried to be really productive during this and personally i feel that's a mistake it's been you know it's been so emotionally and mentally taxing for us to go through the ups and downs and the sort of national grief and personal grief and all those things and yet we have all these things telling us you need to hustle you need to be working on your side gig you need to be and some of that is survival financially but some of it is just the social pressure of always be productive always be doing something and so this particular strain allows you to just uh what do i have that it's it's um a couple of indica strains inertia and lazy boy to help you sink deeper and deeper into your couch until you become one with it which you know let me help you with that tap into your inner fauchy one kenobi yes somebody feel free if people want to make these strains um you know just send me a small fee and we'll be good yeah you got to trademark that stuff well right on there's a lot more in that article definitely folks check it out that's just about going to do it for us this week it flies by unfortunately uh north coast journal is available on newsstands now available online uh pick one up stay informed stay safe jennifer thank you both so much and we'll see you guys again next week see you next week [Applause] do [Applause] you", "EqPfb_Pehxc": "what's going on I want to welcome you to and thank you for watching this video I also want to say how much I appreciate all the new YouTube and Twitter followers and remember you can always reach out on the comments here Twitter post or DM and snapchat for any questions you may have in this video I'm going to show you the baldor hybrid strain that I picked up from fluent in Tallahassee this is the version of the blue dream strain I paid $45 for this eighth and this harvest came in at 20 point 17 percent THC looking at the bottle they I noticed it was packaged three days before I bought it which was great and they even give you the actual harvest date which in my book gives you two extra brownie points it smells sweet fruity and a bit earthy to the flavour of it was just like it smelled but the fruity scent turns into a blueberry not a really sweet blueberry just regular blueberry this 8th weighs 3.56 grams the 8th weight being exact doesn't bother me at all since as you can see the dense bullets were trimmed perfectly I kind of did expect them to be this a nice since I bought the ham trend that level which is what they call the premium now now on to the effects I felt it was a faster onset and I'm talking about by the time I had like the second hit I started feeling the beginning of the effects Netflix was turned off and changed into the sweet dance induce the music couldn't stop balancing to the beat and loved it and I have found a new gym strength more than a week from now on the comments I also felt an intense urge of motivated creativity by that I mean once the music was flowing the urge to write this review and take all the photos kicked into high gear and I got all of it done with a smile on my face from ear to ear and still dancing left and right on my share my stress and anxiety were knocked out pretty far into deep space through the duration of the effects ooh ooh how I miss a really well trained well treated well harvested well cured blue dream I can definitely work a lot better on the strain stress from more keeps bouncing right off first their energy and creativity just long delicious I certainly recommend this train for all day and night use I would just try to avoid it within two to three hours before bedtime that way you're not laying in bed looking up at the sky I hope this helps you Medicaid right have a great day", "XKHMmF_s88E": "scoring all YouTube coming at you with another strand revealed today we got Kimball push Kimball Chris's name that the Kimbo Slice Ultimate Fighter died a couple of years ago but it's a very good strong yeah I said indica dominant strain his some dry pull is like a sour citrus tardy type of home tasted and ghost yeah and when you burn it is saying taste it's real good I was very pretty easy to see it has a lot of colors in it a lot of trichomes heavy THC I'll say it's a very potent strain is good for stress depression pain appetite insomnia all type of illness like that in its down genetics the genetics on this is on blackberry cush and a Starfighter and if you ever see this or have an opportunity to try it I recommend it to you about it it's you know every good opportunity to use it it's very good medicine until next time take care peace", "tv8ND_Zg0Mk": "[Music] what's up jazz what's up Pete I feel like I should move this move what my lab tighter why is it in the way are you too tempted that you're gonna use it no well this it feels like if I'm not using it it's just kind of there yeah it's that screen temptation screen addiction I would not go that far so big news Gainesville green the the quintessential Florida's strain just launched under this sunshine cannabis brand and true leave we pick them up today over and grab this one Chaz already has his pen loaded or he's he's switching up his true stakes how many true sticks do you have over there three three three all all three colors three different colors I also have a knockoff but we won't we won't say too much about that one but yeah it is I put the Gainesville in the sunshine cannabis no that's the one I hear oh yeah sunshine I've been is the cool one is it gold yeah I saw a little of the sunshine cush actually that had been in there I don't think I'm allowed to say what's in the other one so the Gainesville green I noticed that the top of it is yellow and that's because it's a hybrid and not only is Gainesville green a hybrid in the Gainesville Green is apparently the hybrid so apparently like in the lineage of hybrids Gainesville green was either the first or a one of the first the that people trace back hybrids to apparently that's what I've been reading anyway so that's pretty cool I mean I used to hear you know up north where I'm from I used to hear about how all the best marijuana all the best weed came from Gainesville so I was excited to hear about Gainesville green coming out and the first thing I noticed is that is that it's got a yellow tip yeah these aren't the easiest things for me to open all the time but I guess like you're struggling I guess that's a good thing there Pete proof that means your child probably won't be able to get into it either ggr that's the strain what's the make up of it it looks like we have eighty two point one percent THC you know one point eight percent CBG and point four percent CBN I know that it's made with terpenes some a blend of terpenes I am not familiar with but drop that into my sunshine pod [Music] oh that was it oh that's different it's definitely different than the sunshine cush hmm now I don't know I want to say hmm almost has like a lime taste to it maybe there's some limonene in there I don't know maybe I'm just thinking green I got more of a piney more pining oh now that's green too I like it that's good yeah it's nice it's smooth and I definitely feel it can definitely feel it immediately you know it's definitely got a nice hmm it's got a nice aftertaste - I like it but in you know learning about the Gainesville green strain coming out I was doing a little research on where it came from and I came across an article focusing on a gentleman named Rick nya and good news is we're getting actually going to be bringing Rick nya down to our Gainesville events he's up in New Hampshire I think right now and I think we're going to be bringing him down for the Gainesville green green carpet event which is unbelievable April 7th April 7th so Rick nya is the originator of Gainesville green and apparently he was looking on the internet found some a lot of people talking about the origination of Gainesville green and making a lot of stories and claims about it and then so he entered the conversation and provided a lot of information that only the true creator of Gainesville green could possibly know so I guess the the story goes he was you know a kid vacationing or camping camping in Florida and Palm Beach and he saw some bales of something get thrown from a plane and ended up finding the you know finding one of those bells that ended up being full of some Columbian gold he had a few seeds from that and then he saved and then he went to Hawaii discovered some other amazing cannabis in Hawaii ended up being Maui Wowi brought some of those sweet seeds back with them and the story goes they tried to grow they a couple of the plants ended up being male they ended up with a whole bunch more seeds and the hybrid was born of these seeds and I guess the story goes he didn't know what to do with all this newfound weed and the in the late seventies so he his father knew someone that had a biker bar down in Florida came down showed him the weed the guy was like whoa what is this these fresh nugs that he's never seen anything like it before and he asked him if he had a name for it he said no so the guy said we're gonna call it Gainesville green and then there's this story it's it's probably much much better to hear Rick it probably tell so much color I'm just I'm just regurgitating something I read on the Internet it sounds like a fantastic story that I want to hear it in person yeah hopefully tells it I can't imagine he wouldn't well well if you come down to the Gainesville events on April 7th we'll definitely you'll definitely hear this story and you get to meet Rick and and learn a little bit more about the the lineage of cannabis it's actually pretty pretty amazing how you can you can trace back a lot of the strains you can trace genetics back you know more 40 hundreds of years probably but I am enjoying the the true stick I can definitely feel the effects from it just taken those those two puffs and those two hits off of it earlier so it's definitely as my seal of approval it's really calming it's helping some of my muscle aches too yeah yeah it's definitely a different feeling than the other sunshine pod the sunshine yeah that one's the more indica more a little more sleepy I think it's got a little bit more of the cbn in that one this one yeah well I definitely like the flavor on this one this and that this one is definitely going to be a go-to for me oh yeah all right well you know what was a true leaf I picked up a bunch of other stuff it's 9 pound hammer flour that I picked up is 906 milligrams of THC I got some of that today yeah that's uh I got that and they're super Silver Haze oh did you yeah what would the gorilla grapes it's always a good one 20% THC and then what was the other one the lemon tree that was a 23.8% 20 24 percent THC on that lemon tree and then I matched up that lemon tree with the lemon og crumble so it's a pretty good pretty good hole digging the truly flower so yeah Gainesville green come out to Gainesville on April 7th and meet Rick nyah meet the Sunshine fam the sunshine team Chris sunshine I'll be there Robert Roundtree will be there we'll have a ton of people there you know you can meet the dispensaries meet your fellow advocates make some connections I think we're still working on the food but the food in Gainesville is always good yeah so even if you're not in Gainesville you know you might as well make the trip up we're gonna be there right", "SC99iukFCgk": "[Music] hey what's up everybody cows coming back at you with a little strand review here for some tangent from Polaris this this is gonna be a little quick review tangey is one of my favorite strains as far as flavor goes it's one of the best citrus flavors in my opinion out there as well you know it's smell taste the whole nine yards so immediately you know let's jump right into you know we got some nice dense kind of fluffy nubs first and foremost this company Polaris they test they shoulders at 25.2% th c8 teach the eight not easy but th CA oh just like CHCA so it sounds good that's crazy okay so realistically it's anywhere between like 18 19 to 20 21 percent THC somewhere you know my husband should probably uh okay you know what it's closer than what they're selling you so but it does look good like blind the guy is there for six [Music] it does have some frosting yes - it looks good looks tasty I'd like it anyway all right so immediately you know the looks I give it a a 8 out of 10 and it's dead frosty it's orange it has the line greens and the light filled vibrant greens that you're looking for the Tandy's note which is a good quality of something that I can it kenji is also known for being a super upbeat happy yet relaxing about hi to it [Music] so you know this is one of my wake yeah this is definitely a wake and bake strain this is one of those I wake up in the morning I love a bullet Angie it's a perfect start the day kind of strength gets you uplifted because you still mellow out you're relaxed relaxed it's not gonna hit you super hard you know even though they do you know like I said there's percent rate shows like thinking you know it's gonna mess you up pretty bad but it doesn't you know it's just real mellow high which is something good okay so looks 8 out of 10 okay go on to the smell now the smell on here is amazing I'd love to smell Tanja's why it's one of my number-one strains it's my top you know top five favorite strings as tangi expel as tangerine jeering I love that citrus you know smells to him you know super lemon haze stuff like that anyways so as far as smell goes immediately it's just a burst of citrus you know it smells like you have just like a whole bunch of tangerines just being torn open in your face at once it's crazy the smell is just so overpowering and just pungent and vibrant it's amazing nine out of ten smell honestly I honestly 10 out of 10 smell 10 out of 10 smell when it comes to tangi because it is such a flavorful smell this is something they give you don't like the skunky buggy you know we smelled it you know we're so used to in a lot of our things this is a strain for you this is one that you know you're not gonna every time you come to smoke you're not gonna be thinking about oh I'm smoking weed that is how vibrant this this smell comes across it's incredible on the taste honestly this is a mouth-watering taste you know I'm not gonna lie I love it it's like I said it's one of my absolute favorites one of my number recommended for flavor for people because you know some people they not only are they looking for medicine but they're looking for taste some people don't like you know the diesel II tasted we get from like perfect example Sour Diesel or the oily kind of a burnt taste you get from someone like like Northern Lights kind of gives you that that kind of an ashy kind of a thick taste leftover this gives you this off you know this amazing citrus smell to just develop your senses it's crazy alright let's take a hit here we go so Polaris I've seen this company a couple times down they've seen that make you know pretty decent products you know if I was to rate the company you know I give them you know they're like a four-star company as far as I'm concerned I haven't had any bad product from them okay so uh man it's good taste immediately the same smells that you're getting you're gonna taste it just citrus I mean almost tastes like you're biting into like a tangerine at the same time you're taking a drink of like orange juice man it's just a overpowering citrus you know I love that it's amazing now I do have to say if if you I don't know if you younger generation may not remember these but out Lloyd's used to make a candy and they were sour and they were tangerine flavored candies there are little circle things in a little silver tin that is what if you guys remember that that is exactly what this tastes and smells like and it's incredible imma go ahead and grab another one like I said it's one of my favorites here we go it's amazing so as far as taste go 9 out of 10 has such an amazing smooth citrus taste to it I love it so now the best part about this is the high the high is a mellow high on it so it's not gonna you know I'm gonna give this a 4 the high I give it honestly like a 7 out of 10 because it's not overpowering it doesn't come on very quickly it's smooth when you as you're smoking or you know even get your hands on some concentrate you know I don't know the concentrate might hit you super fast I haven't been lucky enough to find the concentrate this stuff is phenomenal as far as flour goes so no matter where you go in my opinion if you get a chance to pick up some tangi grab it it's a phenomenal strain I mean who doesn't want a wonderful flavor with a wonderful smell and in a wonderful hi all in the same time like I said I recommend this honestly for some of our elderly patients I would definitely recommend this too because of the flavors it's gonna keep them off that that we kind of you know off off sent that up there you know the G their generation is kind of stuck on so this would help somebody the you know needs to ease into the idea or the concept of smoking medical marijuana so this is definitely something I recommend as far as somebody who's new to this industry definitely something for them to try out but as always you know if you like the video like it down below you know if you guys got any comments questions anything like that let me know if there's a certain strain out there that you just want more information about you know you just haven't been able to pick up or find or you just you know are weary about grabbing it let me know I'm willing to test it for you I don't mind I'll pick it up I'll try it you know I'll let you know what my opinion is on it however as always make sure you guys subscribe and all my gift it out there you guys got a stay lifted guys out", "sQF8-dl5fls": "[Music] yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing some of my orange cookies wax so hopefully that does look good on the

"b-q4d-yTMT8": "you see in pockets and material in Africa that still goes back in time like that hasn't had the Dutch infiltration that see like when I when I was over in Hawaii in the in the mid 80s it was the last of the Southeast Asian varietals grown in the cane fields and so I go there and I get to experience some world-class cannabis and it was perfect because the soils the climate all matched up with those type of plants and so you had this incredible combination and then I go back you know years and years later and I got this uh this white kid that's telling me about you need to check out the aloha white widow and I was like that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for the cambodian that used to grow out here that used to take top your head off make you almost peed your pants you had to sit on the toilet smoking um where's that and they're like oh no no you want the white widow and I'm like no I don't want the white widow I know the white widow is like what I want is the things that were from here did did Africa have the ability to hold material in constant do you still have to because someone whose discover in stock because to me I'm like Afghanistan got hammered all over Asia got hammered from war Africa had so much war and famine and issues as you're mining material you stable to mine some of that killer stuff from the past or is it it's getting polluted quickly it's it really is it's hard to find like I was in this last year went to through Ethiopian than this Seychelles Islands right there and it's even finding these old land races where all of a sudden it's like oh these guys were here from Amsterdam a couple years ago and we have a white widow mango that we open pollinated with all our land rate stuff so all of a sudden is this with what's happening is it's harder and harder to find from from Africa and that was years ago Southeast Asia you know I traveled through Vietnam Cambodia lout Thailand area trying to and then even that was mid 90s and you're still running across places where people had brought other genetics in so this is one thing going back in this diversification and being able to keep things from their from the origin you know in Southeast Asia India African keep these genetics separate and being able to do to do testing and that's like the kind of the back step of documenting this but like yeah Africa it's it's anywhere in the world right now it's like Irian Jaya Papua New Guinea you're going there in these areas people have been there with cannabis or him it's amazing because you know for me for my background from being in cannabis when it was coming over from all these places throughout the year in cycle it just let me experience a range of effects that I don't experience now I called most of the stuff we play with now homogenized cannabis and what I want is I want to be able to have these unique directions to fit what I want to do and how I want to feel and I people try to tell me that you know it's your imagination that you're you're dreaming that things will better at that time and I said oh no they they had unbelievable effects and the directions were phenomenal and they were very unique in the way they sent on how you made you feel and you just you don't see this except in some very rare cultivars so we see stuff that's highly marketable and a quality but like you know you working with some of that stuff that panama's I remember some killer panama's that was just thumping and the the flavor profiles were unique in the way it made you feel was unique and the problem is that as soon as we started to hybridize it down so that it would work in our climates as soon as we started to try to bring it indoor we basically just started calling and out of existence and we dumbed it down do we turn the qualities down and if you know for me when I try to get when I meet people that like you like I've known you for a long time but I know that you're you know you scour in the earth and I'm always like did you find some goodies someplace you know is the goodies still remaining somewhere and and and unfortunately the goodies are out there but they're just not markers you know for though for the most part but the some of these cultivars that take 14 weeks that the flowers still have 14 weeks is like a football and it hasn't filled in but but this is something that it's good to have in the toolbox you know let's not get let's 9 you get let this go and I think right now that's these different unique cultivars that we run into it's keep it alive or share it with somebody else and you know it's like that it's like cannabinoids that feed your endocannabinoids you know everybody's different and that's that's the thing something that one strain it's like is that could be that key that helps you like with epilepsy it's 3 to 5 percent right of people that are affected by say Charlotte's Web but what are they cannabinoids within that cultivar that are accessing your endo cannabinoid profile and that's something collecting big data right now going into this on the pharmacogenetic level is identifying these genetics plant genetics and then a person's makeup and seeing that 80 year old lady that's in Australia that just got help from a certain profile and helped her epilepsy epilepsy and then you have a 3 year old child in America or somewhere else that you'd never know that this particular balance of a one to one fight and that's something working one and was finding these old land races from from Africa as well but developing a full cannabinoid profile you know what I'm talking like 5 percent THC 5 CBD 5 CB n CB g CB DV HCV flatline across the board or these different profiles and then when you identify a cultivar like that being able to put it in vitro and you put that on the show", "ONsNd63vZHw": "hey what's good everybody jay ping here checking in respectmyregion.com i am here today to do a quick taste test review featuring a pre-roll

packaging plenty it's definitely high potency it's a smooth smoke harvested on december 6 packaged on march 3rd it's about as fresh as you could possibly get it to me the 8.8 on the taste test and the flavor and then combined with the experience i'm gonna bump it up to a nine flat and then when you think about the price point sixty-five dollars plus tax unfortunately it just doesn't meet that high highest shelf top level premium in my opinion but in on all in all honesty i feel that this item is arguably a 90 out of 100 overall so definitely a premium product for premium flavor and potency let

eight i would say and then let's see i think overall yeah it's going to be a solid 8.75 on the overall taste so far and then when you talk about the actual taste and overall experience and the potency the color all these things the undeniable issue at the beginning of how it lit it's going to affect the score which is how it goes [Music] when you think about all the things considered this is an 18 plus tax pre-roll i can feel the high it's a little bit energetic a little bit clarifying it's potent i think i give this a [Music] 8.5 overall you got to drop the score a little bit because of the way that it lit and how like it's just not it's just not the greatest it can be so let me know what you guys think drop a comment be sure to like follow and subscribe uh be sure to give me any

ready fools you know we do it roaches you catch it", "9050tb9nIeQ": "[Music] [Music] so so yeah flight crew what it do what's happening youtube fam what's happening we here and we finna just jump right into it no time wastage you know what i'm saying we got this long overdue highly anticipated review bars you dig from rit him man we got this we're gonna pop the seal on this purple tsunami man we're gonna get this purple tsunami cracker lagging i've been holding off on the review because the owner my homeboy my personal partner tied over ortega asked me to hold up for a minute while they were transitioning to their new facility new location um and then they were waiting you know to get more flour in stock if you have not checked them out it may not be too late they got several several several new strains dropping that y'all need to check out man if you're a fan of good flour make sure you check them out over ortega let them know smoke sessions tv sent you much appreciated you know what i'm saying uh but let's jump into it man i don't know how my posting is gonna be uh this upcoming week just because i am down in houston i did transition down here which means unfortunately got to deal with hurricanes man and it's like a potential hurricane and another tropical storm all moving towards the gulf so i'm not really sure what's going gonna happen this week you know what i'm saying we'll be good though keep the faith you know what i mean and uh we'll drop the reviews as we can so stay tuned stay posted you know what i'm saying but let's pop the tag on this uh on this purple tsunami man this is how it comes to i had already unboxed it and everything so because like i said i've had this for a little minute i just been sitting on it but it's sealed this air tight no smells nothing nothing's getting through man i hope everybody has been blessed oh my goodness as soon as you pop that seal though them smells is coming through okay hold on there so we got a little we got the little child proof child proof demo you know what i'm saying you got your qr code on there if you want to scan it probably take you right to the uh to the coa matter of fact let's put a brief little synopsis right here for y'all you know what i'm saying just so y'all can see that i got some percentages for you right there you know what i'm saying be sure you check this out and then gonna go ahead throw that coa right there for you as well with the follow-up coa do as you do you know what i'm saying if you need to pause it feel free to pause it right there check it out we'll briefly touch on stuff but i'm not gonna really cover like percentages and everything just because i'm putting it on the screen for you to review that yourself you know what i mean reading is fundamental so again purple tsunami nice glass jar nice labeling nice clear you know i'm saying very uh just very clear and distinct labeling nothing too fancy you know i'm saying very straight to the point kind of got a little level of sophistication to it three and a half draw again with the child proof lock i cover the percent that's just on the drawer really quick for you all we got 11.19 percent cbda delta 9 tac percent is at .01 percent which under the point three which makes it legal shifts straight to your door uh or take they include all the paperwork of course if y'all dealt with them before it always comes with nice paperwork it usually has a personalized card signed by todd's wife um as well or sometimes if the handwriting is really really sloppy you know they got extra busy and that one was from todd himself you know i'm saying and then uh coa is always in there you know what i mean notice the law enforcement is always included so those are just basics that you definitely will receive again this is just something that i had actually opened to pack up a while ago so this is an indoor may not come through too clear because of the glare but this is an indoor hybrid it's a 70 30 if i believe a sativa dominant mix sativas are good for that morning kind of get you upbeat kind of wake you up get you out of bed type of feeling so if you need something to kind of pep you up during the day or wake you up in the morning definitely go towards those sativa dominant flowers um that's what i recommend this was also from a fresh april 2020 harvest as well so this should still be nice fresh flower you see my man's got not not just one boost integra pack but two so this little three and a half it came with two boost integra packs if you're not hit that just keeps your flour fresh keeps that moisture content right where it needs to be so you're not receiving dried out crunchy buds nobody likes that you know what i'm saying if you do that's your thing it's your prerogative you know what i mean bobby brown so let's pop the top man i'm ready because i was smelling it already oh right off the bat the the smell you're getting a kind of a you getting that distinctive kind of you are getting a gassy undertone but it's also a nice blend of just like an exotic kind of a tropical scent to it as well oh yeah you kind of get that that that good old nice cbd kind of earthy kind of a tone as well very very subtle though it's not like it's overwhelming i would say the overwhelming scent for me is going to be like a kind of a just a tropical gassiness to it okay so let's go ahead we're going to look at this flower don't worry i know i'ma give you that up close and personal video then i'm gonna also have up close and personal high quality photos on my ig so if you're not following me you know what i'm saying go ahead and follow your boy on ig i need them ig subscribers to match my youtube subscribers or maybe we can even bypass you know what i'm saying we can we can just bounce right over it and and just keep pushing the sky is the limit so let's check some of these flowers some of this blood out i can already tell you this is terpe it's frosty it is definitely frosty and it's got a nice little amount of purple i mean i know the name is purple tsunami uh really nice beautiful buzz these are very well manicured hand trimmed little nuggets you know what i'm saying that's what we call these little popcorns you know we call these wild front we call these popcorns you know i know my finger kind of putting a little shade a little shade on there so let's try from that view again no worries though because y'all are going to get an up close and personal view with it you know i'm saying let's compare the bud size to the top of my thumb you know i mean so you got some nice little popcorn buds in there uh very turpy i mean you can see the you can see the frost you can see the crystals uh not really like a lot of i mean the herds are there the hairs are there but it's such a such a great trim job to where even the the hairs or as we call them or the pistols you know what i'm saying is they are scientifically known as um are not just jumping out because it's so it's actually really frosty and it's got some nice purple specks throughout some really nice purple specks throughout so here's what we're going to do let's let's do a sticky test now before i even do the video or the up close and personal y'all know how we like to do that sticky test that hang time that jump man you know what i'm saying we like to do that test here we're gonna crack this one open too and get a smell you know what i'm saying you never really get that full potential of the smell just that fool in your face fragrance sometimes until you bust them down you gotta bust them open now when i crack it open i'm getting the kind of a sweet earthiness to it a sweet kind of just standard cbd flour kind of earthiness but it's got a sweetness to it as well nice and purple on the inside very very crystally very terpene on the inside you are kind of starting to see some of those orange hairs or those orange pistols uh once you crack it open so again without further ado flight crew more boys we're gonna do this sticky test okay so not nothing super crazy okay so very average i give it i give it one more i'm gonna try a different piece we'll give it one more okay so maybe maybe maybe a second and a half maybe two seconds worth of hang time nothing crazy but i'm not gonna knock it for that because the flower looks amazing so instead of me just constantly telling y'all how beautiful this flower is we're gonna go ahead and cut to the up close and personal video flight crew so y'all can get a look at what this purple tsunami do hold tight [Music] nice [Music] [Music] yeah we back flight crew so there you have it y'all got the up close and personal view of this beautiful purple tsunami you got to see it in all this up close and personal glory you got to see it in his birthday suit you know i'm saying one thing i forgot to mention as well that it was listed on her that this flower actually took over three years of breeding and testing to get what we have today so they did put a lot of effort a lot of trial and error into this flower into the into just just bringing you the best flower what it seems like that's a goal over at orate is that they do want to just bring you quality quality flower quality prices they have budget lines they have exotic lines premium you know what i'm saying so just check them out man if you have a moment but let's see what this purple tsunami talking about first thing we're gonna do is they get old dry pool nice freshness on the dry pool you kind of get that that kind of sweetness on the dry pool but it's not very not not something overwhelming not really just jumping out with flavor on the dry pool but you are getting a kind of fresh sweetness on the dry pool so let's go ahead and smoke in folks like always i don't do much on the first pool or two just because i am using a lighter so it does tend to have a little butane flavor i don't want to discredit the flavor or the taste of the blood no whatsoever you know what i'm saying so i want to give y'all the most honest to the point you know what i'm saying review without any outside interferences i want it all to be on a level playing field one of my subscribers actually did ask me as well to do you know put in a request actually to to show more of the ashes as i'm smoking just so y'all can kind of see how clean that the how clean or not clean that the flour is burning um as well so i will try to do that i'm just a person where i don't like getting ashes all over the place so as soon as i see ashes forming i'm like you know hitting that ass tray so excuse me for that if i do that i just don't like spilled ashes you know what i'm saying like like a drinker don't like spilling alcohol i don't like getting ashes all over the place okay a little bit of a throw grab see i'm dropping ashes okay you know what i'm saying man ashes don't rock you know what i'm saying we all it's happening like like crazy not because i'm talking about it i did kind of stuff this one a little tight i was trying to pack it in that purple comes through when you grind it if you grind it up okay excuse me you got to respect the gangster that purple tsunami with that throw grab purple tsunami ain't playing no games so see what i'm saying let's let's try to get a little ash look right here you know it's not the best look you know what i'm saying but you can kind of get a little bit and see what the ash is kind of looking like i know it's not the best you know so i apologize but it is got a nice little white burn to it i just don't really let my ass just like really develop too much and hang off okay so the flavor i just got some of that kind of zesty it was like a zest sweet kind of fruit type of a flavor just on that inhale just now okay okay it's a whole idea that it's a whole header y'all straight up this one is definitely all ahead there you go you can really kind of get a little bit you can see the color of that ash and for those of you who are interested in that ash you know what i'm saying why not pass it to go get your pool you know what i'm saying gone don't pull it get you a cup of toast you know what i'm saying let me share sharing this curry you know i said it's the only way you gonna smoke a head with me doing this corona yeah yeah back like i never left you know what i'm saying we dropped our phone on y'all getting y'all pulling and we was looking at the whiteness of those asses you know what i'm saying as requested by one of my subscribers because i do review and read y'all comments i try to respond and do whatever y'all asking me to do to the best of my abilities as long as there ain't no [ __ ] you know what i'm saying so let's finish smoking man purple tsunami who's talking about that flavor it just reminded me just now getting it again that flavor is a very coating one you know what i'm saying every pool that gets stronger it's coating the inside of your mouth so it's taking them taste buds over and it's getting stronger and stronger with every pool uh and i'm not mad at it so it's definitely doing something you know i'm saying this guy again it's like a it almost has a sour diesel type of a flavor to it as far as like the zest um the zest is similar to a sour um on the flavor it's got just a zest but then it's got the kind of fruit tone to it as well like a kind of a fruity zesty undertone uh and it's definitely got some throw grab not harsh at all so that's not what i say throw grab y'all here it's already affecting me each pool you know what i'm saying we gotta take a little drink for the cause y'all yes lord okay so yeah like we were saying and then look look at the look at the ring that's starting to develop i see that ring y'all see that glistening it's got some paella it's got some punch so if you oppressor you know i'm saying if you like to press this might have something that's not a scientific test that's just a smoke sessions tv certified flight crew approved testing method you know what i'm saying we look for that we look for those little things nice smoke though it's it's gonna grab you it's gonna hit you every time but it's got you want to pull big because the flavor you you gonna enjoy the taste and the flavor so much to where you gonna be like you're gonna be tempted to take them big pools them he-man pools as i call it you know what i'm saying but you definitely are gonna want to go easy you know what i'm saying because it's got a little grab to it i'm starting to feel that kind of upbeat kind of just sativa feeling you know what i'm saying so that's why sativas again are preferred in the mornings get you through that afternoon hump you know what i'm saying not a before bed type of deal because this is going to give you that upbeat uplifted vibe if you're looking for something you know what i mean to help relax you and get you get your night cap in then you're going to want to go for more of an indica dominant this is a 70 30 sativa dominant uh purple tsunami right here so definitely something to kick your day off with your coffee or something got a nice taste to it good flavor and it's definitely gonna you know get you a more upbeat type of vibe so again purple tsunami coming to you uh from rta hemp orate hemp y'all always producing and putting out quality flaw but this is just another one y'all gonna set the bar so high i expect nothing less you know i think the subscribers expect nothing less and before we do anything let's let's go y'all know how we gotta end it out you

I always think of times people think of it when it was made illegal in the 19th days someone a historical anomaly you've just given the scope of time it would appear not many people go to jail in the

this up sorry about that 10 points uh 10 categories 100 points i'm gonna take a dab i'm going to talk about it and yeah i'll explain to you why i gave it the score i did so this is the package it came in the 35 gram shatter this is the package it came in gold pretty plain doesn't really stand out too much but what stood out was the strain wedding gushers and the price 35 dollars good price it's pretty good for shatter you want to be a little bit more translucent but that's got a good color on it all right so i'm going to break off a little piece here boom i'm going to throw this into my my wriggler shout out to higher standard for the beautiful piece all right so we're going to cold start this dab because you want to full start the dab that way you don't burn any of the terpenes and i can get all the flavor i can see that melting up in there nice okay that's nice and melted oh wow yeah you get a really a really gassy flavor wedding that's wedding cake and uh gushers crossed together and uh you definitely get the gas of the wedding cake there so presentation 70 it's just plain gold packaging and i can't see the shatter um it's really hard to justify spending any amount of money when i can't see the product but luckily the the wedding gushers strain just really stood out to me um shattered the fact that it's shatter alone stood out to me shout out to palm desert you guys have a really robust shatter market which is awesome the shadow markets die down a lot in washington state it's hard to find a lot of good shatter there are a couple brands that make it but it's really hard to find a lot of good stuff but uh the bud tender recommended this brand for the bang for their buck so uh so it gets so the product appeal it bounced it back up to a 90 percent color eighty percent uh it looks like good shatter i wish it was a little more translucent but it does look really good uh smell 75 percent shatters never really gonna get a crazy smell category the aromatics on shatter just really aren't there but the taste is wonderful 88 just pure gas on the taste potency again 88 it hits you right away this strain hits you right away i'm kind of fumbling through my words a little bit so i can tell that it's a little bit more of a heavy strain probably not one i would use during the day if it weren't for me doing this review for you guys more information available i had a docket a few points on this too i really only get the thc information 72 thc and barely any cbd so you know i wish i got some terpene information i wish i got you know maybe some strain genetics uh you know anything to tell me about the brand or the product more other than basic thc um which is on the category of why i buy products thc percentage is is lower i would almost rather see terpenes by themselves than um just thc percentages on a concentrate if i'm being honest because then i at least know what kind of flavor i'm gonna get but i would still recommend this product bang for your buck 35 bucks good shatter good taste good high can't really ask for a lot i like i like i said i like the price 35 dollars is really reasonably priced for good concentrates especially in california so if you're up in the palm palm desert area definitely look out for that i gave it at 82 overall like i said i wish i could see the product before i buy it um because like i said i think their product does look good so if they showed it off you know more people would probably buy it the packaging doesn't really stand out and there's not a lot of information available but all that being said i would definitely buy this wedding gusher shatter again from king's garden so if you like the review like like the video subscribe to the channel check out our entire library of west coast weed tour reviews and that's all i got for you guys today see you later", "9AYvLly1isA": "how are you doing today I hope great and thank you for watching this video I also want to thank all the new YouTube subscribers and all the Twitter followers welcome to the family and let's get right to it on this video I'm gonna show you and tell you about the ultra black line 450 milligram cards raised from fluent I paid $60 for the cartridge and it came in at eighty nine point three for two percent THC the cartridge quality is top-notch great airflow and it didn't clog at any point plus the flavor never changed I'm extremely impressed with the cartridges they use I have tried plenty of OG Kush flour before and I must say the flavor on this cartridge is really dead on the flavor was a combination of wood and pine only thing missing compared to the flour was the light hints of lemon but overall it was a great flavor on the cartridge unto the effects the first effect - here was all my stress and anxiety issues melting into a flowing river of inner joy that had me smiling from ear-to-ear then came the euphoric need to enjoy myself and listen to the music and dance all the things I'd like to do the combination of that inner joy and do foria completely eliminated my mood swings for the duration of the effects another great effect is my chronic back pain was lower to the point where I only felt that when I got up from my chair or did short movements like that there was also a strong urge to eat all kinds of snacks which helped a great deal with my appetite loss problem not very long after the effects started I also felt my entire body feel relaxed - this eliminated some overworked shoulder pain that I had from the day before and I am very impressed with how well I can feel the effects of this black line cartridge I can definitely work on this strain it calms me down fills me with inner joy gives me the power to deal with anything my job throws at me and it lowers my pain through the workday so awesome I definitely recommend this Ozar black line carthoris for all day and night use hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "oODxSjyjuuo": "hey YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video you see I got me a cartridge you got Mike hangar tougher tech Freddy a hit up rise Erie and grab some outer space is the strain LLR cartridge outer space this is coming in at like 85 almost 86 percent THC it is a strong one that's why I grabbed it very strong stuff yep fresco LLR cartridge outer space is the strain I had had this in the sugar before I did have this and the sugar before it was really good so I figured it's got to be good in the car our cartridge wastes no time let's get it open without further adue Cresco outer space ll our cartridge this opens got the soy cheese will move nice outer space ll our cartridge filled up to the top nice nice and filled [Music] Jesco red cuz it's a sativa so it's got the red ring around it I like how they filled it up to the top some of the currents they do some don't seem filled very nice let's get this little rubber piece off the bottom here throw it on my pen settings sativa I like my sativas like I said I had this in the in a sauce before and it was man it was really really good so and I bought this just because it was a really high potency I said the potencies of eighty five point zero four three plus another like 100 zero point nine seven eight so most eighty six and this was packaged on ten seven twenty nineteen so really just a couple weeks ago not even at a week ago the seventh October seventh this was packaged and expires of course October seventh of 2020 most marijuana products they give it one year expiration date let's give it a hit so the Cresco outerspace LLR cartridge bath gram paid fifty five for the half gram mmm nice nice sweet almost like a candy taste with a little I don't know kind of like citrusy maybe kick to it at the end really nice dog that says a nice flavour Cresco has the best lor cartridges right now I haven't tried a prime yet I don't think but yeah matter of fact I don't think I've tried any other lor cartridges other than Cresco so I really can't make that claim I apologize I haven't gonna try to get a prime one maybe a Liberty they also have no other cartridges that rise I guess because Cresco is so good did I just keep hiding them I bought this one and I also bought kosher tangi which I'll be doing a review on that one too kosher tangents of hybrid LLR cartridge yeah bought two of them yeah I spent the hundred bucks I use $10 credit once again I had a $10 credit built up and dropped a hundred bucks for a gram to half gram cartridges stuff is expensive but it's quality and uh so you get what you pay for mm-hm Cheers outer space LLR [Music] nice sweet candy tastes kind of a sweetheart you know that type of candy a little bit tart but sweet this is exactly what this tastes like very good though well I think I'm gonna wrap this video up I don't want to make it too long you take a lot of time to upload to YouTube if you make them really wrong and nobody really wants to watch a long ass video about it about a review so LLR cartridge outer space pretty good I'll let you know more about what I thought down south in the comments let me know what you guys are smoking on PA medical marijuana peace I'm out", "9ose8u5egtA": "welcome to Lexus world today let's light a J gather round and talk about the tale of Australian bastard cannabis all the info that's out there on it and whether you can obtain it today so in my popular freaks of cannabis mutations episode which I'll link to in the description I brought up the very unusual Australian bastard cannabis strain or ABC and promised you guys had cover it at length this was a stable strain not just the one-off mutation that grows in the wilderness of Australia and had stayed largely off the radar because to even tell it's cannabis you have to inspect it closely during flowering phase the earliest first-hand reports I could find of it being seen in the wild are from the 1980s and 90s locally in Australia ABC is known as cannabis Australis buying the buds mutant or mangy weed depending on who you talk to sorry if I'm pronouncing any of that wrong Australians but whatever you call it ABC doesn't resemble the cannabis most of us are used to first off the leaves look completely different as you see in these pictures they can't even be considered fan leaves also it grows more in a shrub like pattern instead of the typical Christmas tree pattern that cannabis tends to exhibit and also it's not very tall as a result average height is about two to three feet however ABC is definitely cannabis it gives off a cannabis like smell and females produced small buds with resin on them but the potency is pretty poor well below 5 percent THC nowadays Australians used to 10 to 20 percent THC tend to describe the high from purebred ABC as kind of crappy bit of a buzz and not worthwhile but supposedly if you scrape some ABC hash together you can get 21st century level baked from the plant how it came to exist in the wild as anybody's guess though one hypothesis is that it's the result of some strange cross-pollination with Australian hop bush which admittedly looks very similar but this is a total speculation I mean for all we know this is a cannabis land race that's exclusive to Australia and has been there for thousands of years we really just don't know in any case the truly outstanding characteristic of ABC aside from the stealthy appearance is its resistance to cold and frost supposedly it will even put up with direct snowfall within reason this and other bits of info lead me to believe that finding the strain out in the wild is easiest in the New South Wales areas of Australia as the mapa should imply several growers reported being well-known in the north eastern areas of New South Wales the next thing people want to know about ABC has the strain been bred before to get higher potency while keeping the weird look and what were the results well back in the late 90s Canadian activist mark Emery imported some cannabis Australis from Australia nicknamed at Australian bastard cannabis and covered it in his cannabis culture magazine not once but several times between 1999 and 2005 the articles were actually written by well-known activist Dana Larsen now the folks of cannabis culture didn't have a ton of ABC to seedbank with so they crossed it with flow and distributed the cross as extra freebies in North America calling it simply ABC crossed with flow flow being a very potent well known strain at the time the idea was maybe to create a strain that had the potency of the flow and the appearance of the AV see pretty straightforward but there was a major obstacle that cut off this vision in its tracks growers that got the first generation cross seeds and reported back found that ABC appearance was highly highly recessive so most of the breeding results ended up looking like ordinary flow cannabis only a small fraction looked like the ABC though it did appear that some of the toughness from the original ABC was passed on to the crosses if all that confused you please take a look at my breeding basics video for more information on breeding a link to it in the description as well either way there wasn't too much of this cross created and there wasn't much interest for it compared to regular old flow or pure ABC so that was the end of this improv breeding program but how can you obtain seeds of the original pure ABC today that's the biggest question people have been asking since the freaks of cannabis episode as far as I've been able to determine there is nobody today who has actively seed banking legitimate seeds of this strain and only a handful of low-key Australian regional growers exist who even play with it at all none of whom are interested in selling seeds in general so it's near impossible to get this out in Europe or in North America without travelling to Australia however if you're somehow well-connected with growers in eastern Australia especially those associated with the old medical growing community there there's not a bad chance you can find the seeds just by reaching out to people through their Twitter feeds or Facebook pages because at various points since the early 90s good volumes of seeds have been sold to many people in the area and there have also been odd sightings of ABC in the wild still either way any breeding program that can increase the potency of the strain while keeping the appearance would several generations of careful work to pull off and though you'd get out of it as they tough in the cold variety of cannabis frankly there's easier ways to achieve that so if you pursue ABC for breeding it may only be for the novelty and scarcity of it so there you go if you do want to hunt for the seeds you may want to start your hunt on a little-known Australian growers form called oz stoners cannabis community or any Australian cannabis Facebook pages also if you happen to be from Australia and have additional reliable info to provide on this please leave it in the comment section below because worldwide there is a good chunk of people curious about the strain otherwise hope you enjoyed the show please

everybody oh yeah hmm okay for definite out of all three this one has got to be the tastiest super super fruity oh man this is nothing at all like the other two doesn't mean really it sounds kinda similar it's just some hints of a Northern Lights book yeah this one is totally tropical oh man yeah and like I was saying it the order did primary difference with this one compared to the order to is

more this is top shelf smoking on and sign it out see you next time guys", "3Ok2500tuyE": "yo guys what is up we go bags with another cart review today's cart it's gonna be pure earth Harley Quinn sativa so without further ado let's get right into this this challenge for eighteen to twenty one depending on your state you already know the rules I don't make them I just tell you how it is so if that doesn't apply to you you already know what the deal is but there's us and I appreciate it today's video is not going to be quite like all the other ones when it comes to the review it's all the other ones are focused around this the cart itself today's review is actually kind of gonna be around me and then the channel we have right now I'm just kind of in a predicament when it comes to actually you know will drop the channel talk and my personal top so after we take a couple of hits here what into so like I said this is a Harley Quinn pure earth cart I've had this open for a day and a half two days and I just been chugging a lock on it it's it's pretty much gone there's a little bit left I didn't plan on making a video that's why there's so little left there's definitely enough to get like one to three maybe hits but but like I said the reason that I didn't record this video is because know Jesus like no we're not going to talk about why I didn't work what the hell I got ink on my finger but I could talk about why I didn't record this just yet let's talk about the card itself so we're gonna get through the really quick review and then we're gonna get to the talking part if you don't care about that part that's why this is first so here we have pure earth just like the last one but this last one was DJ short which had some amazing strain tastes this one is a very cushy flower taste so if that is a your cup of tea then this one is really good for you I'm a big fan of this one even though I'm not a fan of most cush tastes cuz they kind of hurt my chest which is weird I don't know how that works but whenever it's a cart and it tastes like like kosher flour or anything like that it gives me like this really painful chest feeling it's hard it's hard to explain but yeah I so yeah like I said up and smoking on this first day a day and a half two days whatever whatever it is and I do like this one it's got a nice good I'll happen nice good hi it is a sativa it's just a half gram so you know nothing too special here but pure earth they make some really high quality carts some really high quality wax if you guys are into carts like this I know some viewers are actually into flower a lot more or maybe some learn to dabs whatever maybe but if you're in a carts this is actually a really strong potent one if you like that cush taste which I know some some people do so if you do and there you go that's your cart just to the side here guys we got it we're charging my phone and the battery while we're doing this or make a move um yeah so Shh I guess that's about it this thing cost the cost know this thing was priced at $35 um I got a buy one get one with the first time visit so that's pretty dope I think that's about it like I said Harley Quinn sativa half gram I ripped off the sticker I don't remember if it showed the potency on their bottom sticker to pull it out same thing is the last box crazy you know there's the sticker right there look at that yeah no it's just just the the size of the cart and the name of the strange so 500 milligram Harley Clinton well this is gang I don't know that it's the box box giving off this really weird smell so yeah well that's all that out of the way that's all the talk no way let's go ahead and take this charger off the battery here looking nice and pretty unscrew it you already know the drill I'm in charge of batteries but is what it is I don't really have any liquid to you guys actually I do I'm pretty stupid I wouldn't brought some water just for this occasion let's go ahead and do a little hydration right here Cheers good they shaped my [ __ ] into it that's cool all right guys let's do one hit here and then we'll start talking about the the channel and stuff like that so Cheers let me know if you guys are smoking on anything down in the comments always super hyped to know it's always cool to see what you guys are smoking on and yeah so cheers guys okay so yeah yeah that's a I kind of take back the last thing I said about this card that it doesn't give me that that chest feel and this one definitely does too it's not the card but it's not a pan a pain Jesus I can't speak it's not a pain I think I made enough to seem like it was a pain it's not it is this kind of makes it hard for me to breathe like my chest is like super having I take really short breaths like that because it's just so hard for me to like inhale that I guess I'm not sure but yeah it's very very Cushing no other taste to it just that so if you're just looking for a pure cush like flower strain taste this is really good for it hydration break yeah so now we kind of got the review out of the way we might take a couple more hits here and there kind of want to talk about my channel if you guys are a sub and that's something you care about but if not and the reviews kind of over it might be a little hint sub talking about it here and there but as for the car taste if you like the cush it's like a eight out of ten probably and if you're going for potency is probably a eight point five eight eight point four somewhere in there so there you go that's all you came forward and I appreciate it but if you want to hear the info on the channel and the future of it go ahead and stay for the next couple of minutes so how it's coming down like I wanted to apologize first thing for no strain Saturday or Sunday or whatever I'm making it I'm gonna try to do another one hopefully pretty soon but I'm not sure or the reason I don't want to make a video on this cart was because I already did the last one the hardly or the the pure earth the DJ short one and I mean they're not too much different it will smack me pretty hard trying to taste pretty well they're the both taste really good and I enjoyed both of them but I just don't know one if you guys like sing to the same card brands back to bag maybe I can buy one cart and then hold off on that one I had like an extra one it's so like I do another one like so say if I get two pure earths and then two venom axes I can do like a pure venom X pure venom banks or something like that I don't know but that's something I just been considering too is when it comes to flower I'm not really sure how to review that I'm trying with the strain Saturday one that I did two weeks ago or a week ago or whatever was and you know that seemed to get some decent feedback so I'm like I'm time to do that that's something I want to keep doing for sure so there's one future like set up videos the carts I love the cards I love doing them because they're so easy and carts are just they're awesome but they're expensive they are a killer um $35 for a half gram that I'll go through in two days like a day maybe I smoked a lot so yeah maybe a day a date to three days if I really want to push it on a half gram but like that's pushing it two days is tops I mean $35 every two days that's killer even if I get buy one deals I mean those only happen once a week maybe two times a week of something decent cards so it's just party off and I've used my buy one get one for the most part on mostly dispose they're close to me hydration right so yeah it's it's just kind of coming really expensive so I'm just kind of trying to chill because I go to school full-time I don't really work I work my dad part-time to make some money but yeah it's just kind of rough where I'm at right now so I'm just kind of time to take it slow that's why videos might be a little like the way that statically because it's just hard to get so much cash they keep putting these videos out you know I'm saying but you know I'm trying maybe I'll buy like some booth carts and review those for you guys because they're like 20 bucks and then you guys get a good kick out of it because it's me dying on pesticides and maybe I'll get some views out of it for some like like review comparing contracts I can tell you guys about all that booth [ __ ] I smoked a lot of it so let's go ahead and take another hit I'm feeling pretty good about this I was just about this just feel pretty good in general it's down a little bit earlier to stress like I said other things weighing on my mind so this is definitely relieving a lot of that so it's really nice to have so let's do another one and then yeah we'll see where it goes from there Cheers yeah yeah it's a nice car guys girth definitely some quality are parts hydration breaker um you guys getting my first hits in the bed and then smoked it all the day smoked a lot yesterday I smoked like I smoked a whole half gram cart and then I smoked 12 half Grand Prix rules so yeah I went ham yesterday I wish I recorded that for you guys I don't know I didn't cuz I should've got a little clip or something maybe I could've thrown it in here figured out how to do that but yeah it was super dope I look like ripped four at a time at once and then I just singular doubles from then on now it's pretty so that was cool but yeah I'm just kind of trying to figure out video options that aren't too expensive for me but that will keep you guys entertained I know the cards are like my channel's main focus right now and I'm totally up for doing experimenting like you know with wax like dab wax or maybe like flower edibles I would love to expiry like do for you guys and like have like a dough best vlog where I go out with some friends and that bulls means chill or something that sounds dope it's [ __ ] but edibles just don't do it for me they don't give me high I don't know I've eaten like 500 milligrams and I've eaten five milligrams I mean no no difference to me it's all the same so that's that if you guys have any video idea of Audis the hell if you guys have any video ideas please let me know in the comments that would be massive um whether it be like for like a strange Saturday or like I just even the random video maybe it's like smoke five grams in one sitting I don't I don't even know if that's that's not really that hard but you know something like that even just small is awesome I don't know uh yeah any helps previous I'm kind of just trying to give try to get videos out it's just

better have me a blast last night i was having fun i don't know why but don julio makes the night so fun so uh all right let's go ahead and get this cheetah piercing and i never been messing about until like this and the ball would have failed woo out of bed man that's cheetah fist oh now it's hard for me to explain the taste of cheetah piss but i'll give it a shot all right let's get back in here one more time that was weak that was weak allow me to get my breathing straight please something i should have done off camera but okay okay i don't think we broke the butt down good enough so let's get back in here it's a it's weird because i can't get a taste it's kind of sweet but there's a weird taste to it that i can't i can't explain i'm almost sure that this is not dispensary grade cheetah piss but it's pretty tasty nonetheless and i'm starting to feel a buzz right across my forehead [Music] faces i apologize you guys i can't give you an accurate tasting on this cause i don't taste nothing now to um cheetah pisses defense i've had it in this jar in this bag with that piece of paper for four days so it probably got dried out taking some of the flavor away didn't take none of that highway though hey there's a slight lemony taste on the backside but i got a burning on the back top part of my throat back top it's kind of like a it's a weird taste i can't put my finger on it okay all right let's talk about something different real quick so i made a statement saying that uh that uh abraham lincoln was black everybody got so upset with that not everybody but you know here's here's something man when when when when black people speak on something and you get upset careful you might be racist i'm not saying that you're racist i'm just saying pay attention to the things that happen when black people speak on black issues that's no place for anybody else to step in that's not of color you know what i'm saying when when black people speak on black issues there's no need for you for you to say anything unless you're a person of color i'm not saying state [ __ ] out our conversations and don't say no but i'm not saying that i'm just saying if i'm talking about some black issues over here there is no need for anybody that's not of color to step in and try to help the situation but that but pertaining to uh abraham lincoln being black the guy told me that i said he said well prove to me that he was black i said prove to me that he was white he said the burden of proof doesn't lie with me now this is just a discussion we're not arguing we're just having a discussion he said the proof of the burden of proof doesn't lie with me i said man you didn't ask that person the first person that told you that abraham lincoln was white you didn't ask them to prove it you just accepted it so why is it so difficult to accept that abraham lincoln was actually black so i told him i said check this out i said put a quarter a nickel a dime and a penny down now first of all let's start with the color of the penny why is the penny that color yeah i know you're going to say because it's copper no because he was black okay i know it sounds simple it really does sound simple but these are simple people that we're talking about not only that you set them all face down and all the quarters and dimes and nickels are facing one way and the penny is facing a whole other way symbolizing that they have turned their back on him perhaps because of his race so there's the quarter c's facing that way and there's a penny he's facing that way so the even the nickel and the don face this way so but we're dealing with simple people and a lot of people say that hey man it doesn't matter if he was black or white if it doesn't matter if he was black or white then why does it matter that he's black see it only matters when he's when he's not the color that you want him to be you know what i'm saying not that grace matters i'm i'm not trying to say that race matters because well actually it does matter because we have been written out of history and and i'm tired of being written out of history that's some [ __ ] you know white people didn't come about to what 1600s something like that sixteen hundreds something of that nature let me see if i can find it so hang on a second please okay here's here's a little something it says groundbreaking analysis of the birth of racism in america when the first africans arrived in virginia in 1619 there were no white people there nor according to colonel records would there be for another 60 years 60 years man so now black people are we were here first i i don't i didn't make it it just that's just the way it was black people were here first caucasian didn't come around till about 1679 1680 somewhere around there so you guys are making me believe that first of all white people weren't even around and then when white people were created a genetic mutation when they were created now white people just came and just took over and now they're president we've been here the whole time but we're going to let you guys you know that was created become president i'm just i'm just trying to get along get around with what history is telling us history is [ __ ] all history his [ __ ] what we need to do is just move from this from this point from this place forward now we can't move from this place forward until we get rid of freaking racism and we can't get rid of racism until we start including black people into everything black people have been pivotal in doing the whole time of history man the whole time we've invented so much [ __ ] man and uh history has been whitewashed so much that they that it's only believed that the only history that black people have is slavery are you serious that's the only history we have is slavery we didn't invent [ __ ] we didn't invent the photo the telephone we didn't invent electricity we didn't have none of this [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of here but we're here to smoke now that was a fat hit y'all i don't know what happened but that hit was just if you guys get tired of me talking about race man imagine how i feel about racism the only reason why i talk about race a lot y'all is because i have to deal with it i know a lot most 99 of people of color have to deal with racism on a daily basis we have to deal with it every day man there's some racist [ __ ] going on every day and i'm tired of it i don't like it man i don't like it at all somebody said the only way to get rid of racism is to stop talking about it how does that work okay let's not talk about racism but you still got [ __ ] that we're still not included in [ __ ] you know what i'm saying we had to fight to become [ __ ] president again black president again we gotta fight to get in the position every top position is held by caucasians and that's messed up and you can't tell me that's not racism so we have to talk about it to get rid of it let's get racism to get out of here man because of the bottom line is we're all people man and we're all here on this [ __ ] together man let's go yeah on a scale of one to ten one being the [ __ ] of the flavor critique of this cheetah piss i really didn't get too much of a flavor off this strand although it's good and i'm really feeling starting to feel the buzz i really didn't get too much flavor off of it so for this particular nug or this specific particular strand i can't give it no higher than a seven that's one thing i give this cheetah piss now now cheetah piss out straight off the dispensary i'm telling you all is eight nine maybe even a ten cheetah piss is delicious so i i i know that it's better than that but this particular strand right here is only a seven for the flavor got to do it okay ratatouille let's get back in here back in the saddle again i really do hope that you guys are having an extraordinary morning man because i'm telling you right now you guys this is going to be an awesome sunday you're going to get everything that you deserve today in a good way i don't mean like bad stuff or you're going to get what you deserve not like that because i'll never wish bad on anybody man i wish good on all you always good on everybody man [Music] excuse me shall we put some more in here don't mind if i do all righty then hold [Music] we're gonna break it down a little better this time because uh i don't think i broke it out good enough okay if i had another hand i'd probably be okay what you think anyway all right and it's a hard little nug man [ __ ] i almost need a knife for this [ __ ] okay let's get it up in here let go oh [Music] all right [ __ ] oh my goodness that was a serious hit right there you wow okay you guys i've really been dragging my feet on this so on this merge thing cause uh it's crazy because i have i have the logo excuse me guys i have the logo you know she sent me the logo she's a really good artist um uh once i um once i get the logo onto a shirt i'll release her name and and direct you guys to her definitely gotta give her a shout out but excuse me i'm pretty high right now you guys and i'm how you doing see that's how i know that this i knew this was some good cheetah piss when i got it i wish i would have smoked this first because it has definitely lost some of its flavor by sitting in that bag next to that paper being in a plastic bag it already draws your wheat out but then have having a piece of paper in there dries it out even further it's not crumbly yet so that lets me know how moist it was it was probably pretty moist when i first got it i remember touching he put it in the bag itself but uh baby i'm feeling quite nice [ __ ] yeah when i do like this you guys i'm trying to look at the time stamp that's all because the time stamp is right here it's right here so i have to do like this because it's blended into the background because it's white so i had to do this to see the time stamp i don't like to make videos my critique videos too long some before i believe that you can get pretty high in like 15-20 minutes so we'll probably be going live again this afternoon i don't know if it'll be like this morning like maybe 10 or 11 i don't know um but i probably will go live you guys notice that i tend to go live a lot when it's nice outside if i do a live like in this daytime it's got to be night out nice outside because i like sitting outside it's really nice yesterday you guys it was like 84 degrees spring is in the air yeah spring is in here oh yeah okay all right you taste so good now well not really taste good but you know what i'm saying man oh yo i'm ready to go out here and kill some zombies now on the game you know i say um i said before that a zombie apocalypse would like end a whole bunch of crazy [ __ ] you know what i'm saying like it would end money um it would end racism um a zombie apocalypse would end a lot of [ __ ] man but not only that you guys know that they're trying to uh they're trying to depopulate so i think bill gates said he wanted down to 750 million or something like that where almost had seven billion people he wants it down to 650 million or 750 million so the the little pandemic virus thing didn't work um they poisoned the food that's not working um they poison the water that's not working they've tried poison in the air that's not working we're still here so um all the only thing they're doing is making us immune to every [ __ ] thing so the crazy part is the only thing to really depopulate would really be to make [ __ ] zombies you don't have to worry about [ __ ] then so you build yourself a bunker underground create some zombies let them run loose for a few years then you come out and just kill everything everything that ain't dead will soon be dude but i don't know if i would want a zombie apocalypse to you know to end all that [ __ ] man because you got to be on your [ __ ] guard man 24 7 maybe you can't go outside do [ __ ] ain't no riding around going to the beach no more ain't no going to restaurants you know what i'm saying ain't none of that [ __ ] man electricity they probably [ __ ] cut electricity also everybody's living in the dark and [ __ ] you know it's just some [ __ ] eventually everything would run out because i would damn sure go get me a generator and keep [ __ ] going or some solar paneling but you see they're trying to block the sun he said that bill gates was trying to block the sun because of the harmful uv rays it's like get the [ __ ] out of here you ain't trying to block the sun for harmful uv rays because we've had these uv rays since beginning of time what you're trying to do is make sure that every source of electricity is gone when you guys decide to shut [ __ ] down you know what i'm saying they block the sun your solar panels ain't working you get generators gas is going to run out they're not going to [ __ ] get any more gas from wherever they feel from wherever they get it from so pretty soon that's going to run out and then we're just going to be sitting here looking stupid in the dark going up what do we do now we would figure something to do oh we would teach them zombies how to act around this [ __ ] and start getting along with them i'm just playing anyway you guys on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] 10 being that flavor [ __ ] of the high critique of this cheetah piss we're gonna give this a i'm really not impressed with this one with this particular strand i think um my storage uh messed up the the uh the thc content of it or the flavor or the high you guys know the drier weed gets the more thc it loses so i am going to give it an eight but i'm really i'm pretty hard man it's right behind my eyes and i feel i feel good man but um i feel like going to kill some zombies on the game call of duty anyone anyway you guys have a purely blessed day man not to be less but to be more than you can be i truly love you all i appreciate you guys man i
