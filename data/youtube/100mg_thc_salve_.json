{"QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and

so far we've done the face serum and the bath bomb two of my favorites and today i'm gonna pick another so let me go i need to start picking before i don't know which one i'm gonna pick yet since it's so sunny out you can see the light from my window i decided to choose the product that i love in the summer so it's our cbd oil skin sap it's a little hard oh there you go it's a little hard to see in this light it's really feeling like summer here in colorado i don't know how it's feeling where you are but it's been super warm i think yesterday it was mid 80s high 80s maybe even and so this is really my go-to summer product um so i'll open it up so all of our products have a shrink wrap on them and so they're tamper evident so when you buy it you're assured that no one else has opened it put it on so it's just a nice little fun fact so i have one actually that's open down here and it's oh it smells so good so you can see it in the light it's a little hard to see but this beautiful beautiful yellow color from the kalanja it just smells like summer honestly so it's a mixture of tea tree essential oil helichrysum essential oil chamomile tongue twister chamomile essential oil and lavender essential oil so all those essential oils in there are really soothing to the skin um and helichrysum as we talked about with the face serum the immortal flower so this is really going to help keep skin and ageless and looking young and i really like to use this under my eye i get really bad under eye bags and under eye puffiness so this really helps just kind of soothe that and relax it and does is kind of a better um a thicker product than the face serum so it's really nice to put on at night or right when you wake up in the morning right under the eye i wouldn't really recommend this all over the face some people do use it all over the face but it takes a certain skin type so you'd have to test it it's coconut oil which can be pretty heavy and um poor blocking on the face and so or poor filling your pores and kind of can create acne for some people so i wouldn't put it all over the face unless you've done a little test first but under the eyes is really amazing and then the other thing i like to use this for i know i said it was for summer that i like to use this but actually i use it a lot in the winter so you know when you go snowboarding or skiing but when i go snowboarding you have your goggles on and you have your little face cover but like right here gets like tons of sun and wind and cold and i always leave snowboarding with like a lovely little red mustache which is just not ideal so i like to put this on before i go snowboarding right here to kind of block that in any environmental issues that are hitting me like the wind or the sun or just snow and it just kind of gets irritated i like to put that on before and then when i get home from snowboarding i like to put it on after so it really just helps protect um from any environmental damage that i would get on from the snowboarding so that's one way i like to use it i also love to use this as a lip balm it's really great when you have dry lips when your lips just need a little extra love and moisturizing and hydration this is really really great for that and it's one ounce so if you use it just for lip balm this is going to last you a long long time it's um so it's a great lip balm purchase if that's what you're looking for and then it's also really great for bug bites i love love love um well i don't love when i get bug bites but i love the feeling of putting this on after i get one because they itch so bad and i have no self control when it comes to itching so i just so this really calms that that chamomile in there calms at the lavender and there calms it the tea tree helps fight it honestly and so um you're really gonna have a powerful formulation that just calms the skin the vitamin e is really soothing hydrating so it's really repairing any um damage that that bug bite might have caused and then any irritation that drives you crazy with it and then the last thing that i like to use this for oh is why i picked it in the sun so i actually can't really tell but i got a nice little sunburn this weekend and they hurt so bad you touch it and it hurts and you touch it and it hurts and you just want to jump in a cold bath or a cold river this is your cold river it is amazing on sunburns after sun care this is my go-to i've had people who have had horrible horrible sunburns and after sun care have used this and say that it never flaked they never lost any skin so it's really really nice for after sun care and really soothing to the skin after you burn it so i really recommend this for any type of after sun care and really just soothing hydrating the skin after the sun has kind of done a little damage to it and that's really why i love this i mean the smell is amazing it has we do we have we do our own in-house herbal extracts for this and the relief salve so in our skin salve we do herbal extracts of lavender flour and calendula flour in our coconut oil olive oil base that is in here so for about six to eight hours we have a big batch it's actually really fun maybe i'll do a video on that um but we have a big batch of the coconut oil and olive oil combination that goes into this and we put lavender flowers and calendula flowers in there and we we uh grind it up because the more you grind it up the more surface area it has to extract so we grind them up when we put them in there and then for about six to eight hours on low heat we extract we slowly extract the uh herbal extracts of lavender and calendula into those oils and then we strain out the calendula and lavender that's why you don't have any flowers in here and then we add it to the formula so it's really really soothing not only does it have those essential oils that give it that smell but it just has that deep yellow color which comes from the calendula and then it just really the calendula and lavender together just really help calm calm your skin and calm you i mean you can put it under your nose and it just really maybe that's why i get relaxed when snowboarding never thought about that but yeah i mean the fastest way into your bloodstream is aromatherapy through inhalation and so aromatherapy of different things can help as well so i just discovered something new all right well thanks for listening and dm us if you have any questions reach out and we love to hear from you guys alright have a good day bye", "oez_GSCOFyc": "oh I did just do something okay it's a can of cake takes a little experiment spare man looking elegant cavitation is dead every piece of brass got a green data like that broke something in there like okay

channeling in order correct man I got oh yes got the salve on the skin there for a bruised hand so I'm curious to see how your hands going to filter and the great thing about this app is that that's weird feeling right now that's only like five minutes the massage therapist it's beneficial beneficial for both is about iterative don't know I can tell no it's actually working on it it's sending it said that tenderness it right now your cannabinoid receptors are stimulated okay they're stimulating the immune system the immune system is coming and sending sending the mantle to fix is on the attack I just enter this on my record all to yourself in my heart and when I hit like that you can't deal with under this at all it's not not like you know right in front right natural but is not there I had a lady with tan back surgeries nothing pain medication there was nothing that worked on her I'm curious a home um it just depends you know you're quiet promise yeah but it'll actually helped fix it it's not just masking it it's not just numbing end with this time and it actually end or if you take the oil in your system you know through the syringe or the they got pills you take high release and it'll help you from the inside out all right Greg thank you very much for the interview we'll get an update a week or so see how you're doing alright thanks", "-dHxOA0moCk": "YOURSELF

black owned businesses and I'm your host Michelle Smith on this episode of Minority Report I'm going to be talking about products that can help you if you are under a lot of stress if you're looking for something to help you manage your pain if you need additional support to help you just focus to relax to just you know deal with any type of medical issues or psychological issues that you may be dealing with something that is herbal something that you can get over-the-counter something that is entirely legal I'm talking about CBD cannabidiol that's the long word for it but for our purposes today we are going to be talking about CBD now I do want to give you a little bit of a warning I'm not a doctor I'm not a scientist I don't work in a lab I don't own a lab I'm not giving you recommendations I'm definitely not giving you any type of health advice I'm going to strongly suggest that you meet with your medical practitioner with your family physician or whoever it is that you're you're talking to whether it's a psychologist a counselor a therapist whoever before you make the decision to try CBD so that is my warning for you as we get into this episode of my nerdy report I definitely want to take this time and thank every single one of my followers you guys are so dope to the new people I'm so glad that you finally joined us I don't know what took you so long to get here but I'm grateful that you have now chosen to subscribe if you're new to my channel and you've never seen the episode of Minority Report baby let me tell you you've been missing a whole whole lot but that's alright because you all caught up in a whole minute but let's go ahead and just get into these CBD products first I want to say the reason why I chose to try CBD I was dealing with severe I mean I don't know what the medical term for it is I'm just gonna say very severe I will be 14 August I shame to tell you how old I am and in all of my years of womanhood I lived under this this assumption I guess that as I got older my PMS would like be less or would dissipate or hopefully just magically disappear yeah that ain't happen it just seems like the older I've gotten the worse it's gotten and it is just it's not just like cramps and bloating it's a whole lot worse I'm talking about severe depression I don't want to get out of the bed it's difficult for me to focus I can't work can't write can't blog can't review products not responding to emails completely just distancing myself from family honey I was giving my boyfriend problems every single month he was fighting he was breaking up it was it just got ugly a few months ago I even went to my doctor and I let her know like this something's gotta give I mean besides you know flow being heavy just the entire week long experience was just getting worse and even before that for a good eight or nine days before my cycle was start I mean I was just in pain like severe pain my thighs hurt my lower back hurt so I was in pain and I was just a miserable person to be around I don't want to be around myself I was getting on my last black nerve something had to give and I don't even want to get too in-depth with the type of medical and health disparities that black women specifically face in this country so I'm gonna say if you have a black doctor be grateful if you have a black woman doctor thank God because some of us we don't have access to that they just simply don't exist in our community nevertheless when I went to my doctor and I explained to her what I was see she pretty much told me he literally please don't laugh when I tell you this she literally told me to start taking advil like the week before my cycle will start every two hours and I just found that to be just so absurd and not helpful to to my situation it helped with the pain you know this bad girl is a pain reliever but all the other experiences and symptoms and things that I was having it was not addressing those so that is why I decided to go on my very own CBD journey now again like I said when I first started out with this review I'm not a physician I'm not you know a scientist I am NOT here to give you any type of medical advice and if you're like I said if you're new to my channel and you're not familiar with my review process I don't review products and I say well this is a five star product and this is a one star product this product was crappy and this product was oh so fabulous that's not what I do I either purchase these products myself or you know partner with brands and they send me products and I basically use them for an extended period of time and I share with you what my experience has been that's what this video is so if you are looking to find out what what you know more about what Campbell oil is what it's made of how it's grown how they extract it from the plant and then put it into all these different products I'm not the one for you baby I can't give you that type of information maybe as I progressed in my journey I can kind of break things down for you and give you a little bit more details but that's not what this hair video is this is strictly a product review I use the product and I'm going to tell you how well it worked for me so I have one two three four different CBD brands and they're from all across the country they offer a variety of products so that right there is a benefit in a plus so if you are not a smoker I have a product for you if you're looking for something that's topical then I have a product for you if you're looking for something that's boo something you can absorb into your system quickly then I have something for you so let's go ahead let's just get on into this thing because I do not want to keep you too long because after this trust me you're going to want to leave this video and go directly to one of these websites to get a like I said it's something over the counter something legal um that is going to be able to help you deal with you know your stress your pain management your ability to focus and you know just to have a better mood so first let's get into these products from total peace and wellness this is a company out of Pittsburgh again it is black owned is a CBD cannabis boutique they have an online store and they also have a physical location so if you're in Pittsburgh you can stop on in and you know they can give you the ins and outs of you know what the benefits of CBD are and try to help you find the right product for you I purchased two of the pre-rolls and the gummies now I love the packaging on this and most of the pre rolls from various different companies come and this type of container you literally squeeze it and it pops open and your pre roll is inside I smoked this one so pop this one open and it comes already pre roll for you now I'm gonna tell you a flat out and by younger days when I tried we when I tried to smoke we weed was just not for me I don't know what it does to other people I don't know how it enhances your mood we does nothing for me but make me sleepy I can't do I can't do we because I have entirely too many things to do to be high and sleepy that doesn't work CBD I can honestly tell you work better for me because it's not a high it is literally a chill it really did help with my move how I interacted with people it really did help as far as I even give me a little bit of energy you know I can get up in the morning I can pray I can meditate I can read my work I can work out and then you know boom I could get right into it I can start doing research for blogs I can start responding to email you know I can sit down and do a product review how many watched a little bit TV talk to my child like it really did help me focus it helped me to censor so that's what happened here with the pre-roll I really enjoyed free rolls I never wrote a blunt roll paper never not a day in my life I've always had people in my life where if I wanted to smoke weed or wanting to try weed they had already had it ready and then like I said after a puff or two and I'm sleepy like yeah that's just not for me this definitely worked better and again this is from total peace and wellness and then I also got the gummies now these are premium broad-spectrum heme extract serene orchard dietary supplement gummies okay there are 15 gummies that came in here and I am down to four I'm down to four of these again they work well you know with the pre-roll normally I would either eat a gummy like before bed or I would smoke the pre-roll you know before bed and then you know the next morning I'm up I'm refreshed I'm pain free and I'm ready I'm ready to get it poppin so again that's total peace of wellness you can definitely visit their website or their online location I will leave websites links to everything down below in the description box the next thing that I want to show you is a company called Genoa okay this company is out of Georgia and they sell CBD or hemp infuse honey or agave this is really really dope I bought a package of seven I have this one open already and I mean this is just a really nice sweet treat okay I'm trying to decrease the amount of sugar and carbs I eat I guess that's considered the ketone thing or whatever but this this fell right in alignment with you know my dietary habits I either could sit and just eat one just you know sitting enjoy the honey stick or I'm taking this and use it in my cup of tea for the morning so again you know you have alternatives you have options if a pre-roll that comes in a container like this is not for you and you're not interested in a gummy and you want something you know you know sweeter go for the honey again I bought a pack of seven this is my you know this is all I got left um but yes I really enjoyed I really enjoy these are definitely mmm definitely will be purchasing more of those so I gave you all the details on the products that I purchased from total peace and wellness I'm gonna took one of my honey sticks and stuck it in the free road container but again they are out of Pittsburgh they have online location they also have a physical location if you're in Pittsburgh traveling through Pittsburgh visiting Pittsburgh please stop by there for all of your CBD needs and then also getting information about Genoa these are the CBD infused honey sticks they also have a glob bag so let's keep going on with um some more of the CBD products now I want to talk about extreme Terps when I got this package it came in this box when I got this package in the mail I was so excited because a lot of the black-owned CBD boutiques had ran out of salt or South however you want to pronounce it have ran out of South and I was really really looking for a South and I found theirs and I just could not wait to get it this is mango breeze extreme south now if you are looking for something mediciney or tingly because I like menthol in it this is not that this is literally just the south it is made out of coconut oil beeswax shea butter in some essential oils and it really does melts easily into the skin so rub that in it really does I mean literally it really does just melt into the skin so if you're looking for a CBD topical product this is one to work well for you I like to put this on after I shower at night and then I'm laying up under my covers and it's nice and cool and I'm just smelling mango breeze child oh my god I loved love this product I was so happy to get this in the mail again like I said if you're not smelling like like a medicine cabinet or you're not walking around smelling like marijuana it really smells I don't know what mango smell like y'all don't have enough mango butter shea butter you don't know what it smells like this is basically what this here is and it does have full spectrum CBD oil in it 500 milligrams and this is a 1 ounce container then I also oil I'm also oil also ordered their caramel chews now these are blueberry flavor and I wasn't I wasn't sure wasn't certain how I was gonna like the caramel blueberry concoction I wasn't sure if that combination was something I was gonna like but I really did enjoy this I mean really I really really did this is perfect for me I'm either the caramels or the gummies so like I said I usually like to take my CBD at night before I go to bed and because I wake up and I'm on it I'm ready to go but if I've been working like non-stop sometimes I sit in this chair this is what I do all of my work review products write blog posts respond to emails I'm taking phone calls I'm live on Facebook live on Instagram I do all of that in this chair and sometimes I'm in this chair for hours like literally and if I need something midday well I have a caramel shoot it's all I need either that or again one of the gummies from total peace and wellness but let's look at these extreme Terps caramel is just so that you can get an idea of what you're gonna get in the mail just trust me if you are going to wants to run over to their website and get you some of these now there's only five in the container and again these also are milligrams of CBD in each little caramel shoe now as far as the the size or the portion of this I personally think that this is a big size this is more than enough for me I normally don't even eat this in one sitting I would eat half of this and then rewrap the other half and put it back in the container again midday I need a midday you know a little burst of energy to keep me going because I've either been up early or I plan on being up all night this works really really good for me again I'm not a physician I'm not giving any type of medical advice I'm saying you know me dealing with my PMS need to know if my cramps my anxiety just my emotions everywhere have been quarantined for what I think we're going on what 11 weeks 12 weeks 18 weeks I've lost count but I'm telling you the CBD came right on time y'all so I ordered these two but they sent me on just a few more additional items to try now this is just a sample size of their tincture and I want to go ahead and show you what this looks like and this is just an additive again this is would be considered that edible you put a few drops in your drink and your tea I just choose to put this under my tongue and it has a little dropper and just a few drops I'm saying I usually use about three three drops under my tongue again that's a midday thing and I'm good good good to go they also sent me a pre-roll so I didn't see any other pre-roll under websites I don't know this is just special for me because I surf else that's what I got it um this is the strain is called lifter high CBD hemp flour 20% CBD 3.1% terpenes made and grown in the USA again extreme Terps is out of blocks of our Maryland and they sent me this pre-roll and as soon as I'm done reviewing this product I've been a spark bag I can again like I said what you know him in my younger days we just wasn't it just was not for me CBD is working so much better than anything else I've tried chamomile tea you know trying to manage my what I'm eating a decreased caffeine cut out sugar you know basically depriving myself of all these of all the things that I like but all the things that I would use I was using you know as clutches and crutches and you know I mean just to try to maintain through the day CBD has given me the shell that I need I'm super high like I'm ready to go like all the time on engaging on social media I'm doing a million things but this has definitely helped me manage my stress manage my pain and I'm just excited and I hope you feel my energy now the last product that I want to talk about in homes organics again if you are new to my platform let me tell you I interview entrepreneurs I also review products like I'm doing now so in that I'm not just on YouTube I have my very own website where you can find muscle different blog posts multiple resources for other black-owned businesses so if you are looking for a black-owned firearm company because we in a season right now where we definitely need to protect ourselves I have a list of those holidays are coming up so Father's Day Mother's Day graduation I have all kinds of gift ideas back to school if the kids ever go back to school I have a list of you know of products where you can find resources for that swimming I mean the pools are starting to open back up people starting to head out to the beaches it's almost time for vacation you know travel bans is being lifted we get ready in like we get ready make some major rules so you probably need a new swimsuit you can go to my website and find resources for that homes were against I've written two different blog posts about this company because I was just amazed about the founder Corey Hong I'm just amazed about you know what he's doing with his organization because not only does he have CD products he also has a scene the Academy so I always always advocate for entrepreneurship within the black community so if CVD is something that you're interested in you know trying not just for personal use but also for monetary gain he has an entire Academy where he will teach you the business of CVD so you definitely want to go and check out or Holmes organics now from them I purchased the soft gels there's thirty soft gels in here for a total of three hundred milligrams it is ten milligrams per soft gel so it's not a lot of CVD so I found myself taking my two but day for those you know for those days where I was just really just like I just had enough you know ten o'clock eleven o'clock I'm ready to completely just shut down this is what I kept before billion I might you know a pre-roll in any one of these pre-rolls I'll just smoke this all in one sitting like literally I might take like three or four foot three or four puffs three probably at the most two soft gels and I'm going to hell to be okay like I said in the middle of the day I'm using extra energy or first thing in the morning I will have some tea with my you know yeah CBD honey CBD infused honey midday I'm gonna have like a gummy or caramel chew this is the cream okay so you got a saw but if you know shea butter or beeswax of wax it's a little bit too heavy for you then I'm gonna highly suggest you try the Holmes organics unscented see BB cream okay it works just like a just like a lotion and even though it says it's unscented it does have a scent to it I just can't name it I can't and I'm pretty good with since it's not anything heavy it's not anything overbearing it's not going to you know even if you were you know if you are going back to work or you're an essential worker and you know you're all frightened carpal tunnel knees you know wherever you're having shooting wherever you're having you can rub this in and you're not gonna smell and you know you're not going to smell like your coworker so go smoke weed on their lunch breaks okay this ain't that okay this is safe it's legal and I enjoy using it definitely this I throw in my purse okay so that's CVD or Nago now the best part about all of these products is one of them is participating in the ultimate black glove gift guide the ultimate black glove gift guide black hole business coupon book is another resource that I created just for you anyone who's interested in

that you found this video informative if you've been wondering about CBD you're not you know not quite sure what to do again I'm gonna highly recommend that you talk to you know your physician talk to your personal doctor talk to your therapist talk to your counselor CBD is legal you do not have to worry about you know getting pulled over I mean in the climate that we're living in right now we know that we're seeing a protest we're seeing marches we are definitely saying enough is enough we're talking about resisting you don't necessarily want to put yourself in a position where you're going out in the streets or you got somebody coming to your house or you're going out to get the hook-up to put yourself in a situation that could be dangerous to manage pain manage stress manage your mood you don't want to you know I'm going to advise if I'm going to give any advice in this video it would be to find a legal alternative and if CVD is not strong enough for you again talk to your doctor I don't want to see anyone in any type of pain or distress if your doctor is not helping you manage your pain not helping you manage your anxiety not help you manage your depression find another physician playing a simple but if you want to try something over-the-counter you want to try a bunch of different products you want to try a soft shell you want to try an edible if you want to try a pre-roll you want to try honey there are so many different options out there available for you and if this ain't even enough again go back to my website www.ihaveaspergers.webs.com and below and please do not forget to give this video a great big thumbs up if you've never been to my channel before go ahead and hit the subscribe button what did you wait for I'm gonna need you to come back so we can bust it up again I love y'all I love y'all so much thank you for all of your support thank you for watching this video and I will check you out next [Music]", "Knfl49kyAOQ": "hi it's Matt at Ruth's house studios and welcome to counter basics today we're gonna learn how to make cannabis infused a body lotion for moisturizing your skin and also for pain relief also very happy to announce that we have a new scripted comedy series coming up called higher beings please stick around to the end of the video and learn how you can support that project on IndieGoGo now let's get started here's what you need to make cannabis infused body lotion you need a quarter cup of cannabis infused cocoa butter 1/4 cup of shea butter 1/4 cup of coconut oil 1/4 cup of light oils such as light olive oil and you also need 10 to 20 drops of essential oils for flavoring such as lemon oil mint tea tree oil eucalyptus you can also use some infused coconut oil and place of the cocoa butter in this recipe and then you could also use oil that's been infused with the herbal infuser and you can save $30 on the air blown fuse with a code ruffhouse at herbal infuser calm now let's talk a little about how you can infuse the actual cocoa butter now we've done this recipe a couple of times recently so but I'm gonna go over it real briefly again but basically you grind your cannabis and in this case you don't actually have to decarbonize effects it's time for the other cannabinoids that are in the cannabis and you do not have to actually activate this and you can do some research to find which level of activation you might need to relieve the certain type of pain that you have too but for this case you don't actually have to decarboxylate or activate your cannabis and then you're going to infuse the oil for about one to two hours and when you're done the cocoa butter is going to be a lot darker and if you let it harden it'll harden back up and it melts very easily on your skin temperatures enough to melt it and you can see there it's it's very slick oil and it's I got a lot of moisturizing value for your skin so that's where we're going to be using for a basis for our oil so whether that's melted or not if you just made it and it still melted you you don't really need to melt it anymore but we're gonna go ahead and put that in a heat safe dish that you can put into a double boiler you could use like a canning jar there and we're not gonna actually boil the water we're just barely keeping it just under the it's gonna board just with a little bubble start to go and like I said you could also use cannabis infused coconut oil if you would rather use that instead of infusing the cocoa butter so it's up to you which one of those you infuse or you could infuse both if you want a really really strong but it being so this is not something edible it probably is a waste to try to make it too strong because you're not really going for the THC and you might also use a strong CBD strain or another kind of strain for this depending on your needs for this kind of lotion ok we're also going to take the shea butter and we're taking the other light oil that we're using in this case we're using olive oil a light olive oil and we're combining all of the other ingredients except for the essential oils into our double boiler or into our heat proof dish inside of a hot water bath until it's all melted and once it's all melted and combined you can take that and switch it into a mixing bowl it's gonna be large enough to use a hand and executed and then at that point you can also as the oil is cooling and cooled off a little bit you can add in your essential oils and in this case it's up to you if you add any oils because you could just leave it as it is and it'll have a slightly chocolaty smell because of the cocoa butter but this part is definitely up to your preferences and also for what you use you're using it for if you're using it as an everyday moisturizer you probably don't want to make it very strong smelling or it's gonna overpower your perfume or cologne or whatever or just be overpowering in general but if you're making it for medicinal purposes you might use a lot of mint or eucalyptus or the things that would give it that minty or that medicinal feel and now you're going to put it in the refrigerator for just a few minutes until the bowl gets cold or whatever and you start to see that it's just beginning to thicken a little bit so just when the the viscosity starts to thicken some and that's when you're gonna do this step here and that is to take your hand mixer on high and just keep mixing and mixing as you're whipping in air it's gonna turn lighter and lighter and you do that for three or four minutes until it quits turning lighter and by that time it'll be finished and then you put it back in the refrigerator to harden and then at that point you could also pour it into a containers because it'd be a lot easier while it's still a liquid and then after it hardens and sets in refrigerator you bring it out of the refrigerator at at room temperature it becomes a very soft subtle lotion that you can rub into your skin very easily it really has no real expiration date as long as you keep it sealed keep it out of the light and it's great for pain relief as well it helped me with my psoriasis on the bottom of my foot with a moisture so check that out also check out higher beings this is a new project I'm really excited about and if you're really interested you could help us support that by checking out Andy

made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music]", "YsncNfHyKBg": "all right you guys well I am Christine Howerton I'm Claire boys and we are two of the co-hosts of the podcast selfie which is all about self-care and we are about to do something we've been wanting to do for a long time for a long time um and we're going to it you know sacrifice and do this very difficult task of trying to earn a million different products no children are home while you watch that well okay first of all let's dispel any myths about CVD yes um you can CVD does not necessarily have THC in it correct so we're going to be doing two videos for you the video that you are watching will be all CVD products with zero THC correct meaning no high they are legal yes in every state and they can be given to they can be they can be given we have a product for pets and I mean taco talked a bit about why you use CBD because I know you're an avid I use I am too or everything um th the and non THC right for the non THC I have a house full of athletes who are getting hurt all the time and so we use a lot of bombs a lot of topical bombs a lot of lotions with CBD in it and then also almost all of my kids everyday ingest CBD all but one I just um helps with sleep helps with just like overall vitality yep and you know some of us struggle with attention issues and so on that helps a lot to you yes and so even my youngest son he loves it he has a taste for it like he really likes the taste of it and I don't have to bother him about it anymore he does in our zone yeah and I have been using CBD for about three months I have anxiety and insomnia I find it to be incredibly helpful now I'm like Claire and like I said we're going to do a second video on CVD products that also contain THC which is the active kind of psychoactive ingredient yes I'm like clear I don't like - yeah and some people with anxiety just don't do well with it it makes me Rossetti worse right actually does increase anxiety and my insomnia so we are gonna do a separate video on THC but this video is for those of you interested in CBD without any of us psychoactive stuff and we're going to show we the reason we did this as a video as opposed to just as the podcast is that we really wanted to be able to show all of the different there's so much out there chance for oh my child I mean like being a consumer going to the store you've no idea where to start right and so hopefully after we finish this video you'll have a little bit better idea of like some brands that you can trust and that we've tried and that laughter just thought or whatever okay well let's start we're gonna start with skincare yes and then we're going to move up into we're gonna talk about oils we're going to talk about so we're going to talk about topicals and then we're going to talk about ingestible where you're taking it you know kind of as a supplement so least we found them okay you talked about this one I'll talk about this one okay so CBD body butter a big fan actually I'm gonna show you any kind of like lotion or topical with CBD in it I really love I'm super vascular yeah and my skin is either always inflamed itchy I'm having some kind of allergy so I use a product with CBD and all my lotions and dips really helps me this has a ton of CBD this is 400 milligrams receptor is a really quality CBD company a lot of any reviews is of you know that is like a really good amount you'll find varying strengths of CBD in different products they should be putting it right on the front and that is a very generous amount of CBD in there look how much is in here it like you'd have to yeah it would take me a long time to use this it's really really really really thick mm-hmm emollient and going into like the winter months we're already so dry yet and cracking I like this so that's 400 milligrams that's a pretty serious yeah right here's another one this is from koi-koi as a is a CVD product line that I really like we're gonna talk about one of their oils in a minute they have CBD and THC products but this one this healing balm is only 45 milligrams so this one's a little lighter but this is a really sick ball yes so if you have like I do eczema or any of their other types of issues this is a really amoliant balm yeah that and I actually use this one a lot and the smell it's like a kind of them really ball smell it's like the a really faint faint like tiger balm almost yes I really like this too great for elbows alright let's talk about base products excuse my pan this is my favorite okay you love that one so you talk about that one okay so a few months ago we interviewed Bridget and Lee from King harvest and they are a local company to us and they have been doing their tint chores and they had also been doing their flower and had been asked to do a skincare line yeah and they created an incredible CBD oil I use this every single day I'm obsessed with it I use it in my shampoo and my conditioner as well I do get really loyal to products you do until until I find something else to ever get up it's like I will use this forever until I don't yeah but how to hold it in it has avocado oil in it and I actually am prone to breaking out yeah and I don't have that experience at all and I use this after I'm micro needled ooh so right after it is micro needling I had it like I can't even believe how much faster I recovered using this that time I believe it so I love that there's also another product that's similar well okay this one is Sol Sol stands for strains of life they again are very well rounded CBD branding a lot of different products but this one is collagen retinol revitalizing creams so if you are a retinol fan like right now I did not know that I've got CBD and retinol in one contact so this is more of like your nighttime serum but they also have a really nice toner I like that because that's I'd get into I get confused a little bit and I went to school I'm an esthetician guys and I still get confused when do you do the retinol versus the CBD because it's like you took the baby D first and then right this is really nice so that you dip you don't you just use one product yeah yeah so that's that's also strengths of life that's a toner good this smells incredible this smells like you're at a day spa and someone has got you like uncover water okay speaking of smelling incredible this is my very favorite CBD CBD bath bombs that is like the gift this year I feel like is the gift in fact I just want to give this to everyone I have its plant-based this one's 50 milligrams oh um that's a good back yeah right that's a nice bath this is from a brand called life elements it smells really good they're so cute I'd spectrum have to write CDs yeah super cute and like in the front I think there's like a little bit of a flower avenger' yeah so that's a nice one and then some other fun smelling products I like these is it kind of reminds of like you know the essential oil companies they have like the ruler yep balls for the different things so these have a little bit of CBD in them but even if they didn't I just really liked them this one's called go with the flow and it's just a roll-on this one is supposed to be for when you have your period so okay you don't hope we can get it just I don't know it smells like a spa I like that one this one is a little bit more intense and to get a grip well is that the blue one yes yes this one has blue tansy in it oh that's really just for the face it is yeah it's really good for your skin when I put it on you can actually kind of like see it's a little bit dark and this company is called plant juice so all of their stuff has like a little bit of CBD in it and then all of their stuff they have a bunch of different formulations you can get as a rollerball or as a spray that I like that so I love this one this one's called chill out and you know I just spray this on myself all day long I've already tried this on me twice today so much it's not like a day spa okay I think that's all on our like topical topical okay so now we're going to talk about in yes what's the word well t-shirt think there's been a lot of discussion about how we say this word t-shirt is how do you say it I always wanted Tincher Tincher I don't know and I say tank shirt I was wrong yeah I don't know or oil drops oil drops okay so oil is the preferred carrier method yeah what CBD I don't actually know the science behind that do you why is it always it might be because it's the easiest absorbed well also it's it's yeah because then it goes through your saliva instead of going through your stomach and bloods and then also I think just getting absorbed into the skin - yeah I don't know we don't know this - we're just gonna talk about all these different ones okay so we have another interested in this one's so coy is a really really good brand they are well known this is one of their oils or tinctures so the way that you use a tincture is that you would fill the dropper up now your measurements on CBD that's a personal thing and you're gonna have to try different things so you're measuring not only how many milligrams are in a serving but then how much you're serving your such time if that makes sense so koi has a lot of different milligram like increments but this one's a thousand which is pretty generous I think there's another one that was 500 mm-hmm that is that's a probably well actually let's look at all the ones we have because I'm actually kind of curious like what's what the top of the I think you're right don't say it quite as clearly I feel like when you're doing these are 500 so is the Florida this one's a thousand I feel like when they don't say how much is in there it's not as good of a brandy yeah like it's almost like not I'm just totally afraid but you know when you go to the store like Ross or Marshalls and there's an essential oils in that area they're not really essential oils totally so I feel like it's in that realm okay so the - of all the textures we have the two that are a thousand milligrams our feels which you've talked about we talked about before and I like and coy so I'm going to do a tiny little tested this one what is it labor orange yeah this one's flavored so you can get CBD oil flavored or not flavored I personally think CBD oil tastes kind of nasty yeah it tastes like marijuana smells if anyone remembers me in college and accidentally drinking like the bong water or like the like rogue string I think you know I'm talking about yes I would imagine Oh at least one time no I actually didn't um but okay so I'm gonna try this one for us okay oh but was it good you know what having a little flavor makes a huge tip I think so because that's good that's actually I was there I saw it was like strawberry milkshake to that they have boys super smart again these do not have THC in them no one's getting high they're not being marketed to children this is really good yeah he's kind like a creamsicle it does feels is also a really nice rant and one thing I like about feels if you're interested in trying CBD is they they have this thing that's called a flight where you can order three different strengths of CBD so smart and try it all at once now I just tested that I taste tested it with a tiny little drop but I would recommend if you're trying CBD I would recommend starting with 500 milligrams so again with this one then you'd fill it to halfway up yes I get 500 and some of them have I don't know if the coin did that some of them have like markers on them so that you can you can kind of [ __ ] I'll show you one that has the markers on it I think I think this one does yeah for you yes you can see how much it's not like a baby medicine dropper early so let me talk about this company - I really like foria products a lot this is their taunt they call it a tonic but it's 500 milligrams and again it's you know you just want to make sure that it's broad-spectrum TV that it's tested that you know exact test you guys really important the testings really important there's a lot of brands where like feels their stuff comes with a QR code and so you can look at that exact batch and the testing that was done on that exact bag and I think states state regulation is different yes but a lot of companies especially companies that I've used that I trust on our website you can go to their web and they'll be fully transparent with all their tested everything yeah and they'll list the toxicity amount for every yes so making sure that they're being transparent that's kind of will give you the go-ahead to try the product I think for you personally is a nice product starter pod for beginners it's a very light oil you can see um it doesn't have as much of the taste in it water in the soil I don't know you know the MCT om CT oil which hey so clear what it feels dosa which that's supposed to have some synergistic like that's really light don't you think that much not as much and it kind of would be something I would take at night yeah that's a good night time is taste I feel like that's what the thing but okay this isn't oily this is actually not for humans this is for pets it's called hemp pets CB do old eyes prude incredible things about people giving their animal something you dropped oh yeah I don't know I'm not one of those people BAM okay so these two products are from a company called CBD essence and they also have flavored mouth drops so they have these this one's not but they have a cinnamon flavor okay it's very you know again very similar sublingual this is 600 milligrams 600 milligrams so that's a nice in-between but this one is interesting it's it's a lot darker than the other and you're going to see different like variation yes and it depends on where the CBD is derived from to have versus cannabis flower so you're gonna be variations in the color too this one has a little bit of it's like a sweet flavor a minute to see that's that's smart they give yes sometimes and again like it depends on the batching home in the batches but sometimes you can get a very very earthy that's pretty enough though I will say it has this little sweetness to it but it definitely tastes like weed it sure does but it is sweet it is is it a wheatgrass shot it really does make a wheatgrass shot okay I like this this company it's called movement lesson because they have different yes coach um they have different formulations for different things wrest control release I'd also like their packaging Oh ID yeah it's super cute and so um there's is CBD with with an essential oils 500 milligram tinctures but it has essential oils that are supposed to partner for whatever it is the issue that you're dealing with so I feel like a lot of people when they first start maybe start with these with the essential oil mix I think so too a girlfriend of ours that was kind of how she chipped her doing the water turn on the water with these oh and this one's nice because the the dropper also has the like you know then measuring now I'm just putting little drops in my mouth because I don't want to I'm not doing full squeezing huh these have a carrier oil of mcg also that's nice there's like lavender I don't know that it's lavender but tastes a little spa you slap the QR codes - yeah so I would sure not even if those are the brand yeah nice and feels just that one as well this one is movement lesson rest okay it Nance it's hard to beat that koi I feels really I I'm gonna say taste wise the coins women it really does make up one word it I know you do I have to say CBD oil does not taste the best no I think it's smart to have like some kind of I do know some people who like really love it like crave it I did too but I also know people who can't tolerate the oil at all so we're gonna talk about other ways to ingest yes CBD one which is super obvious as soft gels this is these from CBD CB distillery which is a really really good brand this is only thirty milligrams so it's not a ton to me this is the best way to give to children absolutely um so you know it's just a nice little flavor yeah and you can get these in different strengths so I think that's a good way to take CBD now I have to say another way and this is from the same company CB distillery is gonna I like those they're real they're really good this particular one is for night time and so it has a little bit of melatonin in it but they also have same brand CB distillery does them without the melatonin to me this is a really nice thing to take them I mean you'd want to keep them away from your kids because they're good or not yeah well take a little rest to me I know right but though this tastes those tastes really good now try two other ones they kind of taste just like like grass with sugar on top yes those are actually actually tasty of gummies you would not know and here's another option of this this is Green Grove and this what they've done is they've packaged it in a drink but it has caffeine in it too so it's kind of like an energy drink with CBD so this has 75 milligrams of caffeine and twelve point five milligrams of CBD and you just add it to water very smart yeah like a little drink and then there are you know similar to marijuana there are ways that you can smoke CBD which I have to be honest with you I can't quite wrap my mind around that's different I know it's weird to consider that you would smoke marijuana without the psycho annoyed you're all like the work of like hiding it one [ __ ] aligner because who the Frick has a lighter these days and then the smells it's not I'm smell right oh well let me I mean let me let you smell this so this is from island but island premiums who also has the cutest packaging ever oh my gosh seriously super cute packaging and they have a number of different products but this is Island flower CBD it's their strain is called jellyfish okay it has 0.15 percent of THC so really really low yes but take a look at this it's just full-on bud just so you know you're gonna roll that like you would roll a joint but there is no THC in it I just don't I don't know I with you yeah I mean maybe there is some kind of body relaxation I won't say this I will say this if were a person who was addicted to just smoking and in fact let me show you this next product so this is also from Island premiums visit their a pre-roll these are basically CBD cigarettes this to me is brilliant for someone I mean like I have some family members who are just completely addicted to cigarettes yeah and I've tried to get them to switch over to vape and shirts we're finding or not that much look exactly like a cigarette they look exactly like a circuit it's just CBD there's no so if you have that physical habit AHA I know where it's like you yeah ritual there is no nicotine in this yeah so anyway and this is that same strain it's called jellyfish so it's very very low yeah legal level of THC I believe so yeah there's those I can think of a couple people that would love that for Christmas yeah I mean I have not tried these because I'm an asthmatic so I don't do right and also confuses me a little bit are there a filter on there yeah look interesting really it really is just like a cigarette so you filter - they're very cool and then another option is I can get CBD innovate pack yes so this is the company called foria they are one that I really like they have this like nice light tank sure but this is an option to wear this again and I know everyone's kind of like what the heck with vape pens but this does not have nicotine and don't have THC this is completely legal and it is just simply CBD oil and I think this is one of the first ones you tried it's okay yeah it's only one I've ever tried so and you can see it's just like a thick little viscous oil in there and then I don't know should I try it I guess we go to vape on camera you're like a teenager right now but again wit there's no THC in this no Chico it's essentially an essential oil it's really it is yeah I mean so you know woody when you draw it in you just kind of puff and it's the fastest way for you to get yeah any kind of relief yeah and it tastes kind of like have you tried this one it tastes a little bit like vanilla it's really pleasurable mm-hmm a kind of allspice yes yeah yeah I would definitely say if you have a loved one who is it to vaping or sequence this would be very nice because I really didn't off yeah situation I really do think so much about smoking is part of the ritual I you know like the whole whole deal and so I just want to point out - I mean Clara I have been adjusted quite a bit of CBD yes there is you know you don't feel anything no I mean if it's if CBD is working you don't feel anything and we'll make jokes about people being relaxed or taking naps but really you feel nothing no you shouldn't feel anything you shouldn't - no where's almost disappointing if this is not what you were hoping for right I mean I had a friend who tried something with me and then like three minutes later though I don't feel anything I'm like you don't feel anything and the idea is over time it builds up in your body and then that's right you're having the healing from you know the inside out yeah so yeah a number of different products all of them all of the ones that we've spoken about today are very reputable company yes parent with their testing again I can't stress that enough making sure that they're testing their products yep so we will link all of those up on South via podcast calm we are constantly talking about CBD products unselfie which is the podcast I feel like it comes up every day really tell you organically - so if you've never seen any podcast you can find us an apple pod caucus and then we welcome you to watch our next video which is going to be delving into all of the THC included my show", "miDPSw2gdqc": "so here is our cvd oilskin sab this is a lovely mixture of 100 milligrams of CBD as well as extracts that we do in-house of lavender and collection of flowers it's also in this formula we have some tea tree essential oil helichrysum essential oil chamomile essential oil and lavender so that mixture along with the extracts it's really soothing for the skin so this is really a product that's gonna be great for dry skin dry lips cold sores wrinkles any type of the east buildup anywhere on your body any type of skin irritations as well as bug bites sunburns and really great for under-eye puffiness so feel free for you to try a sample at the front desk", "FymCTaaSMDY": "my name is Willie Christie and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "YnpyI03qRZw": "hey guys so this is kind of like a this is a kind of a fun blog for me to do this week and it kind of happened by accident so about three or so weeks ago you might remember that I went to this crazy crazy spa convention with my friend Hillary who is the the informal skin Carmo CEO and we it was at the Javits Center in New York which is this massive like blocks long Convention Center and so this spa convention had you know a slew of spa focused brands like so nage which is one of my favorite what this is one of my favorite masks ever is antioxidant mass is incredible so so not so nage is an la-based Spa skincare brand they operate in the spa Channel and they have their own their own spa where they perform medical grade facials and things like that and so I ran into the founder the CEO of so nage at the convention and got a facial and you know I posted that on my IG and it was amazing so there were and there was also the foreo team was there and you know how much I love that foreo UFO mask matter of fact I think I need to do that this afternoon it's been a bit of men like a week um so there were brands there that I knew and brands that I kind of collab with and like loved and then there were brands that I'd never heard of before there was there a slew of like fake French spa brands like these brands like with products and services and stuff that sound French like because these crazy French names and they have nothing to do with brands so they're so there were like two ends of the spectrum right like really serious like spa brands at this spa convention they're never kind of these fake ones and then somehow like and then there were all these high-tech things like these LED facials like we're going on and people are laying down with the LED like bright deep red Warren G red LED lights you know similar to the dr. gross device so there was that going on but then there were like interspersed throughout this huge like it was an arena was like an underground chamber I don't it was nuts there are several maybe a dozen or so CBD and half of brands and I don't necessarily see how they really fit into the spa channel but this this this whole thing honestly it wasn't limited to spa right like you could present whatever if you have products you present and people who are looking for that in theirs I guess in their in their spas would be down for you know trying out your products and maybe presenting your products in in their businesses but um so the funny thing about a lot of these CBD brands is they're like they're kind of like wacky sometimes like what if that packaging like who came up with that packaging who designed that packaging like I'm a packaging copywriter I pay attention to packaging I pay attention to product names and how you know how things look do they look hokey do they look like you know they were made in someone's kitchen which is all well and good but that's like a different thing to me DIY skincare um or do they look like legit brands like thought like well-thought-out brands and I guess I'm like everybody if a if a package is is beautiful I tend to believe that what's inside is is is good for me it is delicious this stuff is delicious um that it's reliable you know packaging is everything like I just I love the drunk elephant package design I think it's incredible that's part of it right in you know sometimes packaging is more medicinal looking or pharmaceutical like the skin suitable so it's pretty straightforward and undesigned looking you know so it's got a little bit of the platinum going on but that's about it this is an excellent sunscreen by the way both of these both of these are but so the thing with the CBD market is is it's new and all these CBD brands are new and they're coming to market and they're not necessarily sophisticated I guess that's really what I'm getting at is the brand sophisticated does it feel like like it's solid and trustworthy or does it feel kind of hokey and you know like Wild West and so I was wandering around I spotted Hillary and I came across this one brand called Hempfield botanicals and within their their presentation in their in their area in their designated area I met the founder of him co-founder of Hempfield botanical her name is Heather she and her husband I think his name is nathan founded this brand in pennsylvania in and around Lancaster and so it's a CBD brand and they make several categories of products so they have topical treatments like their staff their CBD salve which which helps to alleviate pain so the the CBD in here is isolated and focused on pain relief and I'm going to talk about that in a second this product actually smells quite amazing and I'm gonna tell you how I used it which is a little wacky they have tinctures tinctures are ingestible drops that you either drop under your tonic tongue if they're an oil tank sure if they're a water-based tincture you can mix them with a beverage you can mix them with a protein shake you can drip them in your tea the the oral tinctures that Hempfield offers are all oil-based so you you drip these under your tongue and kind of hold them there for a bit and and and the CBD and the other components in the formula get infused into your into your system sorry that way and they also they also have a couple of skincare facial skin care treatments and one of these in particular so this one's called fortify and this one's called soothe and I am like completely infatuated with this product so you know usually when I'm testing a product like if I'm testing something in my nightly regimen what I want to do is use it sometimes every other night or so right so that I can see if there's a difference in the morning and how my skin reacts so I had been doing that since I got a bottle of this and I have come to realize that I love using it like I love the whole experience of this product it's it's I don't even know how to explain it like it smells amazing it's a blend so the soothe the soothe oral CBD oil is a blend of seven ingredients of five of which or is it four of which are non fragrant plant oils it just smells incredible non fragrant plant oils that we all know and love right now I have on my fingers and I'm not going to be able to scroll so it's got baroja seed oil it's got sunflower oil it's got hemp seed oil aka cannabis sativa seed oil and it's got chamomile and you know we know that chamomile is super soothing so those oils make it not unlike the the topical skincare oils that facial oils that I have reviewed recently though the one from Kiehl's I think it's called cannabis sativa seed concentrate the one from the one from Peter Thomas raw is baby here right so these are these are these are oils that are that that have cannabis sativa seed in the in the blend and so cannabis sativa seed helps to soothe skin but the difference between these the Kiehl's version the first aid beauty version is that this also contains something called crystalline cannabidiol so that's the that's the the CBD that's giving it it's kind of kind of it's kind of pushing it taking it up a notch from just straightforward facial oils and so what I have found on the day after the day after I use this is my skin is noticeably more calm I you know very often I have like parts of my face that experience irritation right up here and my forehead very commonly shows irritation so the the days that I the mornings after I use this product hands down it's quite obvious to me because I'm so in tune with how my skin looks and how my skin acts I have noticed that this product actually does soothe komm irritation and that's what it's intended to do so Hempfield claims that it calms a sensitive skin that it's an anti-inflammatory and that it's ideal for acne prone skin which is something that heals claims on their cannabis sativa seed concentrate so that but the thing about this so I only like in immersing myself in literature and research matter-of-fact Heather had given me a couple of pamphlets on CBD and on the products to take with me and I was like enthralled with them like who gets into educational pamphlets the people who write them so I I have been researching like what is it about these products that makes them kind of magical right or gives them a distinctiveness like when we talk about when we talk about these the oral tinctures you know this one's called headies and this one is called tunnel vision so this one is intended to help you focus obviously and heddes is to help alleviate headaches there's one called Forty Winks which helps you sleep so but what makes each of them different if they're using CBD and so what makes them different is something called terpenes and terpenoids of the in in this case of the cannabis plant there are apparently more than 100 isolates or terpenes in the cannabis plant and each of those has a distinct effect a specific benefit in the body so the terpenes in the tunnel vision have apparently the effect of helping you to focus and concentrate your mind and so I've been actually using this and I don't know do I notice well I noticed that I'm not like not concentrating but so but the the ones that I mean that's kind of like a big like a big benefit right are you more concentrate or less able to concentrate like if you can't concentrate something's going on anyway like you maybe have a lack of sleep so the but the Forty Winks is very obvious does it help you sleep better yes in fact it does and the I have a CBD supplement in pill form that I've been using kind of experimentally like let's see if this actually does work and you know you pop one of those at 15 milligrams 15 20 milligrams and depending on the concentration in your oil you you have to kind of figure out what's what's the right dosage so 15 15 to 20 milligrams dosage and obviously in a supplement form that's already taken care of and I'm like out like I'm in a coma I wake up in the morning and like Orpheus is blinking like what just happened um so if you have a concern for sleeping you know you have insomnia or you know anxiety keeps you up you really need to consider a form of CBD to help you to help you sleep it really does work in terms of anxiety if I'm having a particularly stressful day I have actually you know taken a little bit of the not the head ease but one of the one of the CBD concentrates that is just straight on terpene list I guess and it does really calm me down it's really incredible so I'm like excited to explore all of this stuff and I encourage you to do the same I have some links in the new blog companion to this video that can help help you with that research but my own personal research shows me that it's not BS in the least bit and if companies like Hempfield botanicals keep doing what they're doing and making like legit claims you know that are substantiated there are two form on on the Hempfield botanicals team so if the brand knows what it's doing and it knows how to how to communicate how to message what CBD does and what the individual within terpenes and the formulas are able to achieve then you know it look the products are all natural so like it's natural medicine and you know this this whole wave of you know THC and marijuana like medical marijuana that's legit like if you know anybody who experiences severe pain the medical marijuana takes care of that right it really does alleviate that and it's certainly more beneficial or less harmful than chemical substances like you know opioids so you know I should have started this out but it doesn't matter when I communicate this this is also in the blog so you know that we need to train our minds and how you do that is through education by reading and and you know being curious to understand that there's a difference between THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis and CBD which is non so like SoCo psychoactive so when I say psychoactive I'm talking about how marijuana or THC gets you high and so that particular component of the cannabis or hemp plant interacts with with receptors in your in your body in your brain I think it's called the cb1 receptor and that's what gets you high the THC interacts with the cb1 receptor somehow stimulates the cb1 receptor and that's not what CBD does cannabidiol is the other component of the cannabis plant right so you have THC and CBD and CBD doesn't react that way it doesn't interact with the body's um I think it's the endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid system so the body has this this system that's actually set up to interact believe it or not with cannabis of all crazy things like it sounds nuts but if you like dig deep and you like research it you like discover that it's like it's legit and that's why CBD and why components of the cannabis plant that include THC are able to alleviate anxiety and pain and able to help you sleep so it's this body's system and the receptors in the system that are interacting with the components of CBD to achieve those benefits in the body and it's all natural so that brings me to the one last product I want to talk about that Hempfield botanicals offers so we have the oral oils we have the the facial the facial oils that are topical skin care amazing product and then we have topical skincare that has medicinal benefits to it so like two weeks ago I would say and you might have noticed it like in like I noticed it in some of my videos I was like there's that that crazy redness on my wrist I started to realize that I was getting like a getting eczema like just really itchy dry skin irritated patchy like exactly what you think on my elbows and on my wrist and so I like I'm like what is going on like what is this I'd never had eczema before and it's like huh and I looked it up and I liked it like Google Images and sure it was like okay that's exactly what I have it looks exactly like that it feels it's a little bit edgy it's the same thing it's not like I don't have a like some crazy ass disease although I guess eczema is a disease right and so I went online and I ordered um I don't remember what the name of the product was but I ordered an XML lotion from Amazon and I knew even though was two-day shipping that I wasn't gonna get it for three days because it had the packages in my building it processed and everything takes a while unless you have an emergency and it wasn't an emergency so in the meantime like this particular area of redness and itchiness is like interacting with my watch band which was a nightmare because all day long I would feel it like oh god there it is and it was just a little a little crazy and disconcerting and I thought God what do I even have like in the interim to treat this while the lotion is coming and I remembered that that Hempfield had had given me this incredible salve like this mysterious salve which is loaded up with CBD and essential oils and let's see if I have it here somewhere so there's spearmint in here which means that it smells actually quite magnificent and so it's a it's a it's for pain it's for pain and inflammation right and so I thought to myself well at least it'll probably make the itching go away but truthfully I started applying this and the eczema like by the time that cream came three days later the eczema was barely noticeable and it was just a little bit of a red patch so even though that's kind of not what this product is formulated to do this is what I talked about this is what I mean when I talk about how like cmed has like all these incredible benefits that we are only barely just now understanding so this I'm like I'm not almost like get some sort of ache so every once in a while when I'm lifting weights I get a sprain in my arm and so I haven't been able to test this yet as a pain reliever but as an XML reliever and an itch reliever yeah this is this is it this ain't bad so anyway that's it guys just just do some exploring know that this is this is a it's a nascent market it's you know it's it's kind of cool it feels a little bit like the Wild West but you know when you really look at it and you look at you know legit brands like Hempfield botanicals there's their substance here it's it's real and it's kind of exciting and I'm this is like to me I'm gonna look back on this year 2019 was the year that CBD came into my life so anyway that's all have a good one be sure to check out my youtube page and subscribe please to my youtube channel and check out the blog at skin karma com where all of this diatribe is put into words and that's it have a good one you guys later", "L0UpRHIowog": "[Music] hi welcome to Diamond delight edibles my name is Liz if this is the first time you're joining and if you're a regular subscriber thank you so much and welcome back I really appreciate your support it does mean the world to me and it's growing and growing I'm so excited I like Wow but anyway so today I'm going to show you two how to do a topical for pain relief using an infused coconut oil and some hocus pocus and to know some essential oils and that put together and this stuff works amazing I use it all the time now I absolutely love it I have a rare genetic disorder called ehlers-danlos syndrome and it's a connective tissue disorder which my body doesn't produce collagen so as my tendons and ligaments stretch out they don't go back so all of my joints are very very loose and although my muscles are constantly sore because they're constantly fighting to hold my joints in place so yeah it's a whole thing but anyway so I've used this and it has been great for inflammation my shoulders and everything so I really wanted to show you how to do it and I hope you do get the sigh of relief from it as well so um I don't think I have anything else to go there I'm gonna get into the as I normally do I'm gonna get into the ingredients and then the directions on how to do it alright well thank you for joining me so these are bombs that I made up earlier so this one is like a bomb like a waxy bomb and this one when we whip it chill it and whip it and multiply it it ends up a lighter or a lighter feel and a lighter texture so it all depends on your preference on what you what you like on your skin I tend to use both so what you're going to need for this is two tablespoons of your infused coconut oil 2 ounces of cocoa butter and you want it to be unrep yer 100% pure unrefined cocoa butter so you don't want anything done to it you want to pure unrefined same thing with the shea butter it's going to be 1 ounce of shea butter and you're use all-natural raw unrefined two tablespoons of all natural beeswax pellets and then we're going to get into our essential oils so for tumeric which is great for the anti-inflammatory as well and so tumeric you can get in a tincture which I've got here you can use it in its spice form but if you use it in its spice form it will be kind of gritty you can also get it in an essential oil unfortunately don't have the essential oil and you can also get it in capsules and it is still powdered form but it's really really fine so I like using this because you really don't feel it at all so that's what I use versus the versus the spice itself then the essential oils that I like to use and I put a list of the description of exactly what each of them do and you can choose which one's work best for you you can eliminate on any other choice you can just pick a few or all but I like this combination I found it works awesome for for inflammation so I've got the tumeric tincture I like I use spearmint eucalyptus lemongrass tea tree frankincense vetiver and lavender and the other thing you want to use is what's called a carrier oil and you could use grapeseed oil sweet almond oil castor oil I think avocado oil I believe is another one and what carrier oils do is you're gonna add your essential oils into the carrier oil before we add it in into our mixture and the reason is is essential oils can be very harsh on the skin and the first time I made it I figured well all this stuff's oily why do I need to add that so I just did it without it and it did I found it made me very itchy but when I add it to the grapeseed oil which they call as a carrier oil for them you I found that there I didn't have any itching at all so that is now what I do so I'll go over all those steps just a moment and then just for your equipment you're just gonna need a double boiler and you just want to use the potty Bowl that you're gonna be keep your stuff in and a spatula or a wooden spoon and also tapioca starch in is an option for you if you would like it helps to make it not so greasy so if you don't like a greasy feeling on your bombs or creams then you can looking at in the tapioca which I really like so depending on how much you can bury again it's I use about a quarter of a cup but again you can test it out and see what feels better for your skin oops yes I'm crushing all right so I'm just gonna get all this cleaned up and we'll put all of our ingredients together alright so the first thing you just set up your double boiler add your water it's important to make sure that the water does not touch the bottom of your bowl you can put that in and you're gonna set your heat to medium to medium-low higher higher to the medium side and we're gonna add in our two tablespoons of our infused coconut oil our two ounces of pure unrefined cocoa butter one ounce of shea butter and our two tablespoons of wax pellets beeswax pellets I use pure organic and you're gonna just kind of mix that in and wait for that to start melting and yeah it's not a whole lot to it so we're just gonna I said let that melt and have everything come together now it's very important do not turn up your heat you want to do it slowly it is very easy to burn any one of these components so you definitely want to melt it slowly over that medium-low heat as it begins to melt you just want to continue to mix periodically mix things so that you're bringing the heated stuff from the bottom up to the to the top and distributing the warm over the coal getting everything melted a little bit quicker and then while our little mixture a little concoction here is melting we can get our essential oils ready okay so you're gonna start with two tablespoons of your carrier oil whichever you decided I use grapeseed the grapeseed oil it's a good neutral good for all skin types it absorbs easily into the skin and yeah but as I said you can find maybe one that works better for your skin if you've got skin issues or yeah the sensitivity or things like that you may find one of the other ones that work better for you so you're gonna add two tablespoons of that and so it said this is my concoction you guys can said kind of do what works better for you this is what I put together that I said that I found really works great for inflammation and a little as well as a lot of my friends have tried it and it has worked really great so I use about one milliliter of the tumeric tincture and then I use one of the capsules of the 3050 milligrams of tumeric the one nice thing about using the capsules is you know exactly how much you're using you just open that up put that in and then I use spearmint as I said if you look in the description you'll find a full explanation to each the essential oils as to why I use them and I use about 20 drops of spearmint and eucalyptus is really good for your inflammation as well and muscle pain and I use about 30 drops of this and if anyone's really actually counting and there's a comment about oh there was 32 I don't want to hear it and lemongrass is awesome plus it smells really nice and again I use about 30 drops of this and then I use tea tree and the reason for the tea tree is it acts as a nice ant is an antiseptic so it takes care of any issues on your skin as well so it is it it helps like I said if it's got any kind of open lose or blemishes or things like that it will help us with that as well and being an antiseptic and I used about 15 drops of this and then ten drops of frankincense whoops that comes out quick stop's expensive too and the vet vetiver now this stuff is really really sick so it doesn't come out of the dropper we got to be very careful well I have to be careful most other people don't and I'm gonna use about ten drops of this and another good one for our skin although I don't like it I don't add it because I hate the smell of lavender but lavender is a great option as well it's a very relaxing and soothing for the muscles but as I said I don't like it don't really find much for me personally I'd anyway again personal option I hate the smell of lavender and then we're just gonna mix all those together now that all your butters and oils are melted here you're just gonna turn your heat down to low and you're just gonna leave it on for a bow we're gonna leave it on for about 20 minutes this is just to make sure everything comes up to the exact same temperature and everything is fully blended and melted together okay I apologize sorry my Stoner gapping move here the tumeric capsule if you use the capsules do not put it into the essential oils so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna just strain that out you're gonna use the capsule put the capsule into the into your shea butter and cocoa butter mixture so I'm just gonna fix that up here by watch it go straighter stop putting a piece of cheesecloth I doubled it up and applauding it into a small strainer all this stuff is very expensive so I don't want to waste it so now this isn't going to hurt the anything I'm just removing the chunks in there that we don't really want in a cream and then I'm going to add the capsule into the end of the oil okay so I'm going to add the tumeric capsule into the shea butter and cocoa butter and our beeswax that's where it's supposed to go and you just want to get a whisk a little whisk if you've got one and just whisk that in alright so our mixture has been sitting on the warm on the hot water there for about 20 minutes you're just gonna take it off and you're gonna let it sit on the counter until it cools down a little bit we don't want to add the essential oils when it's really hot because that will it'll burn off on the essential parts of the essential oils so we want to let that cool down a little bit before we're gonna add in the oils for about 5-10 minutes just check the bottom of your bowl if it's just warm to the touch then we're good but if it still feels hot wait a little bit so that feels good so now we're going to take a Nadder and add in our essential oils and you're gonna get a whisk and we're gonna whisk that in alright so here you got some options if you just want a waxy balm you can go ahead and pour it into your containers like this if you would like to take away some of the grease enos of it you can add in the tapioca starch so I'm gonna add in a quarter cup and you're gonna whisk that in again the tapioca is optional I like it though it makes it feel a lot nicer you just use a spatula to get anything off the sides I just continue to whisk whisk that until it is all known all all smooth sorry you want it nice and smooth like that so as I said if you just want to have a bomb then you can go ahead and pour it into your containers I'm gonna do a little bit of both I'm gonna do poor part one so the poor one is a bomb and then show you how to emulsify and make it a lighter texture so I'm just gonna pour the liquid just doesn't do it I'm just doing a bomb and I pour that let that set up and now you're just gonna let these you're gonna let this sit on the counter until it partially solidifies so we're going to wait for it to solidify about halfway and then we're going to start the beating process now this will solidify fairly quickly because of all of what the Watts that we have in it but less wax you use the longer it's going to take to to solidify now you can put it into the refrigerator to assist with it but it'll go fairly quickly like I said right now because we've got the wax up quite a bit of wax in there but if you do want to speed up the process you can definitely put it in the fridge for about three to five minutes but don't forget about it all right so you want your bomb now to be like this so you see how it's partially solidified here on the sides it's kind of solid but in the middle we're still liquidy and you're gonna get your hand mixer or blender or whisk you can use whoops and we are going to continue to mix this until it is all one homogeneous uniform factory [Music] all right so I'm just gonna let this sit again and let it solidify around the edges again and we're gonna repeat the process and each time we do you're gonna see the the product keep getting lighter and lighter all right so it's sort of quite a bit more on the sides there during your mixing process you can always test your bond to see how it feels and make sure that you like it for your texture so it's gonna be a lot more solid once it solidifies and sets however you want to see what it's actually gonna feel like just take a little bit rub it on the back of your hand and see how that feels so first it'll be a greasy L feel greasy but that tapioca you'll notice it'll start to nod not feel it and then you just want to work it in so it may be a little bit yellow on the skin but as you work it in that yellow will go away okay so I would just put it back into the freezer for about two minutes and I'm going to continue the process all right so you can see now that our pain balm is all one uniform texture we whatever we pull off the size is the exact same we're not getting any separation wax or anything like that and that's how you know that is fully blended there and it's gonna make a nice light bomb for you so now we're ready to pour it into our containers I just want to smack them down so they're nice and fun get out any air bubbles and that's it you can let them sit out on this counter for a couple of hours to fully set or you can put them into the fridge or the freezer to quicken that up and I'm gonna put these into the fridge probably for about a half an hour and then we'll all come back and we'll test it out right so my pain bombs here have set up and this was the one that I did just as wax and I didn't whip it up there and you can see it's darker my lighting is a little bit tough here to see it's pretty bright and then this one's a lot lighter so I said you can it'll just give you a little bit different texture totally up to you it's just a preference thing you're not gonna get any different benefits either way so we're just gonna give it a try here you see so you see how it goes on a little bit yellow and then you just work it in and there you go then you can see that grease enos it was first there at tapioca that's what takes that away so it just feels really nice on your skin as well and that's it so now you can make your own pain bombs at home without caught us thinking absolutely well not gonna lie it's a little bit expensive if you go with all those essential oils I highly recommend doing research on buying them your local if you go to your local health food store it's gonna cost you an absolute fortune I do recommend Amazon has great prices on essential oils a couple of things with regards to essential oils make sure that they are 100% essential oils and that they are pure that the other is that they're actually essential oils because you will also see essential oil fragrances and that is just extracting the fragrances from your different your different herbs and roots and same things so you want to make sure it's essential oils 100% pure and that's about all I can say with regards to that if you have any questions at all as always don't hesitate to put them in the comments I'll always get back to you if you have anything else any suggestions or anything I'd love to hear from you other than that I hope you enjoyed the video and you have a wonderful rest of your day thanks for watching [Music]", "agLIlV_RBrU": "hey there so i wanted to do another video again i got so many messages from people interested in these cannabis drinks like i knew that that was a market i knew people are interested in that but a lot of people messaged me so i just wanted to do some more videos and content on that and last night actually i was messaging these folks that work at tonic i was just messaging them through instagram they were so nice and one of them was telling me like that they have different ratios of thc and cbd so if i wanted a more cbd focused one to be like for the daytime they have that you know all kinds of stuff different flavors so along that i wanted to post another drink from them um this one is much much stronger so this is the tonic beverage that i got at the dispensary and this one's a hundred milligrams whereas the one i had yesterday was 25 milligrams cbd 25 milligrams thc so literally five times stronger so for me like knowing this information knowing that this is a hundred milligrams i just know right off the bat that i can't drink this whole thing in one sitting or one day to be honest um so what i've got here is it's really nice that if you can see there's like little demarcations to tell you okay if you want just a little bit this is how much you should take and it's like got lines to mark it and a little see-through strip so you can see you know where you're at so that was incredibly smart because i was like all right well i can just measure out how much i do want you know so i had 25 milligrams right here and i just poured that into a cup and really really like this so this one is a mango pineapple flavor there's no cbd in it so it's a little more psychoactive and personally like i like the more light milligrams of of thc because yesterday was a really nice experience for me i had that one tonic seltzer and then the rest of the night i drank regular sparkling water like perrier bubbly you know other things so that was like my night but if i had this i would want to make sure that i hydrated a lot lot more because it's like pretty concentrated you know like like you need some water to get that feeling good one thing that can happen with cannabis beverages and i've seen this happen is people will drink only this right they think it's an actual beverage like i'll just drink this this is almost like medicine you know it's like a flavorful nice way to drink it but you need like an actual drink an actual beverage so consider that and i tell people that with gummies too like yeah it's great to have gummies but buy yourself some just regular gummies and eat those too like don't eat gummies that are infused with cannabis is like a main snack like that's not their point but that's just my opinion so again if you buy this super super good but hydrate yourself um this i believe was 25 milligrams or i'm sorry 25 at the dispensary so 100 milligrams for 25 bucks so i would definitely buy this there's no taste of cannabis it tasted like uh like mango popsicle juice if that's a good description um so i was really surprised by that like whoever makes this and formulates this it has come a long way since the ones that i had like many years ago like on our honeymoon my husband and i went to colorado and had different you know drinks there and things like that and they did taste a little cannabis but this was also back in 2017 so things have really come a long way since then but yeah if you're interested check this place out it's tonic they're made by a company pts progressive treatment solutions and this one right here is called their pure thc infused beverage all right hope you have a good day bye my youtube channel is sponsored by the wonderful folks over at killcliffcbd.com that's k-i-l-l-c-l-i-f-f-cbd.com and you can

today uh when it comes to doing your own label design which is awesome we fully support that we just want to go over some things that will just make your life easier we recommend setting up your files in adobe illustrator if possible just gives you a nice vector file format setting it up at 300 dpi using cmyk color space that allows for scalability and a really clear print we recommend leaving a one inch by half inch blank space rectangle somewhere on the label this allows for us to place a sticker that includes the batch id the qr code that scans to that batch's coa and the expiration date this allows for longevity of your labels and we apply them when you place an order another option is to have a qr code that links to the lab results page on your website if you choose this does create an additional step for the customer to find that particular batch's coa but we've seen it done successfully in your document setup we recommend having a bleed of 0.125 inches on all sides of the document also a 0.0625 inset safe zone where no text runs into the edge of the document this just ensures that when the label is printed if there's any misalignments things don't get cut off or cropped we highly recommend and in fact some states require the following information to be included on your label first an fda disclaimer we've provided this in the description below for non-edibles use the term product facts or supplement facts instead of nutrition facts as some states don't allow nutrition facts for non-food items be sure to include your company information such as your

tincture our six thousand milligram tinctures is sixty milliliters but the milligrams of cbd per serving are still 100 milligrams be sure to have the thc content listed as well such as isolate and broad spectrum products showing 0.00 percent thc and full spectrum products being lab tested at less than 0.3 percent thc which is the federally legal limit some of the common label sizes we recommend are as follows for our one ounce tincture we recommend a 3.8 inches wide by 1.9 inch tall label 1.8 inches works for height as well for our two ounce tinctures of six thousand milligrams we recommend a four inches wide by two inches tall label for a full listing of the recommended label sizes we've provided a document below that you can download and check out if you're providing your label files for us to print please send them as individual pdfs for each sku have the fonts outlined this just ensures that when it gets to the press computers there's no janky fonts happening and the layouts get skewed or screwed up it'll make the process much smoother we hope these tips help you when you're designing your cbd labels if you're interested in checking out our private label design service or white label service options we provided those links in the description below and thanks for checking us out", "cRp4g1JN9vY": "sunny skies CBD full-spectrum tinctures are made with full spectrum distillate like all sunny skies products there's a QR code on the label that when scanned pulls up the lab results for that batch of product if you look at the COA for this full spectrum tincture you will notice trace but legal amounts of THC under 0.3% if you look closely at the coa for the full spectrum picture you will also notice the presence of minor cannabinoids CBD THC and other cannabinoids work synergistically with one another to create what's known as the entourage effect this is why we generally recommend the full-spectrum tincture however if you are subjected to drug tests for work or whatever other reason we recommend going with a broad spectrum or isolate tinctures which are THC free zero point zero zero percent THC we use MCT from coconut as our carrier oil and distillate as our extract rather than crude you'll notice that a lot of full-spectrum pictures on the market are made with CBD crude you'll find that our tinctures tastes much much better disel it is a more refined extract and therefore has less plant material per milligram of CBD there are milliliter markings on the droppers for customized dosing [Music]", "7p3Nz8h5WrU": "sunny skies CBD broad-spectrum tinctures are made with THC free broad-spectrum distillate we process full spectrum dissolute to a broad spectrum distillate using reverse phase flash chromatography here in our lavender and like with all sunny skies CBD products the broad spectrum tinctures have a QR code that when scanned pull up the lab results for that batch of product cos can also be accessed on our website on the lab results page if you look at a broad-spectrum tincture coa you will notice that the THC is non-detectable 0.00% you will also notice the presence of minor cannabinoids in the broad-spectrum tinctures this will allow you to have some of the entourage effect commonly associated with full-spectrum tinctures - the THC so if you look at the coa of a full-spectrum tincture and compared to a broad spectrum tincture they look very similar except for the full-spectrum tincture will have a trace the legal amount of THC under 0.3% the only cannabinoid you will see on an isolating sure CoA is CBD so isolate tinctures are also THC free but they don't have the presence of minor cannabinoids like the broad-spectrum tincture we use MCT oil as our carrier oil and all of the droppers have milliliter markings for customized dosing [Music]", "96y9vctDktw": "hey guys Rebecca from elements of eternity so today I am working with cannabis again I am making a edible medicine I'm making chocolate peanut butter truffles these are actually going to be dipped in homemade organic chocolate so I already D carved my marijuana and medicine and today I am using sunset sherbert this strain is actually known as galette oh it's a indica dominant hybrid 85% indicus of 15% sativa strain it's very potent it tested about 29% it's mom and dad is Girl Scout cookie and pink panties actually so I was wanting to make an extra strength medicine here I wanted them to be about a hundred milligrams apiece by the time I'm done with them now for starters they recommend around 10 milligrams and see how it goes so to make my butter I used a organic here's my gonna be the mix I know it's cream but it tastes just like the inside of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but I used an organic hormone-free churned butter cream like a butter and organic coconut oil is going to be for my chocolate and what I did was I usually it is about two ounces per pound of butters but I actually used three and I didn't use trim I actually use the buds I got this from the cultivation car farm the other day and I grind this up so I ground up the three ounces of this and to measure your THC when you're making edible guys it's always a rule of thumb that one gram of cannabis has a thousand milligrams of dry weight that means a strain house like say for instance 15 percent THC now this strain has 29 percent CHD their THC so it's higher but for instance the average medicine flower has 15 percent THC it'll have about a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC 15 percent of say a thousand milligrams equals 150 milligrams but sorry I got dizzy for a second but the average strain actually is only 10 percent anything over 15 or 20 percent in your strain is considered above average and high in THC and it's considered extremely potent and this strain here I'm using actually for edibles is really good with appetite stimulation it helps with pain restlessness and sleepiness the great thing about these is that it doesn't it does make you feel good and euphoric but it's not supposed to knock you out now if it does knock you out that means you took too much and since everybody handles edibles completely different it's highly recommended that if you're not used to edibles to start small like say for instance these are a hundred milligrams apiece to start out actually in a fourth now if you're you know used to this and all that you've got to eat the whole thing but yeah so what i'm doing here actually I need in my hands are sterile I need 50 of them if I have 50 of the these right here that's a hundred milligrams each now if I don't make it that far and get actually 50 of them then they're actually going to be more potent than that and I have my labels and ingredients in all that forum these are amazing alternative medicines for you know people that are really having a hard time with illness or cancer say nausea energy or whatever and I'm using the stainless steel ball is half of them because I want them all to be the same size and what I do is I dip them in powdered sugar so that they don't stick and kind of just pack it in there and knock off the excess so that and like I said they're going to be dipped in chocolate so they're going to be so they're going to be truffles chocolate peanut butter medicated truffles mm-hmm by the time I'm done with them and you know for people who are not familiar with edibles when they eat them they expect this high like you would smoking marijuana and it's actually nothing at the sort now you do get high and you do get intoxicated I'm not gonna lie about that but it's not the same you can be in a lot of pain and within a half an hour you'll start feeling your pain ease away or nausea or joint pain muscles it's great for arthritis hey guys I'm back along my camera father so I just did my chocolate oh and by the way I'm sorry my phone cut out I had to lower my resolution on my phone so I could finished the video so this half is going to be a little less better quality so I made my chocolate which is just organic coconut oil organic cocoa powder some honey and since it is summer months I want my product to hold up so I added a little bit of organic beeswax to the chocolates so that it holds up and I also crushed some Adeem a nuts which are kind of like a bean they kind of taste like a roasted peanut and I crushed them up it's gonna go on the tops and I set these in the freezer anything easier to to handle and for the chocolate to free zones or set up so we're going to do and let it drip off c6o and if you chop wits like this and you're wanting to add toppings you have to do it right from the get-go because once it cools um just like so so I'm gonna pause this and get more done and then I'll be back okay guys I'm back so I ended up getting them all done dipped in chocolate and they turned out really great I decided to only put the a dummy on some the Adame nuts and for packaging they actually go on one of these a little and they hardened up great so they go on one of these and in one of these boxes and plated with the ingredients and the sonim so yeah they turned out great I must say guys that I know they're at a hundred milligrams but I'll tell you what I test all my products so I um tooth like I don't know it was like a [ __ ] half a teaspoon of just the filling and let me tell you I'm I'm really feeling motion but I was really nauseous and hurtin and that's all gone a little loopy I honestly wouldn't drive that's for sure so yeah I'm really really happy with how they turned out and they turn nice and hard because I put the little bit of beeswax in it so yeah that's about it so I'll talk to you guys later bye", "T6QLp_dK6Pg": "hi this is Nancy

had that was CBD related I'm not mistaken I think I've only had like and I think I had a pixie stick I never had lollipops I haven't had too many the lollipops were the best that they were from heady

the Clementine taste so I just [ __ ] lynched my coil in the banana crush to get the taste away and it went away after a while and dunno it's just that banana cushions you're not [ __ ] love it and I didn't think I like you and for the person I forget her name but she asked me the other night about banana crush on the coil and stuff my I whipped up your baby it should be better than mine like this liquid to me it seems very thin or at least it was at first like my vapors and maybe it was my baby that was malfunctioning it might have been my baby that was malfunctioning but now it because like that first it was blowing thin cloud I don't know if my I don't know honestly the juice is very very water you know it's not very thick or anything not like you don't have some juices out of 1000 it wasn't wasn't anything crazy like dick or anything either but this is I've had this coil for like about a week now and uh I've only had this one no burn taste no nothing like that well I did have one burnt taste but that was my fault because I did you sir not know what kind of touched it but I think I was like drinking or something that's probably why but yeah we'll probably doing though I'm just gonna do it we're gonna do the CBD living water I have no idea actually what it is I don't even think it's wax I think it's like whole nother it might be wax in my I don't know but uh I'm gonna get

shit's not on that side it's not a company that they go through that I that's where I usually get emotional I'm gonna start getting some [ __ ] through this company I usually don't like to go to any other company because I just try I trust that one company because I they just they there with a whole bunch other companies and they have it just all a bunch of different products like it's not all like they have their own brands and then they go through other companies and get stuff and so like it's very variance there's not just their stuff you know they're not company with this so if you want this stuff you have to go to see me deal with him order those things for real I'm already edible wise I've had some shitty ass edibles lobby cost for the best they were like m9 I did tend to be honest with you only thing I didn't like was I think it was like a little bitter taste actually there ain't anything so I'm gonna give these I didn't like them better than wali pop but they may be said they weren't too bad I'll give it a 7 7 out of 10 for real and it's not even like the quality the qualities was winning it right now it's just that better taste and I feel like for 20 bucks you probably

bit about topicals I've got two brand-new topicals coming out from ab annoyed botanicals that I'm pretty excited about and I do get a lot of questions on the skincare products so I thought we could just talk through a couple of them today and I'll let you know what I think so first up let's talk about face serums with the new topical from AB annoyed I have two different options for facial serums the first one is from made by hand and it's been my go-to for well over a year now it is a nice thick serum there's 100 milligrams of CBD in this bottle so we know that CBD is awesome for neutralizing our insides this is going to help us neutralize our outsides as well have oil and CBD are considered to be skin normalizer so that should if you're more dry or more oily this should help you get back to that middle range which is what most of us are going for I know I am especially so this one is nice and thick when you shake it up and pull it out it kind of looks like honey there is actually honey that is in the formula and I usually apply it by putting it on the back of my hand I always put it on my left hand which means that my left hand is significantly softer than the back of my right hand but this you can just take it and rub right into your skin I do actually already have makeup on so I'm going all over makeup which is weird but hey it's effective this one is super super thick I am in Michigan so Michigan in the winter especially right now not super awesome so this is perfect for wintertime skin a nice thick serum I do also put it sometimes in the cuticles and my fingers and then the ends of my hair cuz I get that crazy dry staticky yuck and I found that the oil tones those down as well um so let's compare that to the new guy from Avenue D I have been lucky enough to be a beta tester on this product for the past couple months I've been using it for a little bit this still has 100 milligrams of CBD so same see me content this one is in a spray pump top versus that dropper top matter of personal preference the dropper top since I've been using that for a while like I'm telling you I've definitely knocked it over and spilled it especially if I'm hasty in it don't screw the top on as well as I should so dropper talks a little nicer that way haven't yet gotten down to the bottom of my bottle but it looks like it winds around so I should be able to get everything out if by some chance there's a little bit left in here that the dropper top can't pull out I would always just unscrew the top and use it that way so this guy sprayed top still shake it up a little bit squirt it into your hand you're going to find I can't really get a good angle on that can I you're gonna find that it's not quite as thick so this I think is awesome for me personally for fall and for for summertime because it is a little bit lighter for your skin and again I'm the goofy one who puts it in my hair and let my fingernails as well right now I'm actually using both of these as part of my routine I'm using the thicker one at night and the a monoid later serum in the morning so I am using it twice a day that's working really well for me personally so same amount of CBD different top and then there are different additional herbs this guy has orange oil he's got honey and rose hip in there this one has a really more herbs and different ones as well we've got blue chamomile we've got mango butter patchouli jasmine cinnamon mark vanilla bean so all kinds of fun herbs in here really good stuff both of them both of them are going to be that oil base that 100 milligrams of CBD so really good stuff for your skin the other item that I wanted to chat about a little bit is the me buddy haven't muscle in joint South this one's almost gone because it is my husband's absolute favorite thing he puts on every morning on his feet and on his knees it does last him a good long time it's a really thick salve when you open it up it's sort of a green color from that hump and it's easy to get out just a little bit right on the end so if you've got sore knees feet anything like that this maid might have staff has been my go-to for quite a while Abbe annoyed has launched a salve as well I'm still gonna be in a little tin that you can open up and just get to work on these this guy is a hundred milligrams of CVD in the tin two M's tin the new AB annoyed version is 150 and it's got some different herbs in there as well I have actually not tried that out yeah so I'm looking forward to giving it a shot and seeing what I think again 50% more CBD and the retail price on it is actually the same so there's there's a benefit they're made by hump does have peppermint and lavender which for me personally work really nicely with that CBD and I see a benefit there one thing to keep in mind is any time you're putting CBD on your skin it's this stuff is not getting down into your bloodstream so I have lots of customers that ask is it okay to use a topical level and use a CBD that I'm eating and taking internally and the Internet is yes absolutely personally I take a tincture every day and I use these products on my skin every day I do also vape that's something that I do as part of my personal routine just if I'm having a bad day or I'm stressed out in an in a little bit of a boost then all day pose well but a tincture is generally my go-to along with these skin products so I'm always here you can email call any questions that you've got I'm happy to help I hope that it was a little bit helpful to get an idea of these products thanks so much [Music] you", "9hcJiK4-T5w": "hey guys hello welcome back to life above the clouds my name is Lauren gah and I have my friend came back here with me I love you might remember her from our pumpkin dinner roll video yeah yes and today I'm really excited because we were gonna make cannabis cell so we have one cup of cannabis coconut oil and we have one cup of cocoa butter you could also use shea butter if you wanted to we're a no butter or mango butter and here k has shaved off of this block of beeswax with one cup of beeswax and we're gonna use two tablespoons of jojoba oil and we have these were my three essential oils but then k fried this entire box of essential oils that's a partial partial sometimes like the room to smell good I have a double boiler set up here it's just a saucepan with about an inch of water and it's simmering and then I have a glass bowl place on top and we're gonna melt all of our ingredients together how easy is that why don't you go ahead and pour in that beeswax and then we're adding cocoa butter and then our cannabis coconut oil I've already melted it because it's easier to measure out when it's melted and yes our two tablespoons of jojoba can I just have a silicon spatula I am going to use to mix this all together while it melts easy peasy lemon squeezy so when we're done with this you can put this you can make it into a lotion bar but by putting it in like a cupcake liner I've also saved this little lotion container that you forgot a jar yeah you can put it in a little jar or I actually even saved a chapstick container pour it in the chest and let it cool could wear this also as trap stick so I also brought a measuring cup with a spout so we can use it to pour into my chopstick containers you can also buy these a craft store you could also I clean out an old deodorant container and use that oh yeah you can pour it into the container and let it harden we're almost completely melted so I'm just going to twist it all the way back down and then you can just pour it in there to fill it up isn't that the coolest thing and it you've never heard of I mean one of but the coolest thing and I've set up all of our little containers we have two

I WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT WHEN\nI WAS 19 YEARS OLD, AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING. >> I WOULD SAY CANNABIS\nWORKS FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR SOME TYPES OF PAIN. NEUROPATHIC PAIN, OR NERVE\nPAIN, SEEMS TO BE HELPED BY IT, AND SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY\nARTHRITIC PAIN OR JOINT PAIN. ACTUALLY, A NUMBER OF PEOPLE\nUSE IT AS A SALVE AND REPORT RELIEF FROM THAT. SOME PEOPLE, IT DOESN'T DO\nMUCH FOR. >> WHAT CHRONIC MEANS. YOU KNOW, WHEN I GO TO THE\nDOCTOR, THEY SAY ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN, WHAT IS YOUR\nPAIN LEVEL. I'M ALWAYS USUALLY AT A\nFIVE, WHICH MEANS I'M ALWAYS IN PAIN, BUT SOMETIMES IT\nCAN GO UP TO AN EIGHT OR A NINE, AND OCCASIONALLY IT'S\nGOTTEN TO A TEN WHERE I CAN'T WALK. AND I'VE TRIED A NUMBER OF\nDIFFERENT THINGS TO TRY TO CONTROL THE PAIN, INCLUDING\nPHYSICAL THERAPY, I'VE BEEN TO ACUPUNCTURE, I'VE HAD\nCHIROPRACTOR. I DO GET MASSAGES REGULARLY. BUT MY GODSEND REALLY IS THE\nCANNABIS. WITHOUT THE CANNABIS, I\nDON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO. I WAS TAKING OPIOIDS AND\nMUSCLE RELAXERS, AND WHEN I WOULD TAKE THOSE, IT WOULD\nKIND OF LAY ME OUT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. SO I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. AND I'M ABLE TO ACTUALLY\nCOME HOME FROM WORK AND MAYBE TAKE A PIECE OF CANDY\nAND THEN ACTUALLY PREPARE DINNER AND BE COMFORTABLE\nBEING ON MY FEET. >> THERE ARE THOSE CASES\nWHERE PEOPLE SAY, I'VE DECREASED MY OPIOID USE OR I\nHAVE GONE OFF OF OPIATES, BUT IT'S REALLY RARE. >> I'VE BEEN A MEDICAL\nMARIJUANA USER FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS NOW. I WOULD SAY I USE IT SEVERAL\nTIMES A WEEK. THIS IS MORE OF A INDICA\nSTRAIN, WHICH IS USED MORE FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT. THE\nMORE YOU LEARN ABOUT THIS, THE BETTER YOU CAN REGULATE\nHOW MUCH YOU CAN TAKE AND HOW MUCH IT IMPACTS YOU. >> THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE\nMEDICAL CANNABIS SYSTEM, THE WAY IT'S SET UP, IS ON THE\nONE HAND NOT A GREAT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH OR GUIDANCE, AND\nALSO, WHEN SOMEBODY SIGNS UP FOR THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA\nPROGRAM, I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT THEY TAKE, HOW\nMUCH THEY TAKE, OR HOW THEY USE IT. I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT\nTHEY GET AT THE DISPENSARY. SO IT PUTS HEALTH CARE\nPROVIDERS IN A BIT OF A TOUGH POSITION. >> IF THIS IS HELPING THIS\nCHILD, IF IT IS HELPING THIS PERSON THROUGH END OF LIFE,\nIF IT IS HELPING SOMEBODY, MAYBE THEIR MS ISN'T\nPROGRESSING AS MUCH OR THEIR GLAUCOMA ISN'T PROGRESSING\nAS MUCH, WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE. >> THERE'S PEOPLE WHO ARE\nSTILL VERY CLOSED MINDED TO IT, BUT THEN YOU MEET\nSOMEBODY, YOU GET THE CHANCE TO MEET A KID THAT HAS 100\nSEIZURES A DAY, AND YOU GROW CBD FOR HIM AND HE STOPS\nHAVING SEIZURES, THAT TO ME IS WHY I DO THIS. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T ARGUE\nTHAT. THERE'S NO POLITICIAN IN THE\nWORLD WHO CAN TELL ME THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING MEDICINE. I'M ABLE TO GO HOME, SMOKE A\nJOINT, EAT DINNER, SLEEP WELL. IT TAKES CARE OF MY BACK\nPAIN, IT TAKES CARE OF MY KNEE PAIN. I'M ON MY FEET FOR 10, 11\nHOURS A DAY, AND A JOINT CURES THAT. I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE ADVIL,\nI DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IBUPROFEN 800. I CAN SMOKE A JOINT, AND I\nDON'T WAKE UP WITH A HANGER OVER. I DON'T WAKE UP SICK LIKE\nALCOHOL DOES TO PEOPLE. >> THE OTHER THING THAT'S\nINTERESTING IS THAT EDIBLES TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR TO START\nWORKING, WHEREAS THE SMOKEABLES START WORKING\nIMMEDIATELY. >> THE TIME IT TAKES AN\nEDIBLE TO TAKE EFFECT IS REALLY HOW LONG IT TAKES TO\nABSORB THROUGH THE INTESTINES. SO IT COULD BE ANYWHERE\nFROM, LET'S SAY, 30 MINUTES UP TO AN HOUR, AN HOUR AND A\nHALF. WE HEAR A LOT OF VARIATION,\nWHICH IS PART OF THE CONCERN AND PART OF THE RISK WITH\nEDIBLES. IF SOMEBODY IS USED TO\nSMOKING OR VAPORIZING AND HAVING AN EFFECT WITHIN\nLET'S SAY A MINUTE OR TWO, AND THEN THEY TAKE AN EDIBLE\nAND 20 MINUTES LATER THEY'RE NOT FEELING ANYTHING, THEY\nMIGHT TAKE MORE THINKING IT'S TOO LOW OF A DOSE, ETC. AFTER A FEW HOURS, IT\nCATCHES UP WITH THEM AND THEY HAVE ESSENTIALLY\nOVERDOSED AND ARE MORE INTOXICATED THAN THEY WANTED\nTO BE. >> WHEN I GET HOME FROM\nWORK, TYPICALLY I WILL TOKE ON THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES. THIS IS THE VAPE. AND THEN I WILL EAT A PIECE\nOF CANDY, AND THIS WILL HOLD ME THROUGH UNTIL THE CANDY\nKICKS IN. AND THEN I SHOULD BE OKAY\nFOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT AND I'LL BE ABLE TO SLEEP\nWELL. >> IT'S VERY VARIABLE HOW\nLONG IT LASTS, AND THAT HAS TO DO MOSTLY WITH THE ROUTE\nOF ADMINISTRATION. SO FOR INSTANCE, THROUGH\nSMOKING IT OR VAPORIZING IT, BECAUSE IT GOES INTO OUR\nLUNG AND RIGHT INTO OUR BLOODSTREAM, THAT MAY HAVE\nAN ACTION ANYWHERE FROM THREE, LET'S SAY, TO FIVE OR\nSIX HOURS, WHEREAS IF SOMEBODY EATS A CANNABINOID,\nTHEN IT IS ABSORBED VERY SLOWLY THROUGH OUR DIGESTIVE\nSYSTEM AND IT CAN ACT MUCH LONGER BECAUSE OF ITS SLOW\nABSORPTION, CAN ACT FOR 10, 15, 20, 30, EVEN 40 HOURS,\nDEPENDING ON HOW MUCH IS TAKEN AND HOW WELL IT IS\nABSORBED THROUGH THE INTESTINES. >> RIGHT HERE IS OUR MOMS. MOST OF THE PROPAGATION THAT\nWE DO IS FROM CLONING. WE HAVE PROBABLY ABOUT 80\nSTRAINS REPRESENTED IN THIS PARTICULAR ROOM. THIS ROOM IS EARLY IN THE\nFLOWER. YOU CAN SEE THE PLANTS ARE\nJUST STARTING TO PRODUCE THEIR FLOWERS. THIS IS ONE OF OUR OLDER\nROOMS, SO IT'S OLDER TECHNOLOGY. SO, THIS IS INDICATIVE MORE\nOF OUR CURRENT GROW METHODOLOGY FOR INDOORS, NOT\nQUITE 2000 SQUARE FEET. WE'RE USING PLASMA LIGHTS,\nLOTS OF AIR FLOW, AND AS YOU CAN SEE, THE TAGS ARE\nATTACHED, AND THIS TAG WILL STAY WITH THE PLANT THE\nENTIRE LIFE CYCLE. WE TRACK EVERY SINGLE ONE. WE CAPTURE PROBABLY ABOUT A\nMILLION POINTS OF DATA. IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. THIS ROOM HAS A LONG WAY TO\nGO, PROBABLY ANOTHER, BASED ON THE LOOKING AT THEM,\nPROBABLY ANOTHER SIX WEEKS. >> WE CONTROL ALL OF THE\nVARIABLES, THE TEMPERATURE, LIGHT, HUMIDITY, CO2, AIR\nEXCHANGE. ALL OF THAT CAN BE DONE\nINSIDE OF HERE, SO WE CAN ACTUALLY REPLICATE A PERFECT\nENVIRONMENT AND GROW BASICALLY AS CLOSE AS WE CAN\nTO A PERFECT CANNABIS PLANT. >> THIS WEEK ON NEW MEXICO\nInFOCUS, WE'RE BRINGING YOU THE DOCUMENTARY FILM\nNEW MARIJUANA. NOW, LET'S TAKE A FEW\nMINUTES TO CHECK IN ON THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROGRAM IN\nNEW MEXICO WITH JOURNALIST PETER ST. CYR. PETER, THANKS FOR COMING. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> YOU'VE BEEN DOING A LOT\nOF GOOD WORK ON THIS. I JUST WANT TO SAY RIGHT OFF\nTHE TOP, WHAT ARE WE WORKING WITH ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA. WHERE ARE WE? HOW MANY PATIENTS? HOW MANY GROWERS? WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN THE\nFUTURE? LET'S START THERE. WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW? >> THE PROGRAM IS IN ITS\n9th YEAR, AND BASICALLY, WE'RE STILL NOT QUITE AS BIG\nAS OTHER STATES, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE OTHER 25 STATES\nTHAT HAVE BEEN MORE ESTABLISHED, BUT NEW MEXICO\nCONTINUES TO SEE REALLY UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH. IN THE LAST YEAR, AN 81%\nINCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO ARE REGISTERED\nIN THE PROGRAM, AND IT'S RIGHT NOW AROUND 30,000. AND JUST, YOU KNOW, BACK IN\n2013, IT WAS ONLY LESS THAN 10,000 PATIENTS. SO IT IS CONTINUING TO GROW. WE HAVE 12 NEW PRODUCERS. THEY GOT THEIR LICENSES\nAWARDED LATE LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER. >> WHAT'S THE TOTAL THERE,\nOVER THOSE 12 NEW, WHAT'S THE TOTAL? >> NOW THE TOTAL, WE HAVE 35\nGROWERS, AND THEY ARE EACH ALLOWED TO GROW ABOUT 450\nPLANTS. NOT EVERYONE PURCHASED THE\nRIGHT TO GROW 450 PLANTS. IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE. $90,000 TO GROW 450 PLANTS. WHICH MEANS, THOUGH, THAT\nINSTEAD OF HAVING 15,800 PLANTS TO MEET THE NEW\nDEMAND OF THOSE INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS, WE'RE\nONLY GOING TO HAVE 13,800 PLANTS THIS YEAR. >> THAT'S INTERESTING. ON THE POLICY SIDE OF\nTHINGS, OBVIOUSLY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND\nOTHER ENTITIES ARE PLAYING A BIT OF CATCH-UP HERE. THAT KIND OF DEMAND, THAT'S\nA GROSS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE. WHERE ARE WE ON THAT SIDE OF\nIT? WHERE IS DOH ON MEETING THAT\nDEMAND? >> THIS SUMMER, THEY\nIRRITATED A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY WERE HAVING A DIFFICULT\nTIME PROCESSING REGISTRATIONS AND RENEWALS,\nAND THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM, I THINK WELL\nFOUNDED, BECAUSE IN TRADITIONAL BUSINESS YOU CAN\nSTART TO FORECAST AND LOOK, AND WHEN THEY GO ON TV AND\nTHEY SAY, THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREDICT IT, THAT SEEMS\nUNREALISTIC, BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY A WAY TO USE\nBASIC MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO PREDICT IT.\nAND WHILE PEOPLE WERE DELAYED, THEY WERE BEING\nTOLD TO GO BACK BASICALLY TO THEIR DOCTOR AND ASK TO BE\nPUT BACK ON NARCOTICS, OPIATES OR WHATEVER TO DEAL\nWITH THEIR PAIN, RATHER THAN THE LESS TOXIC THC. WHAT WE'RE SEEING, THOUGH,\nIS THAT AS THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS INCREASE, UNLESS\nTHERE IS A RULE CHANGE, THE SUPPLY IS GOING TO BE FIXED,\nAND SO IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. SO THERE'S ALSO A WAY TO\nPREDICT, YOU KNOW, IF THE PATIENTS -- RIGHT NOW,\nTHERE'S ABOUT 1.2% OF THE POPULATION IN NEW MEXICO ARE\nREGISTERED AS PATIENTS. BUT AS PEOPLE BECOME MORE\nCOMFORTABLE WITH IT AND START HEARING ABOUT RESEARCH\nTHAT SHOWS HOW IT WORKS, AND AS DOCTORS GET MORE TRAINED\nAND FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND ARE ALLOWED BY THEIR\nMEDICAL GROUPS TO START REFERRING PEOPLE TO THE\nPROGRAM, AN ECONOMIST HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW\nMEXICO SAYS THAT ABOUT 30% OF THE POPULATION, OR\n630,000 PEOPLE COULD QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM IN ONE OR\nMORE OF THE 21 CONDITIONS THAT YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR THE\nPROGRAM. >> THAT WAS AN INTERESTING\nPOINT, BACK WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM, WAS THE\nQUALIFYING CONDITIONS. IT'S BEEN A BIT OF A\nSTRUGGLE TO GET THAT EXPANDED OVER TIME. WHERE DO WE STAND NOW ON\nTHAT? A LOT OF FOLKS FELT LEFT OUT\nOF THE PROCESS EARLY ON. >> THE PROCESS TO GET A NEW\nMEDICAL CONDITION ADDED, YOU HAVE TO WRITE A PETITION AND\nGO IN FRONT OF A MEDICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE, AND\nTHEY'VE APPROVED NOW -- IN NEW MEXICO, THERE'S A TOTAL\nOF 21 CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED. AND I KNOW THAT LATER THIS\nFALL, THERE WILL BE ANOTHER BIANNUAL MEDICAL ADVISORY\nMEETING, AND I'VE HEARD THAT THERE WILL BE A PETITION TO\nINTRODUCE CANNABIS FOR USE IN TREATING PEOPLE WITH\nOPIATE ADDICTIONS AND DISORDERS, BECAUSE CANNABIS\nIS A GOOD WAY TO TREAT PAIN AND A NICE WAY OFF OF\nOPIATES WHEN PEOPLE ARE OVERDOSING AND DYING FROM\nTHOSE. >> I'VE READ THAT. WE'VE GOT ABOUT 30 SECONDS\nLEFT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS:\nWHERE ARE WE HEADED WITH THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA PROGRAM\nHERE? ARE YOU FEELING LIKE IN YOUR\nREPORTING THAT WE'RE GETTING TO SOME KIND OF PARITY WHERE\nENOUGH GROWERS WILL MEET THE DEMAND AT SOME POINT? ARE WE GOING TO GET THERE AT\nSOME POINT SOON, OR ARE WE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BEHIND\nTHE EIGHT BALL A LITTLE BIT? >> WELL, THIS ADMINISTRATION\nHAS TAKEN AN APPROACH AND HAS A PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW\nTHAT THERE NEEDS TO BE STERN REGULATIONS, BUT THOSE STERN\nREGULATIONS ARE REALLY CRUEL BECAUSE THEY'RE BONE-HEADED. IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET\nSCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT THAT IF THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS\nARE INCREASING BY 81% A YEAR, THAT CAPPING THE\nNUMBER OF PLANTS THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GROW IS GOING TO\nWORK. >> WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK,\nPETER ST. CYR. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON\nTHIS, BY THE WAY, YOU DO A LOT OF GOOD STUFF ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, LET'S GO BACK TO THAT\nFILM, NEW MARIJUANA, AND HEAR ABOUT HOW CHANGES IN\nTHE PROCESSING OF MARIJUANA MIGHT IMPACT PEOPLE WHO USE\nTHE DRUG, ESPECIALLY TEENS.", "k1Ze_r0LH68": "the CBD morning drops and CBD sleep drops are two of our complimentary turkey and infuse tinctures they are both made with CBD isolate and our THC free the morning drops are infused with limonene terpene isolate whereas the CBD sleep drops are infused with two terpene isolates line Ahlul and humulin limonene comes from citrus fruits primarily and is the terpene most often associated with energy and focus the morning drops have a subtle citrus flavor for the sleep drops line Ahlul comes from lavender and humulin comes from hops both are known for promoting relaxation and the combination of the two creates a subtle piney flavor a frequently asked question we get about the CBD sleep drops is are they more effective at promoting sleep than the rest of your tinker's the answer is probably but if so

stuff so feel free to hit that subscribe button if this is something that you find interesting or useful today we'll be reviewing the medication gabapentin we will be taking a look at what it is its uses the dosing some side effects as well as some precautions to take into account if you are taking up a Penton or if you are considering it just a little disclaimer before we start this video is for informational purposes only and it's not intended to be a substitute for medical advice from your physician please continue to follow any specific instructions provided to you by your local healthcare provider or providers it so gabapentin is a prescription medication that is available either as a tablet a capsule or solution it is marketed under the brand name neurontin or horizontal or growl eyes org release as some people prefer to call it and it is available either as an immediate release tablet or capsule or an extended release formulation the two approved uses of gabapentin are firstly as an adjunct in the treatment of management of partial seizures and what an adjunct means is that they're by painting by itself may not be used to treat partial seizures but it may be used in conjunction with other medications the second use of gabapentin our fda approved use is in the treatment of post-apartheid inner algea this is a condition where there is a lot of pain due to damaged nerves which results as a complication of shingles so sometimes when somebody gets shingles the person may be healed there rushes disappear and everything but there's been some damage to the nerves and this causes pain gabapentin is used to manage that kind of pain interestingly one of the most common uses of gabapentin which is the management of that a peripheral neuropathy is actually not an fda-approved use it is basically an off-label use and what off-label uses of medications are that the medication was not necessarily studied for that condition but over the years they realized that it actually helps in that condition and based on the doctors experience he be prescribed it for that particular condition off-label uses of gabapentin or non-fda-approved uses include fibromyalgia hot sweats and sometimes even I said pre-emptive therapy in acute post-operative pain so they figure out that this person has had a procedure they're gonna be in pain preemptively they may give gabapentin to prevent the pain from occurring in the first place other off-label uses include in the management of hot flashes due to menopause it may also be used in the management of pruritus which basically is itching it can be used also in restless leg syndrome in single toes which is just a fancy name for hiccups as well as alcohol dependence with respect to dosing the extended-release formulations like relies may be given once a day while the immediate release preparations are usually divided throughout the day usually maybe two or three times a day the dose is usually capped around 3,600 milligrams because beyond that you start increasing the incidence of adverse reactions and as well as there is really no proof that beyond three thousand six hundred milligrams you get any additional benefit it is also not uncommon to see that those titrated gradually upwards so say somebody will start with a hundred milligrams at night and then gradually over a period of time as in us depending on how well the person tolerates the medication that doctor be titrated upwards until they desired therapeutic dose next we will tackle some side effects side effects include dizziness which occurs in about 28 percent of the adult population across 17 percent of and about 3% of pediatrics so we're talking about approximately one in three adults experience some kind of dissonance while they take gabapentin others include somnolence which is also predominantly in adults about 21% hypoglycemia has also been observed there are also a host of psychiatric side effects which are usually experienced in the pediatric population this include hostile behavior hyperactivity mood swings and sometimes disturbance in thoughts and like I said this usually occurs with the kids and the occurrence rate is around about 5% of the pediatric population which leads us to the next big one which is suicide ideations some people tend to have suicidal thoughts and I'll talk a little bit more than that when I deal with precautions other side effects include peripheral edema which is accumulation of fluid in the usually the lower extremities we also have the usual suspects nausea and/or vomiting and also some people may experience fatigue or lethargy another common side effects is ataxia ataxia is the condition that mimics being drunk in there is slurred speech that stumbling that's falling and for the most part there's a lot of in coordination some people may also experience breathing problems which I'm going to address more when I talk about the precautions now moving on to the precautions and the very first one that I want to mention is the ability of gabapentin to cause suicidal thoughts typically this happens in pediatrics or kids but it is definitely not completely absent in adults so it is definitely worth taking a load off especially if you are a parent of a child that is taking it to keep a close eye and you as an adult also it's definitely recommended that if you see any kind of mood changes you you have to seek help it is estimated at about one in every 500 people that take gabapentin may experience this obviously to varying degrees the second precaution retrospect together anything is to note that it has the potential to be habit-forming it actually has the potential for abuse as a result a lot of the states if you are watching this here in the United States though it is not a federally controlled substance a lot of the states are pushing to make it a control substance just for that reason and in one of the states where I'm licensed now in Virginia I know for sure that gabapentin is not a controlled substance so that is something definitely to be worried of whenever you start taking gabapentin thirdly it is recommended not to discontinue gabapentin abruptly anytime you want to go of gabapentin do you want to work with your doctor or your healthcare provider because they will most likely taper you off especially if you are taking it to prevent seizures may result in a condition called status epilepticus where you have continuous seizures so that is something to be very careful about not to discontinue gabapentin abruptly or as we say don't stop it Coulter also as recently as December of 2019 that's just a couple of months ago depending on when you are watching this video the FDA came out to put out a specific warning about gabapentin affecting the breathing of people who are already at risk of breathing problems such people include people that take other opioid medications concurrently or any kind of medication that affects the central nervous system as well as people who have COPD for such people definitely work with your doctor they may be some dose adjustment needed or they may be you know some way forward so that you don't find yourself in a situation where you have breathing difficulties due to taking gabapentin I'll put a link to that specific warning from the FDA in the description below so if you care to read about the whole thing it gives a whole lot of guidelines what to do what not to do so that's gonna be in the description below now if you become pregnant while taking gabapentin would be a good idea to talk to your health care provider about registering with the north American antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry this is a registry that is set up to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs you know you're in pregnancy so it's free to join you there's a lot of information there I'll put a link to the website in the description below as well if you are interested there's also a phone number I'll put a phone number there as well so you can check it out so that's a high-level overview of gabapentin feel free to leave your experiences in the comments below if you

you guys it's L and happy skincare Sunday I hope you guys are having such an amazing weekend and getting ready for the week to start so today we're gonna be talking about another ingredient of the week that might be actually something you guys have either heard very little about or you don't know anything about it's a little controversial and it's actually CBD oil and it's really really interesting and I really wanted to break it down for you so if you want to know more about that hit that subscribe button and let's do it all right so I hope you can hear or maybe you can't but it's raining outside right now and again you know on these type of things where we just sit down and chat and have some girl time I like to sip on my door and just look out into the beautiful stunning gorgeous world that we live in and so I hope you don't mind if you can hear the stunning rain but it should be quite soothing okay all right so this probably this ingredient probably took me about four to five hours to research because there is very little known about this but yet so much conversation about CBD oil now CBD oil if you don't know is a cannabis product I have all of my notes right here written down this is probably the most notes I've had for any one ingredient Sunday video and so just so you know CBD oil specifically is what they say is it's non psychoactive so there is no need to freak out and think that this is going to get you have a mind altered state this is it has been stripped away of all of those ingredients that would cause that type of reaction a CBD oil is been kind of coming into the world of skincare and you will I promise you you will see so much more about this product and about this ingredient in 2018 as well as in 2019 I know firsthand that there are some really cool companies coming out with this product in it or this ingredient in their products lines are kind of based around this whole CBD oil and all of the skin benefits now I will start out by saying that there is there is like one of those things that has just kind of hit the market and people are just starting to be really excited about it so there's being research being done all over the world daily about the benefits of taking it internally as well as using it topically I am NOT going to even touch taking it internally there is needed much more research to really find out what the benefits are there are really cool claims about taking CBD oil internally and I will let you do your own research I've actually looked into it as an anti-seizure medication for my daughter but again talking to her neurologist there just isn't enough information available to really have them prescribe this as something that somebody needs to be taking internally so my fingers are crossed that this will come to light in the next few years that it is something safe and effective to take internally but for now we're gonna be talking about using this on adults topically in a skincare routine so a lot of claims and research has been done about the effects of CBD oil in products now so just so you know why our skin will react to this type of product is because our skin actually has receptors for cannabinoids the same way that our brain does and it's a very kind of complex medical type of information but we do have those receptors in our brain as well as in our skin and that research is just now kind of starting to get underway like I've said CBD is a compound found in the hemp flowers okay so they extract that oil out of the actual flowers of the all right that's where it comes from so CBD oil can be derived from hemp but they are made from different parts of the plant and so they do different things to our skin so you have seen for a long time hemp oil hemp seed oil and a lot of skin care but we're not talking about that we are talking about CBD oil so it's taken from a different part of the plant as well as it does different capacities in the skin to affect the skin so some of the really great things that you can use on the body with CBD oil is muscle pain so my husband has a really bad back and we actually started using CBD oil on his back and it has helped him quite a bit it also can help soothe the skin it also can help hydrate the skin when it's in body lotions or in it's true oil form some more claims of CBD oil is that CBD will help with basically itchy skin and inflammation which is all sorts of things like psoriasis eczema and allergic dermatitis so that is really exciting for people that have those ailments it is also said to be one of those miracle products for people that suffer from acne so acne obviously is an inflammation in the skin so it happens when there's too much fatty acids and bacteria on the skin but CBD oil can actually help with acne and there's been a lot of studies done with CBD oil and acne and the amazing benefits of this product for specifically acne so one facialist actually out of New York said that this is the new argon oil of the future there are so many amazing claims also to about an anti wrinkle cream so it helps really plump the skin smooth the skin it's really all about hydration and hydrating the skin and really protecting it actually her according to Philip Blair he's an MD for he's a medical adviser for a CBD oil company but he is a obviously a medical doctor he treats patients with sea the oil the time he actually says that CBD can outperform a vitamins C and D as an ox antioxidant for the skin what so I'm really interested in hearing more research about this it also a CBD oil this is gonna get into a little medical too much medical that I don't want to speak on too much because I don't not a medical professional but we do have an endocannabinoid system inside our body okay and that's why we have those receptors now taking or applying CBD oil on our skin can have all of these amazing benefits anti-inflammatory hydration moisturization helping fight bacteria for acne dermatitis psoriasis eczema but it also can support that endocrine that endo cannabinoid system which actually regulates a lot of parts of our body which is amazing also to I wanted to say that CBD oil also has been known to come redness on the skin as well as has really strong antibacterial properties to it so that is something that's why it's so great for anybody that's suffering even like with rosacea so this would be one of those products that you might want to look into if you have any of these skin concerns because there's so many products out there that you can't use because of these skin concerns there also was done a study by I have a right here the University of Colorado School of Medicine the dermatologists in there actually said that he used it on his hands he has really bad cracked hands from things like eczema and he used it and he has not had a flare-up in over a year so again just a bunch of testimonials that go along with this there are some issues with this being incorporated into skincare is because a the efficacy of the product so it's really going to be hard when you start to see this mass marketed to know how much is in each product how well it's been researched is it organic how well has it been extracted is you know coming from the right part of the plant and all of those things so you're going to really watch it once you start seeing this come on the mass market what you will mark my words um and you just want to make sure that you'd really do your research into the companies behind these products so a couple of things that I want to pull your attention to a couple brands that I found that I really trust I've done again lots of research on this is a brand and actually I've only found one or two is a brand called M G C derma they are actually they come from the pharmaceutical world the creators of this and founders of this it's definitely research based it's definitely a company that prides themselves on kind of being the four founders of incorporating this into all sorts of different types of skincare masks facial moisturizers toners and this again is one of the product lines that I would trust and have done the research to trust them so I'll link them below if you are looking for that type of product and you can trust them with their ingredients there's also another product line by a company called I think it's imbue I am bue botanicals they have an amazing CBD facial cream and basically it is a really hydrating night cream and it will really help smooth out fine lines help with hydration and overall health and wellness of the skin all right so that's another brand I would recommend now I have been trying this brand right here this was sent to me this is called a verified CBD daily skin re energizer it's pure hemp CBD oil CBD daily skin regenerator regenerator or re-energize her I've been using this as a night cream I have really noticed a really great glow to my skin but this product is cruelty free and it's made in the USA Packaging is recyclable all that good stuff and the ingredients look pretty good it has like avocado oil in it as well it also has a hobo oil in it it also has hemp in it the only thing I don't love is that it has dimethicone in it I don't understand why companies keep putting dimethicone in their holistic holistic products okay so that's just something to note it's pretty far down on the ingredient list we'll be honest but it's just something to note for sure I have been liking it so far it's and oh I wanted to tell you a couple of products so if you aren't too sure about CBD oil but maybe you want to try something that is from the hemp family because the hemp family of products is actually really amazing for this skin as well so hemp has vitamins A and E in it also has omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and a bunch of antioxidants so hemp seed oil is fantastic there is a facial oil by a company called Jeffrey James it's called the glow facial oil it has home oil in it buck sea thorn hemp seed oil there's another brand called the Wonder seed which has a hemp facial cream then also to some products that I've actually used that I have no idea is for a company called ardency in if you guys have not seen my review I did of their foundations about two years ago they have a mascara that has hemp oil in it as well as obsessive compulsive cosmetics has their in their lip tars their wanded lip tars they actually have hemp oil in those as well so that's something really cool to note so if you want to get on that train so I hope that this has kind of been a little Education moment you know I love to sit here and really mentor and teach about ingredients that we either have forgotten about or that we haven't heard about or that I feel are going to be on the rise in the next coming years and something to keep your eye out for trying to keep you abreast and ahead of the curve so again thank you guys so much for being here I really appreciate it and I'll see you guys the next one let's love for me to you bye you guys", "vnTyp0lAWb4": "hey folks this is Adam from 911 and today we've got this it's called joy oil its THC free it's a great oil

today's review if you would like to read the full review of this product you would have to visit Green Valley nation website before I start talking in detail about this little pot of gold infused with sea really I would like to share with you some information I gathered about the company love CBDs headquarter is in Suffolk in the UK everyone would describe this brand as a cozy family owned company which was funded founded in 2014 besides skin care products they also offer CBDs price and CBD capsules to make the products they use organic hemp which was grown without use of any pesticides herbicides or actually any harmful substances they are manufacturing the product from hemp supplied by many organic spa organic farms in Europe CBD is extracted at low temperatures through co2 extraction method conveniently love CBD is very transparent company and they publish lab test results online so if you know your batch number of your product you can go online and check the lab report to see how much CBD does your product contain does it contain any THC is probably doesn't but ok you can you can always check for yourself one of the love CBDs skin care product which I have here it's a cannabis infused balm it is called a little pot of gold by the members of love CBD it can be used in many different ways it is 100% organic the hemp use for produced and this balm was grown in sunny fields in Slovenia as I told you before it was extracted through co2 extraction it is rich not only in CBD but also other cannabinoids and therapies when I'm looking at the ingredient list I have to tell you this is very clean formula the producer didn't add any water to this product so there's no need to use any preservatives or alcohol all the active ingredients of this bomb are really very good and by many would be considered as a beneficial for your skin cannabis infused bomb is suited for all types of skin even if you have sensitive skin you can give it a try this little pot of gold is available in three sizes in this little pot you can find 300 milligrams of CBD luckily you don't have to use much of it before we get into specifics of this product I would like to quickly discuss with you the lab test results as I told you a moment ago they do publish the lab test results on the website so it's very convenient for all customers what I did is that I checked a batch number it's batch number 13 and I just go online to check their report the report said that there is 100 milligrams of CBD for each 10 milligrams of the products so this is 40 milliliters so there are 300 milligrams of CBD I have also found out that this product contains 0.03 8% of THC this is not really significant amount you don't need to worry because even if you put a little bit of civilian fuse bomb even if it contains a tiny tiny amounts of THC it actually doesn't go to your bloodstream out of curiosity I also decided to check lab test results for other batch numbers and I'm very happy to inform you that high quality of love CBDs products stays consistent on the love CBDs website you can find also lab report for heavy metal content samples were tested for presence of mercury cadmium lead and arsenic company claims that they get they hemp from organic farms and this is true yes the lab test results proved that the tested samples do not contain any significant amount of heavy metals now when we know that this is really high quality product let's talk about it a little bit more so as you can see it comes with a cardboard box I really like the colors it's a light brown and a little bit of the green on the cardboard box we can find information about the ingredient list also how much CBD it contains and we've got here information that if that the hemp was grown in Slovenia we also have a sticker with the batch number but it is also on a product itself as you can see for yourself this is very cute little jar you can get it smaller you can get ten gram jar but you can also get it a little bit bigger meaning a 100 jar I got something in between which is 30 gram jar it is made well this part actually is made from transparent glass so it is a little bit heavier and for example plastic one but I think that it's good that is recyclable and here I have the lead and at the beginning I thought that this lead is made of bamboo because it has it has that sort of design but unfortunately this is just plastic and now here you can see that that this product is it's a little bit green yes this is green and of course their consistency is it's very stable so you can even keep it like this and you can be sure that nothing will happen to it okay so I've taken I would say that I took a lot on my finger really because that amount of the scream of this balm which will actually last you a lot you can put that directly on your on your skin and you can nicely nicely put that on your skin I don't know if you can see you see I've got a lot of it it would be enough to cover two of my forearms yeah and also my hands so I have to warn you that it will take a while until it actually soaks into your skin so at the moment your skin might feel a little bit sticky a little bit I don't know unfresh but it all will pass and after few minutes your skin will be soft and it will still smell wonderful because this bound is so thick I think that it will even the small pot it will last forever and the great thing that it's so small is that you can take it everywhere even if you are just taking small back it can always fit into your back just remember not to put too much on your skin because then it will take even longer before it gets absorbed if you are a huge fan of natural skin care products you're gonna love this product as well because it contains as I told you before natural ingredients so besides CBD we also have here coconut oil she about her and yeah rosemary vanilla this is really good product of course it's designed for your skin but who don't also put a little bit on my face and I must say that it works wonderful and it doesn't clog pores on my skin I remember that one time I put too much on my face and my skin on my face unfortunately started to sweat a little bit I guess that it was just too much however I have to say that after using that products my skin feels very hydrated just nourished in general this product is good for many types of skin but also you can use it in many different ways and usually when I'm having that in my in my back and I feel that for example my my lips are a little bit dry I can always put just a little bit of it a little bit you can barely sit and just put that on my lips and this is really good lip balm even though it's not really a lip balm you can use it that way okay I think that it's been several minutes since I put the bomb on my on my arms and on my hands and I must say yeah it feels very nice it might still in some places feel a little bit greasy so again we're gonna give it a few more minutes to work time to my final thoughts about love cvd first of all I really love the company I really like the fact that they are publishing they lab results online which makes it so easy for me to just check I check the quality of the product and is it does it contain really what it says on the label and this jar is very cute it's gonna last for a very long time so I think that it is a really good value of money and it really it really smells wonderful so it keeps it even I would say relaxing ethic of course your skin loves it because it feels moisture it feels hydrated it feels nourished but also you feel relaxed just by using it do you have any other skincare products you would recommend me to try I would love to hear your opinion please write a comment comment down below letting me know if you ever tried this product or maybe you have some questions or maybe you have some recommendations for me what I should try next if you liked this review please remember to subscribe to

we're gonna have a look at their kids specifically these Lumiere kiss from Hampshire these have been specifically designed for vape and CBD Isles what makes them different is important at a lower

are fantastic I'll only four ingredients in these it's a hundred percent natural there's no THC there's no nicotine these are great they taste great I make these two fantastic logon to nature linked already now and get yours", "KbsD6ysxCiM": "hey everyone my name is kat and i'm here with another cbd product review you guys seem to love my cbd reviews so here's another amazing one so this one is by the brand cbd living previously i did a video about the cbd living for pets today i will show you the cbd living human products that are also vegan so the three products i will be talking to you about are the teas we have the coconut herbal loose leaf tea and we have the chai turmeric loose leaf tea and then we also have the tincture this is my favorite so when you're shopping for your different cbd products you might be overwhelmed with the different options available so there are cbd isolates and then there's full spectrum and then there's broad spectrum once it used to be thought that cbd isolates were the best ones but that has since been debugged now experts recommend that you get a broad spectrum cbd blend so the reason for that because the main difference is that full spectrum has trace amounts of thc which is why the broad spectrum can be sold in every state so you want to get the broad spectrum if you don't want to test positive potentially on a drug test you know it could mean your job another important factor when using your cbd products such as a tincture is that you want to place it under your tongue you want to do it sublingually so that it can be absorbed quickly and efficiently into your bloodstream another thing you want to do when you're taking cbd products is to make sure you're getting omega fatty acids or just eating it or taking it with some sort of fat to really maximize the absorption such as nuts or avocado so for example the teas that they have they all contain nano particles of cbd so they use a nano emulsion to make sure that the cbd is soluble and stable so they make it smaller than 100 nanometers and it absorbs readily so for these things to be more fully utilized do take it with some fats so another amazing thing that i love is that they are non-gmo can you see that vegan gluten-free thc free and they use that nano emulsion technology so i have a wonderful story and experience to share about this tincture as a wedding photographer i use this before a big event when i know there's going to be high stress environment or something like that this is a gem and plus it's so convenient it just fits right in your bag another occasion that i saw at work miracles is when i was in the vehicle driving to the ceremony with the groom and he was having this like mental emotional you know meltdown he was kind of nervous and i offered this tincture for him and you know it's contactless so you can just really just without touching just squirt the few drops under the tongue and um he sprayed like good four uh pumps and he felt like within 10 minutes you could see his energy change he felt so calm and he was thanking me he said cat i feel so much better thank you so much that really works cbd living has a really wonderful collection of t-shirts so this is their smallest one this is a hundred micrograms and then they have up to ten thousand micrograms so if you really want some strength they've got that so while we have been making this video i've been brewing this chai tea with the cbd in my french press and i'm going to try it for you guys i've been drinking the coconut one and that's really really tasty if you like that tropical vibe they pretty much taste like how they smell and they're just such beautiful teas they have all these beautiful um pieces too so if you just like looking at tea these are beautiful teas cheers oh that's perfect and a little sweetener with maple syrup goes a long way this is so good you guys all right guys so if you are looking for a high quality and affordable cbd brand with lots of vegan options check out their website i'm going to do a little screen recording here of their website because there's so many vegan options it's insane so you can see here they have gummies they have sparkling water they have regular water they have muscle products for your store muscles they have the tinctures they even have sleep aids they have bath bombs even a suppository they have some loose leaf tea they've even got coffee and golden milk bath salts lotions and hand sanitizers energy shots pet products i did a video on their pet products which i'll link it right up here if you guys are interested in checking those out they work wonderfully for my cats and um what else they have they have amazing stuff like dabs i don't do dabs but you know those who like shatter or dabs or whatever those are they've got those and they have looks like these new vapes i'm totally impressed i'm really impressed i feel the benefits i feel it working i will be using cbd for the rest of my life because i just find it to be such a wonderful tool at wellness and and my well-being and i want to share that with the world and i hope you guys give it a try you know these times are very trying you know we've got the holidays and the new year this is a tool you know it's a wonderful tool for me to really center myself and ground myself and come back to life so i

Catherine certified nutrition consultant with foods that heal you and I just did a review on our heme CBD salve and in this video another new product we have is face serum and I've been using this for about a week as well I don't know if making me look younger yet or not but I love it I did some research to find out what's the difference between lotions face lotions eye creams face serums there's oh my gosh there's so many things out there so I like to just have one base I like to keep it really simple and what I love about this face serum is it's all-natural has a ton of different herbs and essential oils in it that are anti-aging moisturizing there's no chemicals at all and it's simple it's the only thing I really have to use now I don't have to use face lotion eye cream all this other stuff I just use the face serum and I'll have a link below my video on directly to this face serum but I started doing some research I use witch hazel it's just really inexpensive I kid up for Walmart but I use witch hazel first and that kind of tightens your skin and clean you know players out the bacteria just use a little cotton swab you can look that up like I said at Walmart online but that's which a is the left side you first and then I use the face serum and I just put a little bit in my hand one squirt I just do one pump stuff goes a long way and kind of dab it on the problem areas you know the wrinkles that we all want to get rid of and then rub it in and like I said a lot goes a long way and then I was pretty excited this might kind kind of sounds silly but I also read that vitamin E and some of the herbs in here can help with eyebrow growth in my eyebrows as I've gotten older are getting thinner I don't know what's going on but anyway so what I've done is started using on my eyebrows so maybe one of my future videos I'll have more eyebrows no I probably shouldn't bring it to people's attention but I just think it's kind of funny cuz you know I'm gonna get whatever benefits I can out of this stuffs because I don't want to have a cabinet full of I serum face serum lip serum this Mac it just gets overwhelming really I'm a super simple person so if you'd like to

middle concentrations in our full spectrum a daily line of internally taken oil products and it's going to dispense you 17 milligrams of CBD per dose if you're taking it in the amounts you have right there on the side of the bottle now this is an MCT coconut oil formulation which is gonna allow for this natural and long-lasting effect of CBD over time perfect for our everyday users of CBD we also have some beginners that like to come to this bottle wanting to start off at a little higher amount we usually recommend slow and low but everybody's different so we've definitely had some people that are needing that from a bottle like this now if you wanted to find a written version of this concentration breakdown feel free to go to the description tab of this product on our website to find it there but we'll go ahead and go into that for you now so on our dosage scale we like to use two different kinds of measurement one of them is the dropper which actually you're gonna see written right here on the side of the bottle and this particular one that is 17 milligrams of CBD now to get that you want to start from a totally empty dropper so we just completely empty this out and press as hard as we can making sure we're really squishing every single bit at the top of that and press that down in and let go and you're given the exact dosage that we have on here on the side of the bottle once again in this particular bottle that is 17 milligrams now if we wanted to break that down further how we do that is in drops to get a drop to happen you need to give it a slow steady press allow those to form and fall and give maybe a second or so between each one gives it a good amount of time to form up and make sure that they're very consistent okay now in this particular bottle one drop is going to be point three seven eight milligrams of CBD not very much so we like to break that down in the following ways for you about three drops of this so three drops in that slow steady drop form that we said is getting you approximately one milligram of CBD six drops is going to get you roughly two milligrams of CBD and if you wanted to go a little further 14 drops will get you about five milligrams of CBD once again if you wanted to find a written form of this just feel free to go the description tab of this on our website and you can found this written down there for you everybody's body is different everybody's needs for CBD are different but this bottle consistently is used by folks getting a consistent and normal dosage of CBD it really is allowing for a lot of people to address an incredibly wide variety of health challenges CBD L internally is allowing for your body to regulate and heal in its own natural way once again this is the 500 milligram

but before i get into those specifics it's important that i explain how cbd dosing works first off everyone is different and you can't compare yourself to someone else just because someone takes 30 milligrams or even 50 milligrams a day doesn't mean you need that much tolerance will vary from person to person and it comes down to several factors these factors come down to how your system responds to cvd your goals and the reason for using cbd the product type also makes a difference because the bioavailability is different from one product to another and most importantly the quality of the cbd extract makes a huge difference bioavailability is something we'll cover in another video but to give you an idea when you use cbd oil drops you put the oil under your tongue which the layer is very thin and there are blood vessels there which allow the compounds to be directly absorbed there compared to eating cbd gummies which go through your intestines and then your liver so some compounds do get lost in the process however both ways are a great way to consume cbd so i don't mean to discourage you from taking cbd edibles but it does make a slight difference and it's important that you know that this image that you see on the screen is from a study of the duration of effects between smoking and eating cannabis cannabis and hemp are very similar so this chart still applies to cbd as you can see inhaling cbd by smoking has a much higher bioavailability and faster response than consuming cbd by eating something as you can see on the right the effects stay in your system for a longer period of time but have a lower potency start low and increase dose slowly while high doses are well tolerated and have literally no side effects unless you take extremely high doses we always recommend starting low such as 10 or 15 milligrams and working your way up because your body probably doesn't need that much cbd to work we're going to talk about how cbd works in the human body in another video but it's very important that i quickly explain how cbd works so you can understand the process it undergoes in our system our body produces endocannabinoids and endocannabinoids are receptors that react to cbd such as anidamide and that is known to increase pleasure and happiness or the trip v1 receptor that has to do with pain sensation and when cbd is in our body it either increases or inhibits the supply depending on what the receptor is to go back to normal healthy levels so as you continue to take cbd whether that is in the first couple of days or weeks depending on your tolerance and the reason for taking cbd those receptors in the body will begin to function normally so how much cbd should you take if you have light to medium issues this is a good dosing schedule to try start with 10 milligrams or even 15 milligrams for the first three days and let your body get used to cbd and slowly work up to find your optimal dose but i am confident that with a good quality product you will notice a difference even at those low doses if you have a serious condition or your body just happens to have a high tolerance for cbd then by all means you can start from 20 to 25 milligrams per day and work up towards 50 milligrams or even 100 milligrams but it's very important to know that tolerance can build up and you may not notice the same effects or even no effects at some point but that's just because you built a high tolerance for it if that's the case then take three to five days of not taking cbd or just cut your dose in half and you'll notice the effects come back after a couple of days like i said this is completely normal and why high doses aren't necessary this image that you'll be seeing is based on our recommendations and also a mix of gw pharmaceuticals recommendations for cbd dosing if you don't know gw pharmaceuticals they're the first cbd company that got approved by the fda for epilepsy in 2018. as you can see if you have a non-serious to semi-serious case then 10 to 40 milligrams per day is enough if you have semi-serious to a serious case 30 to 100 milligrams per day would do the job anything higher in our opinion is not necessary but we still wanted to include a mix of gw pharmaceuticals recommendations try it before going to bed the best way to figure out your tolerance levels and to see how cbd affects you at a certain dose then take it 20 to 45 minutes before going to bed if you don't feel sleepy or getting a better night's sleep then increase your dose by 5 to 10 milligrams the next day if you notice that it's working very good then you've pretty much found the right dose to take if you notice that after a couple of days or a week of taking that dose that you don't sleep as well or you feel the same then reduce your dose or take a couple of days off from cbd and let your tolerance reset be consistent we can't stress enough how important it is we gave you a glimpse of how cbd works earlier but in short it takes your receptors back to normal healthy levels so taking it consistently every day you will be replenishing your receptors constantly and over a period of a couple of days or weeks you'll notice the real benefits of cbd some people see the results they want in the first couple of days while for others it may take up to two to four weeks so it's really important to be consistent and patient what is the biphasic effect and why it's important the word biphasic simply means two phases cannabinoids have biphasic properties which means as the dose increases the effects do not necessarily improve as you can see from the figure as you increase your dose the effects become more but higher doses produce diminishing effects after a certain point in general smaller doses of cbd tend to stimulate the body much more effectively than higher doses lastly quality matters when it comes to manufacturing cbd extracts many variables make a difference such as the hemp flour used the extraction method and how well it was purified to retain as many cannabinoids and terpenes as possible with the least impurities i'll dive into this subject in another video but it's worth it to understand when it comes to purchasing cbd when purchasing cbd products make sure to do your research on the company and only purchase full spectrum or broad spectrum cbd products over cbd isolate because these spectrum products contain other cannabinoids and terpenes that not only have health benefits like cbd but they work together to enhance the effects while cbd isolate is purely cbd without any other essential compounds just to recap everyone is different so do not compare yourself to someone else consistency is key to seeing the real benefits of cbd test your tolerance levels by taking it before going to bed and lastly quality matters now before we finish i just wanted to say you guys can always use our product finder quiz where we ask you three simple questions that will

pain cancer radiation burns acne you're talking about circulatory issues you know especially for the for the folks out there tell us the science how do these oils and lotions work you know especially for such a wide variety of issues so my understanding of it which is limited because there hasn't been enough studies yet and I can't wait to learn more about how these actually work but my understanding of it is that the cannabinoids respond to your peripheral nervous system your you have an endocannabinoid system which we as humans have this yeah every human has an endocannabinoid system and it's kind of a regulatory homeostasis system and there's two kinds of receptors there's cb1 receptors which are in your brain and those are the ones that mostly respond to THC and that will give you these psychedelic or a psychoactive you know experience and then you've got the cb2 receptors which are found in your peripheral nervous system and they deal with you injure yourself or you if you have pain they will interact with either your own natural endocannabinoids that your body produces or cannabinoids from cannabis so the topical seem to work with responding to the cb2 receptors in your peripheral nervous system the THC doesn't act actually go into the blood I'm pretty sure I've done like a bunch of drug tests on yeah at least for now is that you're not going to fail a drug test you're going to feel psychoactive effects yeah and so people typically don't feel any sort of psychoactive effect it doesn't seem to get into your blood system it just seems to interact with these cb2 receptors so dealing with the issue right where you put the SAP or the topical on the skin and these cb2 receptors will help the healing response and will help bring your body back to homeostasis once they connect you know with the cannabinoids", "Qqm0eS5nKmw": "okay so in my current attempt to worry less and experiment more I'm coming out of a sixteen and a half hour fast into this is a candy bar with a hundred milligrams of THC see how it is okay so when you finally wrestle with the childproof packaging which is also micro proof you get this it's a pretty little gold bar it's pretty being that this is the first carbs I've had in a few days it's actually really good you actually don't get a hint about cannabis flavor and who raped you oh no how far hundred milligrams are gonna take me cuz I believe I have a pretty high dollar okay so it has been one hour since I had my candy bar and while I wouldn't say that I feel high I I feel good there's definitely an edge gone a little bit of a body low I'm very uh positive okay now it has been to two hours since I ate my candy bar and now yeah I'm high I'm very tingly and they calm my body weighs a lot it turns out that 100 milligrams just write him out for me okay it has now been three hours since I ate my candy bar now I'm feeling just absolutely fantastic you'll notice the we're on the road because we've had to go buy 20 cheeseburgers I love you okay so 100 milligram bar we're probably five six hours now when I lost count awesome I really think I could even help my dosage coolest thing about all this is just the availability of something like this it was $25 at the dispensary the fact that something like that exists at the dispensary that you can go to the store and buy weed is just a mind-boggling

"vAd2MnnDEn4": "hey guys welcome back to our channel if you're new here I am Judith and today's video I am going to be eating a hundred milligram edible for you guys I did get this on 4/20 and I am barely going to eat it with you guys just because I don't know it's been in the fridge it's been getting cold and I thought why not do it today today is my day off so your grocery and yeah so I'm gonna consume this a hundred milligram edible for you guys and see what it does to me I am a huge smoker so I don't know if it would hit me as much but honestly it probably will because edibles hit different than smoking like honestly honestly if you eat edibles they will hit like major but yeah so I'm gonna eat this for you guys hopefully I don't feel like I'm dying and then from there who knows this video will probably be a short vlog and yeah I'm just gonna go about my day on an edible and see the effects of what happens so let me set the camera for you guys and then open this oh so I am in my little sister's room I am at my mom's house and yeah there's nowhere else I'd rather take a hundred milligram edible than my mom's because if I freaked out which I probably won't but if I freaked out my sisters are here and my mom is here and everybody is here so if your girl feels like she's dying everybody is here hominy yeah yeah so let me set this camera up for you guys and then let's do it okay you guys I'm so mad at myself because I literally broke the freaking edible and I didn't want to do that I wanted to show you guys exactly what it looked like and your girl is just not paying attention if you guys have ever tried these let me know in the comments down below and what you guys thought about them so I've tried these before they were good and let's do this again so here we go I'm gonna break this seal for you guys know it's childproof it's childproof you guys it doesn't even have a little cut for you to follow do you have scissors money so you legit might need a knife or some scissors to open the packaging which is always good that's like an a-plus because if you have kids or you have little adults around you don't want them to easily access these things because yeah Oh Jax is sad he's crying outside right now but I don't want him inside because he's just gonna he's just gonna bark and do odd things possible but he's sad because jenna so just dipped or she went somewhere I'm not sure but okay so I went ahead and cut it open I'm sorry my nails are a little rough right now one is really bitten your girl has been super anxious and nervous and if you know me you just have a lot of anxiety sometimes and believe it or not I get and I get anxiety attacks and it's just a struggle you guys so if you guys know what they feel like or you guys are also going through the same thing I hope that you guys are doing everything possible to just stay calm and everything is gonna be fine you guys I always try to remind myself that but anyways it smells so good these are dark mint chocolate bars and they legit smell like dark mint chocolate they really do you guys let me push them it to the front they literally broke it in there I am so upset with myself but they still looks so good okay let's do it I'm gonna eat the whole bar you guys so let's do this they are look look at how they're packaging for their chocolate is like go ahead and hold that for you guys look at that it literally tells you the milligram of each little bar that is crazy I don't even remember eating the other one and I don't remember being this excited about having the milligrams on the bar I don't know I guess yes yes if you guys how do you say it um if you guys are dosing or how would you say I money you just oh yeah mone is smart she okay so if you are micro dosing and you are a big believer or a big person who does micro seeing these are exactly what you need but let's do this image it tastes like dark chocolate man mm sorry 20 milligrams yeah 820 milligrams right there let's go ahead and eat oh my god I'm such an idiot you guys and you guys are not telling me so apparently it doesn't give you the milligrams on here I just assumed that they did but no it doesn't it actually says THC on the bar d\u00f6 oh my god I'm either dumb or I'm blind you guys I'm so dumb but it does say THC on them on the packaging and lets you know that each bar is 10 milligrams so I just assumed that that's what it was on that's what was written on the bar but you know what it's still cool it still lets you know how many milligrams each little bar is and honestly dude the reason why I like these is because ok 30 more milligrams and then it's 50 milligrams total and you can't argue with that [Applause] and I got this one this one didn't break yeah so this one didn't break you guys and 15 milligrams for this little bit is yes yes I love edibles that are tiny but they pack so much like a little brownie that's 100 milligrams like thighs the best because you don't have to eat as much like it legit gets to the point it's not like you have to eat 50 cupcakes to get 100 milligrams like no I love that they high dose these things so that you can eat less of it but get more of a punch like those are my favorite edibles look 20 more milligrams what is that now 70 milligrams oh my god I'm freaking myself out honey you're gonna be here with me okay my sister said if I feel like I'm dying she's gonna be here with me you're gonna remind me that I'm not dying she was gonna remind me I'm not dying guys honestly I can always have I can always be having a bad day but once I get on camera for you guys and I talk to you guys I just make a difference I do feel better I do feel the best I could be sometimes but yeah like I really like being here with you guys you guys motivate me of course I do want to do big things when I'm older I hope you guys stay to see what the [ __ ] that J and J twins are gonna do in the future my sister has a boyfriend and they're hella cute you guys so shout out to all the couples out there especially my sister's relationship because he is so nice you guys like so next so nice oh hi there any more milligrams and that's gonna be a total of 100 milligrams you guys so recently hmm yeah I would buy these again mm-hmm yes mm-hmm so recently I took half a tab with Hubert he took the pool tab you guys I don't know I don't know people could do the most and still survive but me knowing I'm gonna take a full time I know that it's gonna be full-blown everything like everything I'm gonna see God I'm gonna see [ __ ] mythological things everything so I took half a tab right you guys I swear I couldn't stop laughing like I was trying I was trying so hard to keep it together because like I wouldn't look at Hubert and I was just like in my mind it was so funny like to even look at him was so funny like I didn't know I didn't know why looking at him was so funny and while I was doing that I was applying to new things so that I can get my life together and go find better things so I was on my laptop like the laptop looked cool whatever but then I started to realize oh my god oh my god it's hitting like my half tab is hitting and that's why I only take half a tab Jax our guard dog our long-haired dachshund or jealous long-haired dachshund even after the tab was over and we woke up the next morning I even asked him I was I asked him how his tab fell and if he felt it and he said smack - smack but yeah I am my my half tops max I didn't think it was going through because I've never had great oh my god looks so young with short hair so I never like I never really have good experiences with papertabs usually jalisa gets us gel tabs and those are the ones that really really like always boom like and these paper tabs one time we took them and they just it didn't work out so yeah lesson learned gels are my favorite my point is don't be afraid to microdose don't ever feel like you have to eat the whole edible or take the whole tab like no I even take quarter tabs and I feel good I feel like I could take a quarter tab and go throughout my day or take a quarter tab and drink and have a good time so everything is possible you guys don't hurt yourselves but I will come back check up with you guys and see when this hits so I'll make sure to time this for you guys let me check and you're gonna wash my hands because I do not want to lick my fingers so it is currently 138 I will come back whenever these shit's hit which will be in like 30 minutes hopefully or maybe an hour who knows no one ever knows um yeah and I'll check up with you guys and see you later my dude shoutout to jealous because she is hooking it up with some boiling crab but yes but yes okay so it's been like 45 minutes okay you guys so it's 229 now and oh my gosh that's so weird why is it doing that anyways so it's 2:30 you guys and I am pretty faded I don't know what that means that's so weird oh it's doing it's like something the camera can see but not us okay guys so the edibles definitely hit you guys I was watching a really good movie right now called private life it's called private life and I was crying you guys I can't stop oh my gosh this edible is definitely hitting I was watching this movie called private life and if you haven't watched it you guys need to watch this movie like the movie is so it's real and I like that so yeah the edibles this is like 45 minutes after or 15 minutes after so like about an hour it took me to really get the feeling like I am super faded right now you guys like I'm just like deeply in movies right now if you guys want something that's gonna hit you guys should definitely get some wounds and if you like the mint flavor with chocolate this is definitely that so yeah thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video", "b5IMYHzYfd0": "disa no marijuana continue to unfold and for one little boy with a rare skin disorder it's been a near miracle well as 13 first reported last May his family was really in the dark they were desperately seeking some answers well now Darcy Spirit shows us how they are seeing the lights all thanks to cannabis cream for Carter gray that is the sound of relief I just got an oil up ahead a massage from mom that means so much more we first met Carter a year ago he suffers from lamellar ichthyosis a rare skin disorder with no cure that causes dark scales where dead skin cells don't flake off despite corrective surgery Carter's skin is so tight he can't even shut his eyes he's forced to spend most of his time inside but his family is hoping this it's a miracle plan that's what it is just might change that it showed us from the first time that we used it thought it was worth continuing to use when we first brought you Carter's story his parents were dealing with industrial sized vats of coconut oil and making some progress but nothing like what's contained in these small jars creams made from cannabis oil an extract of marijuana how would you describe your reaction when you realized you'd found something that worked I cried oh haha a lot I still cry I still I'll be in the bathtub just scrubbing his back and the scales just fall right off into the bathtub Carter's grandma makes the creams in her kitchen giving her grandson a gift no doctor could completely clear like soft as a newborn take a look at these before and after photos of Carter's back and head no scarring no sign that there was ever even any buildup there at all a dermatologist told them there is nothing on the market that I could prescribe you that would give you better results than what you're getting so how does it work dr. Scott Jacobson says cannabis taps into the nature of our own bodies the endocannabinoid system is found throughout the body in the brain in the immune system in the nervous system as well as in the skin actually skin cells have cannabinoid receptors in them and so putting them on topically you're going to get that action directly where it's needed dr. Jacobson also says cannabis is known to reduce inflammation he's gonna do two for Carter and his family you get oh it's a giant leap forward relieved relieved and eager to find out more about what we can well we can do since our first report Carter story has gone international we have a lot more about his journey on ktnv calm Darcy Spears 13 Action News Carter wandering the district I'm", "8OJ6v23ah6w": "good morning guys I wanted to quickly go over how to calculate milligrams of THC and explain what it is exactly I think this is one worth knowing since milligrams of THC is quickly becoming the new dominant unit of measurement when it comes to trying to discuss dosages just like it's the dominant unit of measurement with prescription medication and a lot of other substances also in legal jurisdictions it's becoming increasingly the standard way to label the dosage up on marijuana edibles and drinkables when we talk about weed traditionally it was always done by weight grams ounces pounds and so on which was very broad and also very standard and in the last 15 years we also started using percent THC to be more precise which describes the THC content of a particular strain per gram and thus its potency per gram but that figure was always expressed as a percentage for example this strain is 12% THC but now we've gone one step further to the milligrams that milligram figure is not as confusing as it seems if you have one gram of weed also known as 1000 milligrams and it's a strain that's 12% THC that means there's 120 milligrams of THC in that single gram why do we need to take things to milligrams because one standard dosage especially when it comes to edibles has been defined as 10 milligrams 10 milligrams of THC is the amount of THC that a relative novice consumer would need to consume in order to feel mild of cannabis effects a mild high so if you buy a marijuana chocolate bar and it states that the whole chocolate bar contains a hundred and sixty milligrams that means that's that chocolate bar has 16 of those standard doses and they're most likely divided into the little chocolate squares in that bar now that doesn't mean that to the average marijuana consumer they'll be able to get decently stoned off of ten milligrams as I said in my episode on tolerance just like with alcohol marijuana tolerance Rises 10 milligrams is really just a measurement for novices for myself I need at least 25 to 30 milligrams and my tolerance is above average but it's nothing special I know super heavy marijuana users who don't feel much of anything until they get to about 50 milligrams but if you're just starting out with edibles 10 milligrams should be your first trial run obviously to control dosage on such like with such precision you have to live in a legal weed jurisdiction because that's the only way you're gonna see the percent THC or the milligram THC vigor expressed in a reliable way on the package so there you go now you know what milligrams THC is and how it might apply to you hope you enjoyed the show if you found it useful be sure to subscribe and hit that like button see you next time", "Ycpkm2BjNb8": "oh [ __ ] coding my name agile welcome to dab gaming TV I'm your host vory and in this video I have a very special edible for you guys personal favorite of mine I'm so glad we found a box of these hiding out my work because these things are [ __ ] fire you guys heard a keep Cola yet if you have it keep an eye out for these products look them up check them out I mean look at [ __ ] color come on this sells itself people are like what is that I want to I want to know more about that item all the time all day long so this to the best of my knowledge it's like some sort of like blue cotton candy blue berry something whatever I don't know I don't know what the [ __ ] flavor it's supposed to be it's delicious it's really really good you guys a lot of cannabis drinks have a heavy flavor in the background this does not this is super enjoyable I've had their their Cola I've had the root beer I've had the orange cush they're all awesome this is the best one so I bought for today it's like that I just I had to swoop I'm not gonna miss out again and neither are you guys so let's get a little poor upshot here hopefully my camera's gonna focus fire guys be one sec let me check the camera here oh yeah we are in focus and let's go in for this poor now I know it's gonna throw up like a ditch but at the same time I just you know I wanted this shot look at that color that's a [ __ ] trip uh-huh it's just screaming blue right looks like something out of Fallout right let's get you a cola or some [ __ ] it's too cool so my favorite thing about this product is not how it tastes but how it hits it says on the bottle 100 milligrams of THC that's like did I I don't know according to whose standards but this [ __ ] hits like a 150 160 even like a 180 would you know if you guys have had a lot of edibles in the industry right now you know they vary greatly 100 milligrams in one brand is nothing and then 100 milligrams in another is really [ __ ] intense this is one of those heavy ones this is one of this ones it's gonna [ __ ] hit you I'm really really impressed so had one earlier off-camera starting to feel it now we're gonna go ahead and consume two more um um I'm getting set to have a great night yeah so let me finish this one with liquid because I think the cold ones gonna be harder to drink but it'll be more pleasant so trade offs Cheers yeah warmer you definitely taste the canvas isn't it but it's still good it's still really really good Cheers mmm that is the [ __ ] spot oh yeah so I wanted to make this one more of like an official review because of how I feel about this product you guys it's really just super nice it's price point and I don't really want to say well we sell it out if you want to check it out we're on weed maps you know check out some stats a dispensaries would keep colas and it's just one of those things where I feel like you get a lot of bang for your buck a lot of canvas drinks are they're pretty expensive this is one of the more affordable ones I found and it just just works and normally doesn't work but it's really enjoyable to consume and that that for me is just a huge win because there's so many edibles out there that you just kind of have to get through or get through it and then it gives you bubbly guts you know like nasty just feeling like it's just too much so much [ __ ] you know it's just cheers to keep Cola you guys are doing it right much respect from dad even just shits fire seriously super fire so you guys can check out the bottle you can see it's a lot of information on it got this story there it says born in Colorado Keith's Cola and all of its products are intended to provide a breath of fresh air into the world of Medicine we infuse each of our products with premium California cannabis we hope you enjoy oh damn you know [ __ ] anybody from Keith Cola sees this small chance of that but you know if anybody sees this you guys as far as I'm concerned you guys have succeeded in what you set out to do this is truly a breath of fresh air to me it's so enjoyable I love selling it love having hot in the sales room just to show people especially people who dab because they have a higher tolerance and they're not that ain't a bull's a lot of times because they're a flavor person and then I can show them this and honestly say hey you're gonna really enjoy the [ __ ] out of it and it's gonna step very high up to a whole other level you know you're gonna feel like you just dab for the first time again or whatever you're not really even gonna smoke that much and they'll be like what I'm like no really for real come back and tell me what you think and they always come back and in life clock you got any more of this one or whatever it's just like it's just one of those things I love I love it it's so [ __ ] good you guys pop this second one shake it up because if you notice stuff does kind of tend to settle on the bottom I've seen that in like all candidates drinks I don't know what's up with that it's just something into the process and how they infuse it it tends to settle out huh but anyway I had to give these guys a rating out of 10 they're getting a solid nine like not to be [ __ ] with I haven't really had anything on their level and when it comes to a cannabis beverage in terms of like like this is this is dangerously good type [ __ ] like I should say that on the pond start slow dangerously good you know it's these are fire so [ __ ] it's something where if we have them in stock it's this gonna be like god dammit here take my money it's one of those situations for me where I like it I like it so much I like it a little too much dangerous Cheers yeah look at that [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna take a quick death because I just got home from work I'm ready to [ __ ] have a dad all right hopefully I can make this little duct work taking a rip out of that Otis today stuff so [ __ ] good there's just not a lot of edibles out there that I can truly truly enjoy yes you guys I understand you feel me let me know down below in the comments maybe there maybe there's something else I need to try tell me what's up my dad you know kind of awkward but is how we do it purity pure THC a dabs Cheers well that hits the spot after a long day alright so I'm gonna save this last one for my day off tomorrow not tomorrow next day for work tomorrow it's been a long week tomorrow is my Friday so at least there's that huh I look forward to having this one I'm gonna finish this one off camera you guys sigh don't rush it too much but [ __ ] this is this is so far I get if you see them

"1wSCMic5Epo": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and on today's review we are looking at a trusty lovable brand one that we reviewed a couple of times in the past and like them every time we're gonna take another look at them in this post and apocalypse world and that is the fine folks at cannabis syrup well mostly for buying folks I think they do some review inflating on weed maps that has me a little peeved but for the most part I do like cannabis quite a bit this is the hundred milligram variety cherry flavored I think we've done grape and chocolate didn't change arena in the best so now we're doing cherry again this is 100 milligrams 10 servings of 10 milligrams each of course we're just going to do it in one I've like canvas syrup every time I reviewed them I find them to be quite potent I think that they are reviewed by s or excuse me they are they used to at least be reviewed by SC labs but I don't see it on here right now but I'll double-check that but independently verified doesn't taste terrible I therefore being unfortunately has a bad texture it it's gonna or thickness it's got like a cough syrup like thickness or at least it used to well let's just go ahead and shut up and open this up and and give it the old-fashioned review here alright almost done with the protective loo balloon okay here we go here is our cherry liquid maybe we could just do it in one gulp that's fine now I do have a chaser here in case things go badly but let's not let's hope that doesn't happen down the hatch did I get it no oh it's like robitussin well it's no good it's not terrible it tastes like cherry cough syrup um but it won't get you uh what's the word for when you do sizzurp I can't remember whatever that kind of crunk is or drunk or [ __ ] up this won't get you that it'll get you high but it won't get you whatever it is like doing coding also don't do coding and I'm done oh well glad to be done with it and guys if you've never tuned in two weeks before you're gonna have to wait a couple more seconds to find out how it's actually going to affect me cuz that's the most important part of the edible review how it makes you feel not how it tastes so I'm gonna sit here stew for the next two hours see how I'm feeling and I'll come back to you guys to let you know thanks for watching wait so I'll see you in just a second this cherry is a real peach that was terrible but this is really good another kind of a syrup another winner ten bucks for this I had a discount to think it got up like seven bucks did it taste terrible it has a cough syrup it kind of flavor as I went over ad nauseam but I'm high I'm still high right out of the sort of six ish kind of range five six someone there feeling good like the format like the syrups it's an easy quick discreet way of doing it this might be the last cannabis we review or review for sometime maybe we'll try some of the higher dose ones because I think they do actually have some like two under or not I've tried that 200 milligrams I think they might have 500 milligrams I'm not sure but maybe we'll do some of those but for the lower doses the 100's the 200s that is going to do it for our cannabis reviews we know they're good now we can concretely say that you can pick up cannabis and feel like you're gonna get your money's worth happy to tell them are happy to give them a good review so again this was the cannabis cherry 100 milligrams from cannabis give it a shot if you haven't already I think you'll be quite happy with cannabis when you do that's going to do it for this review here on weeds guys I appreciate you watching as always and we will see you on a future review peace", "qqK060xvpIg": "[Music] hi there guys so good it's really good to see you welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you make sense of all those millions of seeming products at your dispensary all those bags with all those candies and gummies and cookies and cakes and whatever and drinks how do you know which ones to spend your hard-earned money on which ones did you avoid that's what weeds is here for that's what we're here for and today we're gonna let you know if it appears 100 milligram Rocky Widow is worth your money I don't believe it's going to be this little guy cost me ten dollars for one hundred milligram edible and I think I'm going to wish I spent my money elsewhere the rocky rope again is 100 milligrams from a tap here I've reviewed several that appears before found them to be lacking too severely lacking so I hope this one is just simply lacking and up here I found it to be bad on the really bad to be on the taste dimension for most of their products they taste they have that really astringent app weed aftertaste that it's really bitter and acidic kind of taste so I hope this would taste better because it's basically just a nerds rope I think it looks like the Nerds should hopefully mask the flavor of the gummy on the inside also I don't know I guess the gummy is the only part where the THC actually is and the Nerds on the outside don't have any or doesn't contain THC so you can see it here at standard-issue nerds rope up should they call it the rocky road so I'm going to eat the whole thing in front of you guys here I'm gonna come back to you guys in two hours to let you know if this is actually worth your hard earned money um alright so without any further ado I'm gonna shut up stick this in my mouth hole here we go and there comes the weed taste and that comes stronger I was about to say oh it didn't taste so bad the Nerds are kind of like a cool cruel prank they mask the original flavor I go oh it's sweet and tasty and then you get into the jellied rope and then then comes that after flavor but it is not as bad as some of the other gummies that I've had like their standard gummy bears are way worse way worse tasting so this one for gummy is not bad I can totally get through this one all right you guys get the idea I think I lied when I said I was gonna eat the whole thing in front of you because it's gonna take longer I thought chewy but I won't finish it and I will come after you guys in two hours - what - no that this ed up your rocky rope and I'll finish this little nerves at the bottom - it's worth your money so thank you so much for watching weights guys we'll see you in two hours at pure I'm sorry just not what $10 I'm not high at all 100 milligrams of THC supposedly I have one more at appeared to review and I think that will be my last foray into and a pure in not there any worse than any other like your infused creations or voodoo sours I don't I don't think that they're necessarily and worse they might even be slightly better in terms of taste and consistency well I think voodoo tastes better but maybe in potency consistency in potency but who knows gummies just do not work for me why and and be though your mileage may vary you may gummies gummies may work for you animals manifest themselves weird ways and different people but they are not for me and I would not recommend them to anybody they don't taste good they don't get you high or they don't taste good to me they don't get me high and I just don't find anything pleasurable about them so I'll do my one last at a peer review that I've got and then I am going to say that we have reviewed enough and appear to know that ah that they are not for me and probably shouldn't be for you either okay guys that's gonna do it for this episode and this review here on wheats thank you so much for watching sorry to blast that appear so much here but again it's just done I can't help

to review it again thanks for watching and we'll check you guys out on the next video", "KGWNCeuuYnw": "I have had chronic pain for the last ten plus years and I've tried pretty much everything that Western medicine has to offer the main cause of my pain is enemy tree osis basically my vagina in abdomen area lower back all of that good stuff hurt all the time but to be honest no surgery amount of yoga prescription pill anything that I've tried has helped me as much as CBD has all the products that I'm going to show you today are very high in CBD and have low to no THC so that I can go about my day without being stoned out of my gourd these are the products that I use every day the first one are these premium gel caps it's just 25 milligrams of CBD they helped me so much with getting an appetite because one of my biggest symptoms with endometriosis is constantly feeling sick to my stomach nauseous never wanting to eat next up I have this paper pen from select CBD the reason I really like select is because they have peppermint flavor that for me helps me a lot like I said I'm nauseous a lot so getting this like quick ingestion with a little peppermint flare where I don't have to have the oil in my mouth is like all I can ask for this is called mad ritual it's just a little balm that I use specifically on my abdomen and lower back it doesn't feel as heavy as other bombs and some lotions that I've tried either like and you don't need to use very much of it which is great because some of these bombs can be pretty pricey these are called basic suppositories so it's a CBD suppository if you don't know what a suppository is it's like this little thing of CBD that I put directly into my vagina so it goes right to the problem area during my period or when I'm having a particularly bad in Demetrios this flare this is kind of specific to endometriosis but I had to include them because half the population has periods this is a lotion that I loved from sagely it's just it's called relief in recovery which is why I started trying it because anything that says relief I really like what I love about sagely products is that they smell very natural and they have pretty good ingredients in them and they also go on non greasy very white and they smell nice so it's kind of like you're just putting on like your daily lotion but you're getting pain relief or benefits from it this is another good option for anti-inflammatory lotion this is a really great option for just a day to day especially if you're like me and you're like typing or on your phone all the time I use this a lot on my wrist to kind of help relieve this is just a simple basic CBD tincture I don't really like tinctures because I don't like putting oil directly into my mouth I'm just it's a weird texture thing for me so this one I mix with a drink and do it that way this has taken me a couple of years to figure out what works for me and unfortunately with CBD it is a lot of trial and error but for me all of that trial and error has been a hundred percent worth it because now I use it every day I really look forward to the day when CBD is as commonly used as aspirin because I I truly believe in it and I truly believe in its effects and I think it could help a lot of people", "OsOSuA-hr3M": "hey everyone it's Susan here and you are watching dank Network and in partnership with lief Broadcom we're here to bring you the latest in cannabis news selves verse topicals that is the question but what's the difference are they the same thing or how do they even work so those are just a few questions that we will be answering today so first and foremost you should know that cannabis topicals are a category of hemp product that allow you to avoid inhalation and ingestion they are used on the skin and are usually meant to soothe inflammation pain and skin conditions this category also includes cells now throughout history topicals have been known to treat itchy skin and traditional arabic remedies would even mix cannabis solution with skin and hair serums usually when other kinds of pop products are ingested there's a widespread effect throughout the body however when it comes to topicals the effect of cannabis it's localized to that exact area of application so for example when a topical is placed on your elbow the relief is felt just in the elbow and nowhere else another key difference between topicals and other pop products is that external application does not produce a mental high salv is an ointment and a subcategory of topicals now while other types of topicals like creams and lotions may go on a little thick selves have a more smooth feeling and so next time you have a sore muscles maybe from a tough workout joint pain firm arthritis or itchy skin from eczema rub some topical relief on the area and watch the amazing product go to work and that's the news you can use i'm susan with dink network sponsored by dance wonder Emporium a premier cannabis

someone out peace out twiddles - all my Happy Trails out there by [Music]", "wA5wg8JqoDw": "[Music] welcome back to torpy eyes in today's video i'm going to show you how i make skin cream that has thc and cbd in it this cream is amazing for sore muscles dry skin sunburns and any other type of skin irritation that you might have [Music] this mixture of products is pretty simple but does amazing job for the body all these items can be found at a store nearby you're going to need coconut oil aloe vera gel and skin cream i have a lot of muscle pain and dry skin so this mix of products is fast acting and doesn't leave my skin greasy the first step in this process is to infuse your coconut oil with the thc and cbd this can be done in a few different ways i found it to be easiest using a slow cooker you can do it on your stove top using a double boiler if you don't have access to a slow cooker i picked up this slow cooker at walmart for about 15 coconut oil is a great product to use because it's all natural and has little to no order it's one of the best binding agents for cannabis both cannabis and coconut oil are really good for treating inflammation to infuse the coconut oil with thc and cbd you measure out the amount of oil you want to make then measure out how strong you want your final product to be for my mix i want about a half milligram per one milliliter of final product i'll leave my mix amount in the description below simply put the coconut oil into the slow cooker then add one cup of water the water is added to create a volume for the slow cooker so you don't burn the product then add your thc or cbd you can use just thc or just cb or combine them both just like me it's all personal preference i grew the harley quinn vx4 strain a little while back it's a one-to-one ratio strain which gave me both thc and cbd [Music] i leave the coconut oil in the slow cooker on low for three to four hours then it's time to separate the oil from the canops and water i use multiple layers of chew cloth and a fine metal strainer be sure to use a heat resistant container because the oil is pretty hot i always go with a collab [Music] me once you have the oil in the glass bowl i put it into the fridge overnight this not only lets the coconut oil to get hard but it also separates the oil and water you can remove the hard coconut oil out of the bowl and then drain the water out since i use ice water hash instead of cannabis flour you see my coconut oil didn't get much color to it usually when you use bud you'll get a very green end result now that we have our coconut oil infused with the thc and cbd we can go ahead and mix everything else together for the cream i use a cream that i prefer any cream will do though this one also has vitamin e in it and doesn't leave my skin greasy so that's why i chose it [Music] as for the aloe vera gel this is great for reducing pain and soreness reducing the healing time of burns and it also contains vitamin a and c [Music] since our coconut oil is hard we're gonna have to warm it up a bit so it's easier to measure out i just put it into the microwave for a few seconds once i've measured it out to the proper amount i put it into the blender's container and place it back into the fridge for 15 minutes this is to thicken it up since our other two ingredients are a bit thicker than the oil for this mix i used 200 milliliters of the coconut oil and 300 milliliters of the aloe vera gel you can use all-natural rear from a plant but it may not last as long i've never used the plant form so i'm not 100 sure [Music] time to add the lotion this container of lotion is 220 milliliters so i use the entire thing [Music] i'm using a ninja blender i set it on low and let it mix for one minute i take it out of the blender shake it around by hand then put it on low again for another minute if you want you can add essential oils to the mix but i like mine as odorless as possible i like to reuse the lotion container that it came in and also any editor i put into a tupperware [Music] container [Music] if you enjoyed this video or found it at all helpful be sure to hit that like button it really

psychoactive part of the cannabis plant and the healing benefits that you can gain from that I want to start today with a showing you some products these are topical creams and these creams come in regular strength and extra strength and then I also have a CBD cooling stick so I want to show you some options for healing if you have joint or muscle pain particularly arthritis or if you have sore muscles from your workouts or any other thing you twisted your ankles or a carpal tunnel syndrome for example anything where your joints or your muscles have been affected and you're looking for a non-prescription and non-medicated type of cream or non-pharmaceutical I should say this is plant medicine and I'm going to just simply show you how this is used this is extra strength and the extra strength comes in a little container like this and and really speaking you just apply it like any other cream if I have a little bit of soreness around my joints so I'm gonna take this extra strength and rub it in and generally speaking I feel the relief in about 15 minutes or so and I like to do this in the morning first thing in the morning and then I also do this at the end of the day just before I'm getting into bed you could apply to three times a day in order to feel the soothing effect over the course of the entire day it depends on your schedule depends on how often you want to use the cream but this one works really well you can see that it's not very greasy it's not - it's easy to absorb into the skin and if goes on really nice and there's no scent on this at all so this is an option if you've got joint or muscle pain this is an extra strength CBD cream healing balm so that you can heal topically the other option if you're experiencing inflammation so let's say you have an injury and it's a it's a it's a pain that feels inflamed so there's a bruise it's feeling warm to the touch the other option is to take cooling stick and so this cooling stick you apply it it's in the shape of a deodorant and you take the stick cover off roll it up a little bit and then apply this to your skin and you'll feel a cooling relief almost immediately and then this one also includes a little bit of the smell of peppermint so using regular essential oils this has a cooling effect and also a great way to work through any topical pain so the option is here rather than to go for something from the pharmacy or from the drugstore is to take mother nature's course first is to apply a little bit of plant medicine notice how it feels this I've seen also my clients use if they've experienced some tenderness or soreness after they've done a yoga class and they come out and they have applied some of this cream and in to great effect so I wanted to share that option with you if you're looking to purchase some of these you can click the link below and you'll have access to all of the different products that are available and remember this is CBD so there's no psychoactive effect you won't feel hi this is on your skin and a great way to leverage what we know about plant medicine is that it works very intuitively with your everyone has a different kind of healing benefit and it might just be the next best thing for you happy to help and if you have any questions please leave that here underneath the video and subscribe and like and do your practices about thank you setting um Salima and we're signing off now watch for video number three and four coming up next", "qFPNyuv3pbM": "Welcome back to another video this week I wanted to show you guys how to make your own cannabis lotion So it is a two-part process. I will leave how to make cannabutter in the description box below so you can go look at that video after or before and Super simple to make it's really nice for inflammation, pain it's a lotion it's not a salve there's a lot of videos out there in that say lotion but it's a salve so a lotion is 75% water and 25% oil so it goes on nice and That goes on like a lotion it absorbs nicely and yeah, so we'll get into the video right now So here is the infused coconut oil. I will leave a Description of that in the box below and so what you'll need is 2 x 8 ounce containers. It does make 16 ounces And you'll need two heat safe measuring cups. Preferably larger ones at least one large one you want to be mixing in that one and you'll need two thermometers and a hand blender Rubbing alcohol is super important when you're making a lotion because of contamination. So you want to just Sanitize anything that comes in contact with your lotion including your thermometers forks of the blender The bowl itself, spoons just cover ground so you avoid any sort of bacterial growth And so here is the oil things. We will be using the cannabutter (cannabis butter) I'm setting it to ounces So you'll want to keep the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes, and this just ensures that The oils have properly melted, it reduces contamination and it helps to emulsify. So keep track of the time and a temperature I'm just pouring the oil into the water, but you could pour the water into the oil I'll be using the blender here Just follow the instructions on that and it will be mixing here for a good two minutes on two minutes off two minutes on For a good like 10 minutes and here the consistency has turned into a lotion it is really nice and creamy and So at this point you could try using a funnel. I tried just I sort of mix it a bit too much in a way and not thick so Here, I'm just using my own piping bag. Well a makeshift one and I will be squeezing it into the containers And so the squeeze bottles are the way to go because it reduces contamination That is it on how to make your own cannabis lotion. It's really easy to make it is a two-step process So I will link the video in the description box below and I will link it here As well if you want to learn how to make that I'm pretty good for different types of things I mean, it's just a generally a nice moisturizer for your body, but you can use it on inflammation If you have like any sort of eczema or psoriasis, I personally have psoriasis Scalp psoriasis and it's going on my forearm, but I've noticed that it actually helps with the itchiness. It seems to tame down the inflammation It's good for pain neuropathy pain sore muscle so really broad spectrum use Yeah, it absorbs really nicely the lotion There we go it doesn't go on really greasy it absorbs really nicely The last lotion that I made was specifically for dry hands. So if you do have dry hands like me Check that out really nice video for that. So I hope you guys have a good day And I will see you guys in the next video. Okay. Bye", "d3pNjEWEak4": "hi guys okay so today I am doing a video on my top 5 CBD creams I've been loving the CBD oil but I am training for a 10k which I know is not a marathon but still I run outside and running on the pavement often hurts my knees so I'm was looking for a solution that I could apply on the you know pain area directly and so CBD cream seemed to fit the bill and actually it worked really well and I'm really glad I tried it so I want to share with you my top 5 today so if after this review you want to try CBD creams as well just click on the link in the video description for the best CBD deals alright so in fifth place I put met Tara's CBD rapid cooling cream these guys are for the cream in two strengths we've got the 250 milligram at $44.99 and the 750 milligrams at 70 799 their cream is a blend of CBD menthol and arnica and that's what provides that rapid cooling effect and really helps with joint and muscle discomfort I just rub it on my knees right after a run and it provides instant relief and usually it lasts for a couple hours and then after that the pain is gone for the day also with this one the menthol smell isn't too strong so you can just apply it after a shower in the morning and head off to work no problem and as with all other matera products these guys are 100% natural and organic they don't contain any THC they are made in the US and they provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in 4th place we have nano crafts cooling sports cream this one is $59.99 for 500 milligram which is great if you need an in-between dosage from Matara this one has a pump dispenser like the matera one so that makes it really easy to dose and apply the cream this one is also made in the US with non-gmo all organic ingredients meaning that it doesn't contain any pesticides herbicides or chemical fertilisers etc and they also provide the 30-day money-back guarantee in third place we have another product from nano crafts it's the muscle and joint bundle so this one is great if you're already convinced and want to take it one step further so this bundle includes the broad spectrum CBD soft gel capsules with curcumin these are packed with 25 milligrams of CBD which is perfect for daily and consistent consumption to make sure that you have a smooth start to your day they also have the broad-spectrum pure CBD drops which are also packed with 25 milligrams of CBD another way to consume CBD if you're out of capsules you can just take a few drops as is there ginger sytrus flavored or you can simply add to a protein shake or a post-workout snack and the third product is the broad spectrum muscle and joint stick that's loaded with 500 milligrams a full spectrum hemp oil that's great for on-the-go application if you're feeling some discomfort you know as you're working out outside and that's usually two hundred and fifty dollars but they're selling it for 195 but again if you want the best prices click the link in the video description it gets updated regularly with the best deals alright moving on to number two which is the ultra relief gel from just CBD just CBD is one of my favorite CBD brands they have a ton of product variety to choose from so the ultra relief gel comes at $59.99 for a thousand milligrams of CBD this one is great if you're looking for big CBD dosage at an affordable price the smell is not overpowering the pump makes it really easy to use and you can really feel the cooling sensation in this one I really recommend it for like intense pains so if anything is keeping you up at night then that's probably a good gel to buy and then in first place I chose the CBD infused pain cream so this one comes at 1199 for a hundred milligrams of CBD that's a really good option for like small pains but is also super affordable if you're just looking to get started or unsure about CBD in general then you might want to you know get started with this one and see how you feel and then just work your way up to a bigger dosage this is also a really good option if you're not comfortable with the oil format it's really easy to use and spread on your area of pain I started to feel the effects about 15 to 20 minutes after I applied the cream after my run and then I was good for the day so I really recommend this cream or any of the five that I listed in this video if you've got any aches and pains or just if you have if you often have pain after an intense workout or just starting to feel the effects of age then I really recommend you to try CBD creams and let me know how it goes in the comments all right if you want the best deals for these CBD creams just click the link in the video description and have a great day", "ZLpZxkFB2-8": "[Music] what is up my friends and welcome to wheats the marijuana edible review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary uh and on today's review I've got the spatula the wheat sworn spatula and the trusty jar of Nutella that means that we are reviewing something that does not have fat in it because THC and fat go hand-in-hand so we're reviewing today we are taking our third look I've reviewed two of these this type excuse-me of edible and past Oh or I guess you would call it an ingestible cuz it's not necessarily edible per se so we are taking a look at th C capsules medicinal softgels today this is our look at the pro canna THC plus hundred milligrams 250 milligrams soft gels as i said i've reviewed two caps in the past both of those were 300 milligrams one was pretty good the the if it was delta-9 yes the delta nine capsules were good I enjoyed them they were a little expensive I believe they cost thirty bucks for the 300 milligrams and then there was also I think it was the gold caps which were also 300 milligrams which were 50 bucks I believe and they were completely terrible they didn't do anything at all to me so I've got a hundred milligrams this time so less than the others but this was a more affordable price I guess linearly it's the same price as the delta nine as it was ten bucks for the two of the hundred milligram pack so you know it's the technically the same price but certainly a lot better price wise than the gold caps pretty simple little packaging here just a cardboard box with some you know directions there on the back advising that we consult a doctor before taking pro kanna don't know why doctor is capitalized there let's go and open up see what these look like uh-oh they are weirdly shaped so here we go here is one of the capsules right here in this little package they're ugly little capsule first let's do a little bit of the good old and Nutella my favorite part of all fat-free reviews is getting a nice scoopful a Nutella yum yum yum yum yum yum who doesn't love Nutella heartless folks that's him okay so that should hopefully be enough back for now and let's go ahead and plunk this in forgot to bring my handy trusty Arnold Palmer tea with me so I'm just gonna have to dry chuckle I swallow that's the word for it so let's do it three two one down the hatch got one more here three two one down the hatch okay well so I've had both the pillows now that's 100 milligrams of THC or so they say now in my body with the requisite amount of fat to help activate it now all we're gonna do is our for me I'm gonna wait two hours for you guys through the magic of editing it'll be just a couple of seconds and I'll let you know how these pro can uh THC caps are hitting in just about two hours so thanks for watching guys and I'll see you in just a bit peace [Music] alright guys I am back it has been two hours for me since I had the pro canna THC soft gels and let's do a little ocular test Whitis [ __ ] snow I don't know I want to let me say this right off the bat I want to love THC capsules I love the idea of them I love something that's discreet easy to take doesn't have any calories with it way of ingesting THC but these suck these didn't do anything for me I I mean it's I don't feel high at all nothing so in terms of what I have tried these are down there with gold caps they're not as good as the delta-9 obviously those got me at least you know somewhat high this is just a real [ __ ] product I don't know if it's on me oh and this time I also try it with fats I had had people in the bat before asked me like well maybe you need to try it with fat which I should have done anyways tried it with fat and still no result um I feel like I could you know if I was if I was a gymnast I feel like I could perform gymnastics if I was a mathematician I feel like I could perform some differential equations but I'm just a stupid idiot and I still feel like I can function as a stupid idiot even after two hours on the THC plus from poke pro canna man again guys I cannot articulate enough I would love for these to be the magic bullet you know an easy discreet portable way of getting THC with into your body that isn't either smoking vaping or having to consume something with a lot of sugar and calories I keep hoping for it I I don't think I'll be going back to pro kanna next time I have to review but I think I'm gonna keep trying to find that magic capsule out there to see if any of them work I'll do a couple more maybe maybe they're just not for me maybe there's something about mean that they just I just doesn't work as an ingestion method I would love to hear from you guys if you know any good capsule brands or if they work well for you please let me know leave a comment below or send me an email at wheats at wheats reviews.com and let me know what you think about these capsules because I'm trying to find a great one I'm hoping to find something that you know I can take with me to the airport something I can you know take with me into a concert you know that's not going to draw any attention to itself but so far of the three I've taken this I don't know if it's necessary worse than gold caps but it's not definitely not any better so far if you definitely want capsules stick with the Delta nine they're still not great they're still not my favorite way to ingest THC but definitely skip out on the procane a total dud of a product look at the [ __ ] back there that is the category that it's in and I am now just rambling so with that guys I am going to sign off from this review and that is going to do it for pro canna here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys and we will see you on our next review peace", "qfdpEsrfu84": "[Music] give me a w w give me an e e give me an e e give me an A hey give me a t t give me an S s what does that spell wait sweet sweets hello everyone welcome to we it's the marijuana review show or we hope you guys make sense of your in dispensary classic classic review today we are taking a look at an edible and a brand I already know that I love quite a bit that is we are taking a look at our freshly legal review of Kiva Kiva their new 100 milligram a THC ginger dark chocolate bar with a hundred milligrams of CBD as well as you guys probably know if you tuned in often I'm not much of a CBD guy um but I am a THC guy so this one's a little bit more expensive than the standard Kiva because of the addition of the THC everything that cost me 25 bucks at night dispensary in Long Beach plus taxes so it's quite expensive but I hope it's going to taste as good as all other Eva products are and even most importantly I hope it's going to be as potent as Kiva has been now you can see the crazy packaging and has to go through this Kim in a sealed bag with a childproof seal and then this itself is in a childproof bag sealed and you always have to figure out how to open these and I can never figure out how to open them because I am NOT a smart person it's some point so we're gonna try to figure this out together you do this and that and then you pull away and then you say [ __ ] it and you get scissors that's how that's actually how it works you try what it says on the back and then used to get scissors and then surprise surprise on the inside is the exact same thing with all the pertinent information on it as well it's got lab tested results nutrition information all the good good stuff you want to see on it and that great Kiva minimalist card word packaging I really like their packaging design I'm outside of this unnecessary bag it's minimalist its well-designed and it does the job so I'm excited about this I like ginger like chocolate I'd loved every kiba flavor I've ever had and they've all got me a very very high so let's see if the tradition continues and here we go can't really smell anything just yet each piece contains five milligrams of THC so I guess this is gonna be twenty little squares or rectangles in there and there we are there are our 20 rectangles with some little design on it and oh it smells a lot like ginger that is a heavy ginger scent let's give it a taste it's like a symphony in my mouth and the conductor is weed it's good guys don't know matter that's what much else to tell you um except if you don't like ginger you are not gonna like this because this is heavy on the ginger flavor I happen to be pretty a fan ginger so I enjoyed this the chocolate itself is great quality there is a slight cannabis taste to it nothing overpowering nothing that's gonna make you throw up but if you hate the taste of cannabis maybe avoid but for me please punch mmm okay well I've been in there sixteen rectangles to get through but don't worry I'll finish off all of these and then once I finish off the last one I will come back to you guys in two hours to let you know how I'm feeling okay it'll probably be closer to three because I'm on my way to go see bad times at the El Royale is that the name the new Drew Goddard movie the guy did cabin in the woods excited about that so I'll cut you guys after the movie and I'll let you know how this kiba there are a lot of pieces of packaging here key the ginger dark chocolate bar is hitting thanks for watching weeds guys and I'll see you in just a bit and welcome back to weeds it has been about two hours 45 minutes and change since I last seen you guys and I come back to you surprisingly conflicted about the kiva ginger dark chocolate bar if you will look at my eyes they will tell you I am quite high and I do feel very relaxed very at ease very peaceful however I don't want to say I feel high per se I feel just sort of more easygoing and more relaxed and I might be confusing this I might this might just be a total placebo a factor I've sort of gotten into my own head and the confirmation bias type thing um I have heard however that's for some people CBD counter affects the psychoactive properties of THC and this can make you feel the CBD sort of effects and you know the more relaxing effects of THC as well but not this sort of more whoa man kind of high aspects and I think that might be what happened to me here ah for some people that's gonna be great that is going to be a jackpot that's gonna be exactly what they want for me it's not what I was looking for I was really hoping for more of a the classic head-high experience especially seeing the movie I just got out of Drew Goddard bad times at Hotel at the El Royale something like that I can't remember all those nouns so I was hoping to be really high for that movie because Drew Goddard likes to spend some crazy yarns and said I was just really chilled out and and you know I was a little disappointed unfortunately this is not gonna be the Kiva for me however I am NOT gonna give it a disapproval or I'm not gonna give it the thumbs down because I think for this a certain customer one who perforce prefers the more gist chilled out relaxed style of weed might really love this for me however it's just not exactly what I was looking for not what I was hoping for but that is not Kiva's fault I I knew that that was a possibility going in so just wanted to give you guys that heads-up that the CBD seems to be pretty effective in here so if you love CBD and THC maybe give this one a shot if you are like me and like the sort of Moorhead high this sort of more psychedelic sort of side of I wanna you'll want to stick with the traditional Kiva's which I have no problem recommending wholeheartedly so this one is a little bit mixed for me unfortunately but again that is not not an endorsement or not telling you to avoid it so I'm going to before I bounce here though guys I want to share with you a little cherry on top something that I do not have mixed feelings over and that is another Drew Goddard movie because I did have some similarly mixed feelings to this key lebar about bad times at hotel Royale something elroy out whatever the name of the movie is but his second movie I think cabin in the woods from 2012 is a fantastic movie I'm sure you've probably seen it and I'm sure somebody if you haven't has spoiled it for you but if not check it out it is an utter utter riot one of the most inventive movies and years just an absolute blast love that movie two thumbs up for Drew Goddard cabin in the woods one thumb up one kind of half cocked for the hotel Royale and about the sort of same for that keepa bar I think that sort of sums it all up I'm still pretty high just not the same high I wanted to be and that's gonna do it for real this time thank you so much for watching weeds guys and we will see you guys on the next review peace", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "iwMgD51_zEk": "first off I just want to give a little disclaimer saying that I do not condone the use of any legal or illegal mind-altering substances the contents of this video are created purely for education it's inevitable that there will be people who consume these substances therefore it is extremely important to educate people on the effects and how to properly use them so edible pot is a lot different than smoking it it's more potent it's processed in the body differently and the effects lasts longer the difference with edibles is that the active ingredient the chemical that gets you high THC is processed in the liver before the user experiences any effects the original THC from the edible is converted in the liver into a more potent metabolite 11 hydroxy THC it's estimated that this compound is about four to five times more psycho active than normal THC and because the edible has to go through a portion of the digestive process before effects can be felt it can take 30 minutes - as long as two hours before a user feels any effects because of this people who don't feel any effects after an hour so might want to reduce only to have the entire thing hit them like a train all at once an hour later so my advice just wait it out it may take a while but it will come on and unlike smoking cannabis in which the effects last about two hours and gradually drop off after a quick climax right after inhalation edible pot takes its time before it reaches its peak in effect and this peak lasts longer typically the effects of edibles lasts four to eight hours when it comes to the effects there are certainly similarities between smokeable and edible weed but there are some properties that appear to only occur strictly on edibles there are two main reasons someone would want to consume an edible the first is for medical benefits such as aiding symptom relief of stress or anxiety or to help one sleep and the second is simply just for recreational purposes just to have a high and have a time aside from these two reasons there are actually a few people in the psychedelic community who use edibles and very high doses in a similar way to what one would use LSD or magic mushrooms for but we'll touch on that aspect at the end of the video so now we are going to get into what you can expect to feel from the different doses of weed edibles but firstly it's important to know that tolerance is everything tolerance plays a huge role in your experience and if you're an everyday pot smoker you'll likely have to take a much larger dose of an edible that someone who has no tolerance to THC in order to feel the same effect so take the following effects of doses I give with a grain of salt as this is just generally what you can expect to feel when you take this particular dose so first off we have the micro dose and this ranges anywhere from one milligram to about 2.5 milligrams of THC it's unlikely you'll experience any active effects from this dose but it is possible for people who are hypersensitive to the effects of THC this dose is more just for purposes such as mild relief of pain stress anxiety etc people who Micro's THC edibles might also report increased creativity and focus the effects of this dose are pretty passive you likely won't feel any different fundamentally this can be somewhat compared to people who micro doze LSD and magic mushrooms who do so for similar purposes next we have the low dose which ranges from two point five milligrams to about 15 milligrams and the two ends of the spectrum can be very different especially for people with low tolerance to th see someone consuming the edible for medicinal purposes will experience stronger symptom relief and this dose can also be used for people who have trouble sleeping you may begin to feel a sense of euphoria and that classic high feeling where coordination is slightly impaired and overall perception is altered but if this dose the high is unlikely to be overwhelming and because of this this may be a good dose to try for a first-timer in my own experience there isn't a significant difference between this dose and edible in your average smoking weed high the medium dose ranges from 15 to 30 milligrams someone with a decent THC tolerance still may not be feeling heavy effects here but for many vistas can make them pretty high it's at those dose that people may start to feel negative effects such as anxiety and paranoia you might ask if people use weed for relief of anxiety stress then how could this dose bring on anxiety and stress well THC has biphasic effects which means the substance can have opposite effects in different doses anxiety can be reduced in lower doses but can actually be stronger in higher doses so if you're taking edibles for symptom relief it is important to be aware of these biphasic effects the drug in half coordination and perception will likely be altered at this dose that agree to which it is altered will likely depend on your tolerance some people might start to get the classic red eyes from being high maybe some people experience close eye visuals for me personally I tend to have a close eye visual on low to medium dose weed that looks kind of like this let me know if you have experienced the same type of visual in the comments the high dose ranges from 30 to 50 milligrams this dose will likely bring a significant high even to someone with tolerance and for someone with low tolerance this can bring an extreme high their coordination will definitely be impaired somewhat you might feel a strong euphoria maybe you'll feel very laughy some people's mouths get very dry and get cottonmouth this is due to THC mimicking a naturally occurring chemical called an and amide which binds to cannabinoid receptors in our saliva glands which causes saliva production to decrease you might also get the classic munchies and just want to absolutely binge eat it's important to remember that the effects of THC impacts everyone differently so no two people's high will be exactly the same and you likely will only experience some of the effects I listed not all the very high dose ranges from 50 to 100 milligrams I would say it's more likely than not that you will probably experience some negative effects at this dose but the high may become so intense you may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed people often experience a rapid heart rate panic nausea in headaches at this dose so definitely don't venture into this realm if you don't know what you're doing for someone with an extremely high tolerance this dose might not be too heavy but for the average person this will likely be overwhelming there are still medicinal benefits at this dose but is only used for people who really need it as this dose is sometimes using cancer patients to boost appetite and is also used for people with certain inflammatory disorders personally any dose at this range or above just completely puts me on my ass the come-up is nice for me as I feel very laughy energetic and social but once the effects really start peaking I honestly begin to struggle to stay awake and wish to do nothing else but to find a cozy place to lie down and fall asleep this may have been due to the strain though as THC isn't the only psychoactive chemical we it's just the most prominent CBD is the chemical that aids with sleep and this chemical also plays a role in the overall effects of the weed and the amount of CBD in the strain will most definitely impact your experience and finally the extremely high dose is going to be anything above 100 milligrams I've heard of some edibles having 250 milligrams some having 500 and even some containing as much as a thousand milligrams obviously the effects will get significantly higher as those increases a 100 milligram edible might not be incredibly strong for someone with a very high tolerance but certainly 500 milligrams is going to put anybody on their ass be very careful of consuming edibles this powerful as there will certainly be negative effects due to the intensity it's in these very high doses that have experienced visuals reminiscent of a psychedelic trip on say LSD the visual might be something kind of like this and speaking of psychedelics there's many people who report having psychedelic like trips from high doses of weed edibles the world-famous Joe Rogan likes to discuss edible pot as along the same lines as psychedelics such as LSD psilocybin mushrooms and DMT saying that edible pot can take you down the rabbit hole there's a comment I found from someone on reddit that I thought described as similarity of the psychedelic feeling on high-dose edibles perfectly not long ago I did a hundred milligrams of THC edibles and had zero tolerance on my couch my eyes closed and no music it was awesome and the peak was over three hours I swam through the psychedelic mind a tunnel with many doors and behind each door was a memory of mine I went through them and had Total Recall I could recall past memories memories of being born my first laugh before thinking and the experience that my first thought as an infant the pure thrill of thinking now the effects of THC in the brain is nowhere close to resembling that of a psychedelic classical psychedelics interact directly with the 5-htt to a receptor in the brain and cannabis does not do this from doing research it seems to be that weed edibles tend to resemble psychedelics more often for people who have already had experiences with psychedelics in the past it's likely more often that this psychedelic feeling is also associated with strains with higher THC levels and lower CBD levels as CBDs antipsychotic effects will likely lessen the psychedelic effect but if you find yourself feeling like you're in the middle of an intense psychedelic trip I'll say what I've always said before let the experience consume you surrender to the substance let your mind flow freely and try not to attach yourself to these thoughts just simply observe don't make any attachments so that's about it for this video hopefully you have a better idea on what you can expect to feel by the different doses of weed edibles if you're new start low THC affects everyone slightly differently so see how you react to the substance stay safe consume responsibly and you'll be fine if you seek to support my work on a deeper level consider joining the patreon I run a book club on there where we read one book a month about topics we go over on this channel if that interests you definitely consider joining as always guys have a great day and peace [Music]", "ZL_j5dyk1Q8": "and to share with you the value of incorporating topicals into your medicine cabinet we feel that cannabis topicals and saves are generally underutilized they can be really effective for pain inflammation and skin conditions and the great thing is they're not psychoactive now personally I've used topicals a lot for sunspots and small skin cancers and I've had excellent outcomes there is plenty of documentation of people who've used them effectively for arthritis for joint pain and others use them for skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis sometimes you're going to find that topicals are blended with other herbs oils or products that can really help amplify their effect for a specific purpose here are some things to know about topical use a game psychoactivity is not an issue as the cannabinoids don't enter the bloodstream now they're not magical creams that aren't always work wonders upon initial use consistency is the key so I recommend using them multiple times a day and see if they work for you now it's also best to apply topicals at times of the day when you're not moving around a lot or sweating before bed is a great time and throughout the day when perhaps you're at your desk or just not running around let's look at a few simple topical products now there's really no surprises here what you would expect from any cream or therapeutic topical it's really not a huge difference with cannabis okay now with topicals it's hard to tell exactly how much of specific ingredient is in the topical itself obviously a cannabis topical will contain some cannabis or a lot of cannabis the labels should tell you if there's any other herbs or additives within the topical itself a lot of the time they'll use an oil as a base obviously some producers do choose to combine cannabis with other herbs or plants within a topical er south now we know that a lot of plants are good for medical use and depending on the specific intent of a product they could choose to combine it with an array of different plants whether it's for nerve pain inflammation or an array of other specific uses so just pay attention to the labels and start to educate yourself about both what cannabis is good for for you as well as potentially other herbs is also now let's get acquainted with this topical here notice first of all that they put it in a dark container this helps protect it from the Sun and one thing that I like to do it being acquainted with any product really but especially a Savoie topical is to first just simply smell it our smell is a really powerful sense that we have and it can help inform us about what our body likes about what it about what it doesn't like for example and cannabis actually I can smell it it has a distinct smell okay so you can sometimes even tell how concentrated this topical is with cannabis or smell other products within it now when applying can start liberally but the great thing about topicals is that really there's no psychoactivity you can't overdose you can't really overdo it but I like to start still with topicals start low and kind of go slow up in terms of the application just to gauge how effective they are so I have a chronic injury in my wrist from some impact from a martial art so I'm just gonna rub it on I like to rub it on my joints particularly but you can use it for any array of uses sometimes it can be very effective verts in conditions like psoriasis and eczema and dry skin that's really great inflammation like in my case or pain pain in joints or other areas some people use it like my colleague Chris for cancer for skin cancer and it can actually help with that topical application as well so I'm just rubbing it in smoothly if it's really thick you can combine it with another oil that's fine as well any other lipid-based product you can just combine it with whether you like the smell of it or anything so feel free to experiment and combine it with some other products you may use therapeutically and topically okay do as much research as you can we recommend this with any product that you take but it's really harder to go wrong with topicals and they are very safe so enjoy it enjoy your senses and just see how it affective is for your symptoms and condition", "ODVX4f3eEDo": "[Music] hi there and welcome to the cannabis kitchen today I thought we would make some CBD infused muscle rub so muscle rub is a tough thing because a lot of people have their favorites but a lot of times they don't really know what's in it and so it's nice to have something a little bit more natural and it's also nice to be able to add the benefits of CBD so today we're actually going to be using two different types of CBD it is absolutely not necessary you can use either CB oil or you can use CV flour today we're going to use a little mixture of both just to add a little bit more liquid to the mix so what we're going to start with is our dry ingredients so what I've done is I've got a little bit of cheesecloth here and we're gonna put all our dry ingredients into it and form almost like a little tea bag so that we can drop it into the mixture and it will be a little bit less cleanup later on so what I've done to start actually is I've made a double boiler so I have that turned on and running right now the heat is just on low I just want the water should be hot I don't want it to boil underneath there and boil away on us so now that that is ready to go once we add all our ingredients that will start to melt together and we'll leave it sit for a little while so I have in this container this little glass I have 10 grams of CBD flour and a little bit of shake as well in there so we're just gonna add that onto our little pile here there we go the next thing we're gonna add is some cloves so cloves actually have a slight numbing feeling so that will definitely be a good add to our mixture here so I have I want to say 15 yes 15 clove pieces in here you can use clove essential oil as well I just didn't happen to have any in my kitchen so we're just gonna pop that on the pile the next thing we're gonna add is some cinnamon so cinnamon as you may or may not know has lots of anti-inflammatory properties I'm just using sugar from my kitchen or sorry cinnamon out of the kitchen but you can use cinnamon sticks or you can use cinnamon essential oil this is a little bit powdery but because it's going to be mixed in with everything else I don't think it's going to go through the cheesecloth so I've used about a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder and the last dry ingredient we're gonna add is some red crushed red peppers so crushed red peppers are gonna add a little bit of heat to this mixture so it's going to be kind of a cold hot kind of a feeling once you put it on your skin we're not adding a lot I happen to have an allergy to peppers so I can get away with using a little bit but not very much plus with all these ingredients that we're going to be adding a lot of them anyway they do have some irritants if you happen to rub your eyes or touch other parts of your body things like you like to put it in your mouth or on your lip so a little bit goes a long way so again I'm using about quarter of teaspoon just under a quarter of a teaspoon of crushed red peppers perfect so now all we're gonna do is gather this up as best we can and we're gonna make a little tea bag I guess you'd call it squish this up just like that give it a good squeeze we want it nice and tight there so now what I've done is I've just cut a little piece of kitchen string this is what you'd normally used to like tie a turkey at Christmas or Thanksgiving so we're just going to wrap this around this is just organic cotton so it won't add anything that we don't want into our mixture and leave a little bit at the end so we can tie it just like that perfect there you go so this is all of our dry ingredients ready to go and now we can start to add our wet ingredients the first thing we're going to add is I haven't here a quarter of a cup of melted shea butter I only melted it to get my measurement right but inside you can put it in as a big clump if you want to not a big deal either way so we're going to add that right into the bowl on top here there we go perfect ya know there are also obviously some benefits to shea butter shea butter is full of fatty acids which is really really good for your skin it has a very kind of high concentration so it's actually excellent for your skin but also it has some alien flare anti-inflammatory properties so of course it's the perfect addition for what we're making today the next thing we have is a quarter of a cup of sweet almond oil so sweet almond oil also very good for your skin it contains lots of vitamin E so it's gonna keep your skin nice and soft so we can't leave that out so pour that in just like that see if this will fit in here there's so much air as we can go good so now I'm just gonna add this little tea bag in as well just because we've got some liquid here so we're gonna put that in and we're just gonna kind of get it nice and saturated if we can and then we can get that started perfect all right so the next additions are small ones we've got lots of little containers here now I will put links on the website for all of these things so what we're using is some camphor and some peppermint essential oil we have our CBD oil as well I'm using the aurora and so the other thing we're adding is some eucalyptus oil I didn't happen to have any of my usual essential oil left in the eucalyptus so I just picked this up at the drugstore it's gonna suit the purposes the eucalyptus oil is and 80 and flama thick so like you can smell it in there it's gonna do just fine sometimes you have to just go with whatever you can so we're going to put all these in here there's only little bits of these as well this isn't a super big recipe so we're adding 45 drops of camphor we're adding 20 drops of eucalyptus and 30 drops of peppermint essential oil there now we're gonna add our CBD oil the CBD oil I'm adding is a hundred milliliters so about four full droppers out of your bottle if you have a 30ml bottle go perfect now the last thing we're gonna add is some beeswax pellets beeswax pellets are going to help sort of hold the whole mixture together but we're not using enough to make it back into a solid as these actual beeswax pellets we're using a lot of liquid in this recipe so when we're finished it should actually have quite a nice easy rubbing consistency so we're just gonna drop those in as well and we'll get up that all melting along so this is going to be done the same way as any other infusion with decarboxylated the flour that we're using which we always do and now this is just gonna sit and melt all together for about four hours and then we'll come back and get it put into some little containers and it'll be ready to go all right so we will check back in with you in four hours okay we are back it has been four hours and we've got our mixture all ready to go so we're just gonna pop this out of the water it's still a little bit hot so we need to be very careful so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take this tea bag we're going to squeeze it out and get as much out as we can so I picked up this cool little contraption at winners one day and I think it's gonna be perfect for the job because I don't have very strong hands so this will help me maximize it so we're just going to pop that in there I'm gonna give it a squeeze there's so much stuck in there get as much as we can there we go I think that's pretty good there we go so here's our mixture let's put that down we've got our mixture here there's not a lot here like I said but we're going to put this into some containers and then it's gonna be ready to go so what I've done previously is I sprayed these containers out with some rubbing alcohol just to make sure that they're nice and clean inside and so now all we need to do is just pour this mixture let me just get a little scraper there we go now it does set fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad I'm not sure we're gonna need to but put all the extras in there and it's already starting to harden in the bowl so you got to work a little bit quick and if it does cool down and start to solidify again you can just pop it into your hot water and that should soften it back up okay so we are back and our muscle rub is all hardened it actually has not too too strong to smell it's quite nice actually and when you go to use it it comes off fairly easily so it's nice and easy to rub on your skin just like that wherever you hurt and it rubs in quite nicely and easily so there you go you got some homemade CBD infused muscle rub which is awesome if you keep it in the fridge it'll probably last you about a year if you don't use it up first and also if you buy some nice little containers they make nice little gifts for people as well so let's fit on nice there you go you can get some little stickers to write a little label on them and I can already feel it starting to work so that is really nice and I think you'll enjoy it too so thank you very much for joining me in this episode of the cannabis kitchen I hope that you enjoyed this as much as I enjoyed making it it's a nice easy recipe I will put the links in on the website if you go into the cannabis infused recipe section at www.canadianoutback.com look into doing that for you as well we actually had this one in the works to make and somebody did request it so that worked out good so whoever was looking for it I hope you enjoyed this particular recipe you can make changes as you wish you can add more camphor which is really good to reduce inflammation you can add more CBD or less just make sure that you're not messing around too much just because you don't want to mix up and get a really runny batch or a really really hard batch that you can't rub on so play around with it enjoy it if you have anything that you would want to add to your balm then by all means let me know in the comments I would love to know how you guys make yours and again please join us on our website

wanted to do a review on penat ryx and Charlotte's webs hemp infused Bahman which one worked for me so I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues and I just wanted to do like kind of like my take so after using this product and it's almost all gone for a solid couple of months actually maybe like two months or w-mint three in terms of pain relief it smells really nice so it's not like like we agents have this or we call this like white flour or something like that and it's really abrasive to the eyes it's really drying on your skin but it feels amazing just because the menthol on this is is intense and so I will douse myself with this before but it was really drying like I said and really abrasive to other people too like they could smell it immediately in your leg oh you're an old Asian grandma and on a 32 year old young lady so I opted for this first so this is called penetrations and this is well reviewed on Amazon and I would have to say what I was using it for is like my shoulder I have a little like shoulder impingement cuz I sleep on my side and things get pinched that way I've tried so many different ways on how to sleep but I've found a different solution this is always like things like this things like this they're always just little band-aids that help you very short-term in terms of pain relief and it's not even pain relief it's kind of like just a distraction it's not really addressing the source of your pain it's a it's a nice distraction so when you're you know when you're trying to work or whatever and you've got an ache in your neck or whatever and you have this burning cool sensation it distracts you from I think the pain I don't that's just my take on it I know it's not solving the problem but anyway this seemed to I guess be something different other than those types of products because it's an inflammation formula so if you have chronic pain it's probably because the the area or the joint or the muscle is inflamed and so no amount of stretching or like working out is really going to help you because it's still inflamed it's in a state of emergency basically so in order for you to like for myself like my knee for example or my shoulder or this like chronic muscle that was underneath my shoulder blade and it's really hard to get to gets really tight and it would cause actually migraines a lot and I would use this and you see I've run through this this container and it was just okay and I really didn't see any difference I think it was a lot better in terms of yes calming down the tissue than this guy but again if I wasn't gonna follow through like this is kind of like taking it's a topical like I guess an ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory that doesn't have to go through your liver to calm down the inflammation of the area or the affected area but if you don't follow through after calming down the inflamed area it stays weak or it stays unconditioned so for me for this example I was putting this and yes it was helping the inflammation and for me to not feel any pain but I wasn't doing anything to make sure that I wasn't going to keep that chronic injury there so I needed to do something physical where I could train those muscles or the muscles around it to activate and that way that one muscle wasn't doing all the work you know and I'm saying so there's a process right so if you're in pain and the area's inflamed yes these things in my experience do work but I went through a whole container worth and didn't realize like there's a second process to that which is to do something physical which trains that muscle not to be weak anymore because that's that's usually why you're in pain is because something is out of balance something is weak and this particular muscle that's always tied are always aching it's compensating for the rest of your weakness you're weak so that's that so I'm basically all out and on my journey of pain relief I also stumbled across things like CBD oil now I'm just about done with this guy and I was doing this is my second bottle full bottle like this and this is a 30 milliliters so one fluid ounce very small and their recommended dosage is one drop in the morning one drop at night or two two drops to full droppers okay and shake well before using and it tastes really good it tastes like minty chocolate stuff so it's in my experience it was kind of mouth drying always kind of got a cotton mouth feel I don't take it anymore I'm just about done but I haven't even touched this in a couple of weeks and I was trying to take this for like anxiety or oh yeah like if I have this pain here if I just take it will it just handle all the things in my body I don't know I can't really say if this works or not because at the same time I was also practicing yoga which to me in my example the whole shoulder blade thing the knee thing the hip thing the only thing that's really been I feel helping is yes these like step one little baby step one and then step two which is a big step which is to start training start conditioning those muscles so that you stop staying in this crappy injured in flame state that brings me to this okay so this is fairly new maybe about two to three weeks the use of this this is the 1.5 ounce soothing scent hemp infused balm from Charlotte's Web I love this smell it smells really good at submit it's like a minty my settlement enos doesn't burn your eyes when you apply it close to your face unless you put it like right here so I usually use this because I'm still getting that shoulder impingement not as bad as I used to used to wake up with headaches but yeah definitely using this in tandem with my yoga has been I'm seeing I'm seeing a lot more progress and a lot more strengthen and how I'm gauging that is just by doing regular everyday tasks so going up and down the stairs seeing if I could jog for like a little jaunt from the kitchen to the to the living room if I got excited about something or to run to the restroom like I'm that's how I'm gauging my progress and before I couldn't do that especially when I had done when I had injured my knee and so I've been applying this pretty regularly to my knee and before when I was doing yoga whenever I knelt down on to my knee onto the kneecap it was very painful and so I would just kind of find ways around it in terms of the yoga like still doing downward dog still doing forward fold still doing everything that I could you know it was really just the ones where I had my kneecap on the floor so I've been applying this directly to it and I've only started doing that for probably the last two weeks because for some reason you just I don't know when you're in an injured state you don't really think of all the ways you think of I don't know that's just been my experience and and that's been a transformation in my mind when you are chronically injured and maybe you have many things wrong with you it's kind of hard to keep track it's kind of hard to keep up with all of your issues but I encourage you to think of your body as a full system and so if your knee hurts it's not just about your knee it's about your hip it's about your quads about your hamstrings about your calves I always forget about my calves is about your ankles so that your your body's a whole system and so this has enabled me to I feel been very effective anti-inflammatory I'm not taking advil or ibuprofen for anything really the only thing that I really take ibuprofen for is if I have a feel of massive headache coming on and maybe I can prevent a migraine and then I'll maybe I'll take some or if I'm you know I have cramps or something that's the only reason why I would take that so I'm trying to minimize as much drugs as possible that I'm taking into my body and just doing these topical things that you just rub and they smell so good too and it is very I in my experience effective that I feel in my body as an anti-inflammatory agent which is pretty cool so and they and I think they make that distinction you know this has 450 milligrams of hemp extract and I've seen it go as far as to like a thousand milligrams and I'm like whew maybe that will like make it make my healing even faster because um right now with the yoga and I've been doing yoga for a good 45 days I think that's a good estimate maybe 50 days pretty regularly pretty like maybe I've missed two days and then I just did it the next day or something like that and that's given me the strength to go and do deadlifting I'm now lifting again when I was completely invalid for like a good three months or something when I when I injured my knee so that's been my experience with this this and this um so yeah not taking recap not taking this anymore I feel the yoga has replaced what I have seeked out in not gonna buy this anymore this is about 20 bucks I think and I think it and I think it does work when I was using it it's just that you need to follow through you can't just put it on to be like why am I not better yet you have to follow through physically emotionally mentally all the things I like this a lot better just because it's a little bit cheaper and and I feel like it lasts longer too cuz this is more like a this is more like a cream and this is more like a wax and like I can both they had a very similar scent this one like very kind of minty yeah mm-hmm they both smell really good I like both of them this one's just a little bit cheaper but it takes forever to get to you so maybe this is a better option I don't know it'll just kind of depend on my mood when when I go to refill this one but this I feel like it's lasting Mia quite a bit so I'll just put three of my fingers in here rub it on I'll do it before and after a workout or like when I remember to or if I'm particularly feeling little stabs of pain in my knee or in my neck and stuff and I just feel better and I've been using this for maybe good three months or so so that's been my experience any specific questions I'd love to you know answer your questions in the comments and maybe you know it'll work for you too and like I said these things are just temporary fixes and they and make you feel a little bit better for the time being but you have to follow through with all the things and try to think of your body as a as a whole system you know not even just your body like your mental state like are you do you really want to get better are you using your chronic illness as an excuse for not living I know that so yeah thanks for watching see you next time", "boVJ8gHNU80": "hi guys welcome back to my channel this week's video I guess we're gonna call it cuz it's not just a day of video taping that I'm gonna be doing wow that sounds really old-fashioned anyways I'm gonna try what I said I would try in my first video of the air and vlog for you guys and since I'm going to be going back to school mid-february and obviously I'm going to continue to be working it's going to be really hard for me to keep up with weekly videos on YouTube for you guys so since I'm gonna be so busy I thought it'd be much easier for me to do a weekly vlog video we're pretty much like most of the days of the week or I'm going to try to do Monday through Friday and then I can have a break on Saturday and Sunday for editing and posting but I want to try to film or vlog those days of the week because that's a lot easier than me sitting down and finding time that's quiet in my house to film a video video sorry you're shaking you're on my dashboard and my car does that also I'm gonna be filming these on my phone again a lot more convenient for me than to carry a camera around so we're sacrificing like a teeny bit of quality but loans nowadays are so amazing I don't think it changes that much and I've done quite a few videos before with just my phone and I haven't had any complaints so I'm gonna trust you guys to be there for me during this change of videos I'm a mess today I woke up pretty early and I went to Whole Foods and collected the things I would need for this week I'm deciding I'm going to try to juice in the morning and then just eat a dinner maybe sometimes eat a breakfast or like snacking in between Pichardo juice as much as possible because I have a shoot it's not really shoot but I'm doing a modeling thing on Saturday and Sunday where I'm going to be mostly nude so I want my body to be and it's in its best form we want to make myself feel and look the best I can for right now that was cool preyas why did you do that so I did a bunch of stuff this morning it's about 943 right now and I'm headed to Bed Bath & Beyond and Best Buy to just grab some things they sound really silly but the lights in my bathroom are off and they died so I need to get new light bulbs and I've been talking for ages about getting the hue light bulbs that you can change with your phone the color of them or I think they also you can set it to go with the music on your phone there's a lot of different options anyways I'm gonna go get those for my bathroom because imagine having a bath with like moody blue lighting or colorful lighting I think that would be really fun Bed Bath & Beyond I'm going to because I was watching shark tank last night and there was a flashback to an episode or the lady who made cozies which is pretty much like a Snuggie but it's more of a hoodie I don't know what to call it I barely watched what she was talking about but it looks really fun and my boyfriend I really want one so hopefully there a best herb not Best Buy hopefully they're at Bed Bath and Beyond if not I'll probably find something else in there that I need in the moment I'm feeling like poop today and I want to treat myself and get something silly and obsessed with the chest belt [Music] so I found that but they only have [Music] [Music] this is already I just finished up I didn't need to go to world market and I in there spending money there like an idiot I'll do a little bit of a rundown of what I got when I get home I'm gonna get my butt to the gym and I'm gonna play some video games cuz I haven't played video games in a while or I haven't like given myself a good hour to spend on a quest and it's sad makes me a little sad oh my god this car hi you guys hear it I'm sure you can okay [Music] I'm a different color now I just set up my hue lights in my bathroom it looks so fun in here so my closet is now orange and blue I'll probably change it my bathroom is purple I want to get more lights now I'm addicted to this this is really fun anyways the other thing I got that you toss the little mini bottle I need a truly less I got Tula the other thing I got was another thing to hang a plant in wow these these are my rooms right now those will be filled later with plants once the ones I'm propagating in here in my bathroom are already so yeah that's what I got at world market oh I also got a bottle of champagne because it was on sale what I got from Bed Bath and Beyond I got a new rope I got a plushy rope like one of those really soft ones because I've never had one and I've always wanted one and what else did I got oh I got a new shower curtain liner just like the bit that goes behind the actual shower curtain probably so hard to tell the difference between these two because they look so similar in this lighting very soft I upgraded from my dollar store one that was like just plastic and got dirty superfast I love exfoliating my body I have a few things up here in my shower that I like used to exfoliate with but I wanted a new little loofah mitt because my gloves are just getting a little bit worn down so I got one of these to really scrub my my body parts I get really rough skin on the tops of my arms so it's kind of important for me to do that I'm going to enjoy my new lights take a shower cuz I'm stinky from the gym and then probably film some makeup videos for you guys but in case I don't see you later today because I'm kind of just gonna have a rest of the day off for myself other than you know doing other things like cleaning and filming videos I just want to have the day to myself and I don't want to feel like I have to check in with you guys because if I'm honest I want to smoke a little bit of weed oh hi I'm gonna sign off for now but I will see you guys tomorrow and I'm getting some parts of my body wax it all ties into what I have to do on Saturdays getting my full arms waxed for the first time ever because blond hairs you probably have never really saved them but because of body painting and the paint clinging to any hairs or any texture I want to make sure it's the smoothest surface possible so that I get a really good result and so that's what I'm gonna do oh if you're wondering where I go for waxing I go to European Mark Center I go to the one in Burbank and I see Brooke she's literally the reason I even get waxed I took a long braids from waxing because it just seemed necessary to me all the time yeah Brooke is my favorite I've ever had and so I don't like to her she's not only talented but she is also super fun to talk to and she makes it a very comfortable experience so if you're ever in Burbank and need to get last Brooke is your gal and then later just go to work so I'm gonna try to make it a very simple day I'm gonna get up in a second and get myself a cup of coffee also on the face I still have some spot what do you call it [Music] tastes like Krispy Kreme Doughnuts to me it's amazing try it out whether or not you're vegan it's really a little late I'm walking into a wax now I was just informed that my usual Brook left and there is a different Brook that I'm getting waxed by today so of course not because alright I just got back to my car I have the arms of a bear baby so there were a little bit red um they look really listeners guys I am headed off to work it's this good lighting it's constantly hi guys I'm back from work I wanted to show you guys something I just got some of my favorites my girl Madame sugar you can find her on Instagram zoom in if you want to look at this I got an ice-cream sandwich for my mom / me whoever will eat it I got one of her blueberry moist lobes which are the most phenomenal things on the planet and one of her edible cookies her THC cookie things and I'm gonna eat this cookie now so that when I get home [Music] okay I'm gonna drive home finish this cookie I'm like 15 minutes from home so it's not gonna hit me that quick don't try this at home I'm not recommending doing this I just know my body well enough that I can do this otherwise be safe y'all okay I'm officially have a good night and I'll see you guys tomorrow I don't like being on camera when I'm stoned so pitch off good morning guys it is Wednesday and it is a 1013 in the morning right now I'm driving to work where I will be all day so it's gonna be a pretty boring morning / day until the evening because the evening is gonna be super fun my colleagues I don't know you go that's a weird word my friends from work and I are all doing her holiday thinking tonight we're going to a little karaoke spot later tonight after work that's where the party will happen for the blog [Music] I get a spot right up run are you kidding no parking Tuesday 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. not to day just a little lunchtime I'm having this I hope the music isn't copyrights I'm gonna be quick about to put it in the microwave [Applause] [Music] [Music] I was in the moment and I enjoyed it and I think I have a few clips of me just like having a good time snapping I clicked the video of whatever song but I had a really good time and that's all you guys needed now feeling a bit just tired today because that's not often I go out so I'm taking my time to spring back and I'm taking a bath with lots of bubbles you can see only trash over there client have a juice it already fell in the tub once so I'm going to attempt to not let it fall again and then I also have my planner waiting for me I'm going to just check off some things and go through what I need to do today in preparation for the weekend and just in general so I'm going to do that and then probably do something about my face because I got my makeup off with a makeup wipe last night and didn't do any skincare and I can feel the difference hey guys I'm back in my car I'm on my way to get my nails having nice hands and nice feet or just like pampering myself a little bit and taking that time to do that for myself feels really awesome I think it's really important that I keep up with it also again for my shoe they for the IMATS thing I'm modeling for on Saturday today I gotta get the nail polish I have off because the color I have is just a little too unnatural and we want either natural nails completely or like nude colored nails someone to nude nails day off really exciting things happen is I just got back I'm getting my nails done where'd my insecurities going on and have friends made me feel really insecure about my class so [Music] it's always something I would say care about you beat them amazing as I think they could ever look go Rita but I had the guy doing my manicure was high in the past at a different place I guess he moved over this place now called hey Lincoln Spa I really enjoy them they have a lot of different options and great artists but he moved down from Lana used to go to I don't know why or what the reasoning was but I didn't like him and I think he's almost gotten more rushed in this salon wasn't very relaxing experience on the manicure side it was brushed and it just looks like it was rushed like the shaping is just really wonky my cuticles are like half cut and he really like ripped them he didn't cut them he would just rip them off which not only is it uncomfortable but it makes her really bad and grizzled I think I'm gonna call them after and just be like hey and I want to say anything but I think we should look into those artists and make sure that he's doing his absolute best because I feel like I did my best anyways I'm gonna go help my dad so that y'all later my room a little bit more all my stuff for I'm s so I am ready and then play  videogames exhausted all comes by Thursday once again guys Thursday boo boo give a like if you love Thursday you love my boring ass Thursday I really want to try it out tacos do beyond meat ground beef taco thing try all the fast food okay buddy good morning guys it is Friday I keep hanging up and getting back to sleep because I'm just tired today my bet is I'm going to I have a meeting at noon and then I work at 2:00 and so now I'm going to get up do my yoga and then get ready see you guys when I get in the car [Music] my lipstick looks hilarious now parked here in Burbank I just had a lovely meeting with Sonny and Shivan who I might potentially be doing a short film short video with in the next coming weeks I'm excited about it they seem like really great souls and great people and that's what I was getting done the first half today next I gotta go to work but I thought since I'm down here in Burbank I'm gonna go to my favorite crystal store or one of my favorite Christmas toys I have money and it's actually right behind me in the crystal shrine and go pick up a gift for my mother's birthday which is on Sunday but she just broke her moldavite necklace that was like beads of moldavite the most beautiful piece of jewelry in the world and she just broke it around Christmastime I want to find her something that is going to kind of replace it or just you know something equally as beautiful she needs she needs something special and even if she says she doesn't need something special I'm gonna give her something special so I'm gonna turn my car off hop in over there really quick I have a few minutes to spare and then I I had to work hi guys sorry for such a lead update it's like nothing ever o'clock I don't know what type it is I just got home from work I'm about to shave my head and then go to sleep tomorrow as IMATS I might make that into a separate vlog I think I'm gonna make it

are 18 and up and caution should be exercised when using animals as well as storing them this video is designed for personal use and it's not professional advice but moreso tips and tricks I have learned myself if at any point in time you're enjoying this video feel free to hit that like button and subscribe for more content like this so the first thing that we need to cover quickly is cannabinoids there are three main cannabinoids THC CBD and terpenes THC or tetrahydrocannabinol is the psychoactive part of cannabis and will cause the high most people associated with cannabis CBD or cannabidiol is the non psychoactive part of cannabis which carries well-known medical effects terpenes are responsible for the smell and flavor of cannabis and have their own effects but are non psychoactive for the most part optimally you want a combination of THC CBD and terpenes for the best experience whether for medical or recreational use otherwise known as the entourage effect in this episode I will be discussing THC for the most part but it also applies to see with the intervenes the exact same way for example if I mentioned 20% THC the same applies to 20% CBD or 20% terpenes making edibles in figuring out dosages can be challenging so I will be covering two examples of how to dose in edible the first example will be if you have lab tests in material and the second example will be if you have untested material if you live in a state like California or Colorado lab testing of cannabis products is required for retail sale this is a great way to control the safety of cannabis in regards to pesticides molds and other harmful issues but also serves as an education tool for patients and recreational users one of the issues of cannabis testing is that it is not standardized yet meaning that THC CBD and terpene tests that you're receiving may be higher or lower than the product truly contains some brands will market their total cannabinoids as the THC percentage which can throw off consumers so make sure that you read any tests you may have access to carefully to ensure that you have the right numbers so for this example I will be talking about Hades og Hades og has 20 1.07 percent THC and 0.04 percent CBD program once again this is a rough approximate not every cannabis flower has the same cannabinoids and some tests may not be accurate but we will use this as a solid approximation for our edible dosage to calculate your cannabis into milligrams of THC multiply the percentages that you have by 10 will move the decimal point one point to the right this Haidee srg for example would have approximately 210 point 7 milligrams of THC program and about 0.4 milligrams of CBD program if I were to infuse a gram with this Hades og with a cup of butter my cup of water would have approximately 211 milligrams of THC and a half a milligram of CBD if I were to infuse 10 grams of this ad 13 with a cup of butter that cup of butter would have approximately 2100 and 7 milligrams of THC and about 4 milligrams of CBD this applies to all cannabis products you have whether it is flour hash Keef wax or trim if you have a lab test a gram of shatter at 80 percent THC for example that is 800 milligrams of THC per gram in some cases you may not have access to lab testing where you may not trust the results that you were given in this case I refer to important TC percentages as follows flour is between 10 and 30 percent THC Keef is between 20 and 40 percent THC hash is between 30 and 50 percent THC and waxes between 50 and 90 percent THC on average flour is 20 percent THC Keef is 30 percent THC hash is 40 percent THC and wax is 70 percent THC these are rough approximations for each product and some products may be higher or lower than the range as I mentioned for the most part these are good starting guidelines for most medical and recreational users so for example if I had 10 grams of hash I would approximately 4000 milligrams of THC in the finished infusion 5 grams of flour would be about 1000 milligrams and 2 grams of wax would be about fourteen hundred milligrams first off I need to mention the edibles can take anywhere between twenty minutes to three hours to fully kick in and edibles definitely hit harder than your average joint or bong run if you have eaten anything else that day that will also have an effect when the adipose potency as well as a handful of other factors so it is best to start off with a low dose wait an hour then increase is necessary in the United States the suggested single dose for an adult over twenty one is between five and ten milligrams of THC this means if you make a 100 milligram edible that by a state's definition is between 10 and 20 doses of THC if you are introducing a cup of butter of THC and have a cookie recipe which calls for 1/4 cup of butter and makes 12 cookies they would aim to have 480 milligrams per cup or approximately 2.4 grams of cannabis flower that would end up producing 4 batches of 12 10 milligram cookies so you could have a few over a couple hours and being able to control the dosing safely but like most things those dosages don't apply to everyone while I certainly suggest starting off at 5 milligrams for 10 milligrams for an everyday user this would almost be micro dosing prior to legalization in California there are four main doses of edibles 100 milligrams 250 milligrams 500 milligrams and 1000 milligrams some companies offered 2.5 milligram micro dose edibles and some companies offered 10,000 milligram edibles that would leave in a weed coma for a week the reality is your dose may be anywhere between 5 milligrams and 1000 milligrams or even higher but you need to work your way up slowly 500 milligrams and 1000 milligram doses are typically considered medical doses and are great for pain and other similar ailments and were utilized quite heavily prior to recreational legalization 100 milligrams is my go to dose per cookie as I can eat more or less as I see fit just as a quick background I have been smoking every day for a few years I suggest new users start off at 5 or 10 milligrams than 550 milligrams 100 milligrams 200 milligrams between 50 milligrams 500 milligrams and then 1000 make sure to space the edibles out at least one hour in between and only bump the dosage if the last experience then give you the desired facts for example if you go and buy a 10 pack of 10 milligram edibles go home and eat one an hour later you do not feel the effects as desired so yeah another 10 milligram animal and they get it in another hour next time you should start off with a 50 milligram edible then see how you feel out for an hour before consuming a second one once again this video is a personal suggestion and should be used only as an approximate guideline for dosing edibles for personal use make sure to keep your edibles and infusions out of reach of children and exercise caution after consuming any edibles but that being said I hope everyone has a wonderful day and if you have any questions feel free to post them below", "EHBqjp1NS7o": "what's up guys Sara here and today I want to show you guys how you can easily calculate dosage when making your own edibles so the first thing to understand is that the average dose is considered to be ten milligrams if you're new to using cannabis or you have a really low tolerance level you might need like half of that maybe even less if you have chronic pain or your chronic user you might need considerably more so it's just good to maybe aim for the 10 milligram mark and when you eat your edible eat like half of it wait the 60 to 90 minutes and see how you feel and then you know for next time maybe you need the whole thing maybe you need to maybe you need even less okay but when we're calculating the dosage when you're making your edibles at home it's kind of nice because you can gate you can make them basically cater to exactly what you need based on your personal requirements so what you want to start off with is some cannabis obviously and this is more than a gram but like just for simplicity sake let's say this as a gram of cannabis now when we're talking about dosage we deal in milligrams like I said the average dose is 10 milligrams so I'm gonna take this one gram and convert it to milligrams one gram of cannabis is a thousand milligrams okay and then if you know the strain then you will know what the dosage is of THC in that cannabis so some strains have 22% some have only 12% the average is 10% so if you don't know what it is go with the 10% mark but obviously it can vary quite a bit it's best if you know what the strain is that's that you're using so we've got a thousand milligrams in our one gram and for simplicity sake again we're gonna state we're gonna go with the average teach the content which is 10% so 10% of a thousand milligrams we go 10% times a thousand I got 100 milligrams so in that one gram of cannabis there's a hundred milligrams of THC now let's say I'm gonna make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil so I'm gonna take a cup of coconut oil I'm going to infuse it with cannabis and then I'm gonna use it to make something gummies or cookies or whatever okay so I have my one cup of coconut oil I add my 1 gram of cannabis which is a thousand milligrams which contains a hundred milligrams of THC so I know now that in this one cup of coconut oil there's a hundred milligrams of THC now when I go to bake with this let's say again for simplicity reasons or sake I am going to use that whole cup of coconut oil and in a bake a batch of cookies and I got 25 cookies out of that batch so I've used the whole cup I've used the hundred milligrams of THC and I got 25 cookies so I go 100 milligrams you know that was in that recipe divided by the 25 cookies so I know that each one of those cookies has 4 milligrams of THC in it and like we said the average dose is 10 milligrams so this would be a really good like starter amount for somebody you can have one cookie which only has 4 milligrams of THC see how you feel next time maybe you need two cookies or next time you make a batch of cannabis infused coconut oil maybe you use two brands or three brands or whatever depending on what you need personally so that's a really easy way to we calculate dosage when making your own edibles so that you can better control your own medicine and how it best works for you thanks so much for joining me guys if you're new to the channel please hit the subscribe button and feel free to

that's about it so we have here in this is the bee's wax melted and there's a half a cup I would just stuck it on microwave i gradually melted it took about four minutes stirring it in about 40 seconds or so long and then we have our tht infused coconut oil same same measurement half a cup vitamin E we need about 4 teaspoons of vitamin E which I had to poke out of these little capsule things put into here and then same amount 4 teaspoons of honey and then we're going to do a couple drops of the butter vanilla pour them in our containers let them sit for half an hour and then we got lip balm okay so we've melted the beeswax right now we are going to pour in the infused coconut oil okay constantly stirring okay then we're gonna add the four teaspoons of I mean four teaspoons of honey they're going away he's starting to harden that's why sorry about that I never use a little quicker I started mouth or hardening I just get the microwave for a couple seconds I put in there for 25 seconds and now we're gonna saw them melted mixing it together I didn't add the butter vanilla so we're gonna add let's see 1 teaspoon of that just and therefore little extra flavor okay stir it up and then we are going to pour it into our bomb containers close the top as possible so a little work here a little over there the container here here don't mind me okay oh [ __ ] shoot Jamie okay anyone leave the lid off for about a half an hour because you can see it starting to harden like see how that fell there and it's hardening leave it for what a half an hour I put the lids on and that's that a little bit extra here so we're gonna find some or containers and see what I can do with it thanks for watching we'll be back in about a half an hour to show you the end result thank you it's been about a half an hour and we poured our ingredients into the containers and they as you can see they've hardened so we got some bigger containers here is too small I went along sugai off

coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but

the NBC 2 news app and submit your tip now", "BzQ9i6EeCZQ": "all right so boom this is the official Twain 20 guy on how to safely consume weed edibles or any year for that matter because this is time that's advice you know I'm saying so I find that consuming edibles I eating it it's a lot more natural and has a less health risks than smoking anything you smoke and inhale into your lungs as the potential to affect your breathing cars in such as bronchitis and just overall get lungs see lungs other basic necessity of life right but at the point to note that not all edibles are created equal and being knowledgeable of the dosage level that you take is crucial in order for you to actually enjoy and have a good experience rather than be one of those people on YouTube that gives a story time about their worst experience of marijuana [Music] three hours later welcome back to no song edutainment yall already know what's going on subscribe to channel cuz I'm a fun guy I'm a cool guy I go through my day pretty normal like I'm a normal guy I'm a swell guy I'm a nice enough guy I'm a cool kind of guy I'm a pretty groovy guy I call this honest entertain you make you laugh but most importantly educate you on a variety of subjects that make you learn something they can apply it to your own personal personal life so mister my research the general consensus I see for a serving one serving of an edible is about 10 milligrams but not all will be dispensaries created equal like I said before some of them serve a bit more some of them aren't as precise and having each in each serving wrap individually so depending on where you get it from one serving we have a bit more THC than you might expect usually if it does have more THC than the 10 milligrams like limit it should have this image or however you wherever you see this image on the box right there but in the meantime products with too much THC must have these warning labels so I've told you why edibles are better than smoking or vaping me but how and what do you do to actually enjoy it safe so I got about five different steps for you to follow if you listen to me if you listen to me just listen to me you will enjoy your edible experience simple because I know it all I just played so most places require or from what I've seen research most states and my keys most provinces in Canada require a limit of ten milligrams of THC in a serving of edible but my suggestion Prasad is to tone it down a bit more and actually do five milligrams as your basic reduction to an edible cookie gummy bears or whatever so number one is important to read the packaging carefully so that you don't overdose or not overdose you can't really overdose on wheat but you can definitely take too much this easy there go anybody take a tab hallucinate you finished our trip the trip but chill out I got a heartbeat I can't feel [ __ ] so no longer do you have to play Russian roulette with your dosage amounts there's now a legal dosage of ten milligrams as your basic level of attaboy experience but if it isn't made at home then in that case be extra careful with how much you're taking in a given set or given serving size so especially if you're new to cannabis or you don't take it regularly it's important to dip your toe in the water a little bit before you dive in headfirst rather than taking the recommended ten milligrams take instead to five milligrams and then wait another two to three hours before you take another serving size just so that you are easing yourself into the whole edible experience and you can actually enjoy the high rather than you know some of the other stories I've seen on YouTube and even if you are a veteran cannabis user you should also implement my foot dosing which is start with five milligrams or even you start with the ten milligrams wait two or three hours and then add another one why should you do this because it gently stimulates the body's cannon but receptors which results in an increased high or increased mood productivity creativity without the sudden high effect that you might get if you were to just like consumer all I was in fact Oh Oh cookies very important to me I mean I love to me but they mean much more to me Tommy so the high is a bit more noticeable noticeable and more enjoyable like is you're kind of like on a roller coaster type of thing rather than already being at the top right so you're gently taking yourself to that peak or a high rather than just as soon as you get to the rides everyday at the top which is not ideal so again five milligrams as your basic level especially if you're a beginner and then every two or three hours just gradually take another serving size just so that you can safely and enjoyably each edible our number two is important to consider your tolerance having a low THC tolerance makes you susceptible to negative side effects of taking too much weed or taking too much THC such as paranoia anxiety and dizziness definitely without a doubt it's better to have an underwhelming experience than an overwhelming experience where you are shaking your you panicking whatever it is it's better to be disappointed than to be on the other spectrum if I'm gonna say okay do what you want you an adult but take heed take heed all right one word is good enough for the wise so he was so it's your first time trying a screen or not well since you interacted with marijuana in general don't try and keep up with the veteran smoker so don't try keep up with the rest of the crew just go at your own pace because there's it's not a race I see alright I got this off like that got the sauce little ketchup those sauce little ketchup thank you keep up with them because people that consume meet regularly already need a higher dosage to get their desired high effect and this is why I say it's important to take weed tolerance breaks the tolerance breaks for weed are important because it allows you to get higher for a longer period of time so your high or not it won't be like twenty minutes it'd be like two plus hours or so and you can get high on a small amount of weed which results in savings yeah I put it all together see it and trying to save y'all money I'm looking out for you looking out for your pockets so take means haulin sprigs periodically so that you can continue to not need a higher dosage and that your high can also last for a longer period of time simple so number three it just be patient like I said be patient with the THC and how it how long it takes to affect you depending on your metabolism and your body fat it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two or maybe even a few hours so these snacks are not like your regular snacks at the grocery store or the corniche story these aren't regular snacks that you can - to eat as you're watching a Netflix videos or Netflix shows or movies whatever it is take heed to the serving size and be patient for 330 minutes any for 30 minutes to two hours if you feel the pips this is the moment you feel the effect is when you can like perhaps take another one but even at that let it right out for a bit on number four you want to be mindful of your stomach's contents so the more food you have in your system the longer it will take for weed to get metabolized in your bloodstream and take effect however in empty stomach I lost with the edibles to activate Kruger so just keep it just keep that in mind when and if you are eating edible did you eat already because if you didn't it'll take effect quicker and if you haven't eaten already before it then start with half a dose or what you usually take or what you want to take just so that you know just you can slow yourself in micro dosing same as the same thing micro dosing is the wave don't just jump in and if you drank alcohol beforehand alcohol can increase the THC blood concentration in your system so it's important to use caution if you're mixing alcohol with edibles and number five just this is more of like the nurture you know they say nature is the nature this is more of an immature type of thing it just be mindful of the environment like are you around people that you or as you care about you want people that care about you right and are you comfortable around these people so if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or long much more it's better take it at your home with your loved one or parent or francica with it your brother sibling romantic partner whatever it is just be around if you're taking a larger dose for the first time or just in general you are taking a new strain it's best to be around people that you actually are familiar with and you actually care about just to that part of for you to experience some type of anxiety or panic attack or just seeing a familiar face will keep you a bit more grounded if you did end up eating so much but again the more experience you have the more likely you are to be comfortable the easier it is for you to be comfortable in different situations or different environments but yeah so my kudos take it easy five milligrams or as your basis for anything for the most part and then just gradually increase your high once you start feeling the effects and its best it's always better to have an underwhelming experience then an overwhelming experience londo and take these five steps into consideration you will have a very enjoyable read hi and again have other videos above or edibles from marijuana lay the topics in the description pink ominous video and we

about an hour to let me show you guys real quick the ingredients my father seen hold on guys you kidding me let me do this right you guys good morning this morning here like that and just won't come back too long ago we talked about those flourish gummies okay first of all I'm gonna be completely honest with you guys I took them and as they went on I literally forgot that I even consumed the gummies that's out but I forgot that I consumed the gummies and during the whole day I didn't really obviously I didn't feel anything really because I forgot that I even took um basically I didn't feel really much of anything maybe it's because of what I ate maybe because my maybe I should have a after maybe I know I ate after a wild learned later on that day but my shirt but time on how long I waited to eat but I think probably I ate too soon and I didn't make the hi I'm gonna make me hi didn't I bring the high up all the way but um I don't know I like some down on me because maybe I ate or I don't know my tolerance is too high I'm not trying to say that these gummies will not work for anyone else they just didn't work for me my tolerance is really high from marijuana you know so I mean like the next person they probably will work for you but with these do not work for me didn't taste that great they weren't delicious you're trying to get us give us someone that doesn't want but just

up thank you for tuning into the canon guide today we got a really cool review for you make sure you like this video and subscribe so we can get more content to more people we got a really cool review we're gonna do a CVD topical self review cell boards artisanal self now we've been carrying this salad for a long time I my collective here you can see that product right there it is a coconut oil base pure CBD derived from 100% cannabis flowers now this is a very high dose CBD product especially for topical in the entire tin I believe is about 400 milligrams of CBD that they list there on the top and they do come in different strains mainly ACDC and Charlotte's Web I wish I had the you know original full tin it usually comes in a kind of the large silver tin and that can run I think it usually runs around $40 in the dispensary depending on the area of coverage that you need to cover can be less or more you know of a value for you oh it's kind of nice system support a small business it's not one of a you know very large conglomerate yeah so when you smell this it is essentially is unscented there's no aromatherapy oils or anything else in here to you know make it very fragrant it is just raw like smells like coconut oil really just really smell like cannabis at all but when you you know it is filled with cannabis when you use it the past couple of days my knee has just been totally inflamed I hadn't been able to walk on it properly and it was seriously just thrown pain just sitting here you know most most people would just take an Advil or Tylenol but this stuff's really bad for your liver so I opted to try out the topical CBD you see how that you know really helped my my knee injury the coconut oil is a little bit thicker sometimes you can almost seem like a solid at first but when you touch it it actually just kind of melts into a liquid oil right there and your finger yeah look at it just melts right into an oil just with the heat of your your skin aren't there a little bit does go a long way with this but I found you know for males so you might actually need more than if you're a female just because have a bunch of hair the hair end up absorbing a bunch of it so I kind of had to use more than I you know I think someone less like hair we'd have to use so I just kind of got a solid glob on there now almost my my top part of my knee was hurting like right above the kneecap so I went ahead got it on both sides of that as well as on top and around the kneecap and just rubbed it in nice and gently now rub me I didn't was a little bit you know sore if you have a really sort area it's again I heard two rubbed in so just you know you can be gentle with it and I believe it is best to do this at night now I use it throughout the day you can use it throughout the day it doesn't actually get you high or medicated but at night when you're sleeping your skin temperature increases and that's when you're gonna be doing most your healing so it's gonna really be most beneficial and you know be a little bit more receptive I feel at nighttime or early morning or maybe even after a shower when you're you know nice and warm then I would take a little bit more I would actually just essentially just coat the entire area and sometimes if you can find like a source or you know find where the paint's traveling from I've actually hit that area with a little bit as well and what I found although I was very skeptical at first because you don't think you know topical is gonna work because it seems like just a lotion but it really really took the edge off now it didn't completely take the pain away when I was active and trying to move on it and you know not doing good things probably but you know when I was just sitting here you know trying to be comfortable and rest it very very very much helped the just ambient pain and just you know just the pain that's radiating and pulsating when you're just trying to relax you know conditions vary and it's really hard to say this will work for you this will work for your condition but I would definitely give it a try there's a lot of different brands out there make sure you find cvd that's derived from marijuana flower not CBD isolate from hemp it has anecdotally been found to be much less effective the have CBD isolate why that is you know a lot of people can just say it's entourage effect or it's the terpenes and the cannabis plant maybe it's the miniscule amounts of THC or the other cannabinoids we don't really know for sure I found that I much prefer those products I found them to be much more effective and if I'm to be just more reputable their testing results tend to come from reputable sources within the state and they tend to have testing sources man I can do a whole video and that you know what I will I'm gonna do a whole video on CBD just misinformation because it's seriously my pet peeve CBD isolates that are just found in a wellness store that's advertising CBD is not going to be a quality CBD product yeah people might might hate that but just be very aware when you're looking for CBD online be very skeptical until you have you know less reasons to be just be skeptical of CBT online especially from dispensaries still be skeptical just make sure you do your research look into it know what your product contains yeah supports been some great people lab test is 100% flower bud ACDC CBD topical great stuff alright so sub Ward's artisan South find them in a dispensary near you thank you for tuning ken guy please like and subscribe to the channel",

it's helpful to use a mortar and pestle in doing this but you could also use the back of a spoon into a shallow pan or a plate however you achieve it you need to mash the to medium size flowers into a paste then add about 250 milliliters of alcohol to wash the mortar and pestle and to make sure that he rats all of the datura paste into the jar along with the rinsing alcohol [Music] now add the remaining amount of alcohol needed to fill the jar to about twelve hundred and fifty milliliters now we need to chop or crumble four cubes of camphor blocks until almost powdered then carefully scoop it up and add it into the alcohol mixture into the jar now add the two remaining kaffir tablets into the mixture hold without crumbling them up these two whole ones will help us make an aggregate when we shake and will also help release the cap for a little more slowly as it dissolves into the plant extracts now make sure that you put the lid on the jar and tighten it very securely because now we need to shake vigorously for several minutes now the better you shake the better and faster this process will complete in the long run so stay with it as long as you can the mixture will begin to take on a greenish tint but we still have a while to go because now we let it sit for several days in a cool dark place and shaking it again periodically after several days five to seven days at least the mixture will darken and the green color will saturate into a neon green color after several days the topical is ready to use but you can continue with these optional steps to make it more refined and easy to use product so now you can strain it very carefully through an unbleached coffee filter to remove any of the plant materials this will make it easier if you follow the next step now the product is ready to funnel into a spray or roll-on container so that when you need it you can easily roll or spray it onto the affected areas this top pool can be used as needed on the skin do not ingest it because it will make you very sick also keep it well away from your eyes and children but it is a great for arthritis pain general aches and pains and in muscles and joints and other general topical useless and to answer this inevitable question in advance no this does not get you high it's a simple old-school home remedy that is not intended to produce any psychedelic effects this

talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "zYFmmX2MxZQ": "Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from\nSpineCare in St. Joseph, MI. In this video we\u2019re going to ask: can CBD\nOil really help with relieving sciatica? Is it effective, and strong enough to actually\ntackle the pain? Or is it all smoke and mirrors and too good\nto be true? Let\u2019s find out! Before we start, though, I want to say in\nfull disclosure that I\u2019m not benefiting from or promoting any product or brand of\nCBD oil. This video is just my personal thoughts on\nthe matter that I wanted to share. If you\u2019ve ever suffered from sciatica, you\nknow how much of a nightmare it can be. It pretty much makes almost every daily activity\nuncomfortable and inconvenient. For many suffers, they rely on over-the-counter\npainkillers to make it through the day. And in more severe cases, pain management\nthrough opioid pain medications, steroids, and injections may be prescribed. It\u2019s no secret that the opioid epidemic\nis real, and many people have reservations about taking something that has a high risk\nof side-effects, including addiction. That\u2019s why the appeal of CBD is growing,\nsince it offers the potential for effective pain relief on top of being natural, non-habit\nforming, and having little to no side-effects. No doubt, CBD use is also growing steadily,\nand is being used for treating conditions such as anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and\nmuch more. So let\u2019s take a look at how CBD may help\nrelieve sciatica pain, and start by going over what exactly CBD oil is and where it\ncomes from. CBD, or cannabidiol, is commonly known as\nhemp oil. It is a form of cannabis, which includes the\nwell known marijuana plant. Cannabis contains a number of different compounds,\neach with different effects on the body and mind. The two main active ingredients are Tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the part that produces the characteristic\n\u2018high\u2019 of marijuana, while CBD is associated with therapeutic qualities and is not psychoactive. Producers of CBD have developed cannabis strains\nthat have virtually no THC, primarily hemp plants. The oil produced from these hemp plants contain\nless than 0.3% THC, which means it is not intoxicating and DOES NOT have any mind-altering\nproperties. Due to that, CBD oil is federally legal in\nevery state and does not require a prescription. I want to note, though, it is also not regulated\nby the FDA and is considered a supplement. Next, let\u2019s move on to some key aspects\nof sciatica. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with sciatica, especially\nits causes and symptoms, and want to know more, I\u2019m going to provide a link in this\nvideo\u2019s description to another video I\u2019ve done that goes over it in more detail. So check it out after watching this video\nto learn more. Sciatica is pain that travels, or radiates,\nalong the path of the sciatic nerve. This large nerve begins in your lower back\nand forks into two (left and right) to travel from the buttocks, into the legs and feet. Sciatica has a couple main causes, with the\nmost common being a lumbar herniated disc that presses onto and pinches a nearby nerve. The other is due to spinal stenosis, which\nis when the spinal canal (where the nerves travel through) narrow and close off, again\npinching nearby nerves. The sciatic nerve is very sensitive, and when\nit becomes compressed or irritated by one of the reasons above, it may cause symptoms\nlike mild to debilitating pain, tingling, or numbness into the areas it travels. One of the things that makes sciatica pain\ndifficult to treat is that it is often a combination of two different kinds of pain, nociceptive\nand neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused when nerves are\nreacting to tissue damage, which sends signals to the central nervous system (your brain)\nthat something has gone wrong. Neuropathic pain is when the nerves themselves\nare damaged, usually through compression causing inflammation and irritation. So what is it about CBD that makes it potentially\neffective in taking on sciatica pain? It\u2019s this: CBD stimulates a part of the\nbrain called the endocannabinoid system, a system responsible for communicating \"good\nand bad signals\" throughout your body. When CBD stimulates this system, it can change\na bad signal to a good one, which may have the ability to alleviate both neuropathic\nand nociceptive pain, as well as helping to reduce inflammation. Currently, though, studies on cannabis, including\nboth CBD and THC, are still in the early stages. I could not find one definitive study directly\nlinking CBD use and pain management of sciatica. However, the process in which CBD works is very\npromising and could be an all-natural alternative to opioid drugs and other painkillers. I can say though, that CBD oil WILL NOT cure\nany underlying issue causing sciatica, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. So please do not take it as a substitute for\ngetting the proper care you need from a licensed healthcare professional! For those sciatica sufferers that have tried\nCBD oil, please leave your experiences and results in the comments section below, all\nof us would like to hear from you! Also, if you have any other comments or questions,\nplease feel free to leave them and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can.

cooking world I wanted to make her pastry cream what we have is two cups milk quarter teaspoon salt four tablespoons of cornstarch 115 grams of sugar we're going to take the cornstarch and we're going to swap it into the sugar a healthy pinch of salt going into the corn stretch whisk it together so we get a nice even blend we're in a separate commit you can either use two full egg I like a really rich deluxe taste pastry cream so I use four egg yolks instead of two whole eggs either work you're just going to districts get a different consistency for the pastry cream so we're going to take our four egg yolks we're going to take the sugar in the cornstarch and we're going to make mix it into the edges we have two cups of milk I'm just going to put it in a saucepan together with the vanilla beans so we're going to heat it up and so it's going to mix those vanilla beans in and pop it on the stove hot hot cream we're just going to slowly ladle some pastry came in to the eggs and what that does is the eggs slowly cooks evenly and you get a nice smooth put it and then we'll put it back into the saucepan and cook it until it boils we just want these like big bubbles like that so this is done we're going to put this through a clip just kind of make sure that if there are lumps in there we're taking them out so put it in there and you see the flecks of vanilla how pretty that is we're not done yet we're going to cool this down and then we'll add our weed butter to it you want to stir this every once in a while to make sure you don't get a film on the top of it as it cools down last step of our cannabis pastry cream so you got to put the canvases we have some note of style cannabutter that we made some scratch and we're going to add it to our pastry cream to give it that little

seven thousand bars a day you know these two machines behind us we're running 70 to 80 pounds of product through these machines every day in Colorado when we started six years ago inconsistency was the biggest problem in the edibles industry and nobody was really testing products nobody was accurately dosing products we saw that as a big opportunity not only to set ourselves apart but to do what was right for the patients people didn't really like edibles because they were afraid of them you could have an edible one day and you'd be medicated fine you'd have the same edible from the same company the following week and you'd be over medicated that was the biggest concern that we saw and you know my partner Rick his expertise was perfecting a recipe and duplicating at 20,000 times a day when I approached him and talked to him about doing edibles that we treated like food you know professionally packaged nutritional labels consistency those were the three main things that weren't happening in Colorado at the time so we saw that really as something that the industry needs you", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in.

thousand subscribers on YouTube that's right a thousand of you awesome people subscribe to my youtube channel thank you everybody who Tunes in and watches my videos and shares them and likes them in comments I really appreciate that holy [ __ ] so to celebrate a thousand subscribers I'm gonna stick to the theme of a thousand and what I've got here is a 1-1 gram snake of some shadow I've stretched out here so we're gonna do a 1 gram damp of some of this grape star shatter if I can get it to focus I picked this up earlier from the hem Center really cool dispensary and this is about who cares what percent 66% but we've got a 1 gram dam which is a thousand milligrams of concentrate and then I also have a thousand milligrams of edibles that we're gonna take today so a 1 gram Babb and a thousand milligrams of edibles do you think that you can handle this what I've got here is the let's get it to focus I have the Colorado cannabis oil capsules and there's four capsules in here and there are a total of 350 milligrams through the whole bottle and they actually make these words four capsules and it's a thousand milligrams but I couldn't find that so these are just I guess less filled and the capsules but let me give you a breakdown we're looking at okay so each capsule is about 93 milligrams of THC and it is full spectrum or RSO so there are other cannabinoids and there's really good stuff I've had this many times before and it's actually my favorite edible so this whole bottle is 372 milligrams of THC and it's not like it's full there's only four little capsules in here and we're actually gonna take we're gonna take three of these which should be just over a thousand milligrams it'll actually be about 1100 milligrams so I'm excited and then I'm gonna try to stream on Twitch after this so this is for a thousand subs on YouTube but you know I stream every night on Twitch if you don't sub to my twitch channel like twitch that TV slash coupons check that [ __ ] out I'm probably live right now if you're watching this and I'm probably not on my thousand milligrams and one gram that but maybe we hit some milestones again I'll do it check out my twitch check out my other social media we have links in the description below follow my Instagram my Twitter sup to the subreddit check out the Facebook I don't know check out all that stuff join the discord that's the good one let's take some of the capsules first maybe like a half now and half after cuz like what if the dev just wrecks me I can I can't continue let's give it a go so this is 350 milligrams for four of these and they're just little capsules and I guess this is the same size for all of them so if you get the higher dose which ones they just they fill more but they have more of the liquid in it early oil so let's go for it let's take a nap now [Music] just little GHC capsules I kappapa movement in this or above okay so that's four of them I think and honestly guys I mentioned it before this is my absolute favorite edible I hate if I want to take a thousand milligrams I usually hate a thousand to get high if I want to take it it's like several brownies or like a fuckload of gummies you know what I mean I'm not trying to eat like a [ __ ] eight ounce bag of gummies to get a thousand milligrams I'd rather just like pop a few capsules and this is actually these are the low dose not like a pop four and get a thousand milligrams some of them are even more potent so I need to look out for those they're hard to find and they're kind of pricey well that's half of it down it's about 550 milligrams of THC here was 1100 for the capsules overall so we have half of that down and let's fire up the let's fire up the nail here we're gonna do this on quartz banger I got the pearls in there hopefully hoping I can get the time right I don't do a lot of dabs on this lately so I'm hoping I get the time right but if not I'm down for four reheats and whatnot we were just gonna milk this a one-gram dab is like it can be a million different things a hundred people could do a a 1 gram them and everybody consumes a different amount so there's different amounts of waste or whatever so I'm just gonna try to go pretty hot minimal waste but you know how it is let's let's see we got here [Music] we got a nice big old Glover here let's see how it looks [Music] oh

another review today and what we're going to be reviewing today is a product called the blue kuduro pick this up last week as a buy one get one i'm going to try the hybrid version of it today so combinations teva indica and this is made by a company called MIP manufacturer website dub dub dub deep blue kudu calm I'll put that link down in the description 100 milligrams in this bar and it's kind of when they described it to me it's kind of like a tootsie roll so the ingredients on this are chocolate organic vanilla extract organic tangerine flavor oil powdered sugar organic coconut oil nonfat dry milk cocoa powder light corn syrup and cannabis and again there's 100 milligrams in this little nut log here there's a technical difficulty so what I'm going to do now it's also know also here it says new and improved recipe and then I've always loved new and improved always implies that it was old and lousy before so I'm going to take this thing and it doesn't seem to be really very packets friendly here so I'm peeling off the end it's going to peel back I'm probably to take about a fifth of this it's kind of crumbly it's not like a toy Tootsie Roll is kind of like a compressed brown kind of crumbling off as I check yeah it's kind of nasty so when I cough about that much little knife down here I'm very soft softer than a 20 cut off the end here got your rather unappetizing little compressed now and avoid instead of the circle so let's pop this in the mouth and see what happens the very weedy very very weedy and taste nobody would eat this and I realize it's not just a chocolate brownie or chocolate fudge it's got more of a consistency of fudge and then a tootsie roll it's not nearly as chewy but again a heavy heavy on weedy taste and 100 milligrams per log so that would and I pay ten dollars for this now to be fair i got this buy one get one at the giving tree it was a the buy one get one day for selected edibles there but i'm going to evaluate this based on its actual list price so that would give it am milligram per doc milligram to dollar ratio at ten so that's not very good that's Louis one of the three that I've reviewed so far that's it for now if I think of anything else up tomorrow when I come back and give you the evaluation for the actual pain relief and effects I'll let you know well it's next morning now this is the recap of the review of the blue kuduro the 100 milligram hybrid version that I took about a quarter of the roll last night so that should have been around 20 to 25 milligrams and let's recap the taste and consistency well this ain't no tootsie roll you know this kind of way it was described to me at the dispensary this Mort tasted like a dry fudge with a serious ganja funk I mean it was a really strong there's no way you can miss it the aftertaste wasn't bad but not good I've said the consistency was the most unappealing thing about it it kind of tasted like dry dry really dry fudge just like a Elmo sandy taste so with that I have to say I have to give the edible rating of this as six so taste rating on this of the four of them out of the four rating from my scale I give it a six now pain relief this is the high point of this um little long goodie this worked really better than I expected based on its reported milligram content within 90 minutes I was fully medicated and at that peak I experienced a serious body effect I mean it was a significant body effect I could really feel that the pain relief was excellent felt a little heavy in the body but not in an unpleasant way and also a very solid head effect a very lightheaded fat and solid had effect nothing that I couldn't handle it wasn't like I was unable to comport myself in public I would say this hybrid definitely lean toward the indica side of the scale based on amount of body effect but overall very very good lasted also for a very long time the head effects were gone within four to five hours and the body fix lasted until after I fell asleep now so that was 6 plus 6 7 plus hours and woke up this morning felt very good was able to do a three mile mark with a mile walk with minimal discomfort after the way I felt yesterday that was saying something I have to give the coup du roule to some hybrid cooter roll a 9 rating on pain relief so very very good third part of my I'm rating scale is side effects as I said I got a significant amount of body high and that made for some couch lock not bad i mean it i was very very relaxed actually sat through an episode of american pickers and I hate shows like that so I kind of tells you i might have experienced some couch lock but i was stable still able to read in function i was also able to go out into a couple errands so I was not scared to go outside or didn't feel uncomfortable so I'll give this a good solid raining of 84 lack of side effects very good and value this is where it gets hit again this is 100 milligram role for ten dollars that's its list price now I said before that I got it as a bogo the buy one get one at the giving tree so instead of 100 milligrams for ten dollars i got 200 milligrams for ten dollars but that's a sale price and i only go by a retail price for the rating so at the retail price of 100 milligrams per ten dollars it gets the rating at the ratio of 10 milligrams per dollar and that's the worst i've done so far and i'm going to have to give that a value of six on the scale alright in summary that means that you had a 64 taste a 9 for pain relief a sick an 84 side effects and a 64 value that gives you after you / for a ganja geezer rating of 7.25 but actually you notice there it's a 7 I decided that as subjective as these are you don't I'm just going to round down if it's below point 5 on the scale I'm going to round down if it's above point 5 on the scale I'll round up so the actual rating will be a 7 well that's it for now that's a review of this next maybe not next time but I had to mention here that I had a low kudu sativa role which I will be reviewing the future i'll probably do it in a much shorter format maybe just actually do the effects and not the unwrapping and everything just to say how that worked out but until then i'm going to say goodbye and stay medicated you", "yRRRaF_BKy8": "today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD based self by Christy wood from by the bay farms [Music] this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compound smells really really good she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not ena constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really important with any product like this we're really any cannabis product I'm going to move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat panic self massage it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the SAP itself I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life [Music] how's it going everybody its Freddie back here today and I'm bringing you a another product review and this time it is not from a dispensary and it is also not a flower or smokeable product so today I am looking at some cannabis south and this is a CBD base South by Christie wood from by the bay farms now Christy's located in Buzzards Bay and she was actually kind enough to reach out to me on Instagram and tell me about her products a little bit and she actually sent me some so this is a CBD only south there's no THC in this no psychoactive compounds but I'm super interested in stuff like this because I have very little experience actually no experience with topicals so super exciting really something new for me and hopefully seeing as I get a lot of questions about CBD and the different uses for it this can help me and you both learn a little bit more about this really cool cannabinoid that is getting a lot of attention but people don't seem to have as much hands-on experience with as they'd like including me so firstly thank you thank you very much to Christy I really appreciate the generosity and you reaching out to me anybody who reaches out to me you kind of hold a special place in my heart because I put a lot of work into these videos into these reviews and it's a lot of passion as well and I don't mind doing it but whenever anybody shows appreciation that means a lot to me so you Christie and let's get into it so the South a basic basically the ingredients in here are organic coconut oil beeswax cannabis extracts in essential oils so this is a CBD only product as I mentioned before and the directions are essentially to Chris you suggest that you test a small bit of this SAP on your skin before applying it to a larger area just to make sure there's no reactions or interactions with your skin so essentially it's just like a bomb or something that you rub on your skin she recommends Christie does using a spoon to avoid cross-contamination or bacterial growth within the salad self and the recommendation on this page says that you cannot put too much on so there's no overdoing it with this I've used it a little bit the one thing I would say is it can be a little bit oily if you take too much at once so you might have a little bit of that coconut oily residue on your hands if you grab a little too much for a certain area but honestly what I do with it is if I have a little extra on my hands I know this sounds a little weird but I just like run it through my hair I really can you see this stuff being used for almost any use is kind of a skin facial topical sort of healing ointment type menthol icy hot almost type applicator or application would be a good use for this and I I believe that the coconut oils and stuff like that are really good for hair as well this is just a personal thing for me um I have kind of long hair I put products in it and if I have a little extra of this Salib on my hands just run it right through there some people might think that's weird too gross or greasy but I don't know I think it's natural smells really really good I have to say maybe the aroma the aroma therapy qualities of this stuff might be one of its strongest uses for me or the aroma therapy aromatherapy qualities if that's even a word are some of my favorite parts of the self so when I have it in my hands or on the spoon I just kind of inhale it or just hold up my hands and kind of breathe deeply and that just seems to be a really nice kind of calming effect for me that could be in my head but whatever works for you works for you right so I'm not here to judge and hopefully you aren't either so yeah this stuff is awesome I've been using it pretty much daily Christie recommends using it about 6 to 10 times a day for the first few weeks constant application seems to be the method to the madness with this stuff so getting a baseline of just like any medication really you know getting a baseline of it in your system or on your skin will help you get used to it and will help you reap the benefits from it a little bit faster and more holy so 6 - time 6 to 10 times a day apply it to whichever areas you feel you need it the most and after that you can start to decrease the dosage that you put on according to Christie so she mentions specifically at the end of this little blurb she's written me that she cannot stress enough that this is a healing process one or two applications is not enough so if you want to purchase this stuff from Christie or you're thinking about checking it out be wary you're not going to you know put it on one time like some snake oil and immediately be cured of all your ailments it's not how any medicine really works so constant application patience diligence mindfulness is really is really important with any product like this notice how you feel before during and after an experience with something like this or really any cannabis product because that's how you really can you know see the effects because they're not always immediate they're not always super extravagant at first but when you implement cannabis and cannabis infused products into your life daily the little steps it makes over a long period of time make a huge difference so that's what I try to tell people is you know don't expect a one-time care because those don't exist in life but kind of weaving these natural and organic and well done products into your lifestyle will really just make your quality of life so much better in my opinion okay so now I'm gonna give you guys a little breakdown of how I apply this stuff and yeah we'll go from there so I'm going to actually turn and move my clothing I'm not gonna get all the way naked folks don't worry that's gonna be on my premium snapchat oh okay so as you can see summer has not yet hit in Massachusetts I am pale as a ghost but I like to put this stuff on my shoulders I get a lot of tension in my neck and in my upper shoulders so I find that an early morning application of this South especially after sleeping on my neck weird if by the way if you don't notice if you haven't noticed by now I have a [ __ ] long neck so this thing's always hurting me actually I had to put an extra little book on my tripod because my neck was too long for the Headroom anyway I digress so what I do per the instructions I open this up if that is really cool-looking I'll actually bring it over to you you can see it so you can see the way my fingertips are ready it's smells reminiscent of a mix vapor rub kind of which is one of my all-time favorite scents mixed with cannabis it's got a really strong cannabis smell but it's not overwhelming it's not skunky it's kind of a sweet natural organic smell of cannabis if that makes sense it's so so so medicinal just as an aroma therapy medicine for me I could literally sit here and sniff this stuff all day and it's just calmed me right down I think that's kind of the essential oils that are in here I'm sure that those have a lot to do with it alright so basically what I do is I get a little bit on the spoon and now I don't want it to be too much I don't know if you can see very well here but I don't have a lot have a little bit and then I just put that in my hands and so one thing that Christie talks about in here which i think is really wise and smart is the fact that a lot of times pain or inflammation or symptoms you're experiencing might be localized in one spot that not that may not be the cause of the of the ailment itself or the root cause so you might be feeling pain in one place as you see him rubbing this together you might be feeling pain in one place but the cause might be in another spot next to it so make sure you apply this in a large swath of skin or area because you don't just want to focus on the one localized acute pain point you kind of want to get all around it to loosen everything up so hands super oily right now it's all this stuff so what I like to do is just rub it on my neck and shoulders so right on my upper back kinda massaging it in this would make a really good massage oil too and that's not a necessarily written use for it on here but I'm sure it would be perfect for that so if you are a masseuse you like to give yourself self massage or if you've got a significant other you bless this out give them a little back and booty rub you're gonna have a healthy happy relationship oh man yeah so I just rub it all in and then with the excess I just gotta you know throw it in the hair I got a headband in now so probably to mess it up a little bit but I know that might might be gross to some people you might think it's greasy and weird but I don't care so immediately upon applying this stuff I'll tell you I also put my shirt back on immediately upon applying this stuff I feel a menthol like quality and the CBD seems to take effect and root in right after this menthol like feeling kind of wears off so it's immediately it's not an icy hot it's not intense like you know hot to relax it away or cold anything it's more so just a very not a numbing feeling but a slight kind of anesthetic numbing agent feeling it feels good that's really the main thing I can say and I also notice that if I smoke cannabis after using this stuff it seems to and this could be you know placebo effect but it seems to kind of go along with the entourage effect and I feel a increased potency of the south-- itself so take that for what it's worth that's a personal anecdote of mine I have a nose pick evidence to back that but yeah you put the stuff on you take a take a bowl or a nice bong rip it might have increased efficacy for you and that's something I believe in so definitely something to keep in mind if you do plan on getting some of this South which I do highly recommend like I said overall as a lifestyle choice I think it's a great thing to implement products such as these into your life because we use a lot of oils rubs creams and stuff but to be able to have access to something that's derived from cannabis and has those essential oils and common pounds in them is really cool and nice and I can't thank Christie enough once again I'll say it again Christie would by the bay farm her phone number five zero eight six eight five oh seven seven nine and you can also see her website on cannabis pain SOUTHCOM that is cannabis pain South one word.com south is sa l ve alright so that's about all I have for you today I feel great my muscles are definitely more relaxed after all of this and since I've implemented this as a daily kind of regimen I honestly do feel less or less tight in the morning and overall great experience so I can't recommend it enough Thank You Christy and thank you for watching I really appreciate it have a good one guys you", "e6dD81GhgiI": "welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember to subscribe to the demystifying medicine channel

crazy wonderful mixed up scary anxiety inducing what the hell quite is this place known as your local dispensary so today we are taking a look at a product that has been uh or a category of products rather that has been kind of up and down in my estimation i find some i really like and find a lot of duds and that is the capsule category uh we are taking a look at buddies today oh boy that uh has quite the reflection buddies soft gels one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand milligrams of thc of course we're not doing on 1 000 like all of our wheats reviews we aim to do 100 milligrams of the thc and review that much of it but a thousand milligrams is quite the uh achievement uh especially for as few as there are there are actually only 20 soft gels in here uh leading to 50 milligrams a capsule if you know you are very simple multiplication um really really excited about this one uh if i can find oh my dog is growling at another dog here she's being kind of a [ __ ] underneath so um so these are as i said very very very strong for a single capsule i'm kind of interested to see what they look like 50 milligrams in a single capsule to me seems very [Music] uh at the limits of what can be done but i don't know you know maybe they figured out some kind of magic um so uh on this buddies package here we've got all our incredible information we want we've even got nutrition facts so one of these soft gels has 6.61 calories in case you want to get that specific 6.61 calories 0.73 grams of fat um so this is a gelatin uh oh it's a glycerin base grapeseed oil uh so it has both some kind of like gelatin glycerin which is some kind of um often glycerin is often used vegetable glycerin is often used uh when making like tinctures uh and then grape seed oil is apparently what they are using uh as their um uh base instead of the more common sort of mct oil you see i don't see grape seed oil very often so 50 milligrams we are gonna do two of these capsules uh and just to ensure that i'm gonna get the best effect i am after i take these capsules going to uh eat some food with a lot of fat content in it just to be sure it gets in the bloodstream in the most uh effective way possible uh and then the other big thing to know about these capsules is their surprising affordability uh buddies i've seen they have quite a few products i've seen um carts from them uh they are sort of partnered with packs i've seen pax pods uh and now of course these um soft gels uh and they're always quite affordable uh these soft gels are no exception soft gels are usually quite expensive um for example like the gold cap which was it used to be a big brand a thousand milligrams of this would have cost you uh well over a hundred bucks uh these were a scant forty eight dollars for a hundred or excuse me a thousand milligram uh capsules a hell of a good deal especially if they are as strong as advertised and then last thing i'll bring up is the lab test results they're on the side um so they do you know show that these have 50.7 milligrams of thc as uh denoted by their lab testings and then of course they give you all the other great manufacturing information on it uh and well let's go ahead and open it up take a look at our very shockingly small soft gels for something that's going to have 50.7 milligrams of thc supposedly there it is um nice looking oil actually a super consistent handsome little tablet capsule soft gel let's get that nomenclature correct so here is apparently 100 milligrams of thc uh i cannot wait to be impressed forgot to bring a beverage with me so you know what just gonna have to dry swallow down the hatch well there we go that's 100 excuse me 101.4 milligrams of thc according to their lab testing results so i'm really interested to see how these are going to fare uh that's going to take me and our custom review wheats review process two hours to find out i'm gonna uh chill out here hope to get quite high as i said eat some nice high fat meal and then two hours from now i'm gonna come right back to you guys here and say hopefully i'm super high well for that we'll all have to find out together see you guys right back here in just a bit [Music] my buddies my buddies my buddies and me i'm pretty sure that was the name of a child's toy from the 80s my buddy it's probably the inspiration for chucky what's not the inspiration for chucky is buddies 1 000 milligram soft gels or in our case one tenth of that 100 milligrams of buddies soft gels um and uh that's where the beginning and end of the similarities to chucky are um in every other way it's distinctively non-chucky-like um it never gets married it doesn't have children it doesn't break the fourth wall um buddies why were we talking about chutty chutties chuckies buddies they're pretty good 100 milligrams um of these uh i wouldn't say it's quite as strong as a um good solid baked edible but i'm not gonna complain that much either um that is the smallest footprint of a thousand mil or excuse me 100 milligrams i think i've ever taken uh and i am uh pleasantly quite high again for something that was so miniscule um and i have nine whole doses left in here uh equivalent size to doses all for uh that very affordable 48 bucks like you're not gonna you know um you're not gonna find ten edibles for that price so that's uh that's a pretty good uh gonna be a pretty good endorsement from me it's not the strongest hundred milligrams i've ever had uh but i am always always looking for things that are going to um pack uh sort of out i'll punch their weight class uh and these tiny again these things are so small uh that is 50 milligrams of thc right there dropped one better not let the dog get that um and uh so yeah very very happy with buddies looking forward to doing uh another nine rounds with them in fact um so i'm gonna give it you know what i'll just go ahead and give it two thumbs up of buddies their thc thousand milligram thought soft gels not the best hundred milligrams i've ever done but again a hell of a value and a tiny little footprint uh so before i go with you guys i mean anytime we do the big old siskel and ebert two thumbs upper uh we want to go and mix our metaphors even further so we want to go ahead and add a little cherry on top some you can sort of mole over think about enjoy watch process during your busy boring days um that is the coronavirus uh you know that you can do with or without weed and this week i want to leave you uh with one of the things that i love hearing the most and um uh and and it can be a bomb for our uh anxious times and that is the phrase uh this x can be a salve for these scary times um just pay attention and anytime there's something that isn't uh people are talking about that isn't scary or is vaguely pleasant you'll hear somebody in inevitably describe it as a bomb or a salve for these anxious scary trying boring uh you know pick your adjective times uh and uh then you get really irritated with it quite quickly so my cherry on top is uh my observation that you're gonna notice people saying an x for y a lot uh that x being a bomb or a south things people never use any other time um so why that seems so uh pertinent now i don't know what also isn't pertinent is this review of buddies thousand milligrams which we did a hundred of thumbs up also thumbs up this phrase which is um a a tincture for our a highly uh friction something something world um i failed to come up with another one wow this went on for a while buddies really great boy this one off the rails in the best way possible thank you so much for watching it's been great stay high stay healthy really do stay healthy and we'll see you guys on a later review also stay high goodbye", "UOHqixhs_Hs": "come on come on do you go do you like sweet baby boy alright we'll go after hi welcome to Angel's anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but", "0U_VnKq42XI": "hello everyone I'm Rick boxer I'm a urologist at UCLA and I am happy to be able to speak to you about cannabis and the urologic practice my colleague Neil Baum helped me with with this and I always give him all the credit he richly deserves and so in the this particular program we'll cover how does cannabis work the myths associated with cannabis safety of cannabis and the urologic applications the my journey to learn about cannabis started when I saw a patient a number of years ago who had been esthetic renal carcinoma he was in the intractable pain and anything that we gave to him was of no benefit and so therefore we he came to me and said I'd like to try cannabis and what do you think and quite frankly at that point I had no knowledge about it whatsoever nor did my colleagues I thought about it and and after he came back and had a very particularly terrible experience because the person who was supposed to help him could not help him and it was about seven or eight years ago in Los Angeles before that was when was only medical and so I decided I was going to learn more about this and as I learned about it I wrote about it and have been speaking about it but more importantly I wanted to share my knowledge with my colleagues because this is a patient driven and a patient driven medication and people want to know about it and it's only the best thing for your medical care to know about it I'm in no way advocating it I'm just simply saying knowledge is important so with that I want to proceed the responsibility of a urologist I believe is to just know a little bit about or even more about the use of the cannabis now it just the tip of the iceberg is some of the conditions that may be helped and we'll talk about those conditions in a moment but there is so much to learn about cannabis and one of the problems is that because it's Schedule one that is it's not allowed really to be researched within the universities the Schedule one has prevented and has become an obstacle to knowledge which i think is wrong so all of us end up having anecdotes and stories by patients and that is not the best way of guiding our care for the patient we really need to have evidence base on medicine and that evidence-based medicine will come but first the obstacle of being on schedule one like heroin or LSD has to be overcome 95 percent of us live in a state in that has either medical or fully legal matter of marijuana and only if you live in Nebraska South Dakota or Idaho is a completely prohibited otherwise your patients have the access to medical or for that matter recreational but we're doling and we talking about access to obtaining marijuana for medical purposes interestingly enough it's been illegal for so many years and it's been it's been considered to be dangerous all the way back into the 30s and far before that but in the 30s when there was reefer madness or than the 40s movies that that portrayed it as as a terrible drug well if you go back you find out that the Declaration in penance was written on hemp paper and so people have known about this for a long time the consumption of cannabis is based on speed rate of metabolism and choice there are various methods by which you can you can consume you can smoke or you can vape you can hear this person is using a bong which is water pipe you can consume in in candy or foods of some sort and what happens is that if the person takes cannabis by smoking or vaping you they get a much rep more rapid concerned by the cannabis you it's eaten it's a much slower effect because it has to be metabolized well under those circumstances some people will take one or two pieces of candy or or a brownie or a piece of candy in a candy bar and say oh nothing's happening and then they'll take a second or third piece and by the time the third piece or fourth piece is ever consumed the the effect will become multiplied that's why people need to be very cautious when they take medication through food which is metabolized now it's very interesting to me that the vascular system the lymphatic system and the nervous system have all been well described for hundreds of years and yet the endocannabinoid system was only discovered in 1992 and as you can see from the receptors the receptor of CB 1 which is THC which is more the the portion that people think about when they think about affect psychologically or neurologically or cv2 which is also known as CBD and people think well how can possibly have a medication or a drug that affects all parts of the body I mean literally soup to nuts and we are urologist we know the difference and so we have to wonder what is it about this drug this Mitali the CBD or TC that really affects everything well the fact is that there are different receptors for CB 1 against CB 2 and CB 2 are principally the ones that that will affect things that your urologist want to take care of particularly in reducing inflammation or reducing pain and so when you understand that the receptors throughout the body are different then you understand why CBD and THC and generally marijuana will affect different people in different ways the facts of about cannabis are that it's been used for thousands of years and it's but I showed you the number of states 33 states and history Columbia where it's medicinal should be um this Columbia is also recreational um it's off-limits for scientific investigation it's classified as Schedule one as I mentioned be same as heroin and LSD and in fact there's more research been done on heroin and LSD than on marijuana because of all the laws and truly became a and has become a political plant and there's limited evidence for abuse yes it can be abused but there is limited evidence and that's once again because the research does not allow people to really find out what is in that plant the plant has a hundred and forty-four chemicals within it and we only know of a few so cannabis and evidence-based medicine is critical in my mind because that's what we've been working on as to clinicians all of our professional lives patient values and preferences and best evidence and clinical expertise all Center in evidence-based medicine and since it is truly a patient driven medication people don't will not go to a doctor generally speaking a urologist and say what do you think I should take and the urologist starts off by saying take cannabis that's not going to happen what happens is the patient comes in and says I want to take cannabis how will that affect me because it's um it's been controversial and and promoted by lots of different organizations and groups and of people finally the National Academy of Sciences the medicine looked at it and put out in nineteen ninety nine twenty one years ago of a book that showed that the it is effective conclusively effective for chronic pain nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy that is chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting as well as muscle spasm and MS now those are the three things that that the National Academy is founded it is conclusively helpful for but there are complications and that's why the complications and pediatrics and pregnancy is that you the grade there is greater number of NICU NICU admissions in women who smoke marijuana or consume marijuana while pregnant there's also premature births and underweight well you think about it if those women were to take any other drug even alcohol for example or or other drugs such as cocaine which are much much more addictive of course they too would get greater number of ICU admissions and premature deaths that doesn't excuse it but it just shows you that that drugs are bad for pregnant women there's no conclusive evidence that it causes heart attacks strokes and diabetes it doesn't cause respiratory diseases such as chronic like chronics cigarette smoking there is some thought that if you smoke every day multiple marijuana cigarettes it would have some lung disease or issues but knowing very very very few people do that and actually including in California for decades people were smoking considerable amounts of marijuana and and studies show that they really were not affected like they would be had they been smoking cigarettes it does not improve immune competence and some people have even thought it would be good for treatment of testicular cancer there's no evidence of that whatsoever but for cardiovascular effects it does elevate systolic and diastolic soon aunt after consuming marijuana causes tachycardia increases sympathetic stimulation decreases a time to angina and there is a slight increase in Aminah and MI for one hour post marijuana use so now just like everything else in life you gotta take consideration any comorbidities and so therefore if someone were to have significant cardiovascular disease you would say that it's a bad idea to smoke marijuana for any purpose now another myth is that it's a gateway drug that has been disproven repeatedly and yet it is repeatedly spoken about and so it's all you can do is try and try again the National Academy of Medicine in the Institute of Medicine in 1999 the same book that I reference before has indicated that it is not a gateway drug but what we really need is research not anecdotes so that people will be able to know what - if it indeed is helpful another myth is that it causes cancer does not and when a person comes in to be seen and they ask about cannabis in the medical in a minute and see that only has medical marijuana and frankly just the knowledge of knowing what in a state that has recreational as well or adult use as well the you just have to say let us look at what is eat what is allowed in each state and that is for the medical purposes but and also it's good reference for you to be able to determine whether or not there's medical marijuana that would be helpful in any particular state and you can say well I guess that's at least anecdotally if not evidence-based that it might be helpful so for example in Illinois interstitial cystitis is a qualifying condition for the use of cannabis and so if a person were in California and they said well I've got painful spasms because of interstitial cystitis you could say to yourself well it is allowed in Illinois there may be proof that it is helpful and I I can't god I cannot prescribe it but I certainly can say that it is recommended or at least possibly used in Illinois cachexia due to cancer is another common condition that is that people use cannabis for to stimulate their appetite terminal illness hospice care chemotherapy induced nausea muscle spasms that's why I put in interstitial cystitis here because if it helps them MS muscle spasms maybe an interstitial cystitis as well or for that matter other muscle spasms it's it's been stating to me how well in Parkinson's spinal stenosis spinal cord disorders and we course see patients that have and have those conditions which resulting geologic illness PTSD rheumatoid arthritis sickle cell anemia at least the pain associated with it intractable pain and every state has the the ability or I should say has stated that if doctors find a condition that is diagnosed as debilitating then marijuana in a medical state can be recommended pain is the most common reason for for using the medical marijuana 100 million Americans have chronic pain and so this is the reason why chronic pain is the most common by far and away the most common reason why people use medical marijuana others is multiple sclerosis chemotherapy induced vomiting nausea and cancer as I listed before so you can see that over 50% of the people will want to use medical marijuana for chronic pain why again why 50% greater 50% use marijuana for pain well in 2016 214 million prescriptions of opioids were used more than 60 million Americans consumed acetaminophen on a weekly basis over 30 billion doses of NSAIDs were were given and 80 million aspirins are consumed a day not all of course are for pain but that's 117 aspirin tablets for every man woman and child in the United States the opioid crisis in the United States is is absolutely an epidemic and unfortunately know about epidemics now but is that an epidemic rate as many as one in five whose are opioid addicted received opioids as prescription for non-cancer pain 11 million abusing opioids and a million thousand people are go to the ER every day for opioid misuse the the most chilling thing is 72 thousand people who die every year and that is more deaths there are more deaths since a year 2004 opioid than all the deaths that occurred on the battlefields in every war since 1775 it is a spectacular amount of people who have have died and as it turns out marijuana is a could be a substitute II and some individuals and does not kill and this is the reason why it doesn't kill I think that this is the most important slide there is why do opioids kill and T C does not and the reason is the receptors the the cannabis receptors are in the in this portion of the brain and in the cerebellum the opioids are in the this portion but most importantly they are in the brain stem for breathing and so this is the reason why opioids kill and cannabis does not there has never been a death due to overdose of cannabis but seventy-two thousand people a year die of cannabis overdose in the United States as time has gone on it's become more and more legal in various states but more importantly and in this particular sideshows it that Americans believe it should that medical marijuana for sure should be legalized sixty-two percent versus thirty four percent and just in 1969 when when I went I was when I was in college in medical school 84 percent thought of what should be illegal and only twelve percent legal so attitudes have change and that's why your patients are coming in to talk to you about it so the summary is cannabis is safe it is not a gateway drug and it has several urological applications you can see that annual desk 435,000 from tobacco seventy five thousand from opioids none none from marijuana a hundred from peanuts so you can see that even even peanuts are more dangerous than marijuana the finally one joke by Bill Murray I find it quite ironic that most dangerous the most dangerous thing about about weed is getting caught with it so the dangers are few the the potential benefit is great and in it in this particular talk I hope I was not trying to convince you to use it but I'm trying to come to you about and educate you about why some people do so thank you very much if you wish to contact me there is my email address I wish you a great day thank you", "8Kjowe3W-Nc": "hi everybody my name is lynn suquan and i'm a member of the

great so yeah uh thanks again i'm excited to be here and talk about this subject today as it comes up often in our team meetings and client sessions as well so i'm going to be talking about marijuana and cbd and discussing kind of the pros and cons benefit of harm for anxiety can i just i think let me see okay there we go did the slide move for you uh i think go ahead i just i'm not sure if it's the view we want but go ahead i think it should be fine okay sounds good so starting off i'll just kind of give a general landscape of anxiety as well as cannabis use in the states right now so anxiety disorder prevalence worldwide an estimated 284 million people have an anxiety disorder and by anxiety disorder and in general that means either generalized anxiety disorder gad panic disorder social anxiety disorder or a specific phobia so an estimated 31 of u.s adults experience one of these disorders in general at some time in their life and an estimated 19 percent of u.s adults have had one of these anxiety disorders in the past year not on that list is ptsd which used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder and certainly entails a lot of anxiety um but i mentioned that because there will be some tie-ins later especially in regards to cbd and some potential research around ptsd as well so we'll kind of have that in mind okay so here's the latest graph i could find in terms of where the u.s is at in terms of legalization and different programs using cannabis as you can see 36 states and four territories have now passed some kind of law legalizing cannabis this could this could include uh thc based cannabis or medical marijuana as that or cbd all of the above these 36 states 15 states and three territories have adopted laws legalizing marijuana or thc based cannabis for recreational use and this has really been increasing exponentially since about 2012. and you can kind of see looking at our country here how widespread is becoming and there's this real contrast at this point between what's still the case at the federal level which is essentially at least on the book scene viewing it as an illicit drug and what's the reality for the bulk of our country at this point in terms of using it medically in some form or even beyond that okay okay so i thought i'd start off just with kind of some uh vocabulary because even i get kind of confused with all the different terms and and what's what and that kind of thing so for viewers who maybe aren't too familiar the base of what we're talking about is the cannabis plant which has several different strains you know uh most often or the ones you'll hear about is cannabis sativa or cannabis indica and within that cannabis plant there's groups of different compounds uh chemical compounds and one of those groups of compounds is the cannabinoids and this is going to entail both the thc compound which is the well-known kind of psychoactive compound that leads to the different effects of intoxication you've heard of kind of etc a different group of compounds is the cannabidiol or cbd uh this is the most abundant uh cannabinoids uh compound group in hemp but it's also in you know the cannabis plant or cannabis uh sativa but it's non-psychoactive uh it doesn't lead towards the high or the different psychoactive properties that you might traditionally think of in marijuana so it's been extracted and it's similarized and used for different growing health purposes as we're going to talk about the term marijuana itself is probably you know maybe the most confusing here because it kind of means different things at different points marijuana can mean the same thing as just the cannabis plant you know the marijuana plant or more often it's probably used as meaning a thc based cannabis product you know marijuana something that has thc that's used and you're going to experience the psychoactive effect or kind of a high from it cbd can't make me high cbd can't make you high correct in general it shouldn't but as we'll kind of talk about it isn't a really important point actually that comes up is um how we don't really have the exact science and practice of ensuring the cbd purity and dosage so if you went to a common dispensary and bought cbd right now not knowing much about it if you don't really know how much thc might be in it uh some cbd products have a fair amount up to three four five percent of thc and then it's just labeled a cbd another one might have some minimal amount that's that's negligent has zero in it so part of the issue we're facing right now is exactly that we don't totally know exactly what contains what's in a very regulated trusting kind of way so cbd something labeled as a cbd product in general shouldn't contain at least too much thc that would have an effect but that's not something you never know so that's that's kind of an ongoing challenging question okay okay so let's take a look at uh cannabis use numbers in the states prevalence has been increasing along with that graph that showed legalization increasing prevalence of use has been increasing pretty steadily there's been a 45 increase from 2007 to 2014. more importantly is the increase in what's called heavy users these are individuals who would use cannabis daily or near daily that's kind of what we're going to talk about as a heavy user or beyond daily multiple times daily that's going from one and nine to over one in three from 1992 to 2014. so that's a big increase that means that the use among users within the use of users the bulk of cannabis consumption is increasingly becoming concentrated around a smaller number of heavy users more and more you know as time kind of progresses here maybe you're going to get to this later but um there's often been a distinction that when they talk about a reliance or addiction is that there's a difference between the daily user and the recreational user uh in terms of impact um and i don't know if you're getting to that later or okay yeah absolutely most of these kind of real serious impacts we're going to talk about are going to be connected to this general term heavy user like you're saying in that frequency of use yeah which ties right into the the next point here which is that quote-unquote self-medication or using cannabis in a way that's beyond infrequent recreational and is used in a way to regulate or modify your mood or your affect habitually and this kind of thing using cannabis or marijuana in that way in states with legalization uh among individuals with anxiety and move disorders is the highest so what that means is in states like mine in california the rates of people who are using marijuana in a way that's self-medicating habitually is higher than states that don't have this legalization status quite yet you can you know i guess about different reasons why that might be there's certainly the proliferation of the legalization happening there's dispensaries popping up all over the point all over the place there's even delivery points that can knock on your door and kind of deliver your your cannabis and that kind of way without even having to go out or drive or go anywhere there's shifting public perceptions around it it's increasingly seen as less stigmatized as having more of a therapeutic value it's an all-natural uh means towards you know health so to speak is kind of what the perceptions are shifting towards and there's reasons they're shifting in that direction but the reasons aren't necessarily based off the research we have available yet so there's something going on there that we can kind of dive into a little bit okay let's see okay here's an example so this is i just did a screen grab off of a common uh cannabis dispensary website and this is the kind of marketing that you'll be likely to find pretty easily related to thc based cannabis at this point this one kind of says conquer your social anxiety and you can see six different products of marijuana on the bottom there that they're kind of advertising as being the helpful therapeutic ones for social anxiety so there's this marketing and social shift towards really viewing this thing as you know kind of you know micromanaging your high and using this for social anxiety and this for insomnia anxiety and this you know this product's gonna be for that and this is kind of the uh social and commercial atmosphere that's happening and has been happening you know for a while now that we're going to see is kind of way over here but in contrast to the actual research which is still kind of way back here so this is just kind of give a sense of what people are actually seeing you know what they're looking at when they're buying their products and the way they're thinking about uh using cannabis before they're coming into your office or kind of on their own this is kind of the this is kind of the focus out there right now okay so as we know cannabis use is increasing and more and more people are using marijuana and cbd to help with their anxiety symptoms so let's look at some numbers around this anxiety ranks among the top five medical symptoms that north americans report using medical marijuana for a big study in 2019 found that more than half of u.s adults receive cannabis as having a medical use xthc and cbd here's here's the important one though results show that approximately 29 to 30 percent of thc marijuana consumption was used to reduce stress and anxiety so something something's big is going on there that the thc this is marijuana being used that frequently for the number one reason stress or anxiety participants reported using cbd to replace medications to reduce pain there is evidence supporting that stress and anxiety and for better sleep and thc again was used most to reduce uh stress and anxiety and isn't anxiety one of the ones on the list for medical marijuana approval kind of well i'm going to go into in a little bit more detail okay go ahead yeah i'm sure i'll get there but at this point no not you know evidence at least thc based uh marijuana not really indicated you know as having a lot of research to back it up okay so this is kind of a surprising result like as you're asking because this marijuana has gained this kind of widespread approval and a lot of people think that as a treatment for mental health conditions and it's been legalized uh for many therapeutic uses you know pain relief you know these kind of things nausea uh different diseases but the research isn't there in terms of anxiety you know and stress but it's being used in this way so what's going on so what does the research actually show like you're asking should i be using marijuana that again this is thc based cannabis products for my anxiety at this point scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of or i'm sorry does one second my screen got locked here that should say um it is up there okay yeah so scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs primarily thc for several things pain relief control of nausea and vomiting and that being correlated in different kind of diseases and these kind of things and appetite stimulation you know especially in patients who might be undergoing chemotherapy or these kind of things can be very helpful for these things however a recent comprehensive review did not identify any really good quality literature that reported cannabis as an effective treatment for anxiety symptoms again that's thc-based cannabis beyond that frequency of use is associated with increased anxiety symptoms and future incidents of some problems in particular social anxiety disorder being one of them and we'll look at some more examples of this okay so despite the state of this research the public clearly reports using cannabis to reduce anxiety and it's increasingly viewed as an adaptive way to cope so why might this be one big reason is that low doses of thc do reportedly engender anti-anxiety effects you know this does happen out there this is you do see this and like you're saying a lot of people are going to report this and it's true low doses are going to probably in some most people sometimes uh reduce anxiety and offer kind of a relaxing effect however you as i'm sure everyone kind of knows you got to be careful because higher doses will do the exact opposite and they can often very commonly lead to increased anxiety panic um paranoia kind of feeling why um many people who i might meet with who described their first panic attack you know kind of describe something like this of having too much thc or being dehydrated and using thc and these kind of things so there's kind of this paradox with it where low dosage will probably be relaxing but higher doses are going to really totally do the opposite more importantly than that is that heavy use and chronic use like those heavy users we were talking about who use daily every other daily especially to regulate mood and affect it's going to build up in their system and there's going to be a sort of a dependence that happens where when they stop using or when they're no longer in taking thc there's likely going to be some withdrawal symptoms there's going to be anxiety altered appetite or sleep there's likely going to be irritability or kind of an irritable mood and irritable depression that can kind of develop and these are going to be very uncomfortable things and if the very reason that they were using thc was to kind of modulate some of those aversive feelings here they are coming back tenfold when they stop using what's going to happen further use so they're going to get caught in this cycle of kind of using it but it could become self-perpetuating of these very issues that they were looking to find help with around it so this is kind of partially what explains kind of this discrepancy between what the research shows and why it's so often viewed as a way of helping anxiety because a person might go through a particular night you know or moment and use it in a way that truly brought their anxiety down or they will they were able to cope with the social situation and they got through it by using it that way but there was kind of the devil in disguise there and that they were actually not ultimately helping themselves through something like an anxiety disorder by using it that way it was actually exacerbating the problem a lot of my clients say i i had my social anxiety but this helps me get out the door and helps me be social um and uh and so what's wrong with that right if i can't you know get out with without it what what should i do what am i supposed to do bingo and they're probably right at the outset that it does help them to get out the door right i mean it probably does kind of shift their mood or affect their physiology or thinking and they're able to get out the door that day by using thc using marijuana but is the disorder is the social anxiety decreasing over the long run in the course of their life or is what's actually happening is they're using it temporarily in that way but perpetuating the need for further use of it in that way and missing out on the opportunity to do something different which is of course what we do you know in developing skills like in cognitive behavioral therapy and finding alternative ways of identifying and altering and facing that fear in a way to truly tolerate it you know and overcome it they're kind of staying in the same place by using it to get out the door that way have you ever thought it can be combined in some way to to meet the needs well i think when it comes to thc probably not but as i'm going to get to there's potential too early to say but maybe you know using uh some combination with cbd might be effective more effective as kind of a combination i'll talk about that more in a bit but i wouldn't recommend it in terms of thc based cannabis products okay so we're kind of this is good because we're kind of already talking about this but this is um these are just some screen shots of a twitter feed i was randomly uh scrolling through at some hour of the night this week and uh the thread was around uh anxiety and cannabis and this just kind of shows some of the at times humorous but uh kind of perspectives of how people are thinking about cannabis use for anxiety so this one person says indica makes me so tired that i don't get anything done and that gives me more anxiety or another person wrote i prefer sativas so i can blame my anxiety on the weed instead of myself or another person wrote just like you said sativa is the only thing that gets me out of bed and allows me to talk to people without fear this person says oddly enough i have an anxiety disorder but indicas make me more paranoid so i prefer sativas is that weird question mark so these kind of show a couple points to me on the one hand it kind of shows that in terms of someone who wants to say is you know sativa the good thing for my anxiety is indica the good thing for my anxiety what's the right way to you know take it what's the good one uh there's no real answer you know someone might tell you there is but depending on the person the situation other compounds involved in whatever the product they're taking there's not anything close to a scientifically based answer to the rights weed for you in any particular moment or situation and the other one it kind of shows up people are thinking about it though this kind of is like yeah this is that research we saw that people are perceiving thc perceiving cannabis in this way that they can kind of fine-tune and is going to be helpful for their anxiety but again we're kind of recognizing the problems and challenges with that kind of uh approach to it here okay so we'll go from twitter to this more academic theory based model here this is by um buckner and his colleagues and what this is is just kind of a little bit more detailed and nuanced theory around this general idea of self-medication so this is a model for people with social anxiety disorder you know what the motivation for cannabis use or substance use you know would be so for example one person might want to smoke to get out the door to be able to socialize and there might be multiple layers of that they might be having many thoughts before they walk out the door of how am i going to look am i going to be judged is something bad going to happen am i going to know what to say in this social interaction am i going to get rejected they're flooded with these negative aversive anticipatory thoughts so by smoking or using the thc before walking out the door what happens to those evaluation fears they're just kind of able to be numbed out who cares yeah yes i don't have to think about that anymore and that's what it's doing or maybe the person's starting to feel incredibly nauseous or their stomach's becoming upset because of the anxiety before walking out the door so what does smokey do oh it calms their digestive system so they're managing their physiological arousal in that moment before walking out the door perhaps is to avoid social evaluation or some kind of negative social judgment oh everybody else is you know doing it so i'm going to avoid any negative social evaluation they might facilitate their social confidence in some kind of way or might just increase positive affect so there's multiple layers and if you're working with someone or even you know someone kind of learning this for themselves you want to think about in detail what's the function of this use for me without any pressure or judgment around it starting to think and observe how and why and what function is this serving or multiple functions does the serve in a particular kind of way and do i want to set myself up to create a dependence on this substance to manage this component here or you know if i want to find i'm involved in you know treatment or therapy or find help on your own or self-help it's like how can i know these functions and look to develop alternative skills to manage these evaluation fears manage that fear of judgment manage my physiological arousal what other pathways of targeting these components can you find for yourself and that's god that's kind of how i would um you know approach someone with this challenge here okay so in summary regarding uh thc danger is about over utilization particularly in heavy users for coping motivated cannabis use that's kind of would be my main thing to focus on take away from it the dangers they can create would be leading towards like i was just talking about to psychological dependence it's going to interfere with the possible learning that could happen by not using it and learning how to cope with those feelings and get out the door anyway which ultimately over the long run is going to maintain the symptoms of anxiety i can exacerbate the symptoms over time like we're saying through just maintaining the course of the disorder and even exacerbating physiological kind of withdrawal symptoms uh could potentially lead towards greater reliance on the substance or even an overt substance use disorder and there's especially high risk around chronic use in adolescence there's no reason are you going to say more about that um i i see a lot of that in my practice and and they're they're smoking alone and often to go to sleep uh or at the end of the day rather than in the socially anxious kind of situations of going out there it's kind of isolated uh alone um use yeah yeah especially if there's an adolescent who's in this kind of high you know high use you know daily to every other or or more then there's even some more recent research about how how dangerous kind of the long-term associations are with that things like depression earlier onset of psychotic symptoms these are the things that are being linked to intense adolescent use you know this is the time where the brain is still developing during adolescence and using thc with that frequency around that time is going to alter the wiring it can even impact uh there's some studies that can even impact iq scores you know permanently using it frequently around adolescents so if there's one thing to highlight to be wary of and intervene and trying to find alternative coping methods for it would be you know that kind of use in an adolescent [Music] okay so not necessarily encouraging therapeutic news for cannabis when it comes to thc based products but certainly some understanding of the nuances of it of how it works and the dangers of it to be aware of how about cannabidiol how about cbd what does the research show can i should i can i be using cbd for my anxiety well as terms of right now you know that same comprehensive review found limited evidence that cbd is effective for anxiety symptoms however in terms of this study limited is something uh it's these are kind of stringent uh terms that they use to define it basically it means that it's just it's brand new you know the research is picking up the past couple years but it's still really in its infancy and it's not grown to the point of having firm recommended proven recommendations for it for anxiety at this time that being said let's look into a little bit more detail on what some of these very initial studies and the directions you know they might point us in here and again we're talking about cbd so this is now the non-psychoactive compounds of hemp or of cannabis not the products that are going to be giving any kind of high shouldn't be at least that's kind of what we're talking about now okay so starting off there is this one study that showed cbd was shown to reduce acute anxiety assessed by a public speaking test in patients with social anxiety disorder so what happened was there was a you know group of patients who had social anxiety and they were kind of impromptu giving this performance task of giving a public speaking activity which of course would induce anxiety you know for people who had social anxiety disorder and the group that was given cbd right before acutely uh was shown to report that had an anxiolytic effect an anti-anxiety effect they reported less stress less anxiety giving that public speaking test versus the people with social anxiety who didn't uh receive the cbd who received a placebo so this is kind of the these were kind of some of the initial studies of what they're showing that acute administration at least initially it does lead towards kind of the subjective reduction in anticipatory or performance anxiety regarding at least most of them are around social anxiety it's an example of anxiety but it's kind of showing this overall anti-anxiety acute effect that it will kind of play and there's a couple of studies showing that you know at this point so that's interesting let's let's say these are going to continue and you know the evidence is going to build around it and we're going to kind of find that maybe cbd does offer this calming acute effect and that's something that's interesting but even with that i would say there's a difference we want to be aware of between uh what's helpful with reducing acute anxiety and what's actually helpful with something like social anxiety disorder the course of the disorder so we you know we want to think about everything in context you know in cbt we're always looking at what are you know what really needs to change whether what are the maintaining variables that are contributing to this disorder being maintained over time and one of them is typically avoidance avoidance of feeling anxiety avoidance of feeling anxiety and social interaction situations and again if we're taking something to reduce that anxiety every time habitually then we're still not going to necessarily develop the skills or shift in thinking or coping confidence that's going to actually relieve something like the whole disorder over time so it's interesting but we want to be kind of careful at that just based off the off of these i'd say you know if you're have something every now and again like a speech or a presentation or something like that and uh cbd is used every every now and then to kind of reduce it or perhaps if it was for anxiety around falling asleep if you used it once a month or you know periodically like that and it did have that calming effect for you then that might make sense but on the other hand the same i would argue the same principle applies that falling into using this habitually this is what i'm relying on to feel less anxious and without that those fears of mine are still just as real you're not going to tackle what really needs to be tackled to overcome you know something like a social anxiety disorder or a panic disorder or something like that but if it lets me get to the party doesn't it kind of wear off and i still have to use my skills once it wears off probably you will still have to use your skills once it wears off yes i would imagine you'll feel your anxiety will jump right when you notice it's starting to wear off and uh that might be a challenging scenario so yes it is good that it gets you to the party and that might be an interesting way of potentially using it you know if we were working with someone individually and that's kind of how we conceptualized and planned for it and the commitment was to still be there and use your skills or have an exposure to do something at the party uh perhaps it's better to get to the party with uh in that way without other than kind of not getting there at all you know if you can test it out and it would still be productive by the end of the night uh possibly possibly uh but on the other hand if we always need cbd and there's no growth beyond that if it stays like that then probably not but if it's in the service of building that exposure and confidence and eventually you commit and don't need it to get to the party then yeah maybe that would be a potential you know you could kind of work out with i'd want it to be in a very individualized kind of plan you know doing that with someone but possibly possibly okay good so this was another study a little bit different this study looked at adolescence adolescents 18 to 19 year olds in japan who had social anxiety and this was different from those other studies because this actually was over the course of four weeks and the individuals with social anxiety were just taking uh the milligrams don't get don't have the exact dosage off the top of my head right now just once per day over the course of four weeks compared to individuals with social anxiety who didn't take the cbd and you can kind of see these are two different uh social anxiety scales the two graphs and you can see on the one on the left the blue uh bars uh you can see the individuals who are taking cbd once per day reported a significantly decreased symptomology of social anxiety over the course of those four weeks same with the different social anxiety the level with social anxiety scale on the right individuals taking cbd once per day reported less overall social anxiety over the course of those four weeks so this is a little bit more interesting because it's not necessarily just taking it in that acute moment of performance or anxiety it's taking that's kind of overall a little bit more chronically which is encouraging that it's kind of showing these results but they're still no long-term follow-up on the study beyond those four weeks so we don't really know what happens continuing after that or if the cbd use stopped you know what happened from there so it's still kind of an initial study but interesting and good in the fact that it was more a little bit more of a chronic kind of use you know versus more acute use okay so here's some other interesting studies with cbd there's some initial evidence that cbd can enhance what's called extinction learning which means it might serve like you're asking about and we're kind of hinting at here in the future it might turn out to serve as a potential adjunct to behavioral therapies exposure therapies like what happens in cvt or behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders so what this kind of means is that using adding cbd to a behavioral kind of relearning process for example say someone was afraid of heights and in order to conquer their fear of heights they wanted to try to extinguish or create extinction learning around that fear or that conditioned stimulus so what they're going to do is we're going to expose to frequent and prolonged situations that involved kind of a progressive facing of fear of heights scenarios and what this study kind of demonstrated is that doing something like that but administering cbd even after some of that extinction learning had occurred so after those exposures had kind of shifted some learning that enhanced how strong that extinction learning progressed so what that means is that enhanced uh someone's ability to feel diminished anxiety around purifieds as an analogy but a situation like that this enhanced the learning to say that doesn't have to be as much of a threat for me and that's over the course of time you know that's kind of more uh longer term so this is really where i get interested in the potential of it because it might be able to find a way we don't know exactly the timing or the dosage or how yet but there might be ways of being able to enhance already proven evidence-based strategies to habituate to fearful scenarios or whether it's kind of a phobia or whether it's something like a trauma from the past connecting it back to ptsd there might be something there that helps reorganize the memory or in the learning or enhance it in ways to start to feel less less of a threat response to these built up fearful scenarios that people experience so this another study kind of showed a similar thing cbd may help produce an enduring reduction in learned fear expression when given strategically along with behavioral treatment so it's very initial a very it's very early on but there's could be this helpful contributory effect that cbd might play along with something like traditional behavioral exposure strategies to decrease fear expression to things like fear of social scenarios or feared past traumas or fear phobias or we might be able to find these areas where we can apply this and the benefits of it you need to learn more about exactly how but the benefits of really might help in the future to develop stronger treatments you know in terms of um other proven behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders so these are these are kind of the fascinating studies for me about the potential of this and if we can get this the studies going further and further where this might uh you know more nuance it and get some actual guidelines of direction what this actually might look like um these are these are kind of the exciting parts of it from from what i'm seeing here okay so let's kind of summarize a little bit the picture with cbd most current studies again still examine more acute single cbd dosing and healthy subjects so further studies are required to establish whether chronic dosing of cbd has similar effects well we still need to get more studies around that but overall you know the summary reviews really emphasize the potential value of cbd and treating anxiety disorders but i need to add to that we're nowhere near knowing exactly you know how when and having a protocol for it so there's need for further study of cbd in the treatment of anxiety disorders and what really needs to happen is we need to develop and standardize dosing studies to inform you know what the dosing strategy is going to be exactly which means how much when for which disorder and which situation for which patients etc again we don't still really have a clear way of determining the purity of cbd you know that we know we're getting cbd and the right one and the right dosage it's like we need to have ways of straightening that out but if we can kind of move in that direction um we'll be able to determine you know what cbd's place as an alternative as an alternative or again supplemental therapy of other evidence-based approaches like seaweed like cbt so it'll be interesting and fascinating to keep a watch and see how this uh this research and the subject progresses here okay so again here's my information and if there's any of course follow-up questions uh feel free to get in contact with me and i'll be happy to share what i know and what i learn more in the future uh dr young a number of people talk about using cbd for sleep and even ask about giving their kids a cpd for sleep what do we know about it helping sleep which is commonly going on with anxiety yeah depression well i think what the studies are kind of showing is that it does offer some of that's probably uh the only the only reference would be some of that acute anti-anxiety effect so if anxiety is the thing getting in the way of the sleep or falling asleep then it very well could offer kind of a short-term benefit of decreasing that anxiety which might allow someone to fall asleep you know easier but i'd offer the same cautions with it that using it in that kind of way um it might be better than you know the other prescribed sleep medications out there in the sense that i might have less side effects or potential for you know tolerance or addiction or other kinds of things but it still might not get to the heart of what you need for enduring skills and strategies or get to the heart of the problem for you know what's kind of driving the insomnia so it might help in the short term but i wouldn't recommend using it habitually at this point still or coming to rely on it or use it as a substitute for other great treatments that are still available out there to use that you know between cbt and mindfulness-based approaches and sleep hygiene and i would go to these places first you know certainly to try and develop that um in terms of children i wouldn't recommend that now i think there was like one one anecdotal uh study i found around using cbd for insomnia and a 10 year old but uh the studies are just kind of nowhere near frequent enough to kind of recommend around that for someone you know at that age certainly so i would i would stay away from that and if i find marijuana helpful for me how can i help getting not get dependent on it well when it comes to thc you know marijuana using it in that way do your best as soon as you can to kind of start to do what i was talking about earlier start to really look at and understand the function of use that it might be serving for you and if it's going down that road of leading towards kind of the quote-unquote self-medication or using it to modulate affect or anxiety or these other kinds of things then it's going to quickly go in a direction that's going to exacerbate the problem so i would recommend as soon as you can you know becoming aware of that you know trying your best to only use it in ways that aren't fulfilling that function so you know if you're using it recreationally or to relax or enjoy or whatever it is sporadically then that's another thing but i would recommend trying to alter the function of the use or if that's a real challenge to do and you kind of find yourself lacking the skills or ability to kind of do that on your own that would be the point in time where i'd recommend kind of reaching out for help whatever that's going to look like for you you know social help or friend help or therapeutic help that's the time to really say wait i can there are other skills and proven strategies i can develop to learn how to get out the door or to regulate this feeling or to cope with this situation let me try and explore those sooner rather than later before the self-fulfilled increased problems develop over using thc in that kind of way so that would be you know that'd be what i'd recommend for it and i know everyone's different but if i'm a parent and i know that my uh adolescent or young adult is kind of using daily and and using as i said alone what what sir what does that usually serve in your ex in your clinical experience um when you know when uh when there's daily use but it's really kind of solitary and and not when facing you know anxiety provoking or difficult situations yeah it it might not be related to a function of use for anxiety in that situation it might be probably not a social anxiety or something like that maybe they're just kind of using it on their own to regulate their mood you know or their affect or they're trying to regulate you know perhaps a depression by increasing that positive affect or that numbness or whatever that's coming along with it that would be the questions i would probably see as likelier to look into so you'd want to kind of formulate and kind of dive into you know trying to individually find the answer to that question with each person with each client i stay away from blankets kind of assumptions of why it's happening right try and dive into the details of what the actual thoughts and motivation and what it's actually doing it's a great question that's what we exactly need to find out for every person we're talking to is specifically what it's doing is it's shifting is it numbness is it shifting mood is it avoiding something that's all great helpful information to start to understand and and try and work with to find more helpful avenues to meet that need and one more question of um do you know anything about taking cbd along with other medicines not much research i'm aware of on that too much other than i know other than it can potentially interfere with some things but not that i've seen as being too much yet in terms of major red flags with it but it's i don't think the research is available that i know of or that i've seen to really give a strong answer i'd still be careful you know for sure taking other prescription medications or psychotropic medications i would certainly talk to my psychiatrist around it and not just start taking it that kind of thing potentially but um i'm not too aware of specific you know research on it well thank you dr elin this has been very helpful is there anything else you wanted to add before we finish up in addition to your presentation uh no that's it just to be excited to keep an eye on the research but to remain patient as the gap between the legality and the social scene of it uh is much farther ahead of the research right now so just to be aware of that gap and to be skeptical and patient before we catch up to actual real you know kind of recommendations for this but to be excited about cbd and the potentials at the same time well thank you very much thank you my pleasure", "3wD0KpsGIhI": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats and it is tincture time guys one of my favorite things to review here on your marijuana review show uh we are taking a look at a product from select we've reviewed quite a few things from select in the past they're sort of the jack of all trades of uh marijuana companies we've reviewed carts i think i've reviewed um disposables um they're in a lot of different uh markets select they're selling a lot of different products and one of those is the tincture and they have a pretty uh wide tincture line now have had it for a while with a whole bunch of different kinds of dosages and mixtures between thcs and cbds and different potencies and yada yada yada so this one here i purchased at a dispensary in long beach for 50 i believe um and it is a pretty good value for what you get inside of this box and it is a little confusing i'll show you here um so this is a one to one tincture uh one to one thc cbd one milligram for one milligram however that's not actually true uh it does say there this is the unflavored 500 milligram thc 500 milligram cbd well actually there's a sticker up here clarifying it's actually 600 milligrams thc and 513 cbd so you get a little extra great who doesn't love that uh and then uh as i said this is their unflavored i think they also have like lemon and ginger other things uh and on the side we've got our dosing uh sort of guidelines um they recommend that each full dropper is 10 milligrams which is a single serving and they say this whole uh tincture bottle has 60 droppers in total which makes sense for 600 milligrams of thc um so we've reviewed a lot of tinctures here i really like tinctures uh they usually work pretty well for me and i absolutely love the form factor uh we'll be doing this one sublingually like we do with most of our tinctures under the tongue which means it actually comes on quite a bit quicker than if you were just taking it like any other edible uh the effects can start to hit as soon as about 15 minutes and really get going at about 45. um so uh let's go ahead and get this open i was looking okay so this is uh an mct oil based um tincture i was wondering what their base was and it is mct oil which is basically just coconut oil so it is coconut oil but just a specific uh chain of molecules i guess um okay so let's open her up our one-to-one drops now i'm not particularly a big cbd guy uh it's not something that is especially um helpful or useful for me i i don't really um uh get a lot of benefit from cbd uh more power to everybody who does i'm i'm glad you really enjoy it uh i don't dislike cbd it's just it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on me but i will definitely keep an eye out uh because this one is almost equal parts cbd in here as well we'll see if that makes me feel any different than the normal thc review uh so like all of our weed reviews we're gonna do uh or excuse me tincture reviews we do uh 100 milligrams not the whole thing and not just a single dropper i like to do that as our baseline for pretty much every tincture so that would mean 10 full droppers of this is going to be our dose we'll see how that goes uh i'll probably do three or four two or three four on camera with you and then the uh remainder that i will be doing the next you know six seven i will probably do on a live stream i've been doing a lot of live streaming thank you to everybody joining in um and i'll probably do uh a little bit more there so i hope to see some of you guys join in for our live streams anyways i'm going to shut up now and i'm going to go and open this up and get this process started smells like nothing at all not a thing okay i'm expecting this to taste uh very neutral uh as mct oil tinctures normally are uh not able to get the full milligram it's only about the 75. got to keep that in mind i have to do uh maybe closer to 13 drops in total uh hung ahaha [Music] um [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] hmm [Music] [Music] [Music] okay that's all i'm gonna do um i i there are uh various opinions about how long you should leave it i usually go for about a minute or two and that seems to do the trick pretty well uh and as i i suspected largely tasteless just that vaguely kind of coconutty oil aftertaste um but it's so un you know it's just it's it's really uh it's not a big deal at all i took three droppers full and don't even feel like i uh need to rinse my mouth out or anything um so in terms of the uh unflavoredness of this tincture it is really unflavored um so we've done our first three or two and a half worth droppers there i've got another you know we'll say 10 to do because i wasn't able to get the full one dropper uh and as i said i'm gonna hope to do some of that with you guys on a live stream uh before i wrap this review up oh i think i forgot to mention uh like all of our wheat's reviews after i do my 10th dropper or so uh about two hours or so after that i'll come back here and let you guys know if this select one to one cbd thc tincture is as good as i am hoping until then stay high stay healthy hi guys i am back about three and a half hours after our first journey with the select one to one drops 600 milligrams of thc in the very specific 513 milligrams of cbd that's not how much i did i did about between 100 and 150 milligrams would be my guess which is probably between 80 and 120 milligrams of cbd and a lot of you got to hang out with me while i was reviewing this we did a little bit of a live stream and i appreciate everyone who tuned in uh and to all those who were there you probably remember that i liked this quite a bit this is very good um an affordable tincture i see it for about 50 bucks normally which is already a good deal for 600 milligrams of thc then you get the added bonus of that one to one cbd double-year cannabinoid goodness um so normally the cbd stuff doesn't really do a lot for me i'm not a big big big huge user of cbd or even sort of i don't really get the uh too much of the positive effects uh i respect it as a product it's just not super effective on me but i did notice it here um the the the high i'm experiencing is way more relaxed even than normal um sort of very very pleasant kind of experience less cerebral than normal for me not really neurons really aren't firing quite as much but i feel very at peace so i'm going to attribute that to the almost equal amounts of cbd in here so this select one-to-one unflavored drops it gets a really really big thumbs up for me i like it quite a bit my dog's thinking about barking but she's not going to she's not going to she really wanted to um so yeah huge thumbs up for me and before i bounce here guys i want to share with you a little cherry on top a little something that you can enjoy that i can share with you that isn't necessarily about wheat in this one you may not want any weed before you check this out because it might be a little too much i'm going to recommend a couple of books from a japanese uh illustrator it's manga i'm sorry i'm a nerd i guess it's only the second one i've ever read so don't judge me too harshly um the artist and writer is a guy by the name i apologize if i'm mispronouncing it junjie ito um and the two books i want to recommend from him that are utterly grotesque i mean truly some of the most shocking images i've ever seen somebody uh put pen to paper but i mean that in the best kind of way uh they are depraved in the most uh wonderful kind of cosmic hori sense of depraved uh and those are guillot geo again probably mispronouncing it which means fish in [ __ ] japan um and uh the other one is uzumaki which means spirals and it's all about spirals and i think adult swim is gonna do some kind of adaptation i've talked a lot about genji ito don't mix the two that's my advice definitely try this and definitely give junjie e2 a shot if you're a fan of gross stuff but keep them apart all right guys well that's going to do it for this review here on wheats really like the select give a huge recommendation my boy genji whatever however i'm sorry i'm still very high so thank you so much for watching guys stay high stay healthy and we'll see you for the next review i'm hoping my dogs aren't going to trip they might we did it [Music] you", "1AkwOXETsQE": "hello dr.

it's made in the USA comes directly directly from an organic hemp farm Dona Florida which I personally have seen them grow that help themselves when you open it up it smells like cannabis if you're familiar with how that smells this is not some type of product that you could just go around the corner and pick up at your local pharmacy highly proven and organic ingredients and what I like about it is no need to massage you open it up you could put it anywhere you have your pain whether it be the neck back shoulder hip or knee and we recommend applying this three to five times a day for

recognize the cannabis we're talking about gets distilled into a thick oil that's nearly solid at room temperature it mixes well with the makings of chocolate which are also fat based so companies like Stillwater ingredients hired experts from the candy industry we've solved it before our eyes they pour these crystals into a glass of water and they appear to dissolve lipids cannot dissolve in water but you can do is coat them in a surfactant and then enable them to be water compatible Industrial sauna mechanics makes this contraption that sends sound waves through the cannabis oil to break

brand I'm not getting paid to do this video this is all like I bought this product with my money nobody said this to me for free this is for real my dead ass feelings about cannabis oil and the benefits that it does for my super dry skin okay like anyone watching this if you think of dry skin you really don't you don't mean my dry skin is redonkulous okay my face be ashy for no reason and no warning no heads-up no nothing it's just dry it's dry and if your returning viewer of my beauty channel Slade parents this one right here you guys know that I rant and raved about how much I love this right here this is the Tony moly hundred hour cream and this stuff is amazing for my skin like I have no complaints about it but I feel like it works best when I'm going to bed because then when I wake up my skin still hasn't wish'd you're in it because it is a hundred hour cream so it's moisturizing my skin for a literally a hundred hours it feels like so I'm not knocking this whatsoever I just personally in my skin regimen I like to use this before I go to sleep and when I wake up sometimes if I forget to put it on before I go to bed now I love this stuff but it's a cream and I am NOT hugest is hugest a word I don't know I'm not a huge fan of face creams I tried this one out because well I bought it because it said maschino and it's like really cute packaging but I bought this one because I wanted it to like just sit on my vanity look cuter whatever and then one day I was like let me just try it and they loved it but normally I use face oils for everything because my skin is super dry and oil absorbs better into my skin rather than creams although like I said before this cream is amazing but I'm the type of girl that I like to try new things I get bored of products really easily I like to try new methods of things like if I have a cream I want to try the oil if I boil or try and miss like that's just who I am I like to mix things around until I find like something that I'm completely in love with and I want to repurchase for the rest of my life and I think I may have found it in this cannabis oil once again not sponsored I went to Sephora and I was looking through a bunch of cannabis oils that I thought would match my skin and this is the one that I just liked the most like the description of it was very appealing to my skin type because my skin type maybe even dry my skin type is action you know I mean and I said it adds moisture to your skin it has omega-3 fatty acids in it actually omega-3 six and nine fatty acids in it it's organic there's just a lot of beneficial ingredients in this product that made me feel like this is the one that I want to try rather than because there are a lot of other cannabis oils out there that do the same thing but this one just appeal to me a little bit more so I decided to pick this one up for around 48 to 60 dollars something like that and it is the before emerald cannabis sativa have deep moisture glow oil and as you guys can see I'm glowing it's not to believe that I have super dry skin I'm glowing hey so even though it's cannabis oil it's actually made from the hemp of cannabis which does not give you like a THC like you're not gonna get hot you ain't gonna put this on your face and be high as a kite you ain't gonna feel no type of psychedelic effect this is purely the beneficial ingredients for your skin from cannabis that is in this bottle here it's in a beautiful green color as you can see here have to do this because anyone who uses face oils often knows that this is important because if I do this and it's not moving as fast as this is and it's going a little bit slow and muggy that means that it's gonna take forever to absorb in your skin you know what I'm saying it's like a thick consistency you don't like it that's well me anyways firstly I don't like thick consistencies when it comes to well it has to move like water when it moves like water you just know that it's gonna absorb to your skin really quickly so it comes with this dropper applicator and let me just show you really quickly gonna do three drops I want to show you guys how quickly this absorbs into your skin first of all look at it drip look at that it's like water again my face oil lovers understand why I have to show that but if I rub it in for you guys you're gonna see how quickly it absorbs into my skin look at that quick and it's not sticky at all there's no type of stickiness whatsoever it's literally fast absorbing and leaves your skin looking like silk let's do a comparison of this dry ass hand and the ones that I just put the whale on oiled hand regular hand do you guys see that now you know camera trick guys realized look at that crazy and I know a lot of people are curious about the smell it doesn't smell like weed it smells very um fresh it's very smells like lavender almost like it's a very fresh floral scent and the instructions actually tells you to breathe heavily in to help you relax and I truly believe that when I put this oil on and I breathe in I feel like a very relaxing feeling throughout my body not like I'm high but like I'm at a spa and I'm breathing in incense or something it's just a very relaxing calming feeling it's really really nice it feels luxurious and for the money and the way it makes my skin look it's worth it's worth every penny so after using this oil for the past two weeks I have to say I will never go to another face oil ever for the rest of my life and I know I've only been using it for two weeks but within two weeks I can always tell if I like a product because normally if I try a skin product and I've never tried it before I will break out within the next 48 hours I haven't broken out my skin is gleaming it's an amazing base for your makeup before your primer I use this as my moisturizer before my primer it's amazing my skin complexion has been so much more clear and it's like every day that I use it as I wake up I see my skin getting so much more healthier and I haven't changed anything in my skin routine except for this so this is the answer this is the reason why my skin is gleaming the way it's gleaming glowing the way it's glowing look in the way it's looking you know I'm saying I just have to share it with you guys and let you guys know how amazing this product is again not sponsored so you can pick this up at Sephora or you can pick it up at the herbivore website as well I believe fun fact I wanted to bring this to New York with me but I was scared that I was gonna get in trouble cuz it said cannabis sativa on it but I don't think I would have back trouble but yeah the pros of this product is it is not sticky whatsoever it's quickly absorbed into your skin it definitely moisturizes your skin for hours on end it has a relaxing soothing scent to it that really like makes you just feel very calm it has evened out my skin tone you get a good amount of product for the amount of money that you pay and you literally look like you're glowing hello the cons about this product I honestly cannot find not even one corner whatsoever I was sitting here I was thinking I was trying to like figure out what could I possibly say because there has to be something wrong with the product nothing the scent is amazing the dropper is amazing the size is perfect like everything is great I have nothing bad to say about this product whatsoever so if you have super dry brittle skin I would definitely recommend you try out the herbivore emerald cannabis teeth I have deep moisture glow oil at your local Sephora you could always go to Sephora just in case you guys didn't know you could always go to Sephora and ask them for a sample of this they'll give it to you in a little container try it out for about three days you're gonna see a huge difference and you're definitely gonna want to buy the full bottle of this because I'm not going back to anything else anything else this stuff is absolutely amazing so in two weeks cannabis oil has definitely restored my skin's moisture made a my skin complexion way more even and has me glow into the dog okay we've kind of navalore let me know if you'd ever tried cannabis oil on your skin let me know what kind of skin type you have let me know if you've even heard of this product or even knew that you could put cannabis oil on your skin if you have dry skin everybody sure works for like combination skin as well I wouldn't recommend for oily although you do need oil for oily skin I feel like this has a little bit too much too many oils are in this they have omega fatty acids they have a whole bunch of different whales than they I feel like there's too much oil in this for someone with Whaley skin what combination you should be okay so definitely check out the spore website to see if this matches your skin type let me know in the comment section down below but make sure you find me on Saturn in Israel all that doesn't description box down below for your convenience thank you guys so much for watch this video I'll see you in the next one poodels", "bo9qKWBA0hs": "yahwah's good you two happy Sunday what's the date Saturday for me but well I I mean but it's a it's gonna be uploaded on Sunday so you're good you're good happy Sunday everyone or Saturday no it's it's Sunday for you now cuz you're seeing this on Sunday but or I mean maybe Monday or whatever day of the week it is today I'm gonna take a bunch of weed pills and see what happens I've taken thirteen before one time but it wasn't it wasn't these ones the ones that I made before when I took thirteen weren't nearly as potent as these these ones I used more reclaim than those other ones if you guys want to see how I make my reclaim pills I have a youtube video up just go to my profile and you can find it so I make reclaim or THC caps with reclaim these ones are pretty strong probably around 60 milligrams each maybe a tiny bit more I'm gonna take six of them right now I normally take two and when I take two I get pretty blazed and a lot of the times often take two and then I'll take two more so on I'm taking four in a day but you know spaced out and then that'll Holly not need to smoke as much because I'll be pre placed throughout the day enough I'm trying to be or whatever so today we'll see what happens if I take six so let's say that let's start taking these I'm really really bad at taking weed pills um just cuz they're fat I mean these pills are you it's [ __ ] hard you miss okay though we'll get to it look into it one we're drinking a mango smoothie by the way right here mangoes help you get more lick if you eat mangoes 30 to 45 minutes before getting late these pills probably gonna take longer than that to kick in but still mangoes I love them what you guys might witness me choke right here in this YouTube video cuz really better taking pills you know we to Ithaca okay number three going in okay gone down easy so far number I think it's the smoothie honestly a thicker consistency drink makes it really easy to swallow fat pills for me number four down the hatch up to number five I did not drink quite enough somebody knew that but it's doing down it's just fine the last but not least not least goodness gracious number six Cheers I almost got that one stuck in my throat but we're good six pills down the hatch a YouTube video though I feel like from me wouldn't be complete without at least a DAB so I'm swiping the wheel off of my fingers they just these ones have a little bit of oil on the outside just cuz I found sitting here for so long sometimes they leak a tiny bit instead did YouTube video for me wouldn't be complete without an ice dam but I'm not yours Emma do you want to die right now all right we're gonna do a dab right now then I was gonna say I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it now or wait like a little bit but then it took a weed pill while ago so I feel like once that starts kicking in she probably won't want to dab so it's perfect timing to take it down right now I'll heat it up and let's get it got that well you know what I feel like I hit the creation in the last YouTube video didn't bring my last video on Instagram last video on Instagram was at that pen in nature let's go for it the konk studios burning tube here nicely clean ready friend Aloha I don't know why I have a feeling that while recording this video the storage on my phone is gonna run out I just have a feeling we'll see so if it randomly cuts out yours like wait a minute this video doesn't seem quite right it's probably because my phone died not my phone dialing my phone ran out of storage recording in 4k 60 frames per second takes up an incredible amount of storage no [ __ ] big files so yeah what I do normally is all I record a video and then I have to edit it right in Adobe Premiere is what I use it's on the phone it's really great for editing for videos like that elissa we're at 5 minutes in 20 seconds so we've got like 6 minutes and 30 seconds will be about damn time so then I'll go and edit it and once I edit and get the full video then it saves again in my phone so it's like I have the footage twice so it's just an insane amount of sort so I've been going back and kind of deleting the extra videos and stuff so we're good on that I actually forgot to grab dams hey babe do you think you could grab some dabs um we have 30 seconds and some papaya and lime warp would be lit gonna go six minutes in oh no I think I said six minutes and thirty seconds tonight in the recording yeah okay as usually I'm not ready at all whew sorry about that babe knows like I just feel everyone else okay going in on the dab cheers everyone might be a tiny bit let's have I mean I need to be here I'm not sure Wow definitely didn't sorry I'll get you're good you did it was my apology long and okay here hit that up really interesting on the temp there but still nice now holy [ __ ] I'm gonna be so glazed when these weed pills kick in oh and we interesting to see what we end up doing today probably some streaming on Twitch yeah some art maybe will be will try to make some music [ __ ] yeah well I'll check back in um and like an hour maybe I'll check in every hour on these weed pills and let you guys know how it's going I think every 30 minutes okay okay every 30 minutes we'll do a quick clip until I start feeling them and they'll tell you guys a little bit more about what's going on so yeah I'll start a timer catch you guys in a sec when I check back in in 30 minutes yeah all right Chiefs it's been thirty minutes actually 35 minutes we just finished some yoga um I mean we took that dab right before so I can't say that I'm baked from the six pills yet but I was laughing while doing that yoga because I was farting a lot yoga always makes me fart I don't know what it is [Laughter] yeah it's all the stretching and stuff so I had the giggles I was like what's this because of the weed pills like you know what I don't think so but my stomach started hurting maybe like 15 minutes after I took the weed pills but it's because I hadn't really eaten much except that mango smoothie right and so I ate a Nature Valley bar and now I feel phenomenal but I mean it's like 2:30 now so I should probably eat some lunch you know actual fat meal you know what I'm saying before these weed pills really start kicking in is what I'm thinking so yeah I think that's next up on the plate is making some food maybe some potatoes oh yeah it's settled making potatoes I'll show you guys what I make alright it has now been 1 hour as you can tell via my eyeballs I'm starting to feel it it took 6 weed pills I haven't dabbed in just about an hour so I could be mine early lit still from that last time for sure for sure but I am NOT just mine early let you see realized pretty nicely blazed right now we'll check back in on another 30 and see if they're fully kicked in and whatnot what's going on I got my eyeballs and they're pretty red right now so see if they get redder if I get more lit we're not thinking about it I feel like thinking about how that I am makes me realize that I am indeed quite blazed already see where it goes see you in 30 peace alright checking in haven't made the potatoes yet it's been at least another 30 or so minutes I need to make the potatoes now and then it's like what type of potatoes are you gonna make I was you're good I'm blazed the pills are working and yeah I got a little cardio in so that was nice you know warm up the metabolism to get the pills going even more so yeah ok let's check back in in 30 minutes or actually I'll check back in when these potatoes are ready which will be 30 minutes we're checking that's like a blanket to see it's like it looks like a blanket but it's a jacket it's like psych Oh underwear with it two things all right so it's been another 30 minutes the potatoes are cut up I haven't seasoned them yet because I was checking my canvas which is freshly rezoned what are you judging how much you think I'm lid off of based off of that's what I thought this is literally reflective now I can reflect a traffic light like oh it's green no I'm just kidding I don't think that's the thing look good at that this one's available on our website links down below alright we're now four hours in since I took the pills and I am blazed I forgot to take I'm so blazed I forgot to take a video of the food I literally just ate a ton of potatoes some turkey sausages and some guacamole I like to dip turkey sausages in the guacamole and then yeah and then potatoes and I just ate all that and now I'm just like yeah [ __ ] yeah so I think that uh Senna and I are gonna finish watching this episode of this dank show we're watching and then we'll see where the day takes us after that you know what's good YouTube its cosmos and as you may have noticed it's not the same day as I was just recording and that's because I kind of fell asleep last night I mean I definitely stayed up pretty late but I forgot to keep recording about how late I was I was pretty damn blazed overall I would say but I figured since I forgot to record it again we'd wake up and do it all over again cheers [ __ ] let's get it we'll take when I take six pulse we'll take five bills right now I got pretty blazed yesterday we'll get pretty blazed once again today we're getting kinda low on the pizza Oh kind of low on the pills and I have to make some more soon let's down these five pills take a DAB to start the morning off and we'll

butter machine out here and today the lotion we're going to be making is just a cocoa shea butter alright it the way that we infused it is we first infused a coconut oil with cannabis ahead of time alright and that's going to be the best way to get those herbs in there so I got a few ingredients here I'm going to show you real quick how to do this so you're going to need some raw shea butter and that's pretty pretty easy to find you can get it out of you know like a health food store or maybe a craft store so and that's a really good base for your lotion the shea butter is so a lot of the lotions that you buy in the store already are you know have shea butter bases so this is something a little secret than me and chef Joey came up with and it's it's like a raw mango butter so it's similar to the shea butter but it's derived from mangoes so today we're making a mango Coco shea butter here and let's not forget the most important part the infused cannabis coconut oil alright so this is a half a cup we're going to add that right into the magical butter machine I made that ahead of time prior to you know starting this recipe so you'll first create your coconut oil in your machine with your herbs and from there you'll get your the rest of your ingredients so I'd love to give away a magical butter machine right now actually so let's do hashtag rub me and B rub me and B and that's a that's a fun one for everyone this is a little bit of vegetable glycerin if you'd like you can take this a step further and infuse your coconut oil with cannabis and also infuse your glycerin today we're just using a base there's no cannabis in the glycerin so we'll add that right in there and then this is a little bit of mango essential oil it's also some terpenes and a couple drops of yellow food dye so that's going to give our shea butter lotion a nice yellow color it's going to be really beautiful so that's it you put all your ingredients in you go ahead and close your machine up let's see here we're going to set it for a hundred and thirty degrees for one hour machine is going to heat up now to that temperature we've selected it's going to mix stir grind and combine all these ingredients so when it comes out everything's going to be thoroughly mixed we'll have a really nice melted oil and what you're going to want to do this is what it looks like when it comes out so this lotion is still warm that's why it's still a liquid and so you're going to want to let this naturally cool and once it cools then you're going to whip it and that's how you get the whipped the whips cocoa butter effect there so you see here so I'm going to let this cool and as soon as it's ready we're going to whip that up so this is a lot of fun let's say I give away some t-shirts real quick I'd love to give out some of our new orange magical butter shirts these are awesome just in time for 4/20 you'll be looking fresh with your crew so let's do hashtag magical butter

peace of mind knowing that what you're putting on your body alright so you get to you know choose what you're putting in it different you know different based ingredients and combining those so so yeah I like to shout out one of the winners I guess he's got the same name as me Chris Harris or here oz you're going to win a magical butter machine so congratulations bro and then I see some people out there they're asking questions asking about adding terpenes to these lotions so there's a company we work closely with called true terpenes shout out to my boy out there in Oregon you can locate them on their website but they sell all kinds of terpenes that have been extracted from natural fruits and vegetables and all kinds of plants and terpenes are what give cannabis and also fruits and vegetables their odor aroma and also flavor so we're using mangoes some Mercy terpenes in this mango lotion today so it's pretty cool it's really fun and so let's go right right along here I'm going to keep going and today this is going to be the the Coco shea butter recipe and we've got a couple different ingredients out here so again we're going to use this if you're just joining us my name is Chris I'm here with magical butter I'm showing you guys how to make cannabis infused topicals and lotions directly in the magical butter machine it's super easy right in time for 4:20 so take your medicating to the next level you'll be able to burn not concern you can make edibles you can also make lotions so at the end of your night after a long day out there you may be on your feet all day have somebody rub some of this stuff on you you're going to love it and I know you know many people probably didn't even know that you can make lotions in the magical butter machines but you can so this thing is so versatile in the kitchen you can make alcohol tinctures all kinds of you know cannabis cocktails and beverages with it and also topicals and skin creams and a lot of people are unable to ingest or they they're not wanting to smoke or vaporize so they may have different pains or you know ailments and aches and topical lotions are a great way to to relieve yourself so it'll it'll actually you know go right through your skin and relieve any of that joint or muscle pain so this is awesome I'm going to go right ahead here and drop some of this shea butter in here with my magical butter spatula so these will be coming out very soon on our website make sure you guys look out for those get a three pack and this here is a just a white lotion base so it's called base lotion there's no no smell to it and you can find this either online they sell it at health food stores are also at the craft store so I picked some of this up at the local craft store and a lot of people like to make these lotions and they make great gifts you know you obviously you're going to have a large batch of this stuff maybe two to five cups so you're not going to want to use it all yourself you go get some of these cute little jars and you fill the lotion up in the jars and then you put the lotion on the skin and then hahaha you get it you catch the drift but anyway you get you give these out as gifts and everybody is going to love you they're going to think you're so creative they're gonna be like wow you made lotion yourself man you are a cool person you know so that's real and I got some people out there Cara thank you for the feedback we appreciate that she says the only thing that helps her arthritis is actual topical lotions so even if she's able to ingest it it doesn't relieve that part of the pain so these topical lotions are helping her out Thank You Cara for for giving us the feedback we love you and go ahead and put that's a half a cup of infused coconut oil so I infused this coconut oil with cannabis ahead of time in my magical butter machine once you have your infused cannabis coconut oil that's your base ingredient now to infuse these lotions so that's exactly what we're doing here and we're going to add some sunflower lecithin to this recipe and that's just three teaspoons and it's going to help all this stuff bind together get a good mixture there so we try to stay away from the soy lecithin I know you may have read that in our owners manual but lecithin is a great binding agent you just want to make sure you get a good healthy form of it so and then what's up Brenda Bloodworth she says it puts the lotion on the skin hashtag it puts the lotion on the skin that's a lot of fun what a weird movie so let's see what we have here oh yes so this is another essential oil we're using some limonene terpene here mmm that's really good add that right in there natural Terps all of them a lotion and then this here is some vitamin E so they either sell this in liquid form or you may have trouble finding that you're going to probably have to get some like vitamin E capsules bust wide open squirt them right in there but about three capsules worth of vitamin E oil there and that's it you combine everything right into your magical butter machine just like that my hands are still pretty much clean if you get a little bit of this stuff on you just rub it in it feels good feels good so I'm gonna close this sucker up I'm going to set our temperature today to 130 degrees for one hour what do you think bud Wow that was freakin awesome did you

sometimes after you have kids and you had no idea it was gonna be that rough and you know that there's a better life but you're not like entirely sure how to get there that's where I come in I help you use cannabis exactly the way that you need to for your day in your life and I walk you through a bunch of other wellness practices that you can implement so that when you graduate my program you're living a much much better life than you are now that's the point so if that sounds like it would float your boat reach out to me at Rubio cannabis calm alright so I didn't talk about what we need today so first of all we have our half cup of cannabis oil that we did last time you can see that it's not liquid it's our live in Canada and it's cold here already so it solidifies so 1/2 a cup of your infused oil and then these are the basics you can go nuts on scythes and add like a whole bunch of different oils and combinations of things I went to my cannabis coach colleague who is the bomb making this stuff I he doesn't like 9,000 times a day and then we also have somebody in our group who makes this stuff for a living so I asked them how to do it like this most simple and easy way to say you and me all the googling so here we go this is cacao butter or cocoa butter I think people say it both ways it's basically the oil that they get from the cocoa bean and it feels amazing I was just playing around with that this is beeswax and this is shea butter so you can get those just out of your local health food store I'm sure amazon also sells them you're also need a tablespoon or if you're fancy then I prefer to use a scale because it's really actually hard to get a table actually gonna add it to my income I stopped today because this is for somebody else and I don't know if you want to smell like peppermint but you can add all those oils as well and then you're gonna need a double boiler or I think I'm just gonna do it right in here so I'm gonna get set up in the kitchen and we'll see you there all right so we're ready to go I have my infused oil the coconut oil that I just warmed up in the microwave I'm just gonna try to infuse it right in here but it's not gonna work and then I've created a double boiler here so that just means that you have a little bit of water in the bottom so that it reaches the bottom of the second pan and you put the second pin in and then pour your ingredients in and the reason that we do a double boiler is so that you don't you don't want to burn your oil you don't wanna get your oil to the point where it's smoking because that's bad so I'm just gonna add in my infuse my cannabis infused oil and then I ended up really having to shave the beeswax because it was so hard so this is beeswax here on top and then the shea butter and the cocoa butter the cacao butter so you put this all together this takes a little while you want to put it over like don't put a rolling boil on it or anything and when this all combines together then you're done so I'm gonna let this melt away and I'll show you what it's like at the end and just so you know I'll have all the instructions for this as well in a link down below not sure if I remember to tell you but there's an ounce or two tablespoons of each of the three other ingredients that we added in here so but that links down below so make sure you grab that so that you don't need to watch the video every time you want to make this okay so everything has melted all together you can see that the liquid like you can see through the liquid now so I'm just gonna pour it back into my mason jar I happen to have one of these for canning which makes this a whole bunch easier there we go this takes about a half an hour to set up so obviously we wait because it's gonna be quite warm and then you can apply this topically which means apply it to your skin so if you had sore hands or a sore back or sore knees this would be perfect for it there's absolutely no way for the THC in here to get you high at all so there's no worry about that and because this is a one-to-one straight it has CBD and THC in it then it will help with pain on both friends and inflammation so yeah this is gonna set up and I'm gonna send it off to the client and see what he thinks and we'll go from there thanks so much for watching this week's video I post new videos every Saturday I'd love if you subscribed and hit like if you liked it and if there's anything else that you would like to learn about please let me know and I just wanted to show you the final product it's quite creamy as you can see and when you wrap it on it takes a little bit to rub into your skin but it feels fantastic because of all the great additives that we added into it and then it absorbs quite well so I'm excited to pass this on to my client and see if it will help with his back pain if you have any questions please just reach out and I can answer them in the chat Thanks", "4Dt87Vmf0dM": "hi everyone welcome to brain talks I'm Debra Khan founder of being patient today we're going to talk about cannabis a lot of you have written in or commented on past articles we've posted on being patient about the use of cannabis in dementia patients now we're happy to tell you that we don't have the answer about the efficacy yet but it is being studied out of King's College in London joining me now is one of the lead researchers his name is Chris Albertan welcome Chris thanks what I mean so Chris let's first just talk about the the cannabis that you are using in this study it's it's in the form of a I think a droplet is that correct close it's an old solution but it's administered as a spray actually so an oral spray it's called sativex it's actually licensed in the US as well as well as the EU in the UK but for MS of so multiple sclerosis and we're looking to really repurpose it and investigate this activity in dementia specifically for agitation and aggressive symptoms now the history though behind this is that it was it was used for MS and found to be very effective is that right yeah that's correct that really helps to target those joint and musculoskeletal issues and and reduce pain and that's areas loss of joint really loosen things up yeah so why was the association made with sativex and dementia what was the connection there yeah I suppose if I first just start with the problem we're trying to address which is these are behavioral symptoms and dementia which are quite understandable when someone when a patient has been very confused and out of sorts not really aware where they are so it's understandable they could get quite agitated and perhaps aggressive so that's the symptom we're sort of trying to target there currently there's a scarcity of treatments pharmacological treatments out there and some of them rather damaging and dangerous especially in the long-term so they would prescribed off-label antipsychotics for instance for the more severe cases of agitation so that's just nesting in within the sort of context and that comes with sort of adverse health outcomes for the individual for the carers exporting as well as sort of economic impact on hospitals and so forth so what we're really looking to do is and we're looking for a saver but just as effective if not more effective alternative and so we're not the only ones who's actually explored the utility of cannabis in this area I think you've actually alluded to on this site previously a Canadian research team as well as I think there's a team at Johns Hopkins as well that have done some research in this area and as it's growing internationally as well but they're all sort of pilot studies that they're looking very promising we're quite excited about the potential of this area so the small but promising studies that are shown so estimated efficacy for agitation dementia so I know I was gonna ask the side of it now what's interesting about medical cannabis is there's really I mean it's in America obviously it's legal and recreational or medical in a lot of states increasingly more the the way that it's being cultivated is very specific now to a lot of health issues my question is when you're using the sativex how like what's the difference or in concentration of CBD versus THC which are the two components in in cannabis that have found to be more effective so what is what is that balance between the two and what do we know separately about how those two interact with with behavior yeah absolutely so yet THC and CBD a known as cannabinoids actually they're part of a wide array of compounds that come from the cannabis plants just two of hundreds actually but there you could create the two main ones that we know of at the moment tthe is the psychoactive compound it's the one where you get that subjective PI feeling but it's also been found as the compounds most reliably to induce a therapeutic effect I was just most recently reported in nature this February even CBD itself has also been growing had some growing interest it's important to note that that the concentrations of the dose is very important when referring to cannabinoid compounds and a lot of lab scientists are looking into that to make sure that for instance you only need two point five five milligrams THC to have an effect but you need in the hundreds of CBD for instance to really achieve a therapeutic effect now we're Sativex it so it's a one-to-one concoction so we have C be passively half THC and when I didn't mention before actually is so the way that it's administered is there an oil spray so it's a spray into the mouth it's not inhaled not ingested or swallowed so that's a highly highly innovative method in a dementia population as well that were excited to explore but in each one of those sprays you get two point five milligrams THC and at two point five maybe two point seven CBD so it's important to note that the CBD isn't actually having a therapeutic effect in itself it's augmenting and weapons synergistically with the THC component that's interesting we're starting to get some questions and one comment from a a viewer saying thank you for your research my mom has been on several different antipsychotics for agitation with Alzheimer's and they've caused her to greatly decline she always ends up so drugged up and has to be taking off the drugs we need something better for Alzheimer's patients this actually brings up a good point which is you know that's what we hear this a lot with the current antipsychotic medications there's a lot of side effects that go with them and they actually in a lot of cases end up worse for the for the person with dementia do you are there any known side effects with from Sativex yes so with any compound yours you have to be realistic about the risks versus benefit ratio and that's really down to the clinician doing striving to make that decision to make that evaluation with side effects actually in comparison to those other antipsychotics it's a relatively innocuous substance so we're looking at side effects along the lines of increased dizziness perhaps dry mouth as well as a common one and then just perhaps risk of increased risks of Falls for instance it's particularly an elderly population you wouldn't want to necessarily administer it with someone with severe cardiac issues or history of cardiac disease and thankfully because it's already a licensed drug and it's gone through that rigorous and objective safety profiling assessment we're really we have much better awareness of what the co logical risks are as well so for instance as part of this trial we are able to look at the summary of characteristics and contraindications and then pre-screened for these so any sort of drug to drug interactions that we're worried about or any history of cardiac disease or significant psychiatric illness there's a history of significant psychosis or depression then we will screen for that and exclude those as participants for instance and that's something that would happen in practice as well so now just to be clear the study actually hasn't started yet it's starting I believe in September is that correct that is correct yes interesting set up so tell us a little bit though about how extensive the study will be and how long we will know before determining although there is effect yeah no absolutely so the city itself will run for just over a year I think about 15 months where we're collecting data and recruiting participants and our aim is academics especially clinical webapp academics we want to get the information out there as soon as us so within a few months of finishing the trial we're having to publish and really inform other scientists other clinicians as well as the public to the result of the study with the aim to then move on to a larger trial where we could really look at the efficacy because I mean that is an important point just to touch on this is just a playlist study at the moment we're just looking at the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment whether or not it's it's good in practice like it if this is a message I'm finding it helpful and then we so the initial pilot will it will how many people will it involve we've got 60 people I will be randomizing so we're using a randomized control design with a placebo so 30 people will be on the treatment 30 people on a placebo so we can really get a good direct comparison and of course the the patient or the resident won't know which they're on and neither will the researchers that really increases the power of the study so there's no sort of bias or risk of bias in essence so you know we've been asked this question before and I'm not sure anyone knows the answer but why is it being targeted towards behavioral and there there have been some early stage early onset people with early onset who have asked well does anyone actually know if this helps to slow down the deterioration you know of brought on by dementia I have never heard of a study before but it's interesting that it's the behavioral on antipsychotic side of things where people start to you know that that this this trial is being targeted and I'm just wondering why why I mean with with dementia there are a lot of different problems from behavioral to physical so why was it targeted towards the behavioral aspect yeah absolutely I mean first we just looked at look at the impact of the effects of cannabis consumption and you sort of think about just even on only terms the the impact it has increased drowsiness bit more of a calm relaxed feeling you sort of associate those with with a therapeutic potential term in a behavioral sense and now when you're talking about more the the disease specific with a pathology dementia and that's a wide array of different types of dimensions so that's the first thing clarifying there have been some exciting lab results yes you're correct about targeting some of the underlying causes of dementia but it's been really difficult and actually translating it up to in-person studies has not been successful so just yet but it's an exciting Avenue for the future absolutely and considering that cannabis is in this sort of societal shift of real focus towards and hopefully a bit more funding and attention goes into the research yeah I'm excited to see what we could find you know this is probably an example of the research now catching up to you know especially in the US where as I said it's legal in so many places you know we often have people writing in saying they're trying it on their their loved one not that we would ever recommend that anyone try anything that hasn't been researched but it's interesting to see kind of the research is actually catching up to a point where you know people don't have the scientific evidence behind a study which it is as we pointed out moving in that direction which is good but you know everything is always better tested by science to have the proof we we have a question actually from a viewer coming in saying how do we get into the study like are you going to be recruiting is it only in London how would people find out more and keep abreast of your research and understand if there's a possibility of joining in a study well at the moment as I said we're just in the setup stage unfortunately it is just a UK centric study specifically closer to London if possible because obviously our research team has to travel out to these care homes and nursing homes to conduct the assessments and bring the drug to the to the nurses so it's quite local for the time being I am excited and hopeful that if the if it's promising results that we could take it international that we could do a multicenter study to really look at impact all across the world in Canada in the US Australia and so forth and I would say if you did want to learn more about the study I'm not sure of the process of this talk but I can leave some links that go direct to our biomedical research centre which has a page on at the moment you can follow me on twitter if you if you'd like and I'll pin a tweet talk to you to have access to but really ads look out this awesome that's when we'll be really pushing driving and you can get in touch with and we'll have confirmed participant information sheets and materials just to send out and so that's great we will we can post those links in the Facebook live thread so don't get to them I'm curious are you targeting a specific age or or are you testing all images I mean you're talking about a nursing home so I'm assuming that's elder more elderly people but you know what about the the younger population of people living with dementia yeah I mean that's so you currently labeled this this interview is sort of like the first major study which is it's very flattering but I'm not too sure it's it's not quite true there are a couple others studies as well but it is in the UK so that is something so what we really have to be careful on is to make sure that we're conducting this experiment in a controlled measured setting where we can be really careful about any potential risks especially because it's such a first word you know if anything goes wrong from a cannabis medication just just the one and if it seems to be irresponsibly used that could really scare a lot of future work and future attention to the therapeutic potential so when it comes to age it was really we wanted to be as inclusive inclusive inclusive as possible to the aina so we chose nursing homes because it's that structure where it can be a trained clinician to administer the drug and that can be monitored they had the impact and so forth the radius so any age in a nursing home is likely to be more severe dementia so that's also likely to be older and then finally we do we've put an age cap at 90 and I wasn't this is a object of debate let's say just because I am the the lab studies and so the the first in human studies they only recruited that in the highest ages up to 90 and that's in the summary of the sativex product characteristics but really I think it could go beyond but just to be safe we wanted to keep it within that bracket and we have a question another question coming in from ever you're saying thanks for joining us will this study include dementia patients in the community setting or only in residential care yes so we're just talking residential care at the moment there are couple studies and in the pipeline where we're hoping to expand community altar but as I said it's where we it's much harder to to monitor the risks and monitor the compliance for instance of how often the drug is taken and so forth but that's that's a future step absolutely because we want to be able to expand very potential across the board so that it can have to be accessed by everyone yeah absolutely okay so Chris what's your Twitter so we can tell people were a twitch what's your Twitter handle yes it's just underscore Chris Albertine okay great so to keep abreast of the study follow Chris on Twitter or we'll post some links to your research centre at King's College we'll post the link to that page so that you can all keep keep up with the trial Chris please let us know when you get any information we'd like to stay on top of this and we'd like to let people know what research is telling us about the use of cannabis and information and dementia patients so we're very appreciative of your time thank you so much absolutely and likewise and I have to reiterate and I said before the call but the work that you're doing with being patient on this is just fantastic and it's really exciting to see a platform gain so much so much momentum thank you thank you so much and we will look forward to keeping in touch we'll come back to you maybe after the the first pilot has finished and let people know how it went and we wish you all the luck yeah absolutely thanks so much okay okay thank you", "92_Fy0pnOg4": "                                                            hi I'm Dr. Joe Sirven I'm editor in chief epilepsy dot com and welcome to the Epilepsy Foundation discussion on cannabidiol for epilepsy I have several friends and colleagues \nwho are joining me today I\u2019m going to let them introduce themselves and I\u2019ll start over here - Anup hi I\u2019m Anup Patel section chief of neurology at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus Ohio I\u2019m also the medical cannabis \neditor for epilepsy dot com hi I\u2019m Barry Gidal I\u2019m professor of pharmacy at University of Wisconsin  Madison and I\u2019m the co-editor of the medication section of epilepsy dot com Alice - hello I\u2019m Alice Mead I\u2019m the head of US public policy and public affairs for Greenwich Biosciences Abbey\nHi I\u2019m Abbey Roudebush government relations manager at the Epilepsy Foundation we\u2019re going to be focusing our discussion now on how did we get here the history of cannabis and also a quick primer on terminology So to kind of get us started and I\u2019m going to turn to Anup now maybe can you give us a sense of just some of the preliminary information that kind of got us down this road yes I think one of the biggest \nmisconceptions around this area is this is a relatively new movement or in the last few years it has really gotten out there This is actually talking about cannabis or \ncannabis-related products that could be beneficial for people who have epilepsy \nor seizures is really a topic that has been going on since the dawn of time there are actual records and Egyptian scrolls of the use of marijuana to treat medical illness so it dates all the way back there in our world of neurology and seizures I think what\u2019s interesting is there is some record of one of our most well-known members in neurology Dr. Gowers and him using this to treat people who have had seizures and then kind of lapse that occurs\nand it\u2019s not that the lapse meant nobody was doing anything there was a lot of work that was undergoing as it relates to CBD marijuana cannabis etc for seizures and\neven in other disease states but then it was really of recent times when documentaries were started to be made around this topic One was on CNN by Dr. Sanjay Gupta that talked \nabout a young girl who had benefited from a strain of marijuana that \nhad a higher content of CBD you know one of the things that the career and profession of epilepsy has taught me is that language is everything \nthe term seizure disorder epilepsy seizure and in this particular area of therapy there are \na lot of terms that are floating around that I think to some degree can confuse \nthe viewers out there So I was wondering if maybe we could of go around \nand take a couple of these terms that we hear and maybe define them \nand kind of just give an answer as to what exactly does this mean \nwhen we\u2019re talking about it I think where this really started with marijuana and I think then the term that has evolved over the years has been we\u2019ve added the term medical in front of it medical marijuana Now I think where this does add confusion at this point where we\u2019re at with our understanding of the science is remembering that the cannabis plant is a very complex plant that contains a lot of these cannabinoids and a lot of other chemicals By calling it medical marijuana I think \nleads some to believe it\u2019s one thing it\u2019s one drug and that\u2019s really not the case and there's a number of these different drugs they may or may not interact with each other \nwe simply don\u2019t know and I think that does add to the confusion so I think perhaps we\u2019ve gotten to the point \nwe should evolve past using medical marijuana as a legitimate term \nand start talking about the molecules just like we would with any other drug\ntalk about individual molecules That makes perfect sense and I\u2019m going \nto take a riff off your answer there because you mentioned two specific acronyms in there and maybe we can kind of get those nicely defined \nso that everyone feels very comfortable And I\u2019m going to look to Abbey and to Anup CBD THC either one \nwhoever wants to take it first I\u2019ll take the THC part\nI think that one of the things we know about THC is that\u2019s probably the most common part of the plant that people are familiar with largely because it\u2019s the psychoactive portion \nwhere it binds to the area of the brain that gives you that euphoria or high \nwhich is why people use it for recreational purposes Completely separate chemical structure\nare things like CBD and etc So Abbey with CBD how would we differentiate that Right so CBD doesn\u2019t have the psychoactive component that interacts with different areas in your body and so you don\u2019t get that high \nthat you typically think of with cannabis the cannabis plant has over 100 \nof these different substances in them THC and CBD are just two of the most common ones but each one does something different So when you think of cannabis \nmost people do think of THC But then you have other compounds \nthat you can isolate like CBD and then we get medicine and treatments \nfor epilepsy and other conditions that way and I think the important thing is \nthat they\u2019re not interchangeable that is a perfect point to lead us \nto a summary at this time And what I ask is each of our panelists \nkind of your main take-home point in terms of when we\u2019re talking about the history as well as the terminology\nand I\u2019ll start with Anup I think the biggest thing I\u2019d like for us to take away \nis that this isn\u2019t a new movement this has been here for a long period of time we\u2019ve just gotten to now a point where things have really gotten where we can actually give this to humans and make a medication that \nthen went through the FDA process but it obviously took a long time for us to get here although the studies were done very quickly\nand the results were interpreted really quickly and then the DEA in our opinion made a quick determination it has been ongoing That\u2019s a great great summary\nBarry so I think this whole issue of \nclarifying what we\u2019re talking about we need to have a common lexicon we need to have a common language \nthat we all understand so when we\u2019re talking between patients between patient providers that \nwe understand what we\u2019re talking about so again an edible a medical marijuana realize there's \na lot of variability in what we're discussing very very important point as well\nAlice well I certainly agree with Anup about \nwe\u2019ve known about historically the therapeutic potential of \nthese molecules for a long time but unlike opiates that began to be developed \nfor modern medicine in the 1800s cannabinoids are hard to research they\u2019re hard to formulate\nthey\u2019re hard to administer so there's just been an absence of technology\nwhich leads us to sort of a gap of almost 100 years between the development of opiates and\nnow the development of modern cannabinoids but technology is here now so I expect to see \na lot of these products available in the future such a good point\nAbbey I guess just echoing what everyone else has said that now that there is an FDA approved medication\nit went through the same process as other treatments And this isn\u2019t a new age drug, it\u2019s not that \nsomebody woke up in this century and thought we\u2019re going to take this illegal drug and turn it into medicine just because I want to use it and then I would also echo that I think \nthere is a real need for us to have common terminology when we talk about this I also think it\u2019s important to touch on \nspecifically cannabis versus marijuana and the terms used I know sometimes people think of them as \ntwo different plants or two different substances cannabis is sort of the medical whereas \nmarijuana that\u2019s the dangerous drug And it\u2019s really important to note that \ncannabis is part of the name of the plant it\u2019s part of the genus\nit\u2019s the scientific name and marijuana is just a slang term for cannabis that really came about in the early part of the 1900s when they were working to outlaw cannabis as well as other drugs \nthat was part of the marijuana tax and I think if we start getting everyone \non the same terminology that way then it\u2019s a nice starting point for us to go into further research and \nbroader conversations about this Abbey thank you for that wonderful point and I think this is a perfect time to thank all of our wonderful panelists that \njoined us for the discussion today that included Anup Barry Alice Abbey\nand you all the viewer my name is Dr. Joe Sirven \neditor-in-chief of epilepsy dot com and you\u2019ve been watching the Epilepsy Foundation\u2019s discussion on cannabidiol for epilepsy thanks so much for joining us today", "FI73gfwO1Lk": "[Music] another video today is gonna be a very different type of video as I've never done one of these before so I'm gonna try this out hopefully everything works out the way I have it in my head so let's get right into the video guys without further ado today is going to be actually a edible review so I'm not personally me myself I'm not a huge edible fan just because of how long the effects last how long they take to come on and a bunch of other factors just doesn't really make me a fan of it me personally when I like to use cannabis I like to know when I'm gonna be high for how long I'm gonna be high and you know I can plan my day around that with edibles it's kind of like once you take the edible and once it's in full effect you're kind of just basically useless as a person that's how you know heavy the effects are for metals for me personally I mean I'm speaking from my point of view everyone has a different tolerance everyone has different experiences so that's why I don't eat or use edibles that much but today's review is going to be hopefully you guys can see that on camera they're one of these shatter bars and this one is 250 milligrams of THC hopefully you guys can read that information hopefully it's focused hopefully the camera is focusing but yeah so this is a vegan shatter bar because that's the only one they had left so I just bought that one this one's two hundred and fifty milligrams of THC ten point four milligrams per square so when you open this up I'll show you guys it it's divided into little squares this one is sugar-free dark choc this one is an indica so they actually have a sativa and an indica bar I'm not sure how that affects I might have to try this a tea go on and see the difference but I've actually tried this one before and I know how it affects me so I roughly know what's gonna happen after I eat this but yeah this one is purple kush and there is 24 pieces in this bar so hopefully you guys can see that hopefully you guys can read that but yeah without further ado I'll just read like the ingredients here unsweetened chocolate sweetener cocoa butter soy lecithin natural vanilla flavor and yeah that's basically it it gives you the nutritional value here on the back it says that there is a lab test result so for the THC percentage it is 60 7.5% the THC a is zero point zero eighty percent THC V is a hunt one point twenty percent the CBN is zero point four hundred and fifty percent the CBD is zero point one thirty five percent the CBC is one point sixteen percent and the CBG is one point ninety two percent so I'll show you guys that there it's just on the back hopefully you guys can see that oh yeah let's get right into this review I'm gonna open this bad boy up show you guys what we're dealing in here and as I'm opening this up and showing you guys a lot of people might not be familiar with edibles or how they work and how they affect you I'll give you a brief rundown on how they work basically so what you have to do in order to make edibles is you have to use obviously cannabis or cannabis derived product like shatter I believe actually that's what they use to make these is they actually use shatter from purple kush or whatever it is to make the bar so you'd have to use shatter hash Keef something with a lot of cannabinoids in it obviously and what you have to do is decarboxylate the cannabis product whatever you're using the bud you know how shatter or whatever you're gonna be using you have to decarboxylate it now I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the actual science and how this stuff works but if you are interested just type in deep decarboxylation on google and it will give you a description on what it is exactly doing it has something to do with removing a carbon atom from the molecules or something along those lines I don't want to butcher the sign so I'm not gonna try and explain it but so basically you have to decarboxylate your cannabis make the edibles and what happens is it's it's different than smoking in the sense of when you smoke cannabis the witch is your smoking the THC the CBD and all the cannabinoids obviously so the THC which is known as Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol is present in the plant so when you smoke that the Delta 9 THC or Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol gets absorbed into the lungs then it goes into your bloodstream and then it gets processed that way and when you smoke obviously the effects come on immediately after the thing with edibles is once you eat the Delta 9 THC when your body starts to obviously break down the food and process it and digest it it turns that Delta 9 THC into 11 hydroxy THC or 11 hydroxy tetrahydrocannabinol so if you didn't know that it actually turns THC into a totally different compound which is why edibles lasts so long and is why like their effects are very very potent so I just want to give you guys that little bit of information if you weren't aware of that and yeah I'll show you guys the bar so this is like the little wrapping that it kind of comes in here I guess that's like their little logo or whatever whatever that means I don't even know what it says but yeah so and here she is there is the chocolate bar that we're dealing with so each square is ten point four milligrams of THC the entire bar is 250 milligrams of THC so now I was thinking about this before the video but I'll just say it to you guys as well I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the entire bar or if I wanted to eat half of it I mean it wouldn't really be an edible review if you only ate half because then you're not really getting the full effects so I'm just gonna leave this camera recording I'm gonna start eating this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour and hour and a half and I will tell you guys how I'm feeling how the effects are how actually I'm gonna start eating it now and I'll tell you how it tastes as well just cuz just kind of giving you an overall review of the product itself because some edibles taste like complete [ __ ] but then the effects are amazing and then some people make like really gourmet edibles that taste amazing and also the effects are there as well so I'm gonna try it now or shut up so there's one little square I know it's chocolate you kind of technically should be sucking on it and letting it melt in your mouth but I'm impatient it's actually a really good holy [ __ ] for being a vegan chocolate bar Wow I know I'm not really a big sweets person I'm not really a big chocolate person either but this tastes really good I mean it you can taste the slight cannabis taste in the background but overall this is like wow really surprised really good job what does the company euphoria extractions really really good job definitely a really good tasting chocolate bar so alright guys so without further ado I'm gonna finish this chocolate bar and I will report back in about an hour an hour and a half and give you guys the effects and how I'm feeling so enjoy the rest of the video guys peace [Music] so so far so good I mean I'll give you a little bit of information so I got the Edible from a local dispensary here in Toronto and it was about I think $26 for that chocolate bar kind of pricey I mean you have to pay taxes and whatnot which is whatever I mean you got to do what you got to do right the government has to get a cut always so yeah two hundred and fifty milligrams bar $26 I mean the chocolate bar itself tasted amazing tasted like a regular like dark chocolate bar really good taste you could taste the cannabis like on the back end and yeah that's all I can really say is if right now really good experience so far and like I said I'll come back in an hour now in half and let you guys know how I'm feeling so hopefully you guys have been enjoying this video I know it's a little bit different than what I normally post but I know there are edible users out there I know people might want to see these types of videos so I said why not make this video right oh yeah like I said I will see you guys soon and enjoy the rest of the video peace guys hey what up guys I'm back and we're gonna talk about the effects and how I'm feeling after taking that edible that I was talking about earlier so it's been about an hour an hour and a half no I don't even know I haven't even checked the time but I know it's for sure it's been an hour so I'm feeling pretty much the full effects already and holy [ __ ] it is definitely some phone stuff it's just a typical indica high I mean you're just couch locked you're sedated your pain with a lot of pain relieving properties a lot of body effects relaxation no depression no anxiety and yeah you're just having munchies you feel tired you could definitely fall asleep no problem but it is definitely some pown stuff and it will definitely last a long time so that is also a plus if you're looking for long lasting effects for like medical patients as well so yeah I mean that's basically all I can really say about it it isn't edible it's not like it really has like a taste or like you know any other smells and stuff like that it's basically just a chocolate bar so my overall rating I guess for this edible out of five I would definitely say it's a high quality edible I would give it a solid four to five and definitely recommend it if you live in Toronto and you're looking for edibles like that's definitely a good company to go with I would say so yeah that's been an edible review by I'm always blazing the 250 milligram euphoria extractions vegan chocolate bar so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like comment subscribe if you're new and yeah we'll see you guys in the next video B so guys", "gz0KRXd8m7M": "they had a bunch of different oh my [ __ ] god all right i stopped at a dispenser yesterday called lit i actually filmed an entire tour of their facility and grow it was [ __ ] epic that video is gonna be up in a couple weeks make sure you subscribe so you can check it out when it's up but while i was there i picked up a couple sodas these are called keef colas they had a bunch of different flavors i grabbed three different ones i grabbed the orange kush which orange soda is probably my favorite soda this one is blue razz and then this one's actually sparkling water and it's raspberry flavored i'm probably not gonna like this one but i figured i'd try it and compare it all these drinks only have 10 milligrams of thc in them so they're not super potent if you smoke like once a day or less this will probably get you pretty lit but for 10 milligrams it's honestly like the potency of a beer for me like i would need to drink five of these to feel a decent buzz i know on the med side this same brand makes 100 milligram sodas but my medical card isn't valid in colorado it's only valid in pennsylvania so i can only shop on the right side out here got all the nutrition facts for you there's 34 grams of sugar so it's about as much sugar as an average soda i'm curious if it's as sweet though because personally drinking weed just does not sound that appealing to me let's find out took off the child lock smells like orange soda looks like orange soda but does it taste like orange soda wow it's actually extremely refreshing there's like a slight weedy aftertaste a little terpy but like it's not bad it's not like actually like weed or like planty it's like actually like terpy i honestly expected to hate this and i kind of like it it's pretty good again this is not going to get me like [ __ ] lit this is basically like me taking one hit of weed and drinking a soda with it now if one hit a weed is all you need this is probably going to be pretty good for you but if you're trying to smoke all day constantly be like getting that high this isn't ideal what i liked about lit was they had literally products for everybody their edible selection was huge they had so many different options like they even had drinks like that's pretty cool they had super cheap stuff and they had the super expensive stuff that i buy so there's really everything in between it's weird it's like already flat it like still tastes good but it doesn't have that like carbonated like bite that soda has to it typically i literally poured this two minutes ago so the fact that it's already flat is kind of weird personally when i consume edibles i want to have like a nice 50 to 100 milligram dose and please don't leave me a comment saying about how your plug makes 500 milligram edibles and anything less than that of [ __ ] i really do not care about the crush you have on your drug dealer and i don't care about how he's lying to you doesn't hatch cannabis empowers soda curious how blue raspberry soda is going to taste i [ __ ] with like a blue raspberry slushie so i'm kind of hoping that's the effect we get the lack of carbonation is weird i really can't get over it this tastes like straight up blueberry i definitely like the orange soda more if you like blueberry you'll definitely like this but it is an intense blueberry again not weedy at all though like it's definitely a little turpy you can taste them like weed terps kind of like the problem with this is dude like i just drank a soda and a half i don't want any more soda don't get me wrong i love a good soda but there's an excess to this and for this if i'm actually trying to get high i'm really not trying to drink four or five sodas there's definitely a market for this i just don't know if this is something i'm gonna get again like i'd rather smoke a joint and drink a root beer i don't know if i need them to be like the same thing together i also picked up these edibles just because the packaging kind of sold me they're called wild i got their raspberry gummies there's 10 edibles in this box and each one is a little over 10 milligrams even these might look like a lot but like i could eat five of these and get a 50 milligram dose way easier than drinking five whole sodas when i get edibles on the wreck side i want them to be like as small as compact as possible if i could get minced i'd be happy like if you could just throw five ten mints in your mouth and get a hundred milligram dose i'd be pumped these are actually really good probably because there's practically no weed in them that you can actually enjoy the flavor you wouldn't really think that there's weed in this as you ate it i mean two more i didn't even realize this but the sparkling water has no carbs in it that's pretty nice isn't it kind of funny how edibles are all like the most unhealthy food and then they're designed to get you high as [ __ ] to the point where you want to then eat more unhealthy food dude these are really [ __ ] good this is my breakfast today i swear to god i really don't want to finish this one i'm not going to lie you guys the orange soda tasted really good and like i'm like kel from keenan and kel like i just [ __ ] love orange soda but like this blue raspberry it's just too sweet ultimately if you're looking to get [ __ ] up there's better ways to spend your money just take a fat dab or something but like if you're just looking to have a new way to experience cannabis which i'm always down for this is pretty fun ultimately when it comes to like a favorite edible brand i don't really have one i'm not really loyal to edibles i don't consume them a lot so i don't have like the experience with all the edibles i like the wanna brand when i'm out here a lot typically but these lift ones are fire i really like i can't stop eating these i'm eating like five of these before i've finished this soda oh i'm at like a real stand still guys i really do not want to drink any more of this oh it's so close to being done though i like how it just has a little thc morning a lot like gummies oh this is getting worse and worse i'm gonna try this raspberry sparkling water i'm gonna compare it see how it is flavor-wise but i don't know if i'm gonna finish this one i've had so much carbonated beverage already smells just like sparkling water looks just like sparkling water that was waste [ __ ] that unless you're on like a no carb low calorie diet uh just stick to the soda it's this is bad i'm going to eat another edible just get that taste out of my mouth these are fire dude i know i was supposed to make this video about the sodas but these wild edibles are [ __ ] delicious but like look at this guys i've eaten 80 milligrams of these already and i had 20 milligrams of the sodas and this was a much more enjoyable experience the sodas are cool but i personally feel like they really only belong on the med side where they're 100 milligrams like if i could drink a hundred milligram soda i would drink it but at 10 milligram i'm just like that's just not enough for me but click like if you enjoyed this video and leave me a comment let me know what your favorite edible brand is it doesn't need to be in colorado just let me know and make sure you subscribe we got a lot more videos on the way especially my tour with lit dispensary you guys are not going to want to miss this video it was so cool i got to check out their grow i got to check out their store and it is in like the coolest location you guys you do not want to miss this video feels weird to just be like consuming weed but not be high this is the last one of the wild edibles i consumed a total of like 130 milligrams so i will get a decent high from this actually but again if you're consuming these 10 milligram wreck edibles make sure you're getting as small or as delicious of like pieces of candy or mints that you can like little mints are so much easier to consume than like an entire brownie or an entire soda but thank you guys so much for watching i truly appreciate every single one of you my name is jeff peace", "xl63tar39F0": "today i'm processing my roots or at least i'm getting them out of the ground if you're going to use roots you want to make sure you clean them really good these are there's just the main roots i didn't take any of the uh the uh the strings it was just too hard to get out of the ground oh my gosh it took me forever to get this out but these are nice uh thicker roots that i can uh def i'll definitely use um i will be close to the video on uh what i do with them um i make sobs and i uh actually eat them i use it in uh with coconut oil and i put in my coffee every single day except saturday and sunday which uh i give my body a break but it does amazing things and i will share that with you so don't throw away your roots keep them bad boys they got to be uh dried hung up and dried and then i'll cut it off bro that good stuff is all right happy growing everybody since uh you have now washed and dried your roots they need to be really washed and dried and if you have grown organically if you've been using salt-based um nutrients i probably wouldn't do this if you're going to put this on your body or in your body you you want organic roots are filters for your plant and basically it's in your soil it's bringing up in into your roots so make sure that uh you are organically based what i do is i break my roots down i've got me uh these fisca big o clipper dills but basically you just cut your your roots down into the smallest pieces you can get and then what i'll do is i'll put mine in this uh mortar and pulse stone granite whatever it is and try to get this as powdery as possible so you're going to have all sizes um whatever you have if you have a little um ninja food processor thing that'll work too but you want to get it as fine and as powdery as you could possibly do i don't know these words um the words uh the scientific chemicals that i'm going to put up on the screen so you can see it but one is for protecting your liver and the other is um a cancer killer and what this cancer killer does it sends a signal to the to the cancer cell tells it to commit suicide it um hypothesis i think is what um what it causes and that's like say if you have a a tadpole when a tadpole turns into a frog it sends a positive this chemical to the tail to tell it to die and then that's how the frog will lose its tail basically does the same thing to a cancer cell cancer cells don't have the trigger that tells it when it's damaged to kill itself it just doesn't do that so what this does will do that i am not a doctor i i can't tell you um i don't want to tell you you know eat this stuff um how i do it is uh you need get a get from you know talk to your doctor if you're if you're in a situation where you got cancer or something i don't want it to ruin anything like say i i can only tell you what i've been doing um i put it in in coconut oil and then uh once it's extracted out i pour that coconut oil into a little jar i take take a teaspoon every day in my coffee except for saturday and sunday which i give my body a rest so i work i have it in my coffee i just put a scoop in there and then you need a creamer of some type like a powder creamer that it'll attach to easier for your body absorb if you're going to use in sauce i take that same um coconut oil and i will put it into my assab bomb making process um like i said i'll put the chemicals up what we're looking trying to extract out of there um i they're crazy words so um two ounces or two ounces of this you want to cut this up in two cups worth into your i put it in a crock pot your own crock pot here along with about four or five cups of water two cups of organic coconut oil um i like the organic um i don't think it makes too much of a difference it's just the carrier but i like coconut oil it uh it hardens up um if you put it once this is done you're going to cook this thing for 12 to 18 hours i go 24 you make sure you replace the water as it you know evaporates out simmers out but you want to um the oil will stay and that's what's going to collect all your uh your chemicals that we're looking for um like say i'm really after two um but you know we don't know what the uh what the other ones do um but for solves and stuff it's absolutely wonderful it's great stuff don't throw them out keep your roots so you're chopping them up roots coming off they're going to be all sizes i break them down and i got some big ones small ones i'm going to use this to grind it up and then put it in my coconut oil and i say i'm gonna do it for 24 hours i will put those chemicals up so you know what they are if you have any questions you're welcome to come to our uh facebook group it's called growers helping growers it's just a bunch of people that uh every we have every type of grower indoor outdoor hydroponic you name it we got it from professionals to people

milligrams of thc and uh so if you guys don't know what thc is so let me see thc or tetra hydrocannabinol is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana's psychological effects it acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body according to the national institute on drug abuse so this gummies right here contains some kind of thc um so basically thc you will find out in a marijuana flower or a marijuana product so technically i live here in washington marijuana pot mary jane dahon whatever you call it it's legal out here as long as you have your state id and your uh as

people believe that it can cure cancer can cure illness it can cure epilepsies and stuff like that so they made a different bunch of products that have thc on it because they knew they thought that marijuana can help alleviate you know pain stress anxiety and some illness and you know some people can just smoke that [ __ ] you know some people cannot just smoke and feel the effect some people needs to drink it some people needs to have gummies like this to feel the full effect of the thc so in this case i have these gummies right so man i'll make another video on this marijuana thing okay so for today's video i just want to go ahead and test this out and uh see what will be the effects on me after an hour so basically this is just a gummy it's like you know it's like gummy worms but it doesn't shake like worms and it says here at the back activation time is 45 minutes cannabinoid edibles can take after two hours or more to take effect so that's just another warning but yeah man

flowering plant it is a psychoactive drug that can be used for recreational and medical purposes there are over 500 chemicals in the marijuana plant but the most commonly known ones being Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD the legality of cannabis differs per country many countries have adopted decriminalization laws to make possessions easier while other countries enforce stricter punishments the countries that have legalized are Canada Georgia South Africa arrghh way and eleven of the United States more areas have legalized the medical use even with the rise and acceptance and usage within the recent years there are so many common misconceptions with the two most well-known being that marijuana is a gateway drug and that it kills brain cells in a 2017 study it was found that 123 million Americans use marijuana while 5.3 use heroin assuming that all heroin users were pot smokers this would result in a value of 4.3% showing a weak correlation thus undefined not biological but more sociological furthermore there is no evidence to support the claim that marijuana has neurotoxic effects however it has been shown to cause short-term memory loss similar to that of drinking alcohol the studies in these regards have been inconclusive with some showing detrimental effects while others show protection against damages caused by Alzheimer's and Parkinson's medical marijuana is the use of the cannabis plant or its compounds to treat diseases and conditions it has been shown to be effective in a host of illnesses and in particular chronic pain and fiber the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 50 million Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain this condition is characterized that pain that lasts three to six months or more and has effects on everyday life and mental health a 20-17 study in the Journal of Health Affairs found that the majority are sixty two percent of medical marijuana usages are for chronic pain and these conditions have substantial or conclusive evidence of cannabis being an effective treatment Friday myalgia is defined as widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue insomnia memory loss and mood swings in fibromyalgia the brain intensifies the signals resulting in a greater perception of pain although idiopathic in nature it can be onset by genetics infections of trauma or stress with symptoms increasing over time cannabis works through blocking spinal peripheral and gastrointestinal mechanisms that promote pain in blocking these sensors the perception of pain is decreased or halted they use the underlying biological and physiological pathways to disrupt pain relieving symptoms although most studies focus on marijuana and the effects of pain relief as a whole there are a few that looks specifically at fibromyalgia and a 2011 study it was found that 43 percent of patients reported strong pain relief 43 percent mild pain relief and the remaining seven no changes in the 2014 study by the National Pain Foundation it was found that 62 percent reported cannabis is very effective 33 is helpful and five percent sever had absolutely no effects a 2018 study published in The Lancet showed that cannabis was effective in both lowering pain levels and weaning off other medications another 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Rheumatology showed that cannabis had significant favorable outcomes in all tested categories I wish I had received this treatment when I was first diagnosed I returned to who I was before and I regained my health are some of the testimonials there are many other treatments that can be used in the case of chronic pain among them non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs opioids epidural steroid injections sympathetic blockers over-the-counter prescriptions and therapy the other most used treatment method is opioids which are a group of medications derived from the opium poppy they're controversial showing a variety of positive and negative effects the positive effects of opioids are attributed to you fork feeling relieving the sensory and emotional aspects of pain however the negative effects of addiction reinforcement and dependency also persist the CDC and 2016 created 12 guidelines to make opioids safer three notable recommendations are non opioid therapy is preferred clinicians should prescribe the lowest dosage and status of the patient should be re-evaluated every three months in a 2018 study done by the Institute University did you not see them illegal it was found that it takes one week for someone to become addicted resulting in over 3,900 deaths in 2017 which was 50% more than car accidents chronic pain is a difficult illness to treat as it affects each person differently please consult your medical professional before partaking and any treatment to ensure it is a good fit for you thank you", "H-KD67mwVC0": "so what does 500 milligrams of THC feel like well I can tell you that it doesn't feel good it kind of feels like this okay so it's a little over two weeks ago that I was given ten drops of cannabis oil and the dosage was played down to me and I wasn't sure exactly how many milligrams I was taking it was said that it was diluted and very weak and I was given ten drops and I have never ever taken anything cannabis related in my life so obviously it's gonna hit me harder I wasn't planning to take it I thought the worst that can happen is I'm gonna be extremely relaxed and calm and I haven't really done a lot of research into THC and cannabis oil and the effects on what it does to you so I took the ten drops under my tongue kept it there had a bit of a bitter taste didn't taste much else and then afterwards found out that there was 500 milligrams of THC in those 10 drops so I didn't know if 500 milligrams was a lot or not because I've never really put much research into the actual effects and what the dose is is law when I read online that 500 is extremely high and I was seeing a lot of people there are regular cannabis oil users or THC users I saw how it affected them I thought to myself well I'm either gonna feel weird and go through like a sleepy zombie State or I'm just gonna feel okay so an hour went by I felt okay and I decided to leave the house because I actually forgot that I taken it I carried on swimming and we were doing a whole bunch of things as I was leaving my skin was so hot like it suddenly felt like in that split second I was fine doesn't feel anything in the next second it just hit me and my skin felt so hot like there was a con air blowing on me and it honestly felt like heat a so I went up to it and I faltered and when I put my hand closed it felt like cold air but as I stood back that that air blowing on my skin for that I was on fire I literally felt like I couldn't handle the heat the next thing that happened is just almost like the wall closing in and like tunnel vision and it was just black everywhere except right in front of my eyes and it felt like like like falling or furutaka like you at the top and as you drop it's like that whoop kind of feeling like everything closing in your stomach jumping and I was horrible I felt like whoa something's not right and then I remembered I took ten drops of cannabis oil and I thought to myself okay maybe it's bringing on some anxiety because I've suffered with anxiety attacks and I managed to calm myself down over the years and control it it just got worse and worse and worse my heart rate shot up so high that it I could feel it jumping on my chest now thought okay it's definitely anxiety but my heart the way my heart was going and felt completely different to anxiety so on my very very bad anxiety attacks where I've got rushed to the ER I had a heart rate of 140 beats a minute now if you think about it to put it in perspective your resting heart rate is about 60 beats a minute it can range between 60 to 100 but usually your resting heart rate is about 67 so 140 is for me if I'm boxing or if I am on a treadmill and I'm running or on the elliptical machine or skipping doing those intense things your heart rate is about at 140 so now I imagine being at a resting heart rate and suddenly shoot up to 140 where it feels like you're running on a treadmill and you're out of breath like you you're running that fast but you're not so your breathing doesn't match your heart rate your brain doesn't match your body's activity and everything's just out of synch so that's classic anxiety symptoms I thought to myself I just gotta calm down so much my heart rate shot up to a hundred and seventy two beats a minute now that's the highest I've ever seen it even when I've exercised and when I used to do MMA training my heart rate ever used to go to 172 I think 165 was the max I've ever seen my heart rate I felt like my heart couldn't take it I had this burning sensation through my chest like almost like when the letter s it is building up in your body and you're training hard and you feel like your muscle cannot take the weight if you lifting a little bit too heavy feels like I'm also gonna take I had that same kind of burning feeling in my chest and my heart was racing so fast on top of that I had this funny feeling like it was it was just like my heart couldn't cope with a the beats per minute and I lay on the bed I got managed to get to the bed and I was struggling to speak because my heart was going so crazy that I couldn't get the words out like I was freaking out inside and I was told with it that's the weird thing I didn't feel the effects of the THC besides those physical responses like I was I was going through all of this but in my mind I'm like just relax it's anxiety and even though my heart was that fast I'm like you're just gonna freak yourself out more and I was talking to myself to calm myself down using my diaphragm to breathe and slow my heart rate slow my breathing control everything but it just got worse and worse and worse when I checked my heart rates again and weights up to 180 and it wasn't like a panic attack where it stays high for long and then oops it just stayed constantly a tip from 180 dip down to 172 to 165 and it didn't go below 165 it was between 165 and 172 for about seven hours so even though the HC is considered safe there are extreme cases where there are complications so if your heart rate stays too high for too long you can have a heart attack my blood pressure was extremely high eventually we call the paramedics because I didn't feel like I was gonna make it now I've seen lots of stories of people taking too much and especially if it's their first time they think that they're gonna die and they have anxiety and freaked out I've been through so much anxiety over the years and has so many anxiety attacks where I was rushed to hospital and this fall so different my mind was still there like I was still thinking everything and I honestly felt like I was I was blacking out and my heart was going way too fast and my heart couldn't take it they called the paramedics the paramedics came my heart rate was still extremely high my oxygen saturation was so low because I wasn't breathing properly I was trying to control my breathing so much that I eventually slowed my breathing down so much that I stopped breathing basically they had to stand over me and told me to take deep breaths because I basically lost respiration and I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my body so I made a conscious effort to suck in air but I struggled so much to breathe it's almost like a disconnected feeling and I have read that so that you could become disconnected but you don't know where you are I knew exactly what was happening around me I could feel every single thing I could feel muscles in my face I could feel the inside of my ears I could feel all my muscles I could feel everything it's scary because then you start feeling so lame almost like I couldn't really move much then I would try shake myself like just like the little jerks and jumps to like wake myself up because I could feel like I was slipping away - I don't know passing out or blacking out and the funny thing is in that clip where you see me laying on the bed there my blood pressure was so high it was 190 over a hundred ten I think somewhere there and I thought I had glasses on I'd fought like you know when you put glasses on they're a little bit too tight and you can feel the bands on behind your ears I could feel that and because my blood pressure was so high my veins were so tight there I didn't have two losses on it was just those veins and the whole time I thought I had glasses on because of that feeling my blood pressure was extremely high my heart rate was way too fast and that's lost him for seven hours it's the last longer but off those first seven hours those were the worst so having a heart rate go that fast for that long it can be dangerous and having a blood pressure that high and if it rose higher along with that heart rate is extremely dangerous you could have a stroke you can have a heart attack it's very easy so even though it is a natural compound and there are no reported deaths from cannabis the complications or ever stating and I've never felt that scary in my life through all the anxiety attacks that I had and everything that I've been through with thoracic outlet syndrome that feeling right there was the scariest feeling I've ever had when I had anxiety I used to think that I was gonna die and eventually you know you're not gonna die even though you feel like it with us I just I couldn't control it obviously I take it such a high dose that my mind was only focusing on negative things as much as I was trying to stay positive and talk myself through it and the paramedics actually brought the stretcher they wanted to take me to hospital if my blood patient didn't go down and they stayed with me for a quite a while because I saw such tunnel vision and my blood pressure was so high I think I just like to zoned in I honestly thought that they took so many hours to get there and it felt like it was nighttime reading where in the clip you can see I'm laying there as it's fall early evening I think there was 10 past 6 or so so I was really like out of it I doesn't feel good at all my whole family around me none of them had ever seen me look that bad I didn't see myself making it out of it my heart was feeling so strained it was about three days after that that I still felt like I couldn't do anything because just getting off the bed walking around the house I felt like my heart was pumping so hard like it like it was overused then drained from the day before so it was just like the next week I had no energy I had left so much energy I wasn't myself at all I doesn't feel good I had the worst headache and obviously such a high dosage was way too high for my body to handle and I had no tolerance to it and it wasn't something that I've ever wanted to try or thought to try so it was a stupid decision to even want to try it and that's why I just got to be careful with what you take sometimes doctors will prescribe you medicines and things and they just don't work with your body they react differently and your experiences can be totally different to somebody else so you everyone can be laughing and having a great time and then you are freaking out and having the worst time and just now you get a complication and like I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna make it and it was an exaggeration because when I look back at the footage that I have the way I look in the video freaked out and not looking good at all my heart rate I got felt that and I can still feel that I can think about it and feel that scared feeling that I felt and it wasn't just because I was having some weird experience from the THC it was just it was pure anxiety and pure fear and yeah it's not something that I enjoyed at all I know I should have researched first it was one of us things that happen so fast that you make a stupid decision and it can affect you it was one of those kind of things because I love to research everything down to a tee before I take it when I had my thoracic outlet syndrome when I was on tremor doll I took like three tremor dolls and I threw the Box away because of all the first of all the way it made me feel I fall I couldn't feel like myself didn't take my pain away and all the side effects so I threw it away and cured myself naturally and this was just one of those things where it wasn't planned at all and just happened like in that split second I was like okay let me just take ten drops I mean what 10 drops gonna be and ya had the scariest 7 hours of my life fortunately I came right I eventually managed to stand after seven hours I managed to get up stand I felt horrible and weird and zoned out but I felt a little bit more relieved that I felt like myself I felt like it just slowed down enough to a point where I felt I felt okay and I could I could go home so yeah that's my experience it's a horrible experience now I know there's I've really got so many messages from people all over saying it took too much and if you want the right those who just message me or if you want proper CBD oil with no THC I'm not interested in any of those things I'm not interested in any of those kind of questions telling me that I took way too much because I know it took way too much for myself but this was just something I thought I'd share because there are so many websites that you read and and obviously it's promoted as a safe thing to take and obviously if it's measured properly and in the right dosages then it can be safe and it can be useful for many things but if you're just taking it and you don't have any knowledge about it and you're taking too much like I did it can be scary and it can be dangerous and just now you're taking a higher dose and your body can't handle it and you end up having a heart attack or stroke or something that could have been avoided because you don't know enough so I hope my experience can just hope somebody make the right decision and not just take some research first I have been struggling to train I've been back to training maybe once or twice but because I've been so busy at work I haven't like got myself back into training and making videos on regular basis so I'll get back to making all my podcast series that I was trying to work on before all of this happened I hope this can help somebody and at least make them think before they try something I'll see you guys soon", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "ioUMlIeceiw": "hey strangers so for today's video it's gonna be a little bit awkward because I may be in a tank top and underwear in a bathtub why because as you can tell by the title it is bellavita bath bombs which is infused with weed I'm pretty sure it says 25 milligrams each of THC I'm not a smoke like a weed smoker but I'm 420 friendly I don't really know what to expect but my best friend got me this the ingredients is baking soda citric acid coconut oil kaolin clay dead sea salt witch hazel natural vegan products the company is Bella Bella betta I thought was Bella Vita Oh Bella Vita bath bombs and apparently it's supposed to give you a body high I'm not sure how much they are cuz I again like I said I got it as a Christmas gift from my best friend Alex thank you but we're gonna just try one bomb there's different flavors here lemongrass lavender honeydew melon blue raspberry I think I'm gonna try the honeydew melon which I'm gonna assume it's the green one so let's pop in the bath I want to see if they'll give me a good like relaxation high cuz I'm not really a bath person but I'm really intrigued by this and because I also work at lush it's kind of different you know so let's try this out and I clean my top for this so it better give me some sort of relaxation and tomorrow off as well so let's put this in and see how it fizzes and then I'll sink myself in and let you guys know if I feel anything different [Music] it does sink all the way to the bottom though I forgot to show you guys the design let me show it off another one face and if I don't feel anything I might drop a second one in so keep that in mind I was actually gonna drink wine with this but then I thought about it like okay if I drink wine then I'll probably be buzzed and I'll be thinking oh [ __ ] getting buzzed off of this or you know so while that fizzes I'm gonna put the water in the rest of the way okay guys I'm gonna hop on in but look at the water it's gorgeous sorry cleave but um yeah let's hop on in I um I'm gonna step on in let you guys initially know how it feels and then yeah we'll see how it goes I have loaded an episode of call me crazy um that's not the show I learned an episode of Arthur cuz you know like 10 minutes long so we'll see if that actually sinks in now I'm looking at the water it does look like there's a little bit of bubbliness in there which is really strange but I usually don't see that with luscious bath bombs and I'm just comparing it to lunch because I'm used to it flushes okay let's chill here for about ten minutes and I'll let you guys know how it feels and if I'm gonna pop in another one okay just like pride the most Awkward bath bomb video ever but somebody's got to do it if somebody wants to get a body hi hey guys so it's been five minutes I do feel relaxed but not in a way where I would say like there's weed in my bath bomb you know I mean so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put a second one just to see if that helps elevate the body high experience and you guys can watch so we're gonna put in the orange one this time we're gonna let it fit behind me it is relaxing though I'm not gonna lie super relaxing but I want to see if I'm gonna get some sort of like euphoric experience from this as opposed to like a regular bath but the smell of it so the first one was melon this one I think is orange when you actually put it inside the bathtub that changed the scent but not in a bad way it still smells really good and I do notice like my skin is quite moisturized right now so that's great so I'm gonna lay back down and then finish the rest of the episode and let you guys know what I think it's so awkward though cuz literally I'm laying like this for like five minutes oh I didn't put the water too hot but I don't think I can lay in there for any longer cuz I'm sweating for my face as you could tell so I'm gonna take away the water and then later clean up my face and I'll come back and let you guys know what I thought afterwards but and I'll also mention if you guys need cleanup or anything like that okay so here's the tub afterwards not much cleaning actually it's just sorry dude I'm sorry dude but sorry like I just couldn't stay there for too long this is sweat and now I know why they say baths or facts are really good for like you know making you sweat detox the skin or whatever yeah this is also it which is crazy um but anyways my thoughts on it I'm not naked I have a towel my thoughts on is that um I feel like the weed infusion I thought I would see like little herbs of weed inside for some reason so I could feel like a weed soup but it actually I want to say that it did kind of made my feel I'm talking this way but it did make me feel slightly more relaxed than a regular bath bomb like my mind feels lightheaded a little bit I don't know if that's from the heat or what but I tried to keep my mind in a sense where it's like hey it's not gonna be a placebo effect this is a weed infused bath bomb I'll feel relaxed if I feel more relaxed than usual then it is what it is but it is a quite cool experience if you're like a bath bomb fanatic so if you want to try different types of bath bombs definitely give this one a try and let me know your thoughts on it what I repurchase it myself probably not only because I would rather do other ways you know I'm not gonna talk too much about it but if I were to feel a certain way I would do it differently did that make sense but anyways yeah it was going to experience I'm very thankful for the gift and I just wouldn't repurchase it again but definitely if you're a 4/20 fan and you want to try different experience in bathing not only to feel but also like kind of into your psyche then definitely check this out sorry if my review wasn't that great but hopefully it entices you to try something new and that's what I wanted to do with this one and maybe with two bath bombs it really helps cuz it says on the packaging so on the packaging it says there is 25 milligrams each so I basically put in 50 great milligrams in there and I think that really did help lift it a lot so yeah if you guys like what you see just keep in mind I do try to post a weekly vlog video and as well as a weekly beauty or fresh impression video and like always I like talking to myself that's not a lie if you like what you see hit subscribe thanks guys bye", "K3-PPyBdGOE": "if you're curious about cannabis but worried about getting too high then the practice of micro dosing may be the best place to start what is micro dosing and how does it work find out on this episode of we neezy by the growth of dipping your toes into the cannabis waters can seem daunting especially if you've had a bad experience in the past with overindulgence having too much cannabis or greening out can be overwhelming cause anxiety and generally just scare people off trying cannabis again that's where micro dosing can help this practice has been used by medical cannabis patients for years and is a great way to consume cannabis for anyone partaking but what is micro dosing micro dosing is used to help you determine what strain works best for you and at what quantity or dose since there is currently no standardized dosing guide for medical users this method has been used to help them find the best treatment plan for their cannabis medication but it works just as well for those who are enjoying cannabis for recreational reasons the standard mantra for micro dosing is start low and go slow starting low when consuming cannabis it's recommended that you start at a low dose first depending on the format you are using to consume dosing may be different with dried flower you may want to start with just a few draws on a joint vape or bomb if you're using oil capsules you may want to start with a 2.5 milligram dose versus a 10 milligram dose this also helps when trying different strains or CBD to THC ratios as every strain is different and your body will react to it differently by starting with a low dose you can monitor how each strain makes you feel and the way your body reacts to it going low on the dose will ensure you don't over indulge and give you insight into the strains and methods that work best for you going slow the second half of the mantra is all about taking your time don't rush the process as it may cause you to overindulge and have a bad experience part of micro dosing is about understanding how much you need to achieve the high you want that means testing testing and testing it's also important to understand how different consumption methods metabolize in the body for instance smoking cannabis typically metabolizes quickly and you can start to feel results in as little as 10 to 15 minutes while edibles can take anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours before you feel air effects edibles are a great example of the importance of the go-slow methodology often when people are first trying edibles they rush the process they become disappointed when they don't feel anything right away and either have more of the edible or consume cannabis another way because they don't think the edible worked this often leads to a very bad experience due to overindulgence as they aren't waiting long enough to be edible to take effect micro dosing is a tried-and-true format for finding your personal mix of the right consumption method strain and dose to maximize your

and now some dementia patients are self-medicating with cbd products without proper evidence of what the impact may be the researchers are now playing catch-up just beginning to study the possibility and efficacy of a cannabis drug for people with a spectrum of cognitive impairment issues recently researchers at king's college london are trying to use cannabis as a better alternative to antipsychotic medications that are currently used to treat aggression in patients with dementia but often come with dangerous side effects what are the differences between the two better known compounds in cannabis thc and cbd does the difference even matter thc is the main psychoactive component while cbd is primarily a relaxant thc is more potent than cbd producing the same effects with a lower dosage while the legality of thc usage is divided across state lines cbd is largely legal while thc causes temporary side effects such as slower reaction times and memory loss cbd is predominantly free of any of these effects at present researchers are trying to repurpose a cannabis drug named satifx which is an oral spray license in the u.s and the uk the drug which contains both thc and cbd was originally used for treating patients with multiple sclerosis and is now being repurposed to help treat dementia it attempts to target symptoms of agitation and aggression seen in patients with dementia the drug is designed to be a safer alternative and perhaps more effective treatment for dementia currently there's a scarcity of pharmacological treatments and some of them are rather damaging and dangerous especially in the long term so they would prescribe off-label antipsychotics for more severe cases of agitation in terms of side effects satisfaction is a relatively innocuous substance when compared to other antipsychotics it has common side effects such as increased dizziness dry mouth and risk of increased falls particularly in an elderly population even though it still has some side effects it's already a licensed drug that had gone through rigorous and objective clinical trials we already have much better awareness of what the psychological risks are overall speaking the cannabis drug with thc and cbd has therapeutic potential in a behavioral sense it may increase drowsiness which is similar to a calm and relaxed feeling but we still have to wait for the results to know whether cannabis is effective for treating dementia you", "x6BgfrYZ7sI": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews Juanes our gummies are produced by Buckeye relief

are juicy bursting with strawberry sweetness and a tart lemon flavor that's just right I wasn't wincing or pinching my lips while chewing on this gummy like I might with other sour candies if you're looking for that experience though I'd suggest mixing this gummy with some sour patch kids medicinally wanna sour gummies provide a one-to-one ratio of THC and CBD per gummy this translates to a medicinal experience that's both mildly euphoric and relaxing used a few hours before bed this gummy is excellent for distressing after a tough day it's also great for inflammation relief rest and

my name is Sara Vee and welcome back to the haze today I'm gonna be doing another review I'm gonna be viewing the BAM Camino by the very famous brand Kiva confection now you probably recognize the name Kiba because of their chocolate products that you see at most stores they're very well known for them they're very very delicious but today I'm gonna be talking about their gummies now this is the Bliss they do other flavors but I'm gonna be talking specifically about the Bliss which is their hybrid gummy let's talk a little bit about this awesome container it comes in a tin container which I really love it keeps the flavor really nice and fresh it is all summer themed and in the front they'll tell you how much milligrams which is a hundred for the entire one in every little gummy is five milligrams in the back it will also give you you know all the nutrition facts that you're counting your calories if you're trying to get high on a diet that will be there for you to open it it's just a quick little push down and turn voila and you'll find your gummies on the inside too it does give you a little bit more information on why they're called Caminos which I really love when an edible company kind of gives you that it kind of sets the scene it gets you in the mood for getting high every little gummy looks like this look at that little gummy how cute it is and it is five milligrams now the taste is delicious they're very tasty they're nice and sweet they're not crazy crazy good but they kind of remind you of movie theater candy like chewy sweet and something you just want to shove in your mouth all day for the high because these come with 20 of five milligrams your will needle II eat a lot of candy to really get super blown if you're willing to go down that road more power to you're willing to down twenty of these but I would say this edible is best use and best for people who are trying to micro dose specifically for the fact that every one of those little gummies is five milligrams if you're kind of a lightweight or you're doing something that you don't need to be high doesn't it take a little bit of the edge off even one or two of these or eating just one or even half of one if you're looking for a 2.5 is really great and it makes micro dosing so much easier with these guys yeah I can't say enough about how how nice these are for micro dosing and how great these are for also traveling if you're someone who gets nervous going on an airplane or something like that these are great because you won't get to blown where you'll get like super paranoid but you'll get high enough to take a little bit of that edge off which is really great if you're looking for something and that's gonna get you super high if you're looking at like go to a party and you don't drink it but you want to be stoned as hell these I'd I wouldn't it wouldn't be my first choice maybe if you have a slower tolerance or you're just getting into edibles this is for you especially if this is gonna be your first edible a try splitting one of these small gummies is so easy and they have like had like a fake little line between them that can kind of give you a little idea where to split it right in the middle these are awesome if you are working from home like a lot of us are these are great for that too because you won't get high you won't feel stupid you can get your job done but it also helps with a little bit of shaving off a little bit of that anxiety which is great yeah if you guys see these which see them a lot I've seen the prices range I've seen them from twenty dollars all the way up to thirty dollars so I guess it just depends on what dispenser you pick them up from these were pretty average for me nothing crazy that's before tap that's after tax and everything so if you guys see them out of dispensary if you got some extra dollars in your pocket I would say pick up the Camino by the Kiva you won't be disappointed you'll get high you might not get superstone but you'll get there so alright guys well that's my review for the day my name is Sarah P again thank you so much for watching in the haze and I'll catch you next

wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button for those of you that are new to the channel and if you've already subscribed thank you very much so I'm gonna leave a link to my CBD MCT oil and that's gonna kind of go over the entire deke art process so I'm just gonna run through a really quick today I've already packaged up my biotics flower and I have that right beside me here this is 24 grams of Vioxx flour which came in at 21.1% CBD and this is our bag of flour so I'm just gonna put this in the oven for 30 minutes D carb at 250 degrees okay so while we're waiting for the flour to D carp I'm gonna go over some of the materials you'll need to make the CBD coconut oil first you're going to need coconut oil now I have organic coconut oil just run to the middle nothing crazy I got this larger container at BJ's you can pick it up yourself you always get it on Amazon I like to use organic stuff same thing with my MCT oil it's just if you're going to be putting this kind of stuff into your body you're gonna want it to be organic and we've put all that effort into making our head flour organics so why not just buy some more more organic products the other thing you'll need is you'll need to measure out 2 cups of coconut oil and I'll get into that too but you definitely don't want a measuring cup and of course in today's video we'll we will be featuring the magic butter machine now this recipe can be used without a magic butter machine but for today's purposes we are going to be using a magic butter machine some people use crock pots some people use a bunch of other stuff I just like the magic butter machine because it's just a no mess situation its cleanup is super easy but you can't use another household kitchen gadgets so now we'll wait for the flour and we'll start making the oil okay so our canvas has just D carved in the oven so before we take it out we are going to add the coconut oil to the magic butter machine again if you're using a crock-pot or whatever the recipe is still the same but your device is going to be different so here I've measured out two cups of coconut oil and you're just gonna put it right in try to get as much of it as possible I know coconut oil can be a pain because of its solid texture and you know it melts at like I don't know 75 degrees or something like that so what I like to do too is take the glove and I'll just kind of use that to get the coconut oil off I can always wash the glove all right so that's all the coconut oil now we're going to grab our D carb M flower smells awesome and gonna add it right in make sure you get everything get this out of the way make sure everything's out I'm gonna put this right on lockdown I'm gonna go ahead and plug it in all right and so the magic butter machine recipe typically calls for two hours at 160 degrees but I like to do 160 degrees for four hours I like the longer cook so that's it now we just wait for the machine all right so the magic butter machine is now done it's been four hours and we're going to take the top off here now looks to be pretty nice not a whole lot of mess this time around which is great shake it off a little bit and now we're gonna slide this scoop off the edge let me show you inside here very typical for this machine you just want to scoop off the edge get as much as you can that plant material holds all that CBD all the good stuff that down I put the glove on my right hand and I am going to pour [Applause] he's gonna get all that juice out of there looks really good so now we'll put this off to the side just back up now there's some plant material down there in the bottom so I'm just gonna scoop the rest of this out all right give this one more good squeeze you can see right there just squeezing it get the most you can out of it that looks to be it so we'll put this in our sink and that is it so what I'll do is I'll take the coconut oil I'll put it in these mason jars and I will let it rest it will risa Lydda fie and you can do what you want with it now the great thing about coconut oil is you can add it to your lotion you can cook with it you can use it as a lotion you can pretty much do anything you really want with coconut oil it's kind of a really good way to use CBD but that's today's recipe that's all I have for if you wouldn't mind please hit that subscribe button if you're new here to the channel and

heard people talk about you know it's good for back pain and all this other stuff and I found the curcumin is actually way way better for back pain than the CBD oil was for me although I haven't tried the lotions and stuff like that but then also THC and edibles especially like the OL spray or like a vape pen before going to bed I found that that helps me out a little bit with sleep if I'm if I'm struggling with sleep so I know there are obvious upsides and downsides I like to get some opinions on this we asked some data we don't even need it and we were we were actually talking about this over breakfast that's the kind of guys that we are yeah so the interesting thing is that CBD on its own based on the data that's available should not help with sleep so basically when they've looked at it and they've given people CBD alone or CBD plus THC the CBD alone can actually cause alertness and it may be to do with how CBD and THC affect cortisol metabolism there's some other stuff of it you know the the signal the ways they signal you know so some people may sleep worse if they take CBD and but when you add THC then people seem to sleep better so there's like a there's a synergism there however I can say for personal experience that I've tried CBD alone before bed and it certainly seems to help it certainly does seem to help me sleep and why that is I actually I actually don't know I don't have a study to say this is why I think there's the you know there's gonna be an interaction with all the other things that are going on in the gut CBD has certainly been shown or you know to improve got information got health I don't think that's an issue for me but that's particularly animal studies and now it's been translated CBD is now being used for in cancer therapies and for epileptics and they're starting to use it in people with inflammatory bowel disease so can certainly have a number of benefits I haven't tried the CBD plus THD THC was more of a thing I did in my teenage years but but have both been shown potentially to help with sleep the the potential downsides are obviously then can interfere with cool summers harbors and all this other stuff so if it's not causing it if it's not causing you benefit then you know there's no there's potential downsides for taking it so I mean we do think you know particularly for people you know heavy marijuana users there is some risk of mental health issues if that's coming from THC or other things you know of is obviously the the strength the concentration of THC in marijuana has increased dramatically over the last few decades so there's there's multiple factors that play there if you're taking 10 milligrams of THC with 30 milligrams of CBD before bed you know you're probably well under that that risk first hold but there are studies that show that it interferes with hormone metabolism called slow metabolism so it's just it's at the moment is kind of a try it out and see if it benefits you but equally you know we roll back to our continuous message which is why aren't you sleeping in the first place right you don't want to medicate yourself to sleep you want to find out what it is it's causing your poor sleep in the first place similar to the melatonin in the apple meadow that can help but but that is a band-aid off the band-aid that you not having enough melatonin because you're exposing yourself to bright lights at night all you know it's something like that right and so I think the micro dose with are the few times where I've done edibles where I get a like oh I can't do anything else besides eat potato chips today I just I don't like the feeling and so I I tend to I tend to avoid avoid that but I also have found that the mental health thing so I have the mental health problems running my family my dad was schizophrenic my brother was schizophrenic killed himself and so I know like that's the reason I won't do psilocybin and other things because there's a potential for you know even though I think I'm well past the age at this point where those symptoms would present themselves I do notice that the couple times where I've tried that an edible that is like Oh like this is too much the next day I it's like the roller coaster there you can't have the high without the low sort of thing and the entire next day I'm just like oh wait I should be happy right now but I cannot be happy this is a thing this is a story for anything that you take to try and change the way your brain functions but what we usually say is there's no biological free lunch right you can't ask your brain to do something which you wouldn't normally do and then expect it to be completely normal after so nootropics are a classic example you know you take these compounds are supposed to increase brain cognitive function various brain functions but it might increase function in one area but it makes you less good in another area and then so maybe well I will do I'll take a nootropic usually book the only time I do is before a podcast yeah and I know in afternoons I all I have this brush yeah yeah there is a nootropic crash for me I thought maybe I was unique in that because I've never heard anyone else talk about it but no I'm certain if experience the same and there are some some nootropics that are basically just like the kitchen sink everything's in there and this sort of light switches everything on you definitely notice a difference but then you gotta come down later so I often liken it to taking MDMA where your lights switch everything on you feel great and then you know a few hours later you have this you have this big come down and it's not the same for everybody again it's something that you have to experiment with yourself but but you know again we go back to why isn't your brain functioning as you would like it to why do you feel the need to take something to enhance your brain function are there other things you could be fixing and therefore you don't need to take that it's propak in the first place you know that's always where we're gonna go back to and then if you know occasionally you need to try something like that you just need to be aware they're asking your body or brain to do something you wouldn't normally do you might gonna you're gonna pay for it later yeah from either the THC thing is not to a point where it's or at least that I feel there's any sort of psychoactive effect it it's it's like micro dosing that's like one or two milligram sort of thing and the thing that helps me with is with the sleep is it prolongs the the period where I stay asleep another thing that has really helped me and I I've had to get really sort of diligent about it and I screw up still all the time water I drink a lot of water during the day but I stop at 5:00 p.m. I stop drinking liquids of 5:00 and that way I don't feel compelled to get up at 3:30 a.m. to pee which but sometimes when that happens I get up at 3:30 a.m. and I'm like I'm up I can't get back to sleep now and so I found those two things for me in the water is probably way more helpful than the THC to be honest with you so just something to think about any other words about THC no it's not something that really interested me on the c-word site about the stuff that's free like sunshine I'm very excited about where as yeah sunshine deficiency can definitely cause insomnia so like you can fix that first before having to buy a supplement we so we the one reason why we talk about CBD is because again it might help with people with inflamed guts and we see a lot of those so we know a lot of people who feel they've benefitted from taking you for some see yeah so that's an interesting thing that you bought up recently is that maybe you have some problem that's stopping you from sleeping and then you take another thing that makes that first problem worse and maybe introduces another problem but the net effect is still positive and so your sleep does get better yeah you", "Sfpk2w-wGNY": "this is always a joy to talk about first of all dementia because it's very close to my heart in terms of taking care of dementia patients but I'm a geriatrician so I take care of older adults and if you want to consider what my specialties are it's in long-term care dementia and end-of-life or hospice and palliative care the buck stops with me I always say is unfortunately my patients die my goal is the best quality of life all right for the duration of their life the best part and the best quality of care so I also run a geriatric fellowship program training young physicians to become geriatric physicians for all of you in here and my advice and certainly when I'm in the training process I'm training them so that they know me and how to take care of me when I get older because I'm kind of picky but also I would recommend that geriatric medicine is a lot different than primary care medicine that's internal medicine or family medicine the whole principles are quite different and actually if you look back at what's happening in our primary care medicine you see the changes that might be occurring more of a holistic approach more of a team approach more of a shared decision-making and also planning for advanced directives in terms of advanced care planning so to speak what happens if I get this this or that as I get older dealing with dementia and the primary emphasis on this particular talk is is what can we do with regards to patients who have behavioral issues with dementia patients and it's marijuana possibly a role in terms of how we might look at alternative ways how we manage these behaviors in addition there's a lot of confusion before that's all right there's a lot of confusion as far as what the hell is marijuana and I would guarantee you that if I go around I bet you I might get 10 or 15 different answers of what marijuana is and then if I bring up the term cannabis what's cannabis okay so I hate to say this but much like I had to do is I have to learn some basics so I'm going to go over some basics so that when you see something advertised CBD oil is being advertised on every street corner that you can buy it here what is it that I'm getting because then what's the difference between marijuana and CBD oil or is there a difference I don't know so so I'm going to go into some basics and then I'm going to talk to you about some of the studies with regards to the use of marijuana where we stand with regards the use of that some of the positive pros and cons if you will of it and then switch into where do we stand with regards to the use in dementia or Alzheimer's dementia before I start I want to ask how many of you are caregivers or have experience with patients who have dementia good a good portion so you'll be definitely interested in where we stand with regards to the use of cannabis if you will in our patients who have dementia the first slide up here is I have geriatrics and polypharmacy good and bad news is we're living longer the bad news is is that we have more medical problems as we grow older and therefore usually that means that we're on a lot of medicines so in Doc's particularly our specialists like to prescribe a lot of medicines because they say you can't live without them I'm on the other side and the other side of that is is that I'm looking at people who are on these drugs but are having adverse effects of those meds and you know what a lot of the drugs that we use have what they call black box warnings that means that you could die from them so it's a constant balance if you will in terms of always assessing the benefit versus the risk overall and all of us as healthcare providers is do no harm alright that's easier said than done okay and you'll see why maybe as we go on so let's take a look the next slide is the problem behaviors are very common the most consistent abnormality that you're going to see over the course of dementia the course of dementia varies anywhere Alzheimer's dementia between eight to ten years but it goes anywhere from three years to twenty years all right so you can see the differences in terms of life span and now there are multiple types of dementia has anything in in this world it gets more complicated so we're finding different forms each of these different forms have a different we'll say memory effects if you will and other neurological deficits that we really have to be a student of to pick them up because it really does mean our this is this particular type more prone to behaviors versus not and if so how do we differentiate that and how are we going to adjust our medications okay and the behaviors are characterized for any of you that are involved in taking care of some dementia patients agitation verbal and aggressive behave behaviors all right and what does that mean hitting patients are hitting slapping biting kicking anybody have experience with their patients on that okay that's disturbing re or the good old yelling and screaming help me help me help me help me shut up well yeah all right and you just want to say that but these are all problems and they're difficult to manage and by the way how we manage them is different starting off by I want to say that the thing is a significant thing is is that there are serious complications that can be associated with that I can walk up to you and I could say you know you're a son of a [ __ ] all right and you're gonna slap me alright how dare you say that to me so number one patient may get hurt the other resident may get hurt and if somebody's trying to do a activities of daily living cleaning them changing them whatever it is they may get agitated they made kick and scratch is this comment yes it's very common okay and the question comes up is what do you do about it okay when the problem is is that the treatment options are very limited I can go through a list of about four different medicine medical medication groups and we've tried them all and each of them are associated with complications all right some more serious than not some of them as I said that can even result in death the more common drugs that have been used all right are now have the black box warning saying that you could die from this from sudden cardiac death that's only a minor not a minor complication but that's only one of the many complications that are associated with taking these medicines next slide please so possible solution can the use of cannabis be a benefit to assist in the management of these behaviors next slide so first thing is what is cannabis and what is marijuana so I'm gonna go through some basics and just so we all understand that and hopefully bring it home in terms of what we're looking at when we're trying to evaluate the benefit versus the risk of using marijuana or cannabis all right in our patients so next slide so the cannabis plants which are oftentimes said the marijuana plant so they use them interchangeably but it really is a cannabis plant alright and originally they were from East Asia but now as we all know they're cultivated throughout the whole world so everybody's growing marijuana all right original use was Industrial fiber seed oil hemp seed oil for example hemp seeds for recreational purses purposes religious and spiritual purposes to elevate the mood and lastly now more recently with the medication that we're looking at in terms of is this an appropriate type of medicine you actually have three different strains the most common ones there's probably several ones listed seva sativa the indica strain and one that we don't hear much about is this third strain which a true Dallas ruderalis and this Teva notoriously that strain so if you have a plant that's high or of this de Teva strain its where really most of the marijuana in quote marijuana as we can't say it which is invigorating uplifting okay and activating if you will makes you feel good as opposed to the indica stre which is more sedating relaxing sleep makes you sleep better okay there's characteristic and where CBD comes from okay so the next slide so the two main varieties that we see from coming from these plants and I'll start by saying there's a term that they use is of final phyto cannabinoids alright and we'll just use cannabinoids in general it's a technical term I realize that but the reason I'm using that is phyto means that there are the naturally occurring which is where marijuana comes from literally and then the endocannabinoids and guess what there in our brain we have marijuana going in our brain let's call it cannabis as opposed to marijuana all right so it's kind of tricky we'll get to that a little bit more so marijuana has a high THC content psychoactive intoxicating this is what we traditionally see on the streets and everybody's taking it particularly for all those medical problems that it's interesting how the young people have more medical problems than the older people when it comes to use of marijuana it's kind of interesting all right and then hemp all right which is basically CBD content in what we're seeing the CBD oils and different products from CBD that we're seeing on the market all right it's not psychoactive it's not intoxicating and again this is where most of the uses was in for industrial use again hemp seed hemp oil now the amazing thing is is that this last thing these are chemicals that circulate or that are fun in this plant there are four hundred approximately four hundred and eighty different chemicals that are in our marijuana plant hey and second of all of those known there's about 65 that have some chemical structure that are related to the endocannabinoids which are the ones that are circulating in our brain okay so it's a plant and you say well you know where should we really be dealing with this but how many of you familiar everybody's familiar with penicillin where did it come from it comes from a mold okay so it's be surprising how many things we might get up natural products that may be a benefit to us that we don't know about the problem is we need to study it and decide what is appropriate what isn't appropriate so some of the terms that you may hear marijuana the main ingredient in that is THC and that mostly comes from the flowers all right in the leaves of the plant when you get down to the stalks the plants this is where hemp is derived from from the stems and the stalks then you have terpenes and terpenoids and science interesting is it but how many Herot of aromatherapy all right everybody's heard of Roma therapy that's basically terpenoids it's a it's a class of chemicals that gives us scent all right I was recently in Amsterdam and it's like on every other corner is either a coffee shop which is literally a marijuana shop as opposed to a cafe which is a coffee shop or a head's shop all right which is all marijuana and it was kind of interesting because I went in there and they say well this is a lemon flavor this is a strawberry favor this is a caramel flavor I mean how many flavors do you have but nonetheless this is basically what they're talking about the terpenoids end up making the the smell and that they have very as medicinal effects such as lavender for example is relaxing to help you go to sleep so theoretically the terpenoids have some contribution to the effects of marijuana and then you have hash and hashish which is basically an extracted cannabis product composed of compressed purified preparations of stock resin gland and hashish is oftentimes the drug that they refer to which is the resident of the cannabis plant this is something that normally is smoked a lot so for some of the younger people this is probably old hat in here am i right now I'm looking I'm looking around for the younger nobody's even acknowledged he met alright and then lastly and this is where I got to keep in mind for those that are growing marijuana plants if you take a marijuana plant and you just crush it up put everything in it that's what you're going to get and you're gonna smoke it but you don't know what's in it and that's a real problem in a sense you don't know if it's got a lot of THC you don't know if it's got byproducts that are dangerous for you so and that's why buying street marihuana is really a raise as a concern in terms of what you're getting in that product okay so it's very variable therapeutic effect I don't know if you know but the recent statistics since marijuana has been legalized the number of ER visits associated with acute psychotic reactions related to that have gone up significantly okay so the only point is to point out some of the concerns that you have with what you're getting and and what effect it's going to have on you and the concerns that we all have and so if I has a geriatric doc is going to be prescribing a medicine for you or your loved one my concern is am i doing more harm am I going to create some problems okay so as I mentioned predominate temp is predominantly CBD this is normally what we're getting when we go and get some CBD all right has a lower concentration of THC it is the only legalized form of cannabis that can be prescribed without a prescription you know in order to get marijuana you have to have a medical marijuana card in order to get CBD you really don't now the good news is that it recently has been reclassified I think it's reclassified in thirty states Arizona is one of them so let me go back and just talk about when I talk about a Schedule one schedule to schedule one is no currently accepted medical use and the highest potential for abuse where do the opiates come they come in schedule two proven medical benefit all right but a high risk for abuse and that's why we have the open opioid crisis schedule 5 is medications with a low quantities of narcotics and low potential for abuse now I put robitussin does everybody know robitussin dm has everybody taking it you know that's a drug as central nervous side effects alright theoretically and the doses that we get or give you're probably not going to get much but actually so CBD has gone from a scheduled one all the way down to a Schedule five that's good news okay however the criteria must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration it can't have a content higher than 0.3 and that's vary from state to state some people will say 0.1% all right marijuana still scheduled as get Road ones rug so it's still not legal can be purchased without obtaining the medication of a marijuana card and the federal law keep in mind here's the difference a federal law it's still illegal CBD is still illegal some of you may have seen the news where the lady was arrested getting on an airplane she had CBD cream or oil or point mint of some sort and she was arrested it's under the airports are under federal jurisdiction therefore it's theoretically illegal and I want to mention that because from the standpoint of myself and treating this I have to be careful I mean if I do it in a federally regulated facility am I breaking the law and the question come and I don't want to get arrested not yet I mean you know I just got back one more just real quick gee oh that's I wanted to say so you really have to be careful federal law still has that Seabee oil and other cannabis cannibal dials are listening to schedule a and the newest drug which is mostly CBD is epi epi Leah Dix I don't know if you've heard about this but this is the medicine that now has been approved for seizures and young kids and really thought to be a benefit the studies look promising and there's a couple of new drugs that are coming out soon and ou allude to them as we go on next slide please so these are the benefits all right potential benefits all right keep in mind that CBD is a non psychoactive and there are very few side effects we've already talked about the pediatric seizures epidural ox is mine anxiety nausea vomiting inflammatory conditions paying Alzheimer's dementia Parkinson's disease but actually studied more in Parkinson's disease in an Alzheimer's dementia alright but so these are some of the potential benefits and now if these are benefits why aren't we looking at them more closely and try to determine you know what are these benefits and are there any potential side effects next slide on the other hand THC I'll talk a little bit more about the ratios THC is activating and a CBD counteracts that activation by cousin and relaxing so if you combine the two has thought that you may potentiate the effect of the eventual effective of any of the symptoms that you are treating on the other hand the CBD counteracts you just don't want to give the THC to you know having everybody sort of activated if you will that's what you're trying to suppress particularly in patients who have a cognitive impairment alright but pain is probably the biggest area where we're talking about and this is arthritic pain as well as what they call neuropathic pain or peripheral neuropathies opioid modulation we're gonna get to that a little bit more and I'm gonna tell you a little bit about how I think that there is some positive things coming out of the use of the marijuana that we're seeing in dealing with anxiety insomnia and spasticity the spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis so there is a new drug that's going to be coming out soon if any day is going to be approved for the use in patients who have must multiple sclerosis and has an appetite stimulant and I'm a little bit more or less disappointed in the one that we currently have we have a drug called Marinol and I think it's very expensive I've used it I think it's worthless drug and I unfortunately people still ask if we can take it and I usually say no because it is expensive and Medicare does not pay for it next slide so these are the synthetic cannabinoids which are Marinol is the drug that I talked about with regards to appetite stimulant epi dialogue which is for the pediatric seizures salty Beck says is the one that's now going to be produced it's almost there for spasticity with multiple sclerosis very positive outcome but good studies are eight that have shown the benefit and that's what really we need and then you have that naturally-occurring canna at cannabinoids which are marijuana in the derivatives and then now over-the-counter CBD as you as I mentioned you know I need any prescription you don't need anything you can walk in and you get CBD a buy it bottom line it's pretty expensive so bear with me again we're using CBD is it a benefit and I'll give you my own personal experience as a physician prescribing it for some of my patients next slide as you might guess we all know that smoking and vaping are big things I do want to tell you that I did bring along some brownies for you when you leave so I hope you had enjoy the rest of your day and just enjoy all right these are very common my wife just got some but I see quite a few people in terms of using this and rubbing it on our thrity joints I'm gonna say it's probably 50/50 and keep in mind you always have to think in terms of placebo something soft on your on your arthritic pain might make you feel better but it isn't really truly doing anything for the inflammation then the tinctures and oils this is what we are more or less using in our studies because it's easy for the patients to take the problem with the Edible is it's highly variable of how much marijuana if you will is in that particular cookie that you're taking and now you know in alcoholic beverages as well as soft drinks they are now putting CBD in those drinks and lastly transdermal patches and suppositories hopefully we don't have to get to that point to use those next slide so what is some relationship between plant cannabis all right the phyto cannabinoids all right and the endocannabinoid cannabinoids come yeah all right next slide all right so there is an endocannabinoid system in our brain and it consists of it's a biological system is composed of a lot of cannabinoids that are moving around in the brain okay all right and they actually ask as neurotransmitters I like this short order neurotransmitter transmitters basically what I'm saying is I say if you feel depressed okay the cannabinoids will have an increased secretion of those they'll hook onto the cannabinoid receptors and maybe counteract the depression so that makes sense to you you follow me so it's a chemical that attaches on or the chemical itself that's going to cause a reaction that's the same mechanism as all the other drugs that we use by the way right how many of you heard of serotonin okay so serotonin same thing okay basically the same thing and look how much we've studied with serotonin all right dopamine another one these are all chemicals that circulating the brain and have our neurotransmitters that create some kind of a reaction where they hook on to a receptor okay so the two that we know of now and there are many all right just what two AG and you don't have to know this but but these are mostly fun in the brain and then Ananda mind is the other one which is fun in higher concentrations of the body now the reason I say that is that they're all over the place so you have certain ones that are predominantly in the brain and certain ones that are predominantly in the bloodstream circulating in the body okay now they are also broken down and I maybe this is a little too technical but CBD and THC work a little bit differently CBD attacks this enzyme which breaks down cannabinoids okay and you don't want to do that I'm going to just say if you use Parkinson's disease you have dopamine and you have an absence of dopamine that gives you the Parkinson's symptoms so the question comes up is you don't want to take something that might be a benefit for you and decrease that okay on the other hand THC acts directly on the receptors alright and if it gives you more of a prolonged effect alright for whatever that endpoint is on the receptor depends on what system is in if it's in the system of the hypothalamus for example it may improve your appetite okay if it's in another system may help your memory if you will alright so there's different different mechanisms we just don't know enough about them yet next slide then these are the receptors cb1 receptors which are found mostly in the brain and spinal cord and then these they're concentrated in the brain regions associated with that behavior so again I mentioned the hypothalamus and maybe if we're gonna stimulate the appetite for example and just using that again cannabinoids you give them and they're going to stimulate the appetite you hear that the rationale behind the thinking behind is there a benefit for appetite stimulant and then the cb2 receptors found in a peripheral nervous system now this is where the anti-inflammatory approach comes in so it works on the immune system and it creates an anti-inflammatory so if you have arthritis theoretically all right it's going to make the arthritis feel less inflamed if you will as an anti-inflammatory drug and I don't know if as we get older the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs these of the advils and that person and a whole host of medicines that we take for our arthritis but as we get older there are more complications associated with it so for all practical purposes they almost become contraindicated in our older patients again what alternatives do we have for managing pain okay then I won't go into that x5 so let's take a look these are the things that internally in our own brain that they may be affecting appetite metabolism pain sleep mood movement it goes all the way down all right now the reason I say that our our older patients but better yet dementia patients have trouble with the appetite they may not eat they have pain that they can't describe so we don't know whether they have or have not pain but the older you get more likely you're gonna have arthritic pain sleep insomnia is a common problem people have sleep disorders all right and mood so it waxes in wane sometimes or more activated other times are more sleepy so we really have to deal with that but remember they also are involved in our basic functions our everyday living okay next slide so the latest term that's coming out is are there individuals which have a lower amount that are necessary to maintain good health vitality and well-being all right so this is called an end and kinetic cannabinoid deficiency and is there a syndrome that occurs now let me give you just a rough maybe guesstimate because it is being used how many people are familiar with fibromyalgia okay everybody okay good all right that's it's so about depressed effect aches all over okay do you think maybe it could be that there's a cannabinoid which affects all of these areas that that our patients complain of with fibromyalgia it's being tried so far there are no definitive results but I noticed that they are using it more and more and people who have fibromyalgia with the Hope Center because there is no good treatment so far all right there's a lot of treatment that's out there question is note I said good treatment so it's always possible to look into this so it raises the question is why are we looking at this if we look at dopamine deficiency serotonin deficiency why are we looking at the cannabinoid deficiency there's occurs in the brain next slide so and why is there more need this is certainly the reason why there's a need for more studies next slide ok I'll start off by saying is there a plus side all right to the use of marijuana that's been described we talked about all the symptoms and symptoms that are associated with it okay I feel hi that might be kids that are good a lot of these others were not sure of but we still use it with the hopes that we're gonna feel better have a good time sometimes it's the difference between taking an alcoholic beverage as well as a puff of marijuana that the trade-off is you're gonna feel better maybe with both which one has the least amount of side effects there are those what argue marijuana has the least amount of side effects I'm not going to go there but let's let's go studies have shown that that there is a reduction in prescription medicine so let's take a look at that a very important slide next slide so changes associated with state having a medical marijuana law in numbers of Medicaid prescriptions for drugs used to treat condition with medical marijuana look at this anxiety depression Lacombe a-- nausea pain psychosis seizures sleep the only ones spasticity quite sure why that fell out to be quite frank with you but the bottom line is so there are some studies that that you can look at CMS the Medicare Medicaid data and come up with there's less there's a reduction in the use of medications for each of these next one even more important okay in consideration of the opioid epidemic all right we have now look at over here this is every number of daily doses filled with the prescription drugs annually per physician in states with medical marijuana law by condition categorize category studied compared to the average number in states without a law look at the difference and and the one I point to is paying okay now we're in an opioid crisis no I don't want to say that we're gonna trade an opioid crisis for a marijuana crisis all right but the point being is as a river really need to look at this very very closely because we are in an opioid crisis and the question is do we have an alternative all right in terms of particularly going through withdrawal and some of the other medicines that we give to our patients who are addicted to opioids so that's a very important statistic I thought and perhaps a benefit that we need to look into a little bit more now as you know there's also on the other side in States who have legalized marijuana there's an increased incidence of motor vehicle accidents alright so a lot of negative things that obviously is quoted in the newspapers and you can quote it either way for those probe those anti marijuana use my concern is is that we just need more studies in order to make sure that we know what we're doing next thing next slide so this gives you an idea of the different studies if you take a look at the number of studies all right these are controlled studies 28 for paying 28 for nausea vomitting 14 for multiple sclerosis and if you take a look at the patients now the point is in order to have an adequate research study you really have to have large numbers and what's problem is is that if you go all the way down and looking here sleep disorder psychosis anxiety disorders alright there are very few studies you're really looking at them here and this is from 2:15 2015 now this was a meta-analysis so basically the Cochran study what they usually do is they look at all these studies that are put together all right that have been done on marijuana and they try to analyze whether they've been good studies or bad studies in this case they just looked to see if there were studies but take a look at these numbers I mean for twenty four glaucoma is something that wherever it is there's only a few six six studies for glaucoma and yet that's being billed as something that you can use marijuana for glaucoma and for eggs sleep disorders all right which are very common not only in our patients with dementia but in our older population in general so you could see there aren't many studies next slide so pain management since that is it so again here was again another Cochran study where they looked at all these different studies now note a lot of these with cannabinoid and with THC and the others are usually with pharmaceutical companies but if you really take a look all those dots are squares that are on the right side all right show that that favors the use of marijuana all right those on the opposite side know and negative I didn't go into each of these studies to see whether they were good studies bad studies whatever they may be I'm gonna point out some problems that we have with our dementia patients in terms of doing studies and how effective they are and the problems we have on judging whether or not they are really truly an improvement or not and I'll go into that a little bit later but the consensus is is that they probably do help in pain so let's take a look at that and can we find something the pharmaceutical industry is trying to produce an fda-approved drug alright which will have the combination of THC and CBD and to try to see whether or not it's effective or not and hopefully like some of the other drugs will get that passed so that you are able to take that whether you're it's federally regulated or not that you will be able to take that as a drug next slide don't go too far with this but I will tell you this all right and much as I talked about serotonin and dopamine alright there is some consider in some of the bay science is that maybe this is marijuana as neuroprotective now one of the things is with regards to marijuana they say it creates apathy all right over a long term used chronic use but we don't know what that chronic use is so the question is a little bit okay or is too much not okay so we don't know the answer to that so the bottom line is that but they it may be neuroprotective now again I don't want to go into this but I will solve it but much as I talked about serotonin dopamine and cannabinoids alright with dementia acetylcholine goes down alright and the drugs that we have available increase the acetylcholine alright and that improves memory that's just a very simple simplistic version of what happens in Alzheimer's dementia but THC competes competitively inhibits cholinesterase inhibitor all right that's what breaks down acetylcholine so and that's how the mechanism of these new drugs work is they they destroy the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine are you all following me on that I mean is that okay you got okay so I'm trying so that is one mechanism the other is is there's a still a theory that that this is an anti inflammatory process so we're looking at drugs perhaps that would be anti inflammatory in nature one of the drugs that promoted that maybe we don't even you don't even know about is is the statins are anti inflammatory and a lot of the benefits of the statins are from its anti-inflammatory effects so the question comes up is this is somewhat like an antioxidant and actually there's some pretty good studies with our diet that we take which is high in antioxidants is a good diet is one of the factors that you can be on to delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer's dementia so I mean we can do a lot of this on our own the question comes up is is there an effect on from the will comb cannabinoids for right now in terms of perhaps delaying the onset or improving dementia in our patients this we don't know not looking into that now but there are some studies next day next time so these are the drugs now in in dementia studies that have been and I'm gonna kind of go over these a little bit quickly but Marinol is the only drug that has been approved and for appetite stimulant that's predominantly its effect we've used that and it supposedly causes decreased agitation I'm just going to tell you right now I think it's worthless I think it's an expensive drug that has very little effect and I don't prescribe it because it's not covered by Medicare first of all you have to pay for it I just don't think it's of any benefit so most of the studies that came out are really using low dose everybody's concerned with THC and for justifiable reasons it makes you high so if I have an agitated patient with dementia do I want to give them a drug that's going to make them more agitated okay so what they did is they they gave low dose of THC alright and and it didn't appear more beneficial than placebos in a small study only 58 patients received this and they received a relatively small dose of THC over a period of time did not have CBD in it so the question comes up or it may have had a little but mostly it was THC study so then they went to a little bit higher doses using cannabis oil and in 11 patients no I want to tell you again love and patience means nothing how many of people have heard of prevacid gonna have a scent I know even if you're taking it I'm gonna tell you it's a waste of money but alright the point being is is that the studies that we're done are absolutely ridiculous and how they have marketed that I think is really pathetic because they are making tons and tons of medicine on this drug it's not a drug you can get over the counter but I think it's actually like $60.00 a month something like that and I just think it's a shame it's it's we're a vulnerable society and we don't want to get dementia so if somebody advertises this drug no harm but you're paying $60 a month if you're on a limited income that's a lot of money okay plain and simply but these were done on hospitalized patients now the NPI is one of the tests that is good for monitoring behaviors in dementia patients and in non dimensions okay but mostly in dementia patients now these were patients who are hospitalized so we just say when a hospitalized patients is high with dementia is hospitalized there are 18 other different things that can be going on the most common which is delirium so we don't know if it helped of delirium or the dementia they seem to say that it was improved and maybe it's a drug that we should look at as opposed to some of the more toxic drugs that we use in hospitalized patients who develop delirium maybe we should look into them the Cochrane review all right basically found no evidence that cannabinoids are effective in reducing symptoms so that basically saying is all the studies it's inconclusive that there is any benefit that doesn't mean that they're abnormal next slide I like to study that recently came on it's a study from Sweden and it came out in this past in April of two night 2019 and they did and the reason I liked this study is because this is along the studies that we're doing in in our dementia units okay they were in a dementia directed care facilities and Jen mentioned to you that that I work out of a facility called Silverado and it's a dementia directed care assisted living facility all patients with dementia it's a prospective study so we're kind of starting with a baseline all right but anyway they did ten female patients I have no idea why they only included female patients as opposed to male patients with severe behavioral problems and they were given larger than previous doses of cannabis and here's this ratio CBD and THC so if you're gonna give larger doses of THC you want to counterbalance that with CBD now the question comes up is are we negating the effects of THC by giving the CBD or what nobody knows this answer okay we don't know this answer but they did monitor the behaviors and the results there was a 40% improvement and behavior scales and they used a decrease of psychotropic medicines now I will tell you here if I have somebody on psychotropic medicines alright and then I decrease their medicine you know they're more alert more active and so what are we dealing with we're dealing with the excess disability associated with these medicines so the idea is it was at the marijuana or was it us just decrease into medication okay improving up daily care and improvement in direct contact so if you're a zombie on mantra medicine and I take you off the medicine and all of a sudden you're communicating to me I'm just saying this is some of the difficulties that we have in studying this it's just not an easy thing to study however the relief there was no adverse side-effects which is great and there was relief was persistent after two months off the medicines and by the way when we take patients off medicines oftentimes they get better and stay better with or without marijuana so it is tricky next slide this is the Arizona study that we're talking about now first of all I wanted to talk about some of the problems we have encountered with regards to beginning this study and doing this study we're in the process of it now but you have to get a marijuana card and from Arizona the state of Arizona the question comes up is if you have a patient who has dimension no longer capable of making their own healthcare decisions then does the caregiver be responsible for getting a card but basically now the consensus is is that both the caregiver as well as the patient have to get a card now this entails now take a ninety-year-old with dementia who has had dementia for eight years do you think they have a driver's license do you think they have a recent photo huh yeah you hope not that's right so my point being is it's really hard to get this information and it becomes costly I don't know if any of you know what the cost of staying in a a dementia directed care facility I mean it's anywhere from 5,000 to 8,000 and and continually going up okay that's a lot of expenses now you throw an other expense on we are actually we need two cards we're gonna get the medicine for for free so you need to necessary offer me information and the left doesn't know the right to be quite frank with you as far as what the actual law is so and and there's still a lot of confusion and I hear different things and the other concern is liability issues all right facility will maybe not wanting to take an effective side effects now we're doing I want to consider this as a pilot study and not at what they call an institutional review board study which is much more scientific but I want to get some preliminary data then go and get a random randomized controlled study that would allow me to have more teeth in this so we're at this point we're using anywhere from 15 to 20 20 patients and keep in mind I don't know that I could get this done in a federal facility so a skilled nursing facility that's under the regulations of federal regulations I'm not quite sure I can do that and as I mentioned the liability concerns at this point though I'm at least glad that they have legalized marijuana medicinal marijuana in Arizona that allows me at least to opened the door and start these studies yes well you have to go through a Medicare I'm sorry I'm a marijuana prescriber usually all right so I'm a medical marijuana prescriber and so I can it's okay to order it I put my name I fill out a form that your PCP can do that also it's very easy to get a medication marijuana card rather so but for this in this particular study I'm the primary care physician for the most part and if I'm not I will get it through the primary care physician of whoever's the physician for the Alzheimer patient that's not not a patient of mine next fine all right so this is our study anywhere from 10 to 15 to 20 we have approximately 15 patients that are signed up about a 16 week trial we're using the cannabis oil that's been shown to be the best route for patients who have dementia with a 2 to run CBD to THC all right now the other thing I wanted to mention is if you're going to get THC it has to be quantify alright because if I get THC from you and you and you from a particular company it's liable to be a different mo I don't know the amount okay and that's one of the problems when particularly when you buy stuff in the street or on the market wherever you're going you don't know how much you're getting and that's a real problem okay and we're gonna gradually increase these doses every two to four weeks and see what kind of a Reese we are we're going to follow alright with a washout period of time much like the previous study and see whether or not we've done some benefit with this but again all those things that we talked about is it am I where I want to get as the initial start this on initial patience with behaviors before they are on the more serious and more toxic drugs alright we haven't got that far yet but hopefully that would be the initial drug that we might try and I'd like to try that rather than seeing patients on multiple medications alright so we're gonna use the appropriate scales we're gonna have nursing observation which sometimes can be really subjective as opposed to objective go looking at drug reduction including the use of breakthrough medications obviously looking for the adverse reactions and making sure that is there some reversion back to the original behaviors after we stop the marijuana okay next slide break from medicine is I order as needed medicine so if you really get agitated while I'm getting your behaviors under control I'll have them give you some medicine to calm you down during that period of time while I'm working on a broader perspective of getting your behaviors under control our philosophy has always start low so rather than starting high and knocking the patient out I would rather start slow and go slowly but occasionally a little bit may not be enough and you may need some breakthrough medicine okay okay everybody so the side effects perhaps one of the more common ones is increased anxiety associated with tachycardia and that's the THC that's what you get when you take marijuana okay you get a little bit more anxious alright some people all right that's one side effects of too much THC elevation of a blood pressure tachycardia decreased concentration sleepiness so then you get the CBD that might be kicking in headaches dizziness paranoia and hallucinations I mean most of our patients who have to mention behaviors are have hallucinations or paranoia and they have delusions so we don't want to make those worse and the number one factor that we have to look at for this is the drug drug interaction okay I've had a negative success not good success in fact I think I've made situations worse by combining marijuana with anti-psychotic drugs that bothers me it makes me very hesitant first slide do no harm all right so am i doing more harm or less harm and I hate to say this I don't know what the hell I'm doing with the marijuana I mean I really know because we don't have any studies so but this is the biggest concern I go back to the dopamine serotonin and now the cannabinoids in the brain and we're messing with chemicals in the brain so do we know what we're doing and where are we going with that so that's a my biggest concern offhand next slide so where do we stand at this particular you know I guess I've not had positive experiences using marijuana there are those that have had positive experiences now the other effect is is it a placebo effect too so I'm taking medicine but patients don't know so you want to anticipate that you take that placebo component placebo is where you give them something that's not really a medicine and you in a lot of our drugs that are tested are placebo and and and the drug you'd be surprised how many people respond to the placebo a good 20 30 percent respond to placebo and some studies much higher by the way and particularly the drugs that we use are anti-psychotic drugs by the way that we use we need better clarification of the current regulations regarding the use of marijuana and then we need more liberalization of the laws alive for more research you know we've tried for years to do research projects with marijuana but you have to go they need to be federally improved and it's illegal so you can't you can't get a study with marijuana because it's federally against the law and this needs to be changed I mean you can prevent whatever you want to do but let's studies be done so we have a better idea of what's going on so we have a lot of potential but we're not there yet next slide so our goal is provide the best quality of life our patients comes in all walks of life in all degrees of chronic disease all right and so we always need to be looking for ways that we can improve on the health and again here's the case of take you providing the best quality of life as opposed to giving medicines that are going to give you a poor quality of life it's a balancing act it's difficult there is no magic answer all right but this is what ultimately we're looking at and so the next slide so be careful what we wish everybody in this room that came to this lecture I'm sure is saying I hope marijuana is perhaps an answer that we can use in conjunction with making our patients feel a little bit better okay number one on the list by the way it's an industry all right and they are expanding in leaps and bounds and what do you think there's much money being invested in made in its success all right we are a vulnerable population okay and looking for instant relief we always have been will always be and I don't blame us but at the same time we can be exploited and I think I'm throwing the words of caution out and we're not sure yet of the short and long term you hear this constantly over and over we don't know what the short term we don't know what the long term effects are all right so basically we really need to be studying a little bit more before we jump on the bandwagon because you're seeing it on the internet you're seeing it advertised you're seeing it everywhere take this but there's a lot of people making a lot of money it's expensive it's very expensive all right probably more than your routine meds that you take that are prescribed by the doctors and in reality it's not covered by Medicare so and the last slide is what we're really doing is looking to provide that quality of care and quality of life that we want happy patients all of us should you know be in a good place when we're dying death is inevitable and my goal at least is to see that you are in the most comfortable place with the best quality of life and best quality of care not always easy to do but we work hard and that's where geriatrics and hospice Doc's are really important in trying to provide that so with that I'll stop and thank you and any questions we'll open it up to questions [Applause]", "8z5bUfY2fJ4": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary uh accidentally jumped the gun forgot to record this once so i already opened this package that was just a moment ago haven't eaten anything welcome to weeds guys with a review show here on welcome to wheats everyone the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary classic ass episode today which means yes a good old-fashioned edible and one of the most old-fashioned kinds of weed edibles the gummy that's right we're taking a look at wanna one of the makers of the cannabis infused sour gummies these ones your standard 100 milligram edible 10 different uh pieces at 10 each however these ones are also a cbd blend uh at a ratio that they actually have listed incorrectly there of 10 to one even though it should be one to ten the way they have it listed in that it is 10 milligrams of thc per piece one milligram of cbd per piece 100 milligrams of thc total 10 milligrams of cbd total in this package in these strawberry gummies i picked this up and i accidentally already opened it was recording didn't realize my bad haven't tried any i picked these up for 18 bucks at a dispensary here in long beach california which is a slight premium i would say over there traditional gummy edibles which probably average about 15 so a definite premium there not a whole lot but something to notice and again it doesn't have that nominal amount of cbd in it which i'm curious if it's going to have an effect on me that's not a lot of cbd i'm guessing it probably won't but we'll be on the lookout for it um and on here as well as all the good stuff you want to see they've got lab testing results although this is nearly a year old at this point which is a little disconcerting but whatever uh nutrition information all that good stuff so let's go ahead and take a look at the most important stuff the gummies themselves these 18 gummies and here you go looks just like that 10 of these squares in there oh smells very strawberry not very weedy at all mostly just strawberry well let's go ahead and give it a bite give it a test see what it's like gummy weedy strawberry a lot of wheat flavor actually more wheat flavor than i was expecting not grotesque but for the gummy candies higher than average but otherwise a totally fine gummy candy nice soft chewy okay well i would say in terms of taste a slightly weedier taste than your like plus or your steezy gummies but not revolting in any shape or form but it's there uh but of course guys it's not the taste that we're in this for trying to figure out if they're gonna work or not are they gonna make you hide and for that well that's what we're gonna have to wait around and see um so uh any time i do gummies i like to try to do them under the optimal conditions i don't think i said this i did have a little bit of fat beforehand just to make sure it's going to hit me just right not necessarily for you or for everybody i do it just in case so i had a little bit of fat before just for the optimal thc absorption um but it's still going to take a while to hit the old bloodstream so i'm going to finish these gummies off of the next i don't know hour so do all 10 as we do here on wheats we review the whole product i'm going to review them over the next or as i said eat them over the next hour and then two hours after i have that last one or thereabouts i'll come back to you guys and give you our wrap-up thoughts the most important part of the edible review is it gonna get us high and for that guys you're just gonna have to stick around and i'll be back in just a bit to let you know our wrap-up thoughts about these wanna sour strawberry gummies well here's one for the blooper reels guys i'm back two hours two and a half hours later with these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and as you can see with my eyes they are pure as the driven snow uh and i came here with a really bad review i was gonna come and really trash them as i was like these are pretty um non-existent non-existent in terms of the high that i feel from these wanna cannabis infused sour gummies uh and i was gonna say something along the effects of well maybe it's the 10 to 1 ratio and maybe that little 10 percent of that welcome back to wheats guys it has been two and a half hours since my first uh bite at the wanna cannabis infused sour gummies and if i look very very sober you're correct um i this guys is gonna be one for the blooper reel uh i came here to excoriate the uh folks at wanna i'm saying that these gummies basically did nothing to me all ten of them felt practically nothing and i was originally going to think well maybe it has something to do with that um strange 1 to 10 ratio of cbd to thc and maybe just that 10 cbd was enough to totally blunt the thc and but not provide any of those cbd benefits that was just i've said i was gonna feel like i felt just kind of peaceful but that's about it not really high at all uh and that's because that is actually the case uh i had it wrong not them well actually the bud bud tender had it wrong uh i ordered the one to ten and they gave me the ten to one uh so this really is 10 cbd milligrams to 1 thc so this is 100 milligrams of ca cbd 10 milligrams of thc the exact opposite of what i thought it was um at least i know that i know when i'm high or not and i was definitely not high in any traditional sense with these but that's on me not on them this one's for the blooper reel we'll have to review wanna again in the future this was just a fun little [ __ ] up um and an 18 mistake so uh wanna i am sorry i uh did not mean to disparage i don't know anything about you just yet i do know that my bud tender [ __ ] up the order uh oh well uh [ __ ] happens but we will check you out again in the future apologize for that it's been fun it's been funny anyways that's gonna do it that's gonna do it for this non-existent review here on wheats no cherry on top just a big shame on me thank you so much for watching guys stay high and more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys right back here for our next review live stream or even [ __ ] up see you then bye", "clLoixOZx2Q": "hi everybody my name is jaime brambila my company name is heat cbd and grace health and wellness they're two separate companies heat cbd manufactures cbd products and great self-enrollment is a practice dedicated to teaching interested patients about the clinical use of cannabinoids so in august of 2018 my wife nicole was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer we learned that the cancer had eaten through her four five and six vertebrae and that she would require eight hours final surgery to correct it the metastases was the only thing holding her neck up when we got to memorial sloan kettering in new york the doctors had explained that her standard of care most likely would include six rounds of chemo radiation and many surgeries to remove the tumor masses so the outlook was looking very grim and but nonetheless we we wanted to go through it full force so the ironic thing is that well before this we started in the cannabis field with the delivery service in california where we were working with patients that were afflicted with critical ailments everything from epilepsy to autism ms and cancer we made the decision to focus on the medical rather than the recreational doing part from the responsibility from the people looking for alternative therapies so after nicole's diagnosis we decided to go full force into understanding uh the monster that cancer is and how [Music] and so we never i never expected uh the outcome of nicole's case um but you know we decided to make this a positive journey and that was nicole's request so that's what we did so the presentation today is going to be about raising awareness and raising awareness about this is successful implementation of natural and plant-based medicines used with standard of care for metastatic breast cancers so we know uh what we know about cannabinoid streptains in the ketogenic diet is that when they're used with traditional standards of care they're positive additions and so um why are they positive digits well they they work synergistically to improve the patient outcome so these compounds uh offer a cytotoxic effect as well as a palliative effect and the more well-researched effect is the palliative effect which will which we'll discover um later on the presentation we will explain in current detail what science understands about uh the effects of these compounds so a little bit of background uh story so cannabinoids exert cytotoxic and p and palliative effects uh by means of physiological modulation through the endocannabinoid system and our bodies are naturally able to produce endocannabinoids which interact with receptor sites within the endocannabinoid system and the purpose for this system is to create the state of homeostasis so all the all the functions that the endocannabinoid system produces it are still unknown and but what we've discovered so far is that this system is intricately tight almost every bodily function that we have silas simon and cylosine come from um magic mushrooms and if anybody is familiar with that uh these compounds are in the class of psychedelics known as tryptamines and these compounds are agonists of the 5h25ht serotonin receptor group which are g protein coupled receptors and that means that the the receptor sites are anchored to the cell membrane so what we important thing to keep in mind is that gpcrs or g-protein-coupled receptors have been identified to perform a phenomenon called heterodymerization or crosstalk and that basically means that when there's a similarly structured receptor one receptor gets activated by an agonist and another one that is similarly structured gets activated as well without the use of the ligand so ketogenic or low carb high fat diets these have been studied for their effects in our metabolism and what what they've been the researchers but they've been able to identify is that ketone bodies are produced in the liver and our bodies are able to use them instead of using glucose as fuel so this has a profound effect on our physiology especially in our cell metabolism anti-cancer mechanisms of action of cannabinoids psilocybin and ketogenic low-carb high-fat diets so in this presentation we're going to review is what current science understands as to the aforementioned compounds i will briefly explain the anti-proliferative anti-invasive and anti-metastatic mechanisms of each adjunct therapy as well as the palliative effects so we're going to start off with the first uh hallmark of cancer and that's proliferation what we understand about proliferation is that it hap it comes after the cell is mutated it's the first significant stage of a cancer cell progression and this is when cells start to divide and reproduce to start forming the tumor mass one of the very important things to keep in mind here in proliferation research is a protein called akt also known as protein kinase b and it's one of the most studied molecular mechanisms of uh because of its effectual potential effects of on apoptosis so the inhibition of akt protein uh initiates a signaling pathway that activates autophagy and this internal leads to programmed sultan also known as apoptosis so in other words keep uh important thing to keep in mind here is that if you turn off akt the cancer cell dies so how do we know uh cannabinoids exert antiproliferative effects well in pre-clinical studies uh cannabinoids uh have been studied for their pre their pro-episodic effects the specific mechanisms of how cannabinoids exert all these effects on cancer cells are still unknown because the system is just too complex there are many receptor sites and many lightings uh involved in endocannabinoid system function and with a recent study from the technion institute of israel done on identifying the heterogeneity and complexity of cannabis extracts as tumor agents we can see an example of that so the more well-known mechanisms of action though research from the completence university of madrid they published the one of the most significant papers on this subject uh it showed that activation of cannabinoid receptors triggers a signaling cascade that causes cell apoptosis and it's done through stimulation of endoplasmic reticulum which creates uh ceramide accumulation in the cell so that that's that's the route on which uh can happen how can ambulance turn off akt and then in another study that was published in a later day from the same university we can see that the pro-apoptotic effects are specific to erbb2-positive breast cancer cells which we know are the her2 new positive breast cancers so here we're going to show a slide uh just so you guys can see the the route the signaling wrap and here we can see that er stress is activated by the cannabinoid receptors that air stress uh activates a process called the noble ceramide the the nova synthesis ceremony and that activates uh something called p8 which eventually activates something called trip3 which eventually uh activates ckt and starts the process of autophagy and apoptosis so what do we know are the anti-proliferative effects of psilocybin the tryptamines uh such as cytosine psilocybin have the 19 have been observed to have strong and medium-high immunomodulatory anti-inflammatory and potentially pro-apoptotic effects that may cause the inhibition of akt and if any and if anybody of you are familiar with the signaling cascades called mitogen activated protein kinase or nuclear factor kappa b these are signaling cascades that regulate cell proliferation cell differentiation and survival and normal cells so what they've discovered uh on tryptamines is that in lab models the when serotonin receptors are activated they also mediate heterodimerization and they and that's the coordinated crosstalk that we went over uh before so this happens between map case uh including p38 me kkk1 erk and pa3 kinase akht signaling pathways as well as nfkb and so this leads to an intricate fine-tuning of inflammatory responses by changes of cell signaling and we speculate that that's how akt is turned off by tryptomines and in the next slide i show an example of how um that heterodymerization that crosstalk happens when uh the five ht receptors are activated and this just kind of shows the the signaling cascade that happens in between so the second hallmark of cancer is hypoxia and one of the important things to identify here is an inducible factor called hif1 and basically what they've discovered what research has discovered is that when areas of severe oxygen deprivation arise this is called hypoxia and this happens in invasive tumors after hypoxia happens uh there's there's a signal that occurs by creating f1 that stimulates angiogenesis and angiogenesis is an important part of uh cell progression because that's basically when vascular tissue starts growing into the tumor cell mass and lymphatic tissue and that's how eventually this the cancer cells uh escape to metastasize so the next slide just shows a depiction of how hypoxia occurs and how the blood vessels start growing into the tumor mass to eventually form the metastases so there are many studies that show that cannabinoids actually block heph1 and in pre-clinical studies the activation of what the activation of cannabinoids in cancer cells cannabinoid receptors and cancer cells has shown to down regulate the expression of several pathways including v egf itself and hypoxia inducible factor f1 so the anti-angiogenic effects of psilocybin and cylistine uh cytosine is assumed to be a metabolite of psilocybin and it's assumed because the pharmacology of psilocybin is not yet well understood either but we know that this belongs to a class of psychedelics called tryptamines and in pre-clinical studies uh tryptamines have shown to have positive and strong effects on our physiology including immunomodulation anti-inflammation anti-tumor effects and these also include blocking hif1 through sigma 1 receptor activation so tryptamines activate sigma 1 and that's how if one is blocked in the cancer cell so now we reach the third hallmark of uh cancer progression and this is uh metastases and this is the final stage of um when a cancer i guess falls out of control uh the important mechanism here to keep in mind is id1 and what we've understood about uh breast cancers that express this mechanism this this agent id1 is that in breast cancers mammary epithelial cells expressing id1 are unable to differentiate they acquire the ability to proliferate and they invade the extracellular matrix so id1 is an important regulator of breast cancer progression that's why we're focusing on it today and so cannabinoids block id1 and out of all the agilent therapies that we're discussing today the one that counters iv1 uh that's been discovered so far is cannabidiol which is a cannabinoid that has a low toxicity profile and it down regulates id1 by modulating erk and reactive oxygen species pathways which eventually leads to id1 down regulation so i don't know if you guys noticed but i didn't touch on the ketogenic diets and the first two hallmarks of cancer and that's because um ketogenic diets work on on a route uh on themselves um they're separate from the routes that cytocyberan or cannabinoids connector and what we know about these diets is that they've been recently proposed as adjuvant therapies for cancer treatments because they target an effect called the warburg effect and that's basically an effect that describes that cancer cells predominantly utilize glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation phosphorylation sorry to produce atp and atp is very important for cell functioning some cancer cells lack the ability to metabolize ketone bodies because of mitochondrial dysfunction and also the enzymes that that help break down the ketone bodies so the rationale is providing the rationale in providing a fat rich low carbohydrate diet in cancer therapies to reduce circulating glucose levels and induce ketosis so the cancer cells are starved the normal cells adapt their metabolism to use ketones and so another important part of this is that ketosis therapy also reduces insulin insulin like growth factor which is also important for cell progression so what what are the effects the palliative effects that we know about so we know that these compounds have been recognized as effective palliative tools when used in conjunction with the usual standards of care the results are that symptoms are greatly reduced and in our anecdotal experience we've seen this uh time and time again with patients that are able to choose this and that happens it's important to stress this point because uh even though with cannabis uh half of the country uh has already legalized the medical use silas simon on the other hand is only legal in two counties in our country so hopefully we'll be able to change some minds today so that we can change that as well i'm going to go through some examples of how these compounds are good palliative tools and so many studies have shown the efficacy of psilocybin in cancer patients as agents to decrease the symptoms of depression caused by the side effects of standard of care so many studies have identified that students have established that simon and other psychedelics have uh very little physiological safety concerns but we still need to do more research to figure out what the psychological repercussions would be um so in john in one of the one of these studies that came from johns hopkins university they analyzed 51 patients that were diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer and what they found was that high doses of psilocybin produce a significant decrease in depression general anxiety and anxiety towards death it also produced an increase in quality of life and optimism and the important the important thing here or the uh thing that that is that creates the most impact is that after this these therapies were administered the result persisted even after um six months after the um the therapy was administered so cannabinoids we know that cannabinoids are safe and effective relative tools um people that have attended these symposiums have probably heard all about that and they have very good effects including an um antimatter effect uh antidepressant uh anti pain and the ability to induce uh sleep um i just briefly covered those just just to talk talk to them talk to you guys about them but what i want to what i want to emphasize on is the synergistic effect that these produce with standard of care and in recent lab studies from the completency university of madrid in collaboration with zelda therapeutics we've found that when we combine cannabinoids and estrogen receptor targeted therapies for example cis cisplatin or lapatinib in a petri dish uh what it shows is a positive additional antiproliferative response in cell cultures so the safety and efficacy of the ketogenic diets uh well these strongly depend on the type of tumor that is being treated in the genotype uh in involved so the information having a little mix up with my science so what we know uh so far about these uh therapies we don't have a lot of uh data on these because so far there's been just very little clinical data uh and single case studies that show the results of what this could do there hasn't been uh extensive randomized uh clinical studies yet but from the little information that we have we can we can see that these these therapies don't have evidence of interaction with standard care this most of the research conducted on these has been conducted on glioblastoma patients but there's also been recent studies that have found that patients with breast cancer equally benefit from these so the following study that i'm going to present is the case study that um captures my my wife's story and i'm going to briefly go through that uh just to explain what we did with her okay so i'll briefly go through this so protocols that were that were used uh we used standard of care she went through treatment every four weeks uh since the time of diagnosis to uh january of 2019 final diagnosis was august 2018 so she would take an infusion of taxation and herceptin progenitor and herceptin are the targeted therapies texas here's the chemotherapy uh we can see that she did a ketogenic diet in addition to supplements borage omega oils those are precursors to endocannabinoids you know pertinent adjuvants if they can be used uh vitamin b12 glucosamine pea which is a ligand of cannabinoid receptors and pre probiotic uh supplements and those we know now that work in conjunction with the endocannabinoid system so the doses that we administered of cannabis oil um they're relatively high and we can see that during several during different stages we the amounts of cannabis oil that we were dosing every day would fluctuate and that's because uh we you know through trial and error and through our method we were exploring with different uh cannabis strains and these were all whole plant uh cannabis extracts we can see that the use of psilocybin she had so she she had two heroic um sessions with psilocybin one happened in november 2018 the other one january 2019 right before she went for the pet scan that determined that she didn't have metastatic disease anymore and then here we can see the images right we can see the images of when the cancer was initially diagnosed and we can see the mass in the center and then this is the pets underneath that that's the pet ct scan that showed no evidence of metastatic disease and we can see clearly that the mass has shrunk significantly so what are the results so so she was diagnosed in september uh september 2018 the end of august uh so by october 2018 50 of the mass was visibly reduced uh her doctor could visibly see that 50 of the mass was reduced by october january 2019 uh pet ct scan confirmed no evidence of residual cancer or recurrent disease and that persisted today so in breast cancer patients tarsus mom is one of the best and most recent advances in the treatment of her2 positive breast cancer and although this strategy has been very successful the statistics show that about 75 percent of the patients with erbb2 over expressing tumors do not respond to tarstuza map and the ones that do respond which is almost 15 eventually develop metastases so this is why there's a need a tremendous need to develop novel therapeutic approaches so that we can improve patient survival in these patient populations there are many important benefits to initiating observational clinical trials to test these therapies but so far little attention has been given to do so and with correct research and proper clinical protocols minor side effects that can occur can be managed and accurate doses can be studied so that we can deliver proper therapeutic benefit so now now we're going to talk about the economic viability of producing an observation clinical trial using cannabis oil in contrast to the cost and time frame to produce a cancer drug so we went we went through an exercise using nicole's case study as an example um and we used the parameters from the case study the amount of oil that she took and the time frame and we went into weed maps we took a little survey to figure out what a gram of oil uh could cost and so two grams of oil is what we considered for you know a clinical trial to prove whether or not these these therapies have have these effects and what we came up with is that so we did a rough estimate and the cost on a daily basis for uh for a patient using this this therapy can range from sixty two dollars per day to a hundred a 120 per day and so considering the five months that this cost um can range between ninety three hundred dollars and eighteen thousand four hundred dollars roughly so now now we're going to observe a study that was published in the journal of american medical association and jama in september of 2017 and it analyzed the investment and return of 10 different cancer drugs that were recently brought to market from separate developers so what this study concluded was that the average time frame to develop a cancer drug was 7.3 years that's a considerable amount of time the median cost uh the medium r d cost and they broke it down into three categories because there are three uh you know categories um in the in the drug development uh pipeline right so novel or self-originating drugs those are drugs that discover uh new novel uh targets and cancer cells those um the medium r d cholesterol is 899 million dollars uh next in class which is uh a step above the science of what we currently understand so these are drugs that develop the science that we currently know a little bit better and those the medium r d cost is 473.3 million dollars and then we have acquired drugs on the low side of the totem pole which those cost 328.1 million dollars so that's the r d cost now all together and we know that r d plays a big role in price for drugs uh the median cost to bring a cancer drug to market was 648 million dollars and obviously this is this is an immediate estimate um there was a lot of uh range in in between those numbers so with all this with all this that we know if we can convince our lawmakers and medical professionals to give the described therapies the recognition they deserve and facilitate regulatory and financial conditions to research the true medical potential of these compounds we can assume that these results would impact lowering of cancer drug costs lowering of research and development cost increasing quality of life of standard of care and the increase of quality of life through pre and post cancer treatments for patients and with that i want to just uh thank the team uh at the end of this presentation for all the hard work that we did together um bringing this case study um to to light and uh here in the picture we have dr sulak lindsey myself caroline and tom my wife uh next to tom there so thank you guys", "fqNfGj8jwFY": "arthritis is a very potentially debilitating condition it affects millions of Canadians and there's actually a lot of different forms of arthritis the most common form that most of us think of when we hear the word arthritis is osteoarthritis and so that is typically the wear and tear that most people eventually especially if they live long enough will experience on their joints and that can be arthritis of the shoulders the knees the hands and that's just your general wear and tear and what people who experience this type of arthritis what they usually complain of is that sometimes they have a mild amount of stiffness but as the day gets on and they start to use those joints the inflammation starts to get worse and the pain starts to get worse another form of arthritis though that a lot of people don't typically talk about is inflammatory arthritis and so you can consider this as a slightly more severe form of arthritis where in addition to the inflammation it's actually your immune system is kind of attacking your joints regardless if you have osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis one of the main goals is managing pain and so when it comes to pain management you're stuck with anti-inflammatories which are your advils or your naproxen of the world tylenol or opioid painkillers and sometimes steroid injections work but if you have multiple joints it's hard to inject steroids all over the body nonetheless cannabinoids have become extremely popular and the arthritis society here in Canada they mentioned that almost one in two of their members reports using cannabis for arthritis it's typically osteoarthritis that patients are using cannabis for but what we're seeing in the clinic is that this is a huge burden to society and a huge number of referrals coming in come for arthritis a lot of the patients will use high CBDs typically and what they become back and report is that their joints feel a little bit more fluid they're having a reduction in the nation and they feel like their functioning has improved some patients will use a little bit more THC but it's usually in the evening where the pain will affect their ability to sleep so they'll use a little bit more THC and that will help them sleep and sleep is really important to managing your mental health and if you're in a chronic stress state then your pain is also going to be worse the next day we were actually the first health charity to have focused call on medical cannabis to understand what impact it has on arthritis patients but coupled with that if something is being used as a medicine we think that it should be treated as such so things like it needs to be taken in the context of a health care provider making sure that it's monitored properly but also people should have access to medical cannabis the same way they have access to their other medications so right now people actually can only obtain medical cannabis through mail order as one example which could be challenging unlike other medications you would pay tax on medical cannabis which is not something that we expect or is true for any other medication so their number of things that we think that if something is being used properly as a medicine it should be treated as such and we also know that many people who are authorized to use medical cannabis are actually taking it for arthritis so in that context we've heard a lot from arthritis patients about what medical cannabis the impact that it has on their disease most importantly we want to make sure that at the arthritis society we're trying to speak on behalf of patients and patient experiences and for something that's been authorized for almost twenty years now we hope that people can have access to medical cannabis in the way that they should but you know really emphasizing that there is so much to learn and we don't want to jump to conclusions but we want to make sure that we're paying close attention to medical cannabis and giving it the attention

"[Music] and now for this one like the title says I'm going to be using a crock-pot I'm going to do maybe a cup maybe a little more of the coconut oil and a half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis we're going to throw it in the crock-pot below and we're gonna let it sit in there for about four to five hours go ahead and strain it through the cheesecloth basic simple straightforward take that half ounce of flour throw it in the oven 240 degrees for 40 minutes grab a smoke if you'd like forty minutes later that should be looking a nice golden-brown perfect just about ready let's go ahead and turn our crock-pot on to low using organic unrefined coconut oil eight ounces add the half ounce of the decarboxylated cannabis stir and cover leave on low for 3 to 5 hours I did four hours stir occasionally double layer the cheesecloth for a finer strain squeeze or press it to make sure you get all that oil out infusion complete overall in terms of the process I'm liking this method the best it's nice you don't have to worry about keeping an eye on the flame if you have a gas stove top like me even an electric range you still got to keep an eye because it might get too hot and you don't want to burn anything that ease of the crock-pot I am feeling and I'm excited to use this coconut oil and some nice gummies you know I love doing it in a smoothie I'll do a video about that even though it's really simple just to show you how I do it let your imagination run wild throw this coconut oil whatever your heart desires thanks for chilling on truebloods TV check out one of these videos click the link and i'll catch you on the next [Music]", "q4maAFJSWAA": "[Music] I'd like to welcome everybody today's presentation on CBD in the treatment of Alzheimer's addictions and mood disorders I'm your host dr. Donnelly Snipes in this class we're going to talk about how we can use CBD in the treatment of addiction CBD and its impact on mental health issues CBD and its impact on neurodegenerative issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as hit a real high-level overview of CBD adverse events toxicity and drug interactions that is going to be really important because a lot of our clients may decide to try to self-medicate with CBD in addition to other medications and I'll just foreshadow for you CBD oil or CBD interacts with just about every medication out there so we do want to make sure that they're aware of that and hopefully agree to if they're going to try to start taking CBD do it in a physician supervised capacity all right cannabidiol is promise for treatment of substance use disorder CBD is short for cannabidiol and recent models implicate major brain circuits involved in reward salient C so how were warding something is motivation and memory and learned associations in substance abuse we call those triggers in maintaining addiction which may be largely modulated by the endocannabinoid system or the receptors in our brain that respond to cannabinoids and that includes THC as well as cannabidiol the endocannabinoid system or ECS modulates dopamine that's really important to recognize it also has an effect on noradrenaline and Sarah but we'll get there when we talk about addiction though one of the things that we have seen with addiction and try to avoid saying we know because we don't really know a whole lot for a hundred percent certain but one of the things that we've seen repeatedly with addiction is that addictive substances and addictive behaviors cause a dopamine surge the endocannabinoid system is there to try to modulate that dopamine so you don't get those surges quite so much alcohol nicotine and THC which is not CBD it is another cannabinoid that's in marijuana but alcohol nicotine and THC all increased dopamine levels via nerve terminals modulated by the in endocannabinoid system important to recognize that when people are using these addictive substances they are activating that endocannabinoid system the endocannabinoid system including receptors cb1 are which you don't need to know that for the test or anything but there is a particular receptor in there that represents a necessary contributor towards cellular adaptations in the transition from recreational substance use to a use disorder so when this CB 1 R is activated it causes changes or it facilitates changes in the brain cells in the system that facilitate the move from recreational use to dependence and and tolerance and all those other things the ECS mediated synaptic plasticity may facilitate emotional learning and memory processes in increasing emotional responses to substance related cues basically what that's saying is the enactment endocannabinoid system encourages the brain cells to be a little bit more flexible to be a little bit more receptive and responsive and which facilitates learning when though systems are activated that kind of primes the brain for learning based on memory so now they're in this wide-open situation think about a classroom you know when you create a classroom you want it to create an environment that's conducive to learning so you do certain things in the classroom and you don't do other things in order to make it so most people are comfortable there they have the materials they need to learn they are not distracted the same sort of thing goes on in our brain when our brain has the right environment to learn it is much more receptive to things and the endocannabinoid system facilitates that condition in the brain antagonism which means shutting down locking off turning off whatever you want to say antagonism of that cb1 are receptor reduces alcohol induced sensitization and nicotine relapse so they're finding that CBD may reduce the people from developing tolerance and sensitization to ethanol and it tends to make them less likely to relapse on nicotine CBD is non rewarding it doesn't have the psychogenic properties of THC that is super important to remember especially for people who are in recovery because CBD is not going to get them high it had acts on other receptors in order to facilitate other processes it acts on a number of receptor systems including the opioid system the serotonin system and the cannabinoid system so when people take CBD they are modulating those symptoms systemically administered CBD which means orally or intravenously by a doctor I guess but generally we're talking about oral systemic lis administered CBD regulates mesolimbic dopamine act that's important to know and potentially reduces substance-induced dysregulation so when people take CBD orally it keeps them from having that dopamine spike that may occur when they take substances because when we take substances that dopamine system gets dysregulated it just goes wide open and CBD seems to modulate that a little bit treatment with CBD blocked the rewarding effects of morphine and heroin and prevented drug and stress induced reinstatement of condition place preference lasting up to two weeks post administration so that's really interesting now conditioned place preference why do we care about this when somebody receives a reward receives a stimulus gets that dopamine rush in a particular place that place becomes associated with pleasure in substance abuse counseling we talk about this as you know a trigger being in that place being in a bar or if you you know use heroin when you're at home you know being at home could be a trigger and when people were given to CBD it seemed to block those memories and reduce the preference for certain places that are associated with use which is really awesome so it kind of reduces those urges a little bit and it lasted up to two weeks post administration CBD reduces a lot of different things and as always in this presentation all of the hyperlinks will take you to the Articles that I got this information from just to keep it clean I do the hyperlinks but CBD reduces in most people the overall level of alcohol intake the motivation for ethanol it's keeping them from becoming tolerant to it but it also kind of takes some of the rewarding effects out of it since its modulating that dopamine release it reduces anxiety and impulse which is helpful not only in alcoholism but a whole host of other mood mental health and even neurodegenerative disorders alcohol related to ptosis and fibrosis in the liver is also reduced because CBD reduces lipid accumulation so reduces that fatty liver it stimulates Auto Fei Jie so the liver the body starts eating consuming getting rid of whatever you want to say bad cells and it modulates inflammation we know that alcoholism causes inflammation in the liver and CBD helps modulate or reduce some of that inflammation now this isn't a pass where somebody can take CBD and then drink all they want I don't want them to start thinking that way because the addicted brain will go there but it is interesting to notice that CBD may be able to help reverse a little bit some of the liver damage done by the intake of alcohol CBD also reduces oxidative stress by inducing death of activated hepatic stellate cells this is again something you're seeing that autophagy oxidative stress is when you have byproducts and residual residues of things that have processes that have happened in your body and they can build up and be toxic which is why the stress part and CBD actually causes some of these cells that have gone a little wonky to be consumed to be gotten rid of it also reduces alcohol-related brain damage preventing neuronal loss by it's antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties okay when people drink one cause of brain damage is due to lack of enough thiamine because alcohol blocks thiamine uptake and results in where Nicky korzak or Korsakoff syndrome CBD doesn't seem to help with that so that's one issue but the other issue is that the ingestion of alcohol leads to systemic inflammation and CBD because of its anti-inflammatory properties does seem to reduce the inflammation and reduce the damage to the brain cells because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes CBD in stimulant disorders CBD has reversed toxicity and seizures induced by cocaine not saying again this is not like taking naltrexone or something that with opioids that is an automatic reversal but they have found that it has helped heal the body some when somebody has used cocaine and had had toxicity or seizures it reverses behavioral sensitization induced by M FET amines and it reduces motivation to self administer cocaine and meth we're speculating again that CBDs function in modulating that dopamine and keeping it from you know going wide open is what reduces motivation to self-administer because the high is just not so good it's just like CBD also increased the extinction of cocaine and amphetamine induced conditioned place preference just like I said on the last slide or the slide before because it is reducing the rewarding say reward salience of those places and of those things then what when it's administered then by administering that you're also reducing the trigger salience you're reducing the urges to go there mechanisms involved in the protective effects of CBD on addiction to psycho stimulant drugs include prevention of drug-induced neuro adaptation hopefully it's preventing by addressing that that receptor it's preventing that neuroplasticity that encourages people to move to problematic use it encourages somehow they don't know how exactly but it does encourage the eraser of aberrant drug memories so it helps with some of those for some people they say it helps with their drug dreams that they have elimination of cognitive deficits induced by psycho stimulant drugs so it helps the brain become a little bit healthier an alleviation of mental disorders that are comorbid with psychostimulant abuse you'll learn in a little while that CBD interacts on opioid serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine systems so it is impactful for just about everything in the DSM for not everything but just about cannabis and mental health disorders anxiety social anxiety depression especially depression related to anxiety when somebody's just stressed out for so long they start to develop this sense of hopelessness and helplessness all of those have shown extreme promise for treatment with CBD CBD has many additional targets within and beyond the an endocannabinoid system it's not just that one system it also activates 5ht which you remember our serotonin receptors adrenal receptors so that's your norepinephrine system and your mu opioid receptors those are your pain receptors your heroin opioid related receptors CBD interestingly has the opposite effect of THC in the prefrontal cortex which is where we have our higher-order thinking and our impulse control and in the amygdala when people take THC a lot of times it increases their respiration it increases their heart rate and it activates their amygdala it activates their stress response system CBD seems to have the opposite effect which is interesting when we get down in a few minutes to talking about the implications of treatment of PTSD with CBD CBD either as a mono therapy or added to regular antipsychotic medication improved symptoms in patients with schizophrenia with promising effects especially in early stages of the illness in terms of garden grown marijuana again it's really important to recognize that THC is a major component of your garden grown cannabis it's really there are special seeds special plants special whatever you call them hybrids that you get theoretically to produce hemp which is where the CBD oil is extracted from so garden grown cannabis may not have the same effects because it does have those higher levels of THC now remember some illnesses some conditions actually respond better to THC but we weren't talking about that in this particular presentation so I left those out but do think about the fact that CBD and THC have some opposing psychological effects in one study I didn't find a whole lot of studies on CBD and PTSD but in one study 91% of patients experienced a decrease in PTSD symptom severity as low as evidenced by lower scores on the pcl5 at 8 weeks post treatment as opposed to their initial baseline well that's pretty encouraging again we want to look at where is this coming from since the PT up since PTSD does involve hyper activation of that amay d'leh and it does involve a lot of those other the serotonin system and other things it seems like the endocannabinoid system specifically CBD helps modulate that and kind of get it back to normal I've used the analogy repeatedly of a warm bath and when people are really anxious angry stressed-out hyper vigilant it's running like running hot water wide open and when they're super calm it's like running cold water wide open and it seems like the CBD gets in there and kind of monkeys with it so it's an adequate not too much as getting through but enough is getting through Alzheimer's and dementia cannabidiol or CBD is a phyto cannabinoid which is helpful as an antioxidant to reduce oxidative stress an anti-inflammatory and an agonist of dopamine and serotonin remember antioxidants we talk about all the time we want antioxidants to prevent aging we want antioxidants to help help fight cancer we want antioxidants to help prevent the degeneration of neural pathways and development of Alzheimer's and dementia so antioxidants not only in food but also in CBD are really helpful at reducing oxidative stress Aunty means getting rid of and oxidant means those ox that oxidative stress we already talked some about CBDs anti-inflammatory properties and then remember agonist means increasing dopamine and serotonin so it increases the dopamine and serotonin systems Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are both characterized by inflammation systemically and oxidative stress CBD is also helpful in patients with epilepsy restless legs and multiple sclerosis now with restless legs that has a a lot to do with dopamine imbalances with epilepsy and multiple sclerosis the CBD generally is used in epilepsy for seizures and in multiple sclerosis for tremors CBD as opposed to THC did not negatively alter cardiovascular parameters body temperature psychomotor or psychological functions nor did it induce a catalepsy or a trance-like or seizure like state like THC does in some people it doesn't put them into this zone it really doesn't have much of a psychogenic effect at all based on his pharmacology CBD may be useful not only in Alzheimer's and dementia but also in other mental health and behavioral conditions that have symptoms such as agitation self-injury anxiety aggression like autism spectrum disorders for example so based on its pharmacology CBD may be useful for reducing agitation anxiety psychosis aggression depression pain plaque formation in the brain and oxidative stress all of those things we work with to some level everyday now CBD is not typically strong enough if you want to use that word to really help a lot with sleep unless the person is having difficulty sleeping because of their anxiety or agitation it may help there now I didn't specifically research CBT and you know sleep or CBD and insomnia but it may be helpful as an adjunctive to what the person is currently doing again CBD interacts as does THC cannabinoids interact with a whole host of medications so it's really important to with your patients if they are going to try it because some are just determined that they want to try that and get off prescriptions or whatever that they do need medical consultation other things that CBD does it helps with pain obviously inflammation is an underlying cause for pain in a lot of people autoimmune to see diseases cause systemic inflammation in the body so when people have something like Crohn's disease or fibromyalgia or you know even diabetes is associated with systemic inflammation depression interestingly enough is correlated with systemic inflammation and I have a video on the YouTube channel on leaky gut and gut health that helps explain you know how depression and stress actually can lead to systemic inflammation and vice versa how systemic inflammation can lead to depression and stress asthma now that's not typically associated with mental health issues so to speak but when people are asthmatic some people have anxiety I know my daughter when she was little she had breathing problems and she was terrified to go very far away from home she was terrified to go out hiking and do fun things because she was afraid she would have an asthma attack so there is a certain amount of agoraphobia or anxiety that can be associated with asthma especially bad asthma but that aside if somebody has asthma they found that CBD is an exceptionally potent bronchodilator so it does help open up those bronchioles so people can breathe easier and osteoporosis interestingly enough that's not really associated with inflammation but I didn't have another slide to put it on as people get older especially women as we get older and our estrogen levels change we become more susceptible to osteoporosis cannabidiol CBD as well as some other cannabinoids stimulate bone growth and may be able to help prevent osteoporosis so that's something to look at again why do we care for a mental health from a mental health perspective well because osteoporosis can be painful bone broken bones broken hips from osteoporosis can be painful and debilitating and as we if we feel ourselves getting more fragile it tends to impair our self-efficacy and impair our our mood and our outlook to answer your question Robert all CBD mixtures are not created equal CBD is not regulated by the FDA with the exception there is one drug that is used to treat seizures in epilepsy that has been fda-approved but anything you get over-the-counter is not regulated by the FDA it is also not supposed to make any claims about being able to cure or treat any diseases additionally if you get your CBD oil from acme calm and you get get it on in June and then you order again in August from Acme com same manufacturer same place same even same size jar you may not get the same potency of CBD there's also a lot of variation between producers in the actual potency of the CBD in the tincture that you're getting or the oil or whatever method you're getting it in so no all CBD products are definitely not created equal and you can't even guarantee that you're getting the same dosage even if you get it from the same supplier every single time do be aware of that it's just like all of the workout supplements and stuff that are on the market there's a lot of loosey goosey nests which is it's very frustrating and it can be very scary additionally the dosage for CBD when you go to one manufacturer they may recommend XYZ dosage you go to another manufacturer they may recommend something you know five ten times higher so the recommended dosage is all over the place or the recommended serving size they can't call it a dosage is all over the place which also means you don't know what potency in many of these studies they were very careful to either not say or give a range of the dosage that they used because you know we don't really know yet since cannabic an avid aisle is so new on the market we don't really know what the appropriate and helpful and therapeutic dosage is yet which is again why you need to get a naturopath or somebody who is very familiar with CBD involved in the process if somebody is going to be taking it so what are some of the adverse effects in toxicity and I note here that all of these symptoms can be seen in people when they take CBD at doses higher than recommended for human consumption but like I said the potency is a little bit loosey-goosey you know between suppliers and the recommended serving size varies dramatically between suppliers so the dose that is quote recommended for human consumption really hasn't been all that well established yet but the FDA has weighed in a little bit but when people take too much they can have developmental toxicity so it can impair physical and cycle development if they are still growing embryo fetal mortality and we're going to talk about that a little bit more in a minute but it actually prevents or inhibit implantation of the embryo and it can cause birth defects central nervous system inhibition so and that's the same as a lot of your depressants it can cause slow to reaction times slow breathing slower heart rate to a very bad place neurotoxicity you're too much of a good thing even though it Fioretti helps regulate a lot of different systems in the brain if you take too much just like anything else it can be toxic hepatocellular which means liver injuries and abnormalities we need to be aware that yes it can't help heal the liver but in doses that are too big it can also overwhelm the lip liver and cause problems itself spermatogenesis reduction so the development or creation of sperm is reduced so that sperm count is gonna go down male reproductive system alterations and it goes into you know the size and weight of testes and other things if you want to read about it the articles in your class hypotension so low blood pressure diarrhea vomiting and fatigue however you know I'm putting that out there so you know that CBD yes it's natural but it also can be harmful just like a lot of other natural things that are out there there are a lot of positive effects if used appropriately and it's important to just be aware and and be cognizant of this and yes Logan the seizure medicine is epidemics CBD adverse effects cannabis and CBD use is rising among pregnant women in one study an estimated 4 to 20 percent of 18 to 24 year old pregnant women were using some form of cannabis products now that included THC as well as CBD but that's a that's a lot of pregnant women CBD inhibits embryo implantation and placenta development remember they need the placenta to get the nutrients in order to develop appropriately and prenatal cannabinoid exposure not just CBD but to any of the cannabinoids potentiates the harmful effects of alcohol increasing the risk of the development of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and craniofacial malformations and eye defects really important to recognize that not only is CBD potentially harmful to a fetus and cannabinoids potentially harmful to a fetus we know that alcohol is potentially very harmful to a fetus when you put them together they potentiate each other so it's I mean it's even more powerful than like one plus one is two it's like one plus one is six really important that pregnant women are not drinking definitely not drinking and using CBD or cannabinoids or cannabis marijuana concurrently and preferably not using cannabinoids either so let's go down to drug reactions and there's a lot of them remember I told you that CBD interacts with just about every drug on the market hmmm well here you go let's go through this laundry list and talk about why we care the first one is sort of a easy go by guide but it doesn't cover all of them however any of your clients who are taking drugs that have a grapefruit warning on them like boosts per\u00f3n or a lot of the antipsychotics those drugs are metabolized by cyp2d6 which is inhibited by CBD so if they're taking that medication then the metabolization of those drugs may not go the way it's supposed to which means in most cases the drug levels are going to bill up to toxic levels in the system way too quickly so it's really important if there's a grapefruit warning on their drugs not to take CBD that's you know just one of those rules but that warning is not on a lot of medications steroids and corticosteroids are used for things like asthma arthritis and other inflammatory conditions we need to ask people are they taking steroids or corticosteroids when my daughter used to get sick she had she was born with lung problems and so every time she would get sick it would go to her chest and she would either develop bronchitis or pneumonia just like that and she would have to be on a nebulizer in order to reduce the inflammation in her in her lungs sometimes she would even have to take oral steroids if it got that bad why do I bring that up because some of our clients may be you know not taking any drugs at all you know any medications at all taking CBD and then they get sick and they get prescribed steroids or corticosteroids it's important for them to recognize that oh this new medication I'm taking might interact with the CBD that I'm already taking they need to let their prescribing physician or physicians know if they're taking it statins these are the drugs that people take for cholesterol most people I know unfortunately who are over the age of about 50 are on some level of statins and you know we could argue whether they need to be or not statins also have some interesting effects on mood just as a side a side effect but if somebody is taking statins CBD will interact with those CBD interacts with calcium channel blockers those are the medications you take for high blood pressure certainly don't want to be monkeying around with that remember CBD can in high enough doses can cause hypotension so if you're taking medication for your blood pressure to reduce it and then you take CBD with it guess what your blood pressure may go through the floor antihistamines interestingly enough HIV antivirals and immune modulators because the CBD is it's in and of itself a immune system modulator sometimes it works with sometimes it works against the HIV drugs and you know depending on what cocktail the person is on is really important to know the interactions I'll put all three of these together benzodiazepines which are your anti-anxiety medications antipsychotics which is like your seroquel and your house all and antidepressant medications and herbs including things like st. John's wort all interact with the gaba system the serotonin system and/or the dopamine system your antipsychotics typically are responsible for reducing dopamine levels so if somebody is taking CBD which increases dopamine you're kind of working against yourself here antidepressant medications increase serotonin and potentially dopamine and or norepinephrine CBD potentially also increases all three of those and so you may put people into a position where they are at risk of things like serotonin syndrome serotonin syndrome is deadly if people get too much serotonin it spikes their body temperature and results in tremors vomiting potentially loss of consciousness a lot of really bad stuff and it can happen after just one dose it's not something that has to do that they have to do you know for a week or two weeks or months at a time sometimes we see when we talk about serotonin syndrome a lot of times we're talking about when we're talking about serotonin and serotonin syndrome we're also talking about when people take it with antidepressants when they take two different antidepressants together or they take antidepressants and opioids which actually both increase serotonin or they take antidepressants and this is a favorite one of the teenagers dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant a lot of teenagers for a while don't know if they're still doing it we're taking mega doses of dextromethorphan rectally in order to increase the rate of absorption and the dextromethorphan actually increases serotonin levels and they were some of them were getting so much they were developing serotonin syndrome so serotonin is really nothing to monkey around with if you don't know what you're doing like I said herbs were looking at 5ht as well 5htp as well as st. John's wort anticonvulsant like klonopin or clonazepam beta blockers another thing that is used for blood pressure proton pump inhibitors which are things like zantac and there's one that begins with a P and I can't think of it right now but you take it for stomach acid and even oral diabetic medications any of these all of these interact with CBD and it will affect the amount of circulate that certain amount of that medication circulating in your system or the absorbability or availability of it in some cases it reduces and in other cases it increases the point is to know what what the interactions are now one interesting place you can go is to drugs calm and they have an interaction checker see if I can get it to come up okay so to answer somebody else's question as well as to show you how the drug interaction thing works you put in the medication or medications that the person is taking and then it'll tell you drug interactions for this one it says statins and cannabidiol cannabidiol may cause liver problems and using it with other medications that also affect the liver such as statins may increase the risk of liver damage so that's what that's all about so that you just go to drugs calm or search for drugs calm drug interaction checker and I've used it with a lot of my clients to help them understand the side effects of some of the medications they're taking as well as to check for side effects of the medications they're taking with other things like herbs over-the-counter drugs even alcohol CBD is showing promise as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for a variety of things ranging from Alzheimer's and addiction to Parkinson's and schizophrenia I mean if you go to PubMed and I'll go there in a minute you're gonna find tons of articles in your classroom I think I have in the additional resources section I think I have about 17 articles that I cited in in this presentation there's just a plethora of information and I'm really excited that this is coming out but right now they still don't have good recommendations for dosing and even if they did if you're getting the CBD over-the-counter you can't guarantee that you're actually getting that dosage of CBD in that formulation CBD does not have the psychogenic effects that THC does however THC has been found to be more effective at addressing certain issues over-the-counter CBD is non standardized so dosages even from the same manufacturer but in different Lots may have different potency CBD interacts with most medications so it's vital to consult a physician prior to using it the dosages like I said of CBD in the literature varied widely currently there are a couple of CBD based medications that are FDA approved for the treatment of seizure disorder finally remember that CBD oils may also have traces of THC generally not over 0.3% y'all know one of my favorite things is pubmed and I can never remember the long address for it you just type in pubmed cannabidiol and we'll just do an PTSD and i guess i stumped it because it took a long time you can go over here and you can shorten the window so you only see stuff from the last two years I always have free full text checked because I like to read the actual article not just the abstract and you can set additional filters like species I always have mine checked on humans because I'm not as interested in what it did to the rats but then all of these you can you can look at of somebody asked about cannabidiol and insomnia so let's see proof of concept there so then going with just the abstract that one hasn't been done yet they're talking about what they will do result 72 adults had primary concerns of anxiety and poor sleep anxiety scores decreased in 57 patients and sleep scores improved within the first month in 48 patients but fluctuated over time and CBD was well tolerated in all but three patients so theoretically this may be something that comes out as a newer intervention that is less harmful to the brain than Anna histamines and some of the barbiturates that are currently available for insomnia something to keep your eye on now all right let's look at let's look for that see if I can find anything on the FDA on CBD yeah yeah potential harm of CBD the FDA really doesn't like CBD they want to tell you about all the scary stuff so right now like I said in the research the dosage a lot of times wasn't even noted but other times it was there was a very wide spectrum of what they were offering for it no the research studies that we looked at or that I looked at did not talk about CBD isolate full-spectrum or broad spectrum we can look at those real quick let's see it appears all of those have THC removed but in the full spectrum and broad spectrum they have some of the other cannabinoids that exist in the marijuana plant in there and you know THC is the psychoactive one so if that's what a lot of the drug tests measure for but each one of the cannabinoids has its own independent properties and usefulness and things so I can see why some people would look for a broad spectrum CBD in order to get as much benefit an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as possible without the THC but you notice neither NIDA nor stomps I had anything about that on them what isn't interestingly it appears this article on the National Institute of drug abuse is quite positive about the potential promise of cannabidiol for therapeutic use so I'll put that in here for you guys to read in-depth let me answer your question Logan let's see yes I would say Logan the I mean anything with dextromethorphan that is being taken in addition to a CBD can't have a potentiation effect and the triple triple sees themselves or dextromethorphan alone can cause can in high enough doses can lead to serotonin syndrome so it is that is one of those things that can be really scary oops No oh hush here is a video I did do on serotonin syndrome if you're in Florida and you need medical error prevention you can get CEUs for it but if you don't care about that then you know just watch the video if you're interested in learning more about serotonin syndrome and what the symptoms are are there any other questions I've really enjoyed all your questions about CBD I am still learning about it obviously along with you guys but I was I really enjoyed going through the research and yes I saw somebody else commenting I'm not sure where you're seeing the ads at there shouldn't be any ads during the during the class but unfortunately Google is creepy aware of what you do I swear sometimes they just hear what I'm saying and I'm not even looking online and I start getting fed ads about it so you probably will start seeing some ads about CBD oil one thing you can do if you want to there are some free open-source ad blocker programs my husband has them on his computer because he really hates ads to no end but you can also install those if ads bother you I usually

epilepsy or Charlotte was pleading with the government for a special prescription to license and distal cannabis oil for her son you cannot take away an antiepileptic medications you cannot stop it abruptly yeah it has to be weaned in the first done things so I'm sayin tune that chord this morning please give me back at police medication today because he needs his medication this is not anything to do with recreational but you're just silent as death warrant so please give it back he's not a doctor Philip he's a minister so he should be listening to the doctor in Canada well after the success of Charlotte's campaigning the law was changed and last week marked one year since the perception of medical cannabis was legalized in the UK but despite the change in the law many doctors are still hesitant to give out the drug and we're joined this morning by doctor Javed Abdel Moneim to separate the fact from the fiction good morning new you so first of all I guess we should understand that what what is it in this cannabis that's supposed to help medicinally well there are there are lots of compounds in cannabis it's a whole plant but the the ones that people believe are active are called cannabinoids there are two that are most important it's CBD you may have heard of that and there's another called THC now that's the one that can cause a high it can cause ill effects but CBD is the one when in combination people think could be the ticket so what is the current law in the UK well the court as you said it changed that just about a year ago law says that specialists not GPS that's the important part specialists can prescribe cannabis based medicinal products only if other treatment options have failed and if they feel there really is a benefit so there must be NHS guidelines in place for prescribing cannabis what do they say yes now the guidelines are there the guidelines are very clear medicinal cannabis can be prescribed only when clear published evidence of benefits exists and other treatment options have been exhausted now those are in draft but that's pretty clear it makes it very very difficult to for example you're certainly not going to get it from your GP right but you've you visit this is the cannabis with the THC in it the because CBD you can you can you can buy absolutely it's available over-the-counter CBD that's that's deregulated in that sense and THC is still the part that's illegal but the you know the evidence over which works in what combination from which diseases is that is what's still not why aren't the doctors prescribe why is it not being prescribed it's a combination of things firstly that guidance it's pretty clear if you if you haven't exhausted other treatments you shouldn't be doing this secondly it called for more evidence there really isn't enough evidence out there that's utterly clear about one agent versus another and thirdly its infrastructure for example Billy had it prescribed but it cost him a thousand pounds a month the import licenses the customs the the protocols for moving the substances into the UK just aren't that so it sounds like the evidence in the infrastructure needs to catch up really with what the laws say and the THC but just explain why is that so helpful what is what what is it so there you go all it's a THC III say it as an acronym it's the high causa that's not necessarily as helpful it's the CBD that is and no one knows how or why and it's certainly the CBD that has more suggestion of help in chronic pain in epilepsy that's difficult to treat and so forth but there are also people who wish that both should be used in combination you say there is a lack of evidence is there evidence ongoing are we actually looking at this now because it's essentially it's a natural product absolutely and it's been around for thousands of years so there was a call for evidence into eight research areas there is soon to be announced potentially a trial a project looking at about 20,000 patients to follow them over the next two years and that's been brought about by a group of patient advocates a certain charity and actually a cannabis medicine or cannabis production company and and and the NHS group that looks over this has said it would be great to have this evidence so watch this space and is that currently sort of a range of conditions that we know that it's helpful for absolutely I mean it's actually licensed in the NHS for use in after chemotherapy it's also licensed for severe epilepsy but again this is only when other usually licensed medicines have been exhausted and the patients aren't getting the benefit from what's already around and more commonly used now people who buy the CBD over-the-counter they say it's useful for sleep for anxiety for potentially for appetite people use it as creams for their skin a whole host of myriad of ailments but that's slightly different that over-the-counter sort of you do they work let me know they are they good the evidence just isn't there but does that mean they don't work I mean cuz there's a lot of online evidence of sort of testimonial where people will say oh my god this has changed my life so it's that only count that I will listen I'm I'm I'm listen if it's CBD not known to cause harm right if it works for you placebo or otherwise I'm quite happy because it can get very expensive but I mean it depends sort of the the what you're buying and how much is in it and this that and the other because it varies and I think that's the problem that people find they're going doing well I don't know what's right for me I don't want to buy exactly and the over-the-counter CBD is actually only a food regulation type item so that isn't thoroughly controlled like a medicine sometimes you don't even know what's in the bottle to you mention that it's this is this has been ongoing for thousands of years people have taken cannabis for ailments for obviously for other reasons why is it taking so long for this and there there are mums and dads desperately concerned about their children why is it taking so long I think there's a social cultural eminent element doctors just aren't used to prescribing this one too the evidence just isn't there the last guidance that came out in August really did almost put a hold on it but that's going to deliver potentially next week they'll finalize the guidance I don't think it'll change much extremely upset about I'd be happy to be wrong yeah thank you thank you I'm coming in today you", "2rDTmvp1Bmc": "is used widely in textiles medicine and food but what is the difference between it and marijuana here to answer that question please welcome medical doctor and health coach dr. Elaine chin and naturopathic doctor and I mean my goodness we're hearing CBD THC we're hearing it all the time so it's nice for us to just sit down and get a definition of the difference between hemp and marijuana so I'll start with you doc what's the difference well definitely it's all confusing because you've got common names and then you've got scientific names so cannabis is a scientific name and marijuana and hemp is what we call common names okay so I think let's just leave it that because we're not doing biology 101 today okay and both of these plants or all these cannabis plants produce a combination of THC or CBD and they're the active ingredients that we get the stimulation or the relaxation effects okay so there's a difference though between the CBD and the THC and what would that difference be well one is what we call psychoactive such as the tea tea and one would say CBD is generally the one that's not addictive and is calming and you'd never get really high on that you wouldn't okay but you might from the THC you technically you do let's talk about how hemp impacts our bodies and I'm gonna throw this one to you Elizabeth great so as Elaine mentioned both the hemp and the cannabis the marijuana they all contain cannabinoids so you've got your THC and hemp it's very low less than 0.3% so there's none of the psychoactive effects your body also makes its own set of cannabinoids to bind to your brain and to different receptors in your body so they have the effect of regulating hormones and of maintaining overall body balance or homeostasis okay so if people are concerned with things like nausea inflammation chronic pain then hemp can be a really great solution that doesn't have any other psychoactive effects okay interesting so I actually I got you took a swab from me dr. Chynn just the cheek swab and it was you know it was very easy in order to give me an exam and to test me to see what the impact would be of CBD right CBD and THC okay so we got my exam results everybody and they were incredibly boring what did it say and we're being truthful here yeah I've got the right here she's boring because she's normal yeah yeah it's like cannot be normal metabolizer normal metabolizer average average and average this would have killed me in grade six what that fundamentally means is that if I gave you a dose regardless of it's a THC CBD combination or one or just the other for different reasons I would give you the normal standard dose and I would expect a normal metabolism rate and a normal effect rate of how you break down your THC or CBD okay and then we also looked at the psychoactive our anxiety side effect risk factors for you yeah you don't have it yeah and equally important you don't have the effects of a THC dependency risk factor the reason why you would administer or take part in an exam like that would be in order to see how you're going to take on and metabolize it something like CBD or th there's a lot of patients are wondering this is right for me so now we're gonna bring slides into this conversation to say if you're not sure let's look at your genetic predispositions and we also in our office measures something called neurotransmitters which are your brain chemicals okay is the impact of THC and CBD so we'll know what to give you more or less of okay do you have is there such thing as like an average dose that you would start out with if someone had average results yes so most prescribing physicians will start at the lowest dose and titrate you up just to be careful another thing worth mentioning is the the form that you take it in so if you're taking it sublingually under your tongue or in your mouth you're absorbing up to up to a hundred percent more than if you're taking it orally and you're actually ingesting or eating it the potency in eating something is vastly reduced so the four makes it each difference so what are the main benefits do you think Elizabeth like why would people turn to a CBD or a THC or hemp products yeah the main benefits are I mean all the cannabinoids have different profiles and so the product that you're getting is dependent upon the cannabinoid and also another class of molecules called terpenes upon the profile of those but the main benefits are they're anti-inflammatory they could help with sleep with mood with brain conditions those are the big ones and also gut health nausea you know cachexia or difficulty with weight loss around cancer there's all kinds of benefits and more being released as the data comes out any warnings that people should be aware of before they decide that they want to go pursue this as a you know as a remedy i would say go to a physician that prescribes cannabis rather than just go to a recreational snoring like wing it right make sure you with a doctor they know what they're doing they've done this before yeah and I understand a lot of people are saying well my family doctor is dismissing it it's only because I think they haven't got that time yet to kind of do the research do the information so but some of it is prescribing anything else we should know give it a go if traditional medical drugs aren't working for you okay good that's good information thank you for clarifying a lot of that for us both of you", "YHWOpgRz-V4": "it's a health condition that affects one in seven people in the UK and this week my next guest has me at headlines after revealing she used cannabis oil to help cure her migraines on TV presenter Jenny Powell joins us now alongside dr. Hillary and Johnny I mean these were debilitating migraines this was taking days out of every single month for you we just couldn't leave the house yeah it's interesting because it's only very much later on in life for me sort of mid forties when I when I discovered that I was actually suffering from the first of I just thought was a really bad headache or a virus and I remember I was actually filming it was freezing cold I was about 46 bit stressed and it was that time of the month and I just had this awful searing headache I felt sick and actually for the first time ever thought can't work and I had to ask if I could just sit down for a while and start working and since then sort of on a sort of regular basis normally I think for doing my hormones and when my periods start I've just had this awful migraine where sometimes three to four days I just can't can't function can't you know can't make tea for everyone can't do the school around can't go to work and it's something that I didn't really I never thought about it you know with people say I've got a migrant that always she's just got a headache you know but why did you have to lie down you know what why is it so dramatic because you look fine but actually and it changes your character I've been really sort of disgruntled and snappy and you know I just I want to talk to anyone I'm actually not held to live with and it was held to go through as well and had you been to the GP there and and gone down there yes tried various kind of mini yeah I'm not great at popping pills I'm all for being preventative and saying but why am I getting them you know what can I do to prevent them rather than right well every month I've got to have this this stack of pills to stop me suffering so much so you know for me that there was sort of like as a safety box it was you know where I'd have these pills there is sumatriptan yeah which kind of worked but I'm not happy with that really I'd rather find out why I'm getting it yeah and what I can do about it or May a more natural way of getting over it and this is then how the the cannabis oil can abide it with your partner actually suggested it yes yes my other half Martin he sort of researches a lot into system well first of all from nutrition but authored to health and sort of holistic ways of looking after yourself and it was a friend of his who actually was epileptic and she's done a lot of due diligence with it and discovered that it helped her I'm just saying this he's all for everybody's different you know I'm not an expert but you know I started to read up on things and discovered that you know for headaches it could help so I tried and it's been like three four months and I haven't had a migraine which for me is life-changing really yes and it could very well be the placebo effect who knows Hillary but where where do you stand on this because if you're saying you've got three or four months there with like this terrible migraine what Jenny describes really well is menstrual migraine and this is very common so many women in the days leading up to their period and during their period they can get migraines on a frequent basis and part of the reason for that is is a falling off of Eastern and levels just before a period and a rise in chemicals called prostaglandins which can cause inflammation and pain and and normally we treat those we can treat those with Eastridge n' just before the period we treat them with with medicines that can stop the inflammation and that would be the traditional way forward now there's huge hype at the moment about CBD products as sold as health supplements legally in this country things everyone's jumping on the bandwagon and you really don't know what you're buying so some will contain a lot more CBD than other products which may have hardly any and there is research done it being done on how therapeutic CBD can be in things like neurological conditions headaches migraines anxiety depression a lot of works being done but we don't yet know how effective CBD is and what concentration you need yes you can buy it provided it satisfies all the safety and sort of regulatory necessities but you don't know what you're buying and some of it can be really expensive now it's worth trying and you've tried it and it seems to work for you and that's fine what it doesn't have in its THC which is the psychoactive chemical that you're not getting a high but you are getting some pain release with an awful lot of people don't quite know what is that you hear they're trying a health supply which is legal cannabis is a Class B drug and it's still illegal to to use and possess and supply so you know you've got to be there is a big distinction this CBD doesn't contain the THC which which has this that gives you the high is the psychoactive and activity but it may be that for some people when they use a decent concentration of CBD does give them relief against pain and some people even think it could be good for conditions like Parkinson's epilepsy anxiety and depression yeah just drops I just take her you know you sort of work up to what sort of works for you but for me just a couple of drops underneath the tongue for about 60 90 seconds and I do it twice a day but like I say you know it works for me I think and I've been very careful I've done the due diligence on what I've got a sort of certified organic non sort of toxic drops that I use from hemp so you know you have to you have to go out there and do the research yeah but it is tricky because it's you know it's very expensive as well and if you get the wrong one you know and there are plenty you can buy online which will have more concentration and others you can buy and health food shops might have very very little if any you know so just be careful and do you diligently it's a waste of money otherwise you", "GcLpuOoOS8E": "[Music] it's not uncommon when people come in for them to describe to us that they've been experiencing atypical behavior acting in ways that aren't like themselves and this is not so uncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder [Music] and people with post-traumatic stress symptoms often attempt to take care of their problem on their own people drink they use substances they misuse substances as a way of coping seven to eight percent of the general population each year are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder or ptsd it manifests itself after an individual goes to a shocking stressful or for lack of a better term a traumatic experience leaving an individual in a very disturbed state the disorder can affect people of all ages and is commonly seen in military veterans victims of sexual assault or abuse and even witnesses of terror attacks and natural disasters symptoms of ptsd can begin to overcome an individual three months after the traumatic event and these include flashbacks where you relive the event over and over while even feeling the physical symptoms such as the racing heart and sweating [Music] individuals with ptsd can have difficulty falling asleep difficulty concentrating and can feel socially isolated develop extreme anxiety while also having depression within the brain the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the primary regions that are affected by ptsd while the neurochemicals cortisol and norepinephrine which are responsible for the stress response also tend to show increased activity in ptsd patients imagine the worst possible day of your life now imagine reliving that moment over and over and over and over again and with each passing moment the fear that it may happen again only grows greater for a lot of ptsd patients they only see one solution one effective way to cope with their problem and this leads us to substance abuse in recent years ptsd has been shown to have a link with substance use disorder in which individuals frequently use these substances to cope with their struggles but today we'll be only focusing our attention to one of these drugs cannabis or more commonly known as marijuana so what is cannabis cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be smoked ate in an edible form and drank in liquid form the psychoactive substance within cannabis is known as thc also known as tetrohydrocannable this is a molecule that is responsible for eliciting the euphoric effects that it is known for cbd is another major component of cannabis however it is not relevant to the studies we will be examining so when canvas is ingested it causes the brain to release dopamine which is the reward chemical for our body and this is the fundamental mechanism by which cannabis affects our brain body and mental state so now we've talked about ptsd and we've talked about cannabis but how do they relate to one another we'll take a look at two studies that examine the effects of cannabis on ptsd does it help or does it hurt the symptoms in a study conducted in 2014 researchers examined 2 276 military veterans who were diagnosed with ptsd their findings were astonishing following an analysis of their symptoms they found that those military veterans that never used cannabis had the lowest level of ptsd symptoms such as depression anxiety and sleeplessness however it is interesting that those who started smoking cannabis following ptsd diagnosis saw a rise in violent behaviors in contrast those who stopped smoking marijuana also saw a decrease in certain ptsd symptoms [Music] in a more recent study conducted in 2020 404 individuals with ptsd were put on a medical marijuana regiment in which they inhaled cannabis these individuals tracked their symptoms on an app for 31 months and had a total of 11 000 responses they tracked symptoms such as intrusive thoughts flashbacks irritability anxiety along with many others after analyzing the results the researchers concluded that there was a 50 percent decrease in all ptsd symptoms immediately after using marijuana like all studies there are some limitations there needs to be more controlled research so we can truly understand the effects this is a new and advancing field and it's necessary to explore all avenues to see how cannabis can improve or deteriorate our mental health now where does this leave us can we say for certain that cannabis cures ptsd definitely not but we can certainly also not rule it out as a potential treatment what we can say though is that for certain individuals cannabis does prove to lessen the severity of their symptoms while for others it may increase them like any medication before taking any course of action it is best to consult your doctor and understand both the possible benefits and the risks this is demystifying medicine presenting ptsd in cannabis help or hurt you", "bAWQzJqxd3k": "THE AREA USED TO BE REGISTERED AS A MEDICAL MARIJUANA SITE.

not all highs are good highs sometimes there are bad highs yeah do you have a horror high story of that experience while you were high I'm sure yeah so I was in Jamaica and my friends there was like 15 of us got all guys we decided to take brownies one day and like the crew range from guys who smoked weed everyday to guys who had never smoked weed in their entire lives but everyone was no pun intended pot committed to taking these brownies they're like this big I took one we all went to the beach and then like all of us were hit with this ridiculous wave to where everybody was I can't even like astronomically high like I wa I couldn't even cross the street like I was trying to cross the street at this pizza place with my two friends and I couldn't I kept backing up and I can I finally sat down and got food and then we ordered buffalo chicken pizza and I was enjoying it and then my friend said like ma'am I've gotta get out of here like I think like the walls are like coming in and his friend was like a very like he was like the guy who would get so drunk and not feel it like he was like the big type of dude who wouldn't get freaked out and he got freaked out to freak me out then all of a sudden I just woke up and what happened was apparently I woke up on the ground with like ten Jamaicans standing over me and my friend said that my eyes started wrong in the back of my head they thought I was joking they slapped me in the face and I fell off and like I guess essentially having a mini seizure and since then I haven't taken edible it was the only time I've taken edibles and I just have I mean the ruined edibles for me I'm not doing it man it's crazy we went to bed at 4 p.m. that day it was a complete waste of a spring break danger you", "lSWq35pDZNw": "welcome to shades of migraine a podcast series created by the Association of migraine disorders we hope you'll enjoy listening to a wide variety of voices including the perspectives of people living with migraine and those that are trying to help each will share their unique shade of migraine tara is committed to the goal of transforming the lives of those suffering from migraine by creating solutions to reinvent the migraine paradigm by placing people at the center of everything they do you can visit www.imtcva.org Institute gives us scientific and practical information about the use of cannabis or marijuana for treating migraine originally geared towards physicians this 20-minute presentation is chock-full of information helpful for anyone using or contemplating using cannabinoids to treat their migraine disease or chronic pain Thank You Ric for inviting me here it's been a pleasure to be part of this organization it's my second time participating and you know today I'm gonna talk about a topic that's fun but yet it's also a little controversial I grew up in the 80s so it's thinking about you know giving the title hope with dope but then I thought about stigma and decided to keep it to keep it to just cannabinoids so today I'm going to talk about criminology I'm going to talk about pharmacology I'm gonna talk about fetish pathogenesis I'm going to talk about some clinical research and as well in particular Rick asked me to talk about physician or clinician expectations and also patient expectations and they're going to briefly mention some cutting-edge research that we're doing at dent which has a large - large practice to begin with but we also are involved in medical marijuana or cannabis so basic terminology marijuana is frequently you know thought of to be a synonym for cannabis but it's not the terms are different cannabis is the botanical term for the hemp plant that contains cannabis sativa cannabis sativa is different from cannabis indica so cannabis sativa is a tall lastly branched with long and narrow leaves there's a picture of it there on the bottom right corner this provides more of the high feeling the energetic buzz feeling it's up till uplifting feeling the ratio of THC to CBD is it has more of a THC component versus CBD I'm going to explain those molecules in a second and recreational users users typically seek this train to get more of the high feeling cannabis indica comes from India it was found there in the Hindu Kush mountain range as well these are short conical dense branches with broad leaves provides more of a stoned feeling and people also use it for sedation pain relief and anxiety benefits as well there's a slightly different THC to CBD ratio and typically medical users prefer this strained over the other one in terms of history it's been around for thousands of years it's actually even mentioned in the Ebers papyrus with some use for pain related disorders but one of the earliest known use has been found in China and plant stems were used for ropes and linen flower seeds especially the resin can be sort of extracted to give psychoactive chemical properties termed cannabinoids so the different types of cannabinoids endocannabinoids are endogenous these are lipid based neurotransmitters one of the first discovered was an and amide and I'm gonna mention that a little bit later and when we talk about pathogenesis phyto cannabinoids these are the ones listed here these are come from more of a natural base and then synthetic cannabinoids either FDA approves these two in particular are FDA approved for the treatment of nausea and and severe nausea shows associated with cancer related pains these synthetic cannabinoids that are FDA approved have more of a regulation in terms of the actual compound itself versus the synthetic that are out on the street these are manufactured by chemists chemists and their chemical structure has changed there have been some warnings associated with that which I'm going to touch on a little bit later on so there are synthetic cannabinoids that are approved by FDA and then there are other ones that people buy online and their structures actually modified they are not coming from natural plants so just to know some of that terminology in terms of the pharmacology tetrahydrocannabinol was first identified in 1964 by Mechelen and by smoking in one cigarette or joint you can contain about 0.5 to 1 gram of cannabis only about 20% is absorbed in the lungs it's rapidly metabolized in the liver you can also have because of its solubility you can have accumulation and fat taking place that's why you can even detect it in the urine two weeks down the line as well oral consumption can produce prolonged but poor absorption so some people who may try something orally and don't feel the effect will keep eating and then later on they just are completely wiped out because the delayed effect more on pharmacology so there's several primary cannabinoids from cannabis so there's cannabidiol cbn caneta i'm sorry a cannabinol cannabidiol which is CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol so THC has more of the psychoactive property CBN is about one tenth of the psychoactive property as THC and CBD has no real psychoactive property adverse effects of marijuana so on the left you can see some of the short-term effects which include memory impairment motor coordination altered judgment motor vehicle accidents sometimes even psychosis and paranoia on the right side it's somewhat controversial it's debatable so I'm not going to really delve in too much into that that area is still controversial in terms of long-term effects of heavy use who uses marijuana there are patients people who use it for recreational they also use it for medical reasons and some use it for both as well now what's in marijuana marijuana contains hundreds in and maybe more different cannabinoids so here's a breakdown of several different cannabinoids CBD focusing on that in particular has several different properties antibacterial inhibits cancer cell growth nor protective benefits both promotes bone growth reduces sugar levels all these other ones that are listed here that you can see where are the cb1 receptors there are several different parts of the brain so it's a medulla which is involved which has a chemoreceptor trigger zone the cerebellum the basal ganglia cerebral cortex the hypothalamus and the hippocampus as well as a spinal cord now I like this article is published in the green journal it's not that green journal it's a different green journal and I like this because it really talks about pathogenesis and right now we we know a lot about migraine pathogenesis and we know because of the newest you know information on neuro inflammation so it's really interesting is if you look at the research that's already existing out there wood cannabinoids and where it potentially affects the receptors there's a parallel between my grandpa thought physiology as well too for example systemic effects there are variants in the CNR one gene which encodes for a cannabinoid one receptor which results in decreased expression of cb1 associated with migraines and the trigeminal vascular activation we know that the trigeminal vascular system and the trigeminal cervical complex all play a big role in migraine pathogenesis we have peripheral and central activation of those too there's been some research on people who have deficiency endocannabinoids and particularly an and amide and possibly there's a relationship between that and the pathogenesis of migraines - that's still an area that needs further research as well if you take a look at the cortex you have sebum antagonists that suppress glutamate neurotransmission by inhibiting NMDA MDA receptors you also have cb1 receptors that suppress cortical spreading depression which is a precursor for migraines in the vasculature you can see that there's some effect on blood vessels and effect on blood vessel dilation induced by cg RP as well as capsaicin midnight ro coxide in addition you have Ananda mite that is an agonist or activates trip v1 which is involved in also trigeminal vascular activation trip v1 is another area of future study it's actually being currently study in a potential target for future migraine treatments so it's exciting to see that the cannabinoid research actually parallel some of this as well there's some effect on platelets as well and when in relation to platelets there is some research with 5-hydroxytryptamine or v HT receptor ends and migraines in the brain stem so we know that there's a peripheral activation there's also a central activation of migraines which involves a sending pathways that go through the pair Iraq or dr. gray the thalamus to cortex and there's descending pathways that go down as well too and persistent activation of these pathways lead to something called allodynia which was I think mentioned earlier in some of the rat models so what's been shown as a cb1 receptor actually is involved in it with activation of the periaqueductal gray area and also the rostral event remit uh medial medulla as well so here's a quick chart that looks at all this sort of combined together this concept of endocannabinoid deficiency which some people may have a genetic predisposition to or have genetically may have that results in increased glutamate signaling which may lead to cortical spreading depression as a potential oral migraine trigger and basically what I just said is summarized in this diagram here now why is it difficult to do research because it's still listed as a schedule 1 drug including some of those other agents I know dr. goshawk back there is doing some research and he might be able to provide some insight just one on with LSD I believe so he might be able to elaborate how difficult it is to do something like that so it's not an easy process so that's one of the challenges to doing research on cannabis or cannabinoids is because of the the scheduled nature of it other research includes the current research includes in most of the trials in the USSR retrospective studies so these are you know there are no prospective trials where we actually give patients medications and follow them through but there are some European ones which I'm gonna highlight just one quick abstract on the most of the ones that are existing right now are very short not enough patience and a lot of confounding factors in those studies which include tobacco use and comorbid illness as well so I practice in New York State so right now the approved uses for medical cannabis is cancer and all these other ones that are listed the newest one that was just added not too long ago is PTSD so I actually looked up word Island and Rhode Island has a very similar approve approval for these disorders as well recently Rhode Island had a Department of Health Center advisory and this was through other states as well and this had in particular due to the synthetic cannabinoid these are produced these are you can buy these online and what some of these people that manufacture them were changing the chemical structure so they actually added something that was making it cause increase bruising it was affecting vitamin K so just to be aware of issues with synthetic cannabinoids that you can buy online there are also legal issues in these vary by states that would encourage you to look up things in your own state you can't travel out of your state for the most part you can't drive with it there's risk of DUI laws allow federal employees to fire for positive drug tests whereas there may be some protection with state employees as well and it cannot be used in certain institutions such as group homes nursing homes or hospitals so what I mentioned before some of the limitations of retrospective clinical trials is that you know there's limited data from that that we can we can use so I found something you know a recent a meeting that took place in the Amsterdam and it was some German researcher which has a little bit more liberal rules in terms of research I was a prospective study at small study where they took some migraine patients and cluster patients and initially gave them THC one group and another group had cannot CBD only they found that adequate higher doses and result in about 50 55 percent improvement in overall frequency and severity the second phase they gave the migraine patients amitriptyline and also THC CBD combination and they found an improvement as well what's interesting about this is that in the cluster headache patients the only patients that improved were the ones that had some background history of migraines as a child as well so this is a very limited study and I only have this in abstract form it's just to highlight that a prospective trial is more you know it gives us more data than a retrospective trial so just to comment about what's going on at dent the cannabis clinic these are the number of patients that we've seen so far in a in a year or a year and a half period majority the patients are being treated for chronic pain 69% approximately about 30 to 40 percent of those about 30 percent of those are chronic migraine patients this data is from doctormick vague who's one of the leading researchers on concussion and she actually has one of the largest population of concussion patients about 800 in one particular study that she's undergoing right now so in a subset of one of her studies she's actually studying in about 149 individuals with chronic pain who were certified for medical cannabis and they were given concussion related diagnosis of post concussive syndrome she was using five sort of pillar pillars as a treatment modality so these were mood sleep headache dizziness and concentration issues and what she found was that there were three of these had had more significant improvement over a period of time with medical cannabis use versus not and these were there was an 80% improvement in mood and 78% would sleep and 76% with headache so the and that's one of the findings the second important finding in this particular study so this study is published in the abstract form and it's submitted for a publication as in a journal and further analysis of this of the study are being done right now as well - so 80% of the patients experience significant improvement activity limitations symptoms emotions and quality of life this is not showing as clearly but it's showing you that there was an improvement in quality of life pre medical cannabis use was 27% post medical cannabis use it was 43% so there's an improvement it was successfully significant there's further analyses being done with this particular study so stay tuned in fact she's actually presenting this at the American Academy neurology concussion meeting that's taking place later on another finding from this study was the optimal dosing was a byproduct a combination of THC to CBD a one-to-one ratio with a combination of a tincture those three times per day and the inhalation component was a 20 to 1 ratio as a vapor pen and this is more used as an immediate relief which which is not used all the time but just more of a breakthrough pain the cost was 269 per month which is a little bit high but cost of this varies from state to state as well - and hopefully this will decrease over time the the last finding of this particular study was 14% of patients reported side effects all were minimal and all were and 70% were related to administration route whether it was dry mouth or cough so this was fairly tolerated so how do you go about doing this I mean not too many places have a cannabis clinic first you have to contact your physician they have to be certified they have to certify you and then you get registered you apply for a card you get a registration then you go to a dispensary to purchase your product so what are some provider expectations so maintenance of CBD products takes about two weeks to of regular use before patients can start to notice any relief of symptoms the change in cannabis ratios should be done in two to three month and month intervals increments cannabis is dose dependent cost-prohibitive so it does cost more the more you use so you know patients are you know they they want to minimize use and at least and get the most bang for their buck as well too so they might adjust some of their dosing on their own taste of tinctures may restrict use as well to the vaporization is contraindicated for COPD and asthma some drug interactions to be concerned about so opioids you may need to decrease the opioid dose as well - one thing to know is that some of these patients that are coming in with you the you may not feel comfortable giving the medical cabinets if there aren't a high dose of opioids so you have to coordinate with pain management to help them titrate down their dose now if you feel comfortable doing that you can do that but I think most clinicians feel more comfortable with who I was originally prescribing them to lower their dose there's a lot of active research going on now with the use of medical cannabis and getting people off of opioids so that's another area of study and is a big need for that as well - so stay tuned for that research to come out as well you may need to decrease the anxiety dose as well too tricyclic antidepressants they have sedative effects monitor increased side-effects of SSRIs anti retrovirals they may be enzyme inhibition or inducing effects related to that and seizure meds as well may need to be adjusted due to the pharmaco dynamic related changes now establishment expectations so this Dement this depends on the amount of prophylactic products the patients are going to use and their ability to afford their products a lot of the patients that we're seeing are not able to afford some of the products at the dispensaries at the rate right now so that's one of the limitations so what some of them wind up doing is they get approved they wind up using their or smoking marijuana so that's something to be aware of as well - patients may have some reduction in migraine associated symptoms but this may take time CBD maintenance so it does reduce muscle pain anxiety improve sleep the increase in tincture dose must be done slowly to prevent any adverse effects such as dizziness and drowsiness it can take about two weeks to develop any kind of consistent use of CBD to notice any positive effects once again THC provides more immediate pain relief in this is more done in the form of a vape form as well too so this is going to be important they can't take this to work they can't drive within six hours after use it will create a high and it may worsen anxiety or paranoia just a few more slides I don't know how we are on time wait okay so alright so there there's improvement that takes over time you need to set these realistic expectations for these patients this I got from the the Rhode Island Department of Health just to show you what people are doing in Rhode Island so this is the data from two thousand sixteen to seventeen there's about 4500 patients that have been being treated for chronic pain and those are some of the other indications and who's writing this in Rhode Island majority are internal medicine family medicine and not so much neurology further research needs to be done i want to thank dr. laszlo Metzler who is leading the campaign at dent doctormick Vig who provided some of the research data on the concussion and Cheryl Lyon who is a nurse practitioner who's very much involved with patient and clinician expectations thank you tava is committed to the goal of transforming the lives of those suffering from migraine by creating solutions to reinvent the migraine paradigm by placing people

"pUhJnKKQDTE": "as marijuana becomes legalized throughout North America [Many] are trying edibles for the first time as a healthier option but with Edible marijuana Providing such a different experience than smoking how does it work and is eating pot Actually better for you? When you heat cannabis you effectively change the chemical makeup of compounds within it called Cannabinoids Smoking heats it to around 800 degrees Celsius and converts thc a to Delta 9 thC which binds to receptors in your brain making them continually fire and causing your imagination, thoughts and perceptions to magnify this is why every thought can feel like a significant one and Because it travels straight from your lungs into the bloodstream and to your brain the drug works within minutes and lasts about two to [three] Hours, but when making edibles the weed is heated to around 150 degrees Celsius burning less of the actual plant and minimizing Carcinogens ThC is Lipophilic not water-soluble so the activated Thc must be dissolved into something fatty like oil or butter and once the substance is consumed the onset of the high is delayed as the drug is absorbed more slowly through your gut but this high typically lasts four to eight hours and most report feeling more high than Compared to smoking marijuana [this] is because when you eat edible weed the ThC is first metabolized by the liver before entering the bloodstream and here Delta 9 thC also becomes 11 o h thC which Passes the brain barrier more rapidly and is a more potent chemical so using the same amount of marijuana You actually get more high with Edibles because it ends up creating both Delta 9 ThC And 11-OH-THC which is a stronger compound and because there are more? psychotropic types of Cannabinoids acting on your neurons you'll be high for longer of course you also get to skip out on the toxic chemicals that smoking provides like Carbon monoxide Bronchial Irritants and tumor Initiators smoking anything means you're inhaling cancer-causing molecules so if you can get high without smoking it will be healthier for your lungs and body the downside it's much harder to control the High you'll get because it can take up to one to two hours to feel the full effects and the dosage can vary significantly modulating the effects or Titrating as it's called is much more difficult [and] as a result you can end up a lot higher than you intend - but unlike those who consume too much alcohol Opioids or other drugs you won't be suffering any serious long-term harm Toxicity [or] Lethal overdose if you do consume more than you intended [if] you've ever wondered why marijuana gives you the

awesome stuff on and I got it from my husband's ex girlfriends yes my husband is still friends with that with his ex-girlfriend and is that snow Fritz family and several of them Mattingly and I'm totally okay with that because I'm really awesome people so whatever I'm not fret it's all again I mean they're really nice and well and I've actually met them before aspects really awesome people and they gave us some Seth and I've heard amazing amazing stories about the stuff and I last time i was there like a couple years ago they stayed there with us for a little bit I'm Marva taught me how to make this stuff and she didn't want to teach me this first secret special recipe but I pressed I think you all if you know me you know how persistent I am I don't like taking no for an answer I just never do the pub's I have to don't like I would ever be but you know light goes on so I kind of want to make this with my mom because my mom likes to do something like this too and I'm sure she would love to learn how to make this that she has all the the Greens got to do it with yeah so I am on the road and I'm really hungry all i've got is a couple of these I don't know like mama bars they're like organic and rod three which is good cuz I'm gluten-free but they're like my gosh you're so hungry like any more fans and I had some nuts but I feel like I need more fat and that's more protein or some so I need to be maybe i'll have to pull over I really don't want to hold up with I just want to cry maybe I think it's neat another mom bar and just suck it up and drive see you later guys oh yeah so the wait a minute this was supposed to really so if you guys have been watching Dustin videos oh my goodness can you believe that I couldn't believe what so many how they're supposed kind of keep you updated to see if this works and you know what goes on better but for now i'm driving by guys", "6J9aM0Gh0iE": "[Music] and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and it's old-school today guys cuz we are taking a look at an edible just like good times good times I mean old times but the old times aren't necessarily good times anymore because here in California we are fully in the new recreational world which includes this ridiculous hundred milligram cap on edibles not just that but makes absolutely crazy packaging requirements for all edibles here in California so what edible are we talking about that is ridiculous today what we are gonna take our first look at Plus gummies that's right another gummy review I normally tell you to avoid the gummies but I have heard a lot of good things about Plus and I am a little curious I'm always hoping to find another gummy I like cushy punch or flourish or Tiki killers that's actually worth something so I'm definitely looking forward to reviewing these plus gummies first thing you're gonna notice is how crazy this packaging is so here it is here is our plus gummies I believe they are sour blueberry blue in case you don't know is objectively the best flavor of everything if there is a multitude of colors and blue is available always go with blue because blue is much like a like a law of thermodynamics or whatever the case may be blue is always the best fruit flavor even though I don't know of any naturally-occurring blue fruits other than blueberries and blue tasting foods are hardly ever blueberries usually blue raspberry or something it's always the best trust me on this though so we have a sealed bag with you know all these insane requirements on it batch number this that and the other I mean it's great because it has all of those wonderful serving sizes and ingredients and all the testing results all this stuff you know I like seeing but it's a bag and then a fancy 10 on the inside I think all edibles now have to be bagged in addition to whatever kind of thing holds the edibles they have to have these sealed maggots it's insane it just boosts up the cost because this uh 100 milligram 20 piece edibles so I believe it's 20 gummies each worth 5 milligrams of THC cost me 20 bucks at my dispensary which is outrageous of course but that is the world we now live in and we shall review it as if it's the world we want to live in who knows I don't know what I'm saying I know I'm sad I'm disappointed that the edible world has changed so much and so for such and in such a shitty direction over the past year but let's stop the bitching and get straight to the review of the plus gummies cannabis infused sour blue berry so we're gonna open up the first layer of the packaging here it looks like it's got a little tear thing nice Oh and then then we got our second layer the zip sealed bag on side of the tear bag and then we gotta figure out how to open this the childproofing I think you ground push down and that breaks the seal yes there we go so second layer of security through now we're finally to our chin on the inside and to the gummies in here ah so here are our blue raspberry or blueberry gummies whatever they call it blue flavored the best 20 gummies in there give it a smell oh definitely a cannabis e odor which is not a bad thing I I'd like to know that there's some cannabis in these but also a hefty flavor and aroma of blue but certainly in a cannabis aroma there as you can see just a bunch of little squares dropped one there and let's pluck it into our mouths but before we do in case this is your first week to review the way they work when we do edibles we reviewed the whole experience I'm gonna eat all 20 of these gummies and then I'm gonna come back to you guys in about two hours to actually let you know how I'm feeling because it's you want to know how have it tasted like [ __ ] but you what you really want is it gonna get you [ __ ] up it's gonna get you high are you gonna get what you paid for it and that guy's is what you need to stick around for but first the taste test so here we go first cube in the mouth um very spongy gummies very very spongy almost hard to bite into because they're so Airy um a surprising cannabis taste them it's not awful but there is a 4 what is 5 milligrams of THC in these cubes definitely a cannabis taste to it but the blue the blue sciency flavor counter sex but if you don't like cannabis taste maybe you don't stick with these because you're gonna taste it again not terrible not overwhelming but it is surprisingly noticeable for what is just 5 milligrams of THC so guys I'm gonna eat me about what 16 more of these and I said I'm gonna eat me which is very back woodsy and folksy way of saying I'm gonna eat the rest of these so guys I'll see you in about two hours I'm gonna scarf these down and I'll let you know then if they're worth your money or not so thanks for staying tuned this far sticking around this far sorry guys this is really my second video back here on weeds and this will probably be another video between season 3 and between season 2 and season 3 so forgive my rustiness see you guys in two hours thanks for sticking around 2 hours since I have had the plus cannabis infused gummies looking at the camera for the first time now since coming back the fuse but I also see now I'm saying the word let's just start over one more time BAM I'm back guys it has been 2 hours since I had the plus cannabis infused gummies and I think there was an even yeah it says create on there as well there are a lot of nouns and adjectives and verbs on that packaging I'm really not even sure what it's called I'm just gonna call it plus gummies plus gummies uh guys I am genuinely pretty impressed uh for a gummy and for a hundred milligram edible this brought the heat um I'm not outrageously high but I am at like maybe a 6 somewhere in that range which is way higher than I expected it to be after a hundred milligrams and especially after a gummy I am pretty pleased with this now that is in the relative scale compared to you know this new world of edibles because this is a very expensive product you don't get a lot for your money here compared to the old world but in this new world this is a pretty good little solution um I found myself not maybe quite as high as if they were like akarova or a Kanaka mini cookie situation but for a gummy and for how much less you have to eat then which is very important to me you have to eat a [ __ ] ton of those cookies from like all you know Pete's and Korova and Kanaka all those ones you just mentioned you have to eat like 20 of those you know many cookies to get the hundred milligrams the gummies here were a hell of a lot more manageable that 10 was no problem to eat by myself I didn't didn't feel like a gluttonous badass after consuming that whole thing at all so really really pleased with that aspect um have a cannabis taste for sure but not awful um I didn't feel like retching after eating that not even close there was a cannabis taste but it was not the primary taste and again didn't have that just incredibly bitter kind of almost you know a cynic that Pacific we've tasted no no just the taste is there but then again for as potent as these came you know turned out to be you would expect that so guys this is a a nice win I think I'm I'm pretty impressed with Plus cannabis infused gummies and then also that were to create for some reason on there as well so I'm really happy with this I think I'll be reviewing some more stuff from plus in the future and if you see these in a dispensary near you and you guys want to eat all of something to get the hundred milligrams Jesus it's it's almost easier to recommend this then which is hard to say which is hard to believe actually then like the Kanak o or the kirova because it's just such it's so much easier to do and they're they're sort of equivalently priced you don't get quite as high but it's it's it's easier to it's easier to manage for sure so really surprised me on this one guys and what the [ __ ] let's just shoot the moon here guys I'm gonna throw a cherry on top - my little cherries on top here just little things I like to add that aren't necessarily we related something you can just do to enjoy throughout your week and I'm just gonna throw this one out because I am having an ever-loving blast playing spider-man on the ps4 from insomniac holy [ __ ] guys it's so great to see insomniac get this win I assume this game it's going to be an amazingly huge hit it seems to be it's only a couple days since it's been out but reception seems to be great and it seems to be doing really well sales wise I'm so happy for insomniac I love these guys since the ps1 days back in like Spyro loved them on the ps2 days Ratchet and Clank so my favorite you know 3d action platformers ever even love the resistance franchises back on the ps3 days and then they have been one of the greatest VR developers as well and I'm a big big fan of VR so you know what [ __ ] it I'm going to this endorsement is not for spider-man which is an awesome game I am having an utter blast with it it doesn't rewrite the rules anyway it's it's not a you know changing the genre it's just a hell of a good video game you know it's not rewriting anything but it's it's wonderful I'm having a blast with it but instead this cherry on top is just for insomniac in general they make great great games they've been making great great games for like 20 years I love them as a studio I'm so happy to see them having this huge success with spider-man so insomniac you'll never see this video but great job guys really proud of you and that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review what a great time we had great gummies that were so good here's an extra piece of packaging we

treatments come many side effects often managed by more medication a law that went into effect on july 1st of this year may give breast cancer patients in the commonwealth another tool in their belt to help with all those additional symptoms reba hollingsworth looks at how virginia's new regulated medical cannabis program will affect breast cancer patients [Music] i felt like i had done everything in my life to try to avoid cancer to say it was a shock is an understatement i had two very young children my daughters were four and two years old and um just i was flawed i didn't think that that i would be a breast cancer patient during treatment bernice o'donnell experienced many common side effects of chemotherapy at the time medical cannabis wasn't legally available with chemo i ended up being nauseous like so many other chemo patients and um to combat that the doctors prescribed anti-nausea medication which was helpful however with chemo you end up having difficulty for me at least um difficulty passing food and then the anti-nut anti-nausea medication made it even more challenging to pass food current day if i had gone through it i would have i would have tried the medical cannabis as of july 1st patients in virginia now have the option of using medical cannabis through virginia's regulated medical cannabis program patients have been able to find relief from the side effects of chemotherapy by using medical cannabis relief for issues like pain nausea loss of appetite and sleep disruption as well as anxiety not to mention pain that may be associated with the cancer itself jen michelle padini of virginia normal says medical cannabis can be an alternative to opiate prescriptions she says data from other states struck a core with legislators in virginia looking for a solution to the opiate crisis it will have the same results here in virginia that we've seen across the country where we're we're seeing a very quickly about a 25 percent reduction in opioid overdose fatalities and increasing up to about 35 percent after just a few years for patients like bernice the extra option is one more way to get through a tough treatment your life is not normal when you're going through treatment but any benefit anything that can make your life that much more comfortable is such a huge plus that it would be worth it to use it right now the first

500 milligram full spectrum oil this is 500 milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract and a 1 ounce tincture bottle as you can see it's got a little dropper to it when the dropper is full that's about one milliliter of product and each bottle there's 30 servings we offer this in a natural flavour as well as mint on the back or instructions we shake well before using place it under your tongue for one to two minutes swish it around and then swallow the product the natural flavour is kind of like a light cooking oil texture and the mint has a slight mint flavor using essential oil that's therapeutic grade and capable of being adjusted this is your go-to day today I'll here this is your daily use morning and night middle of the day as needed you know I've even experimented with this putting a couple drops on the skin about 5 to 10 drops on the skin to just see how it would respond to some inflammation maybe a little bit of tennis elbow there this is the Honan sound it's a thousand milligrams of full spectrum hemp extract in beeswax there's a little bit of eucalyptus essential oil and a little little bit of lavender essential oil just for a little bit of scent but it's not overpowering it's not too strong it's not emasculating it's not a scent you're gonna be dragging through the room and your buddies are gonna be like what's up with this guy again this is a full spectrum help extract thousand milligrams with beeswax it's a it's a it's a hard product it's it's a solid your your body body heat will melt the product onto your fingers and you simply rub it and massage it into the skin this can be used daily or even multiple times throughout the day last but not least we have a 25 milligram soft gel for people who may not be interested in taking the tincture may not like the flavor of the natural flavor or the mint flavor we have a 25 milligram soft gel there's 30 in here that has added to it 10 milligrams of pure cumin which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties as well as anti depression properties or anti-anxiety properties this is something that I consider a nightly thing or you had a long day you want to you know you went on a long hike you got your elk hunting this is kind of like the you know right before a bad take it this made when I take this at night and I wake up I feel rejuvenated and I feel refreshed 25 milligrams is not a substantial amount of taking at once but it may be a substantial amount for you if you haven't utilized the product and I would recommend taking this at night or late in the afternoon when you're just home for the rest of the day until you see how your body responds to it I wouldn't say it causes drowsiness but it does promote and can promote relaxation and well-being so this is something you know I have to write a long day that you you're on the couch you're a back at camp take one of these and you're ready to go to bed and the properties of this product may help you get back in action in the morning you can also take up to four of these in a day but if you have the oil and the soft gels like they're good pair that go together so you can take the oil as your daily and and then take the soft gels add needed for an extra boost", "iWF9MmiQUA4": "in this study we treated children with dravet syndrome which is a very serious genetic form of epilepsy that unfortunately has a very high seizure burden and a very high mortality from epilepsy that these children who had not responded to often five or ten other treatments were given cannabidiol or a placebo in addition to their existing medications cannabidiol is the major non psychoactive ingredient in cannabis also known as marijuana so cannabidiol does not produce any high or psychoactive properties and therefore has less potential side effects especially for use in children than a psychoactive compounds such as THC we were in the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of the study and we did that for 14 weeks and we were like totally convinced that she was in a placebo because her seizures didn't change at all and then we were able to roll into the open label extension and the second day that we're in open label and we knew that she was getting the actual drug she went seizure free like completely seizure free for two months which has never happened the main findings of the study were that there was a very statistically significant reduction in the convulsive seizure frequency in patients who are randomized to cannabidiol when compared to patients who are randomized to placebo so the message is that cannabidiol does work in reducing convulsive seizures in children with dravet syndrome my hope for the future is that this study will lead to more similar studies to assess cannabidiol and

been a lot of hype around delta 8 thc a cannabinoid cousin of delta 9. delta 8 thc is chemically different from delta 9 thc by only a few atomic bonds while delta 9 can exist in cannabis strains in amounts up to 30 to 40 percent delta 8 only exists naturally in fractions of a percent nevertheless companies are stoked on the idea of extracting and concentrating delta 8 for its unique effects word on the street is that delta 8 thc gets you high but to a lesser extent and without the anxiety it's also known for its appetite stimulating analgesic and neuroprotective properties and anti-nausea effects in a 1995 study conducted by dr rafael meshalim eight children with cancer who were being treated with different drugs along with chemotherapy were given delta 8 thc in conjunction with chemo and as a result vomiting was completely prevented with side effects reported as being negligible so obviously delta 8 thc deserves our attention there seem to be both medical and recreational benefits

I told you there are dispensaries that are recommending marijuana as treatment for pregnant women suffering from morning sickness in this study was conducted recently in 400 dispensaries in Colorado found that nearly 70% of the dispensaries had someone in there recommending marijuana as a treatment for morning sickness now there's a huge difference between well could a cup of coffee be good or bad for you and getting to a place where we're telling pregnant women to take marijuana when we know marijuana we it can be very bad for brain development so I I don't know how this is happening I don't know as an OBGYN if you're in no offense to the state of Colorado where I was born but if you're in that state and you're not pissed off this was a fascinating study the way they did this it was published in your journal of obstetrics and gynecology they had these secret researchers pretend they were eight weeks pregnant and call 400 dispensaries in Colorado and say I'm eight weeks pregnant I'm having morning sickness do you suggest marijuana and like you said almost 70% of them were like absolutely and that was uniformly really scared to know this because we know that you know when when you're pregnant and the baby in utero the placenta is that filter to really rule to weed out the toxins weed out the toxins [Applause] but no matter what we still know that some of that marijuana will get to the baby and how much and how it affects a baby whether it's edibles whether it's through inhalation or even secondhand marijuana can affect the baby and the baby's brain is developing we know it affects neuro development and neurotransmitters so this doesn't leave us very concerned I'm a supporter of medical marijuana I'm actually a supporter of recreational marijuana I am fine if someone wants to of age use marijuana recreationally if they do it the right way I'm fine but here's a big issue I was just in Colorado again my state I love Colorado more than anything people I'm very close to went into a dispensary where they recommended marijuana to help a teenager who's very close to me to sleep at night and the dispensary retailers the people who are working the counter not all of them are beginning to act like marijuana is a panacea and they're beginning to act like doctors and I beg everyone to be very cautious because it's not a panacea it's not a cure-all it can be very effective for certain things people who it can be effective as what we call an antiemetic potentially in the right scenarios but I'm worried that the people working there arguing enough training what's that this was the thing this study actually called both retail and medical and they had completely similar recommendations and only 31.8% so less than a third of them even recommended checking with your provider without prompting so so they were giving this advice as if it was gospel straight from the word of a nurse practitioner a doctor health care provider there are so many other ways to treat some nausea symptoms in pregnancy there's so many safe reliable natural methods even and even some reliable medications so before trying all of that I really don't think we should be taking a lot of risks with regards to the baby this is a real problem prescribing this by by non-medical people to young people to pregnant people without getting doctors ago I mean this is very powerful it's urgent if you wait again I support marijuana but imagine walking to a liquor store and the guy working at the counter oh my god this this whiskey if you've got a headache this was awesome and oh my god we got this new whiskey for babies telling pregnant women not to drink because we know that it has it has a negative effect on the fetus I think we can say the same thing about marijuana so and I will add that we've had numerous doctors who specialized in the use of marijuana to treat medical conditions on the show who have a an immense amount of respect for if you're going to use marijuana

make cannabis infused cocoa butter [Music] cocoa butter is a pale yellow edible vegetable fat it's extracted from the cocoa bean and is used to make chocolate as well as many ointments toiletries and pharmaceuticals cocoa butter has a natural chocolatey flavor and aroma and also has a high saturated fat content making it a good vehicle for infusing cannabis in order to do this we're going to need about a 1/2 ounce of dried cannabis - a 1 pound or 16 ounces of food grade cocoa butter and optionally you need 1 teaspoon of soy lecithin powder and to do this year we're going to be using an oven - decarboxylate err cannabis and a double boiler setup to do the infusion you could also use an infusion machine like the mighty fast herbal and fuser and you can save $30 on the mighty fast herbal infuser with a co roughhouse at the herbal infuser calm but to thank them for sponsoring this episode the first step is going to be to grind and decarboxylate our cannabis so what I'm doing now is I've weighed out 1/2 pounds of cannabis and I'm grinding it go make sure I pull out any big stems and any seeds that I may have once I have it all ground up I also want to put this into a dish where I can spread it out evenly so I'm using this large glass there's just so we can see it in the video but whatever big dish you have you can spread it out nice and even so it'll cook even we're gonna put that in the oven preheated at 250 degrees Fahrenheit we're gonna let that D card for 25 minutes [Music] now when you're making cannabis infused cocoa butter you want to make sure that you're using food grade cocoa butter there's other cocoa butters that you could get that aren't necessarily designed for you to eat it might be used to make our hair products or something like that or candles so make sure that you're getting food grade and I'll put links to where you can get that on Amazon okay and we're going to be putting our 1 pound of cocoa butter into a double boiler that's got boiling water underneath it and we're gonna let that melt let's go take a few minutes to melt but I should take about the same amount of time as it took to decarboxylate our cannabis so by the time that 25 minutes is gone by you're also going to have your cocoa butter nice and melted nice and hot so it's that point cannabis is out and we're going to be able to add that into our cocoa butter and this is much like infusing butter or infusing any other kind of oil such as olive oil or coconut oil which we've done before and so it's going to be a very similar process we're going to be letting this infuse for one to two hours [Music] notice I'm letting that infuse without a lid on it and I'm doing that because I don't want the condensation to build up and let any water drip through so you want to avoid letting any water comment on contact with this especially if you're making chocolate but once we have our infusion down we're going to filter that out now filter the plant material out and you can do that with cheesecloth or a cotton muslin bag or a filtration bag if you're using the mighty fast turbulent fuser you'll have that HEPA filtration bag that's included with that we're using a fine mesh filter which works perfect you see we were done there our cocoa butter is now a much darker colored and has been infused with that cannabis has a lot of different flavor now and I've put that in the refrigerator for a little while so it'll harden up and you can see what it looks like but it hardens up very brittle like chocolate it'll have that snap to it and you can use this for a lot of different things you may notice at the bottom it looks like there's a puddle of brown stuff but that's a very very thin just a little color layer there of some very fine sediment that's filtered through and that's nothing to worry about and you could use like a vegetable peeler and just break that off if it bothered you very much but it really just is a very thin layer so I'm just chopping it up now so I could store it and you can store this for as long as you want in the refrigerator you can even freeze it until you're ready to use it and there's several different methods that you can use this for different cooking methods and you can also use it just as it is to moisturize some people may put it in their hair one popular thing to do with it is to make lotions or SAVs out of it and we're gonna be doing a recipe very soon you can see we've made a lotion out of it there so make sure that you subscribe to our Fi Studios because you'll see these recipes that we're making Whitney's coming up we're also making a white chocolate as you can see it's a very very good ingredient to make white chocolate is the main component of white chocolate in fact so make sure that you

month exploring a current trending article from the peer-reviewed literature. Scientific information isn\u2019t just for scientists-\nit\u2019s for everyone! It just requires a bit of a break down. [CHEERY INTRO MUSIC] For this month\u2019s De-Natured segment, we\u2019re\ngoing to look at an article released in August 2018 in the Journal of the American Medical\nAssociation Psychiatry. This month is all about plants, and in this\nmonth\u2019s Lesson Plan we began by mentioning that most organisms on Earth depend on plants\nto live. Not only do plants provide oxygen to the atmosphere,\nbut they serve as the energy starting point for many living food webs. But in the realm of human medicine, plants\nand their isolated compounds can yield much more than oxygen and food- especially in the\ncase of cannabis. In this paper entitled, \u201cEffect of Cannabidiol\non Medial Temporal, Midbrain, and Striatal Dysfunction in People at Clinical High Risk\nof Psychosis\u201d, the researchers report the results of a new clinical trial that investigated\nhow cannabidiol, or CBD, can affect individuals at high risk of psychosis. So here\u2019s what\u2019s already known. Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants- plants\nthat have been used by humans for thousands of years for a multitude of purposes. Two well-known varieties of plants in this\ngenus are commonly known as hemp and marijuana. Two chemical compounds have contributed to\nthe well-known nature of Cannabis plants. The first is cannabidiol, or CBD, and it\u2019s\nprimarily found in hemp. The second compound is tetrahydrocannabinol,\nor THC, and it\u2019s primarily found in marijuana. While both compounds have the exact same molecular\nformula, THC is psychoactive, meaning it can create a high, or euphoria. But what do cannabis plants have to do with\npsychiatry? That\u2019s where brain chemistry comes in. The reason our bodies react to CBD and THC\nat all has to do with the fact that human brains have an endocannabinoid system. Alterations in this system are associated\nwith the symptom of psychosis, which can be generally defined as a loss of contact with\nreality. While some research has shown that regular\ncannabis use can be a risk factor for developing psychosis, especially in teenagers, these\nfindings specifically refer to THC. The other compound, CBD, can actually have\nthe opposite effect. In fact, some clinical studies have shown\nthat CBD has antipsychotic properties for people with certain mental disorders. Despite a growing body of evidence that CBD\ncan be beneficial to those suffering psychotic symptoms, scientists have yet to figure out\nhow. To address this, the research team observed\nthe effects of CBD on three specific regions of the brain in people at clinical high risk\nof psychosis. The first of these regions is the medial temporal\nlobe, or MTL, and its primary function has to do with new learning. The other regions are the midbrain and striatum,\nwhich also contribute to learning in the form of helping to encode and update information\nin our memory. To observe the effect of CBD on the brain,\nthe team had participants perform something called the verbal paired associate learning\ntask, or VPA. Participants at clinical high risk of psychosis,\nreferred to as CHR, were recruited as well as healthy control participants who were not\nat CHR. For the purposes of this video, we\u2019ll refer\nto CHR participants as high risk participants to get away from being too bogged down in\ninitializations. In the study, high risk participants were randomly\nassigned to a CBD treatment or placebo treatment. After taking the assigned drug, participants\nperformed a VPA task while having their brain scanned using functional MRI. The healthy control group didn\u2019t receive\nany drug treatment, but they still did the tests and imaging. But what exactly did the VPA task entail? It actually has three separate testing conditions:\nencoding, recall, and baseline. During encoding, participants answered yes or no\nto whether a pair of words went well together. So for example, \u201csharks\u201d and \u201cawesome\u201d\n- definite yes! In the recall condition, participants were\nshown one of the words they saw during encoding and asked to say which word it had been paired\nwith. The baseline bit was a control of sorts where\nthe participant looked at a blank version of the setup they\u2019d seen during encoding\nand recall. The response of the brain during the VPA task\nwas measured using fMRI. Specifically, the scan measured the blood\noxygen level-dependent, or BOLD, response of the brain. Basically, this allowed the researchers to\nmeasure the flow and composition of blood in the brain during the encoding and recall\nparts of the VPA task. Then, they could compare these responses to\nthe baseline results. So what did they find? Overall, high risk participants who were assigned\na placebo had several regions of the brain activate differently than people in the control\ngroup. Similar to previous studies, these regions\nincluded the three thought to be associated with psychosis. The specific hypothesis the team was testing\nwas whether participants at high risk who were given CBD would have a level of brain\nactivation in between the activation levels of the control group, and the high risk group\nwho were given placebo. The team did find this middle ground activation\nin the striatum during encoding, and in the parahippocampal cortex and midbrain during\nrecall. These results suggest that for these specific\nbrain regions, CBD may help normalize brain responses in individuals at clinical high\nrisk of psychosis. This article was published in the one of the\nmost prestigious families of medical journals. In addition to academic circles, the results\nhave made headlines in the news as well. Here are some reasons why I think this study\nis capturing both scientists and citizens. First of all, the results are directly relevant\nto helping humans. Unlike some other articles that we\u2019ve discussed\non De-Natured, this study has a direct human end use, and an important one. Mental health disorders affect people in every\nwalk of life, and in the case of psychosis, as many as 3 in 100 people in the U.S. will\nexperience the symptom of psychosis at some point in their lives. Another reason I think this study made the\ncut is because the research team was the first to do something. In this case, they are the first to give evidence\nof how CBD acts in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms. This is a major level up from just knowing\nthat CBD can reduce these symptoms. And of course, whenever there\u2019s a promising\ndiscovery in the medical field, there\u2019s the potential for profit. There is a growing body of literature supporting\nthe use of CBD for medicinal purposes. And that means major money for those involved\nin supplying the product. In the United States alone, hemp-derived CBD\nis predicted to soon become a billion dollar market, and that\u2019s without federal legalization. There is undoubtedly a lot to gain from using\nthis particular plant product for medical treatments, and money is certainly part of\nthat gain. The devil is in the methods section when it\ncomes to issues in experimental design. However, this research team did a great job\nof removing potentially confounding variables and removing bias where possible. For example, the study design was parallel-group,\ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized. Randomization allows the researchers to remove\nthe bias that comes from assigning specific people to specific treatments. It\u2019s picking names out of a hat instead of, say,\nbecause you like their asymmetrical haircut. Double blind trials are ones where the participant\nand the researcher aren\u2019t in on who was assigned which treatment. That way, the researchers are less likely\nto be looking for certain associations. If a researcher knew a participant had been\ngiven the CBD, they might start looking for some kind of result, or jump to conclusions\nunintentionally. We just can\u2019t help ourselves when it comes\nto investigating things- it\u2019s impossible to not start explaining what we see, and double-blinding\na trial is a great way to avoid that. What about the \u201cparallel groups\u201d bit of\nthe research design? This piece is actually more of a limitation\nof the study. In parallel group studies, each participant\nonly receives one of the treatments, and then those people are compared to separate individuals\nwho received the other treatment. In this study, this meant that the high risk\nparticipants either received the CBD or the placebo, but none of them were actually observed\nunder the effects of both. With a non-crossover design, the baseline\nis a bit iffy. I mean, just think about how different we\nall are when it comes to chemical reactions! Take alcohol, for example. Comparing you sober to a friend who\u2019s had\na bit to drink might be a completely different story than if you reversed the roles. Luckily, the researchers do an awesome job\nof pointing out limitations like this in the discussion section of the paper. They mention the issue of the parallel design\nstructure, and suggest that a study be done where each high risk participant be tested\nwith both the placebo and CBD treatment. That said, they mention that the two high\nrisk groups were reasonably similar in terms of demographics and baseline health measures. This does, however, lead me to another critique\nof the study, and that is the sample pool of participants. One potential problem area has to do with\nsample size. There were 15 high risk participants assigned\nCBD, 16 high risk participants assigned the placebo, and 19 age matched healthy controls. While these numbers do allow for testing statistical\nsignificance at the cutoff levels the team was interested in, more is almost always better\nwhen it comes to determining the strength of an effect. There\u2019s also the issue of diversity. In the table showing sociodemographic measures,\nthe paper only reports age, sex, and education level. However, there\u2019s no mention of variables\nlike race and ethnicity, meaning that this could be yet another psychiatry study done\non a Caucasian sample. Conducting research on participants of varied\nbackgrounds is essential to understanding the full picture of drug-brain interactions. Here\u2019s the thing. Humans and non-human animals have been using\nplants for medicinal purposes throughout the history of their time on Earth. Understanding how the chemicals in certain\nplants can affect our brains is a really complicated area of research, and a study like this one\nis just a single piece of that journey. As the research team put it themselves, this\nwasn\u2019t so much of a clinical study as it was a proof of concept, pilot study. It\u2019s exciting to imagine what we might find\nnext when it comes to this amazing kingdom of life on Earth. Thanks for watching this episode of De-Natured\nhere on Nature League.

"I was interested in chemistry from a young age when I was in fifth grade I wrote down that I wanted to work on epileptic cures and work on research for disabled children when we were seniors in high school the teachers sent it back to us and it was kind of neat to see that I was going on to be a research scientist making the tools that doctors can provide to patients I was introduced to cannabis as my brother was working at a construction company and was asked to build a dispensary and through that effort became more aware of the whole community went out into the public and started talking to some of the individual patients and I myself had my own medicinal need so I was curious how much could this be effective for me which types of medicines might be best THC and CBD are both used across medicinal use and adult use THC is rather psychoactive where CBD is not really early you can see research that suggests CBD might be very helpful when you go talk to a lot of the dispensaries they're not really aware of what CBD or a non psychoactive use of cannabis might be like what if a lab was present and could tell them how do we really start to put medicine into medicinal cannabis when we first started that was the first question was why would you ever touch that stuff well when you look at it in a different fashion when you understand that it could be very beneficial in therapeutic uses helping you know epileptic children or other individuals who might be ailing or helping people reduce their opioid use you can look at cannabis in a much broader fashion than just THC rates patient here in Southern California I was really concerned about HIV meds that promotes cancer on the long term side effects I started having tumors in my head my ears my temple CBD it erupted cancer drove so I started making tinctures for myself the picture is a liquid form of cannabis I notice my autoimmune system was really starting to kick down though I'm really fine and life's good I rely a lot on the lavatories reports I want to make sure that it does not have any a mold or mildew and safe for people to just the predominant amount of work that happens here is analytical chemistry so what molecules are present in which products I can figure out how to say this type of cannabis product is going to be best for this consumer I really have a winning solution lawmakers have established the laws now the regulator has to establish the rules and details of those laws so they're really leaning on laboratories in their experience to say hey scientists that are out there that have thought about these problems what do we need to know as a regulator so that we can get these rules set up in the right fashion we have to educate through research and scientific understanding these professional associations such as the American Chemical Society have message boards they have networking event and they're all geared towards bringing these people together who have been largely isolated in the past through the cannabis chemistry subdivision we're seeking to validate the good works that people are doing and provide additional collaboration opportunities and ways for people to explore this expanding space the world is very bright for chemists to get engaged inside of cannabis and really take a fresh look at it and say how do we harness this natural resource that we could use in different types of ways to improve society and the world around us [Music]", "XPyiJLSa2u8": "today we got a little gift from our sponsors raise is that I wish but how dope would that be to

viewing this later as a recording we are so happy to have you with us my name is naomi hoffer i'm the program manager for the sherry servado berson brain cancer survivorship program and with us also in the background here as part of our program is alexa greenstein who is our survivorship nurse practitioner and mary des tree who is our marin expansion program liaison who's expanding our supportive care services for survivors and caregivers to our marin patient and caregiver community this webinar is part of our regular living well after brain cancer treatment webinar series which is part of our growing survivorship program thanks to a generous donation from cherie cebrato brisson i know many of you many survivors are interested in medicinal cannabis and have heard a lot about it but there's a lot of questions so what do we know and what don't we know we're going to talk about that today with our experts so first of all we're going to be talking a little bit about the history and overview what is cannabis and what are the components what are the therapeutic uses what do we know that it's used for and what it might be beneficial for we're also going to hear about the research and current findings that we know exist right now what do we know about this and um then turn around what this means for you as you're considering using this for your own therapeutic uses so after we hear uh from our panelists we're gonna have some time at the end for q a and we invite you to submit your questions using the q a box and then we're going to have an after the show segments where we will hear from survivors and hear how those who are using it for brain tumor recovery and management of side effects how it's going for them and we'll have a chance to hear from you as well and hear your questions so i feel very privileged and honored to introduce two speakers with us today who are very well versed in this subject matter dr donald abrams is the immediate past chief of the hematology oncology division at san francisco general hospital and professor of clinical medicine at ucsf he has an integrative oncology consultation practice at the ucsf center for integrative medicine the osher center for integrative medicine and we are pleased to have him also as part of our regular survivorship programming at the ucsf brain tumor center alongside his expertise in cancer nutrition and botanicals dr abrams has a long history of interest and involvement in clinical research that evaluates medicinal marijuana on various patient populations he co-authored the chapter on cannabinoids in cancer in the oxford university press integrative oncology text that he co-edited with dr andrew weil he co-edits the national cancer institute's cannabinoids and cancer website and he was also a member of the national academies of sciences committee that published the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids current state of evidence and recommendations for research published in january 2017. we're really honored to have him with us today and we also have dr eduardo rodriguez dr rodriguez is a glioblastoma or gbm clinical trial data scientist in the brain tumor center at ucsf he is a trained physician who graduated from national polytechnic institute in mexico city and also holds a master's degree in clinical research from ucsf dr rodriguez currently serves as co-principal investigator in the study on the impact of cannabis on the quality of life in patients with central nervous system tumors we are truly grateful to have him here as well to share his latest research with us we'll first hear from dr abrams and then from dr rodriguez and then back again to dr abrams but dr abrams thank you so much for being here and i will now turn it over to you thank you naomi it's a pleasure to be here so as mentioned i am going to start out by giving you a little bit of background on what cannabis is what cannabis isn't what we know about it and how long we've known what we've known so yes so this is my topic uh what do we really know i want to start out by reviewing a little bit the history of cannabis and what it may be useful for so this is the so-called siberian ice princess it's a mummy that was very well preserved in the ice in siberia she was so well preserved that her tattoos are actually being copied i understand by some millennials but in any event she turns out to be under an mri scan a woman in her mid-20s who appears to have breast cancer that spread to her bones and around her waist was a belt that had a pouch at the end of it and in the pouch were the flowers of the female plant of cannabis sativa suggesting that this woman dated about 2700 years ago knew about the potential medicinal benefits of cannabis it's postulated by the anthropologists or archaeologists or whoever makes these hypotheses that perhaps she was using cannabis to treat the symptoms of her cancer if not perhaps even the cancer itself and again i think that's a bit of a leap because we don't know that everybody in this tribe wasn't buried with cannabis around their ways so cannabis has been a medicine probably for the last 3000 years it's one of the oldest known psychoactive plants cannabis sativa or cannabis indica its reported first use again was 3 000 years ago in china south of mongolia made its way along the silk route to the indian subcontinent and then further west into the arab world where it was widely used as medicine cannabis was brought to the west by w.b o'shaughnessy who was a british east indie surgeon who was working in india and saw all the potential benefits of cannabis and brought it to the united kingdom at that time it had many uses supposedly as a pain reliever a relaxing agent anti-inflammatory against muscle spasms and also for seizures at the beginning of the last century in the united states most of the forerunners of what we recognize today as big pharma had cannabis products available for physicians to prescribe to their patients cannabis actually fell out of favor uh in 1937 with the introduction of the marijuana tax act where the mexican word for the drug was used to sort of fool physicians the act was introduced by a prohibitionist who felt that widespread use of cannabis by african-american jazz musicians and mexican migrant workers was going to lead to increased crime and mental illness in the united states so ultimately cannabis was removed from the united states formulary we know that cannabis is potent because of chemicals called cannabinoids which are present in the plant we believe that there are at least 400 different chemical compounds and of those about 140 are these structures that resemble delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol which is actually the main psychoactive agent in the plant delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has been studied in israeli children with cancer and felt to be an effective anti-nausea medicine for children getting chemotherapy and then all of us are quite familiar now with cannabidiol or cbd which again is a related compound to the delta nine thc again in addition to those three cannabinoids there are at least 100 others and there are other compounds in the plant itself that have medicinal benefit so again some of the non-tetrahydrocannabinol cannabinoids are cbd which i'm going to talk more about cbn which is a breakdown product actually of delta 9 thc and many people who use old cannabis which is rich in cbn says say it's very useful for sleep cannabinogirol or cbg is another non-psychoactive cannabinoid similar to cbd which they say is going to be the next cbd as yet it has not been studied in clinical trials but people are trying to grow plants that have more cbg than current uh strains do i think a very interesting cannabinoid is tetrahydrocannabiurine or thcv which apparently decreases appetite decreases appetite for food for alcohol uh tobacco and also for opiates so this is uh if we're going to go about developing individual cannabinoids as medical treatments this one is one that we might hear more about in the future and in addition to the uh cannabinoids there are also flavonoids and terpenes which give the different strains their characteristic smells and it's felt that all of these work together in the plant to sort of balance the effects of the delta 9 thc which again is the main psychoactive component so it's sort of like the other compounds provide the yin and the yang or the yin to the thc's young if you will so they help increase and augment the beneficial effects of thc and perhaps decrease some of the adverse effects so since cannabis was removed from our formulary we haven't learned a lot about what it does therapeutically because it's very difficult to study since it's a schedule one compound which means that it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use according to our federal government but over the past 70 years since cannabis has been prohibited we've learned a lot about how it works basically all of us have two different types of receptors for those cannabinoids the cb1 receptor is one of the most densely populated receptors in the human brain unfortunately we don't learn about that in medical school that shows you the extent of reefer madness the cdb1 receptor is distributed widely throughout the whole body and this receptor is found in all animal species down through sea squirts the cb2 receptor is was originally not felt to be in the brain but subsequently has been identified but not at the great density of the cb1 receptor the cb2 receptor was initially found in cells of the immune system in the spleen and in the peripheral blood in the natural killer cells and the b lymphocytes suggesting that this receptor has something to do with immunity so why do we in all animal species down through sea squirts have cannabinoid receptors you've never seen a monkey smoking a joint well similar to our own endorphins our own endogenous opiates that we make we also make endocannabinoids we make our own cannabinoids chemicals similar to thc and the other cannabinoid compounds the first was identified by my friend and colleague rafael machulim at hebrew university in jerusalem felt to be the father of cannabinoid chemistry and he named it anandamide after the sanskrit word for bliss subsequently another endocannabinoid to arachnodonyl glycerol has also been identified so why do we and all animal species have this system of cannabinoid receptors and our own endogenous cannabinoids the endogenous cannabinoids are synthesized on demand and when they complex with the cb1 receptor they cause changes in the cells particularly the cb1 in the brain cell which lead to changes in our appetite in control of immune function muscles and pain in our thinking in our nausea etc and when these endocannabinoids complex with the so-called cb2 receptor they're also involved in alterations in our immune function in cell proliferation cells dividing inflammation and also pain i think michael pollan says it best michael is a berkeley journalist who wrote the book the botany of desire and he has a whole chapter on cannabis and he says the reason that we in all animal species have these receptors and endocannabinoids is to help us to forget and in his next book the omnivore's dilemma michael is trying to gather his own food and in each chapter it's about gathering food and in one chapter he's sitting in the woods holding a rifle on his shoulder holding very still actually crouched in the woods and he said this is painful and out of the blue he postulates that the reason that we in all animal species dependent on praying pr e for our food have this system is to help us to forget pain so with that in mind the activities of both thc and cbd for example do both share analgesic or pain relief as their main probably activity thc unlike cbd is psychoactive the cbd is felt not to be psychoactive but it is anti-psychotic for people who have those sorts of illnesses and it also decreases anxiety so i think it really depends on what we mean by psychoactive it's obviously acting in the brain it just doesn't get you high and we live in a society a puritan derived judeo-christian base that thinks that being high is something that's not something we should strive for and that's something that's a whole other discussion so you know cbd has sort of catapulted to the top of the most favored cannabinoid list because it doesn't get you high but it i think it is psychoactive and we know that again as michael pollan predicted that in states where cannabis is licensed and available for patients there has been a marked decrease in prescription of pain medications anxiety is also anxiety medications have also been released it was mentioned that i was on the committee at the national academies of science engineering and medicine that reviewed 10 000 articles on the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids and these are some of the conclusions that we came up with as far as what it's most beneficial for the largest body of evidence is really in patients receiving chemotherapy that connect cannabis and cannabinoids particularly are licensed and approved to decrease nausea and vomiting we all appreciate that cannabis can increase appetite and again it seems to be very useful in patients who have chronic pain particularly most of the clinical trials have looked at patients who have neuropathy or pain generated from damaged nerves and cannabis in this situation seems to be much more effective than placebo and probably as effective as the currently prescribed gabapentin or neurontin i see many patients in my practice who really enjoy cannabis sometimes just cbd sometimes thcs sometimes both as a treatment for their insomnia saying that it definitely helps them to sleep and then the question of whether depression and anxiety are relieved i guess can be uh answered a little bit by the graph on the right showing that prescriptions for anxiety medications are markedly decreased in states where cannabis is available depression less so but definitely decrease so cbd again has gone from being an unknown cannabinoid to being uh the most favored and i attribute that to my friend and colleague sanjay gupta who did his first special uh weed in uh 2013. and in that show he showed charlotte figgy a young girl recently deceased who had refractory childhood seizure disorder go from a child that couldn't do anything because she was constantly seizing to the happy smiling girl on the right just after taking a drop of a cbd oil under her tongue and this ultimately led to gw pharmaceuticals developing the drug epidiolex which is now licensed and approved as a cbd treatment for children with this disorder prior to the large studies of epidialex there were really very few clinical trials on the use of cbd in humans most of the information that we had to rely on came from test tube and animal studies very few clinical trials of cbd existed but the in vitro and animal studies do suggest potential therapeutic applications we actually did a clinical a survey of patients at three integrative medicine centers in san francisco chicago and san diego as well as clients in 10 dispensaries in those cities asking people using cbd dominant products what they are using it for and as you can see here 50 reported pain is their main symptom that they used it for but fully 63 or two-thirds were using cbd for pain relief again 44 for anxiety a third for insomnia and 20 for depression and that's cbd dominant we also asked how effective this was and people rated it in all of these situations eight out of ten as far as being quite effective again this is not a placebo control trial but this is the sort of information that we need to provide us with sort of avenues to determine what we should study next personally however i think cbd is a bit over the top it's now a 23 billion dollar industry and at the farmers market at the ferry building we were surprised to see a cbd sunday for sale that was sold out and now there's cbd infused clothing that claims to prevent soreness before it starts and then last week or a few weeks ago stress zoo elephants are being given cbd oil to help them chill out and stop fighting i'd love to know if that worked or not so i am going to turn the session over now to my colleague who is going to talk about what we know about research in cannabis in brain tumor patients particularly thank you so much dr abrams we will hear again from dr abrams and invite him back and now i'm going to invite dr rodriguez to come up and as dr abram said to talk more about the the research being done currently with brain tumor patients at ucsf dr rodriguez are you here yes hello naomi hi i cannot turn and turn on my video it's been disabled right now um well thank you very much for an invitation and i would like to thank to all the participants for their interest in this this talk um and i think thank you to dr abrams for that good introduction on what's the overview of cannabis so now what i would like to address is what is uh naomi can you tell me if you're seeing my slides please yes we see it yes perfect um i would like to address what is being done in the realm of uh specifically neuron ecology with cannabis as dr abrams mentioned the research really in humans is being poor to say the least because of many hurdles and i think it's mainly because of all the legal aspects of it so i'm going to reiterate a little bit of what dr abrams already said so the potential uses for cannabis to treat nausea and vomiting induced by chemo radiation uh to help increase the appetite and therefore the weight in our patients when they are undergoing chemo radiation and cannabis moderately improved chronic pain and the only kind of not likely to have a role in depression is cbd uh although this is debatable because this all has been done only in um animal experiments and as we probably know too uh measured depression is a little bit tricky as well and uh like dr abrams mentioned most of the patients that report using cannabis say that it improves their sleep quality so medical cannabis as an anti-cancer the first article that was released let's say was in 1974 which actually was on a press release by the washington post where they claimed that marijuana psychoactive component thc slowed the growth of lung cancer breast cancer and virus-induced leukemia in laboratory mice and prolong their lives by as much as 36 percent i think this is um unique in the sense that it was uh first published on a paper rather than in a scientific journal and then afterwards the the scientific paper came out in 1975 and this is uh kind of like a screenshot of an enhanced image of course it's not the original uh image of both of those articles however it got the attention of the federal government and it was when when it got investigated and then it was put under schedule one by the dea which again it poses many legal hurdles uh since then uh there are there have been many efforts to try to prove that it's actually an anti-cancer agent but again most of the efforts have been done in animals and cells and much of the research has been done in thc because of the mechanism of thc is well known and cbd as well and information on the beneficial effects of non-psychotropic cannabinoids is right for in vitro and animal studies like i already explained and specifically to address the brain tumor realm is tricky because um most of the studies or most of the drugs are being developed to try to use as therapies to be effective in vitro or in animal models in rats or mice or monkeys but then when that is translated to humans it doesn't always work so that's definitely a place where we need to improve the the research that we are doing um on this realm in the brain tumor space cbd has shown remarkable results in vitro uh like dr abrams mentioned uh this this was first shown by uh the israeli group um but the mechanism unfortunately for which it prevents tumor growth is not fully understood there are many theories on why they do it uh some of them are they say because it depletes uh oxygen to the to the tumor cells and that that's a feasible uh mechanism but it's not proven um yet and there are very few clinical studies on cannabis and cannabidiol like i we already explained uh however uh all the in vitro and in vivo and animal studies suggests a potential therapeutic applications so what's the evidence in humans that we have so far where i have a few examples here and this is this was actually recently published on a systematic review that we that we did so we did an exhaustive review of the literature and we pulled some of the uh articles that we thought they were the most not only the most interesting but the the ones that add to the literature and in this topic so in 2006 in spain uh this is also a friend of dr abrams manuel guzman um conducted a pilot clinical trial study of thc in patients with recurrent glioblastoma and what he did was inject thc at different concentrations and different schedules in nine patients um unfortunately what this showed was um that it didn't even help so can you see my pointer uh naomi yes we can perfect so so these arrows this is just what i i just want to go over this really quick uh these are the mris of the patients and this curve what it shows is the growth of the tumor in in centimeters and cubic centimeters and the arrows is when uh thc was administered so as we can see actually didn't stop it uh same for here and this is this was uh patients who needed a resection so this drop that we see in in the tumor is uh the resection and then this is after resection so it actually didn't help however it was a small sample and of nine patients only and um and some of the measurements and some of the uh how it was applied it can be debatable but it was it's a step in the right direction uh in 2017 in england uh dr susan short conducted a two-part safety and exploratory efficacy study uh and what i like about what we like about this study is that it was randomized uh if people are not familiarized with this is when people are assigned assigned randomly to a specific treatment or placebo in this case so it was assigned to thc and cbd on a ratio one to one that means that it has equal parts thc and cbd and or to the placebo which was i think really while while there were undergoing uh those intense hemosolomide treatment in patients with recurrent glucose stoma um so the first part it was only six patients and it was just to to try to see if it was safe and it was well tolerated by patients and they determined that it was so they moved on to the second part where 12 patients were assigned to to cbd and nine cbd and thc and nine patients were assigned to placebo uh in this case they were it was actually demonstrated that it was safe and it showed good results for survival um in this case it is one of the best studies i think um the only issue is that is a small sample and it cannot be generalized to everybody as you can as you can imagine uh the results of 12 patients can be generalized to millions of people so that that's the caveat in this study but it's a again it's a study a step in the right direction and i think that this is um setting the basis for further research and then uh on one of the society for neuroecology meetings uh dr nicholas blunden published this poster the developing role of complementary cannabis therapy and glioblastoma treatment and uh he at the university of jail he administered oil concentrate of at least 50 milligrams of cannabinoid per day uh for at least one month plus uh standard of care treatments this means radiation or chemotherapy so but it was just voluntaries uh it was not directed to specific patients so it was to whoever wanted to participate in the study so 23 patients were registered and 15 of those 23 were using cannabis so they observed good results compared to low use or no use of cannabis meaning they improved their symptoms and they improved their their more tumor improved or got stable but the issue uh and i wanted to to remark really these words it was at least 50 milligrams and at least one month this means that it was not the same concentration for everybody and it was not the same time for everybody that they were using so again uh it's a step in the right direction but it's not necessarily the best way we can not generalize with this type of results and then in 2004 on the on the opposite side of the coin let's say as you probably know there are other efforts that have been trying to show the hasterts of consuming cannabis and i i like this paper as a good example on how some evidence can be misleading so in in this paper what they did it was a retrospective which means they went back to the electronic medical records of patients over time of a large amount of people but it was 130 000 patients from kaiser uh who filled out the questionnaire from 1977 to 1985. what i think is interesting here is that it was very close to that initial paper that was released in 1975 so so maybe the people people actually didn't answer sincerely because of fear of being stigmatized by either the government or their other members of society but they were at least 25 years old and patients were followed for 21 years retrospectively they were not actually followed they were not calling them in real time for 21 years and he identified 19 000 20 000 to round up people who use cannabis at least once the issue with this is that he categorized all these patients as cannabis users and that's problematic because if you used only once let's say that these are uh recent grads or even grad students level or on in the age range they could have been trying just for fun and he categorized them as them using cannabis he found that nine patients who ever use cannabis at least once per month develop glioma so again this is problematic because out of the 130 000 patients that we started he derived conclusions out of nine patients so um we need to put in context uh not only from the research point of view but also in time what's happening in society at that point and what's the age of the group so i will take these results with a grain of salt and now so after we pulled all that information uh dr nicholas wutowski who you may or may not know and see in the clinic uh he's a neuro-ecologist and he's a director of clinical research in in our department he observed that a good proportion of his patients were using cannabis for some kind of issue for sleeping for anxiety and they were saying that they were feeling better however in science and in medicine we cannot just say because my neighbor told me that this works i'm going to prescribe it we need evidence so we decided to do a observational study observational means we are not doing any interventions we are not giving cannabis to anybody we are just surveying where we are asking people how they use it and this is because of the legal barriers mainly uh the federal legal barriers so so and and we want to see how cannabis is actually impacting the quality of life of our patients over time so we decided to use uh quality of life because that's our main goal is to improve quality of lives of our patients um and we want to see if there's any differences between people who use cannabis in real time versus those who don't use cannabis in real time so what we are doing is we are enrolling patients we ask them a series of questions and then we every three months we ask them the same questions slightly different but essentially it's the same idea to try to see what how they are feeling and for one year uh i understand that this is not the the best the ideal will be to following them until they they get better or until they don't want to keep participating anymore however we have certain time constrictions so so we follow them for one year and then we try to analyze uh what's happening with quality of life so therefore all patients can participate in this study we have people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis and both are equally helpful for our study because we need we need to see if it's working and we need to see uh we need a comparator group so this is uh and what we have found so far um uh today we have enrolled 81 patients in our study out of 216 we are aiming for that for that number 200 people is fairly balanced we have 50 50 males and 31 females and they have various degrees of using cannabis i think it's interesting that the the females that decided to participate are the most balanced so it's almost 50 50 split which is great for for results and for us to be able to drive conclusions and then generalize those and um these are the main reasons why people are using cannabis in our clinic this is not that they are being prescribed is mostly uh why what's the symptom that they or the the reason why people think that is helping them so we have the the majority of people is actually using it to relieve any kind of symptoms and i'm going to go over that shortly uh some people think that is use is is helping them for the tumor treatment and of course we have the recreational users which is totally fine and then we have other other symptoms and in other symptoms we include include sleep aid and anxiety relief we understand that this is a disease that can create anxiety in people and this is definitely a an important point to make so these are the specific symptoms why people are using um cannabis which um they're similar to what dr abrams showed us before uh on the survey on cbd and the dispensaries uh is slightly different and we have here that the majority of our population is using it for because they don't feel hungry because of anorexia and they are trying to improve their appetite and their their weight for anxiety for depression in other we said we are including here um other symptoms that are not don't fit in any of these categories for migraine and for sleep aid and the rest of them are um i don't i don't want to discard them just out of hand but i think these are the more important ones and interestingly enough pain relief is actually not one of the main reasons why people use cannabis in our clinic again this is self-reported this is people are using cannabis uh because they think that is helping them with this kind of symptoms one of the interesting questions that uh is pushing for this uh research study is that when we ask people before using cannabis how they felt and this is on a scale from one to six and six is the worst they have ever failed and one is the best status let's say that they can feel uh before using cannabis they report a four a score of four which is fairly high and after using cannabis it shrinks down to to 50 to two so almost normal uh again this is self report and i know this is subject to some things that we call bias and and this is for recall by us because we are just asking if you remember where how you felt before using cannabis please let us know how you felt so there may be some some biases there but i think this is this is still really interesting and it's a good motivator for us to try to explore more of what's happening here again this is self-reported it's not actually what's happening so now um to measure quality of life we use a series of instruments we call it so surveys really that have been validated in large amounts of people and and we try to compare this right so the bars when the when the bars uh overlay that that means that it's not statistically significant but i think it's interesting to see how users people who use cannabis actually feel more fatty more nausea and more pain this is interesting because we will expect the opposite however this is how people start when when they they initially go into our study this is how they start so now the interesting thing will be to see if three months from now this this curve actually switch and the people who don't use goes here and and the people oh sorry the people that don't use goes up and the people that use cannabis goes down that will be an interesting flip to see uh we don't have enough data yet to show you those those data but um this is the this is how is the baseline of our patients and same for functional scales uh this this is actually the opposite the higher the score it is the better it is and the lower the score it is the worse it is so uh physical functioning role functioning emotional functioning and cognitive functioning uh all these are actually statistically significant and again this is how people enter into our study and what we aim in the following months or years is to to evaluate this data on on a time lapse basis so the conclusion and we think that uh this phenomenon also that we are seeing of how people using cannabis are actually doing worse it's not because of cannabis that they were doing worse is because they feel they have more symptoms and therefore they resort to cannabis so we need to prove this over time of course and we have we think this because 58 of our patients have a high grade glioma which is an aggressive glioma so and they are subject to feel more symptoms and this is why we think this is true however we need to complete enrollment to further evaluate cannabis over time and compare to non-users so the general conclusions here is that more formal studies like this one even if they are observational are needed but if they are controlled uh in a more controlled environment like placebo compared to placebo or compared to different concentrations of cannabis are needed to to prove that it's actually working it's also important to know that there are some interactions that we may or may not know because it hasn't been studied and it can be interfering with treatments and other medications that patients might be taking so we need to know more about this and we definitely need involvement of community physicians scientists lawmakers especially and other stateholders is needed of course in community patients are included because this is this is mainly driven for the benefit of our patients and we remember that what is observed if you come across with some paper or some press release that it claims that cannabis is helping for x or y reason uh if it's only been tested in test tubes or animals that doesn't necessarily mean that is going to work the same in humans and this is why we need more research in humans so having said that this is an invitation for everybody to join the study again we welcome both types of persons people who use cannabis and people who don't use cannabis they are equally important to our study to to come if you have any questions you can reach out to me or you can reach out to the general clinical research coordinator line and if you scan this qr code if you have an iphone or a newer android you can scan it and it will take you to this flyer and you can have that information thank you thank you so much dr rick rodriguez that's really uh great information and i feel like we need to kind of put a pin in this and invite you back when we get more of your study results so um thank you um mary has put in the chat box uh the contact information so you have it um i apologize for the clicking sound i don't know if that's gonna resolve itself because um dr rodriguez's mic but uh hopefully it'll resolve itself now so now we're going to turn it back over to dr abrams and really talk about what this might mean for you and some practical considerations thank you naomi uh really appreciated dr rodriguez's presentation and i i do want to note that many studies have uh found that same finding that the people that are using cannabis at the beginning uh have more symptoms and maybe that's why they turn to cannabis because they're not getting relief from their conventional therapies so what does all this mean let's put it together first of all often we're asked what is the best way for me to consume cannabis i see a lot of older women with cancer who go to the dispensary and they're told only eat a quarter of the cookie these are people that feel that inhalation is bad and eating is good so they eat a quarter of the cookie and nothing happens so they eat another quarter and nothing happens so they eat the whole cookie and then they call me three days later after perhaps a visit to the emergency room with a not very good feeling saying they're never going to do that again so they're describing the pharmacokinetics or what happens when we take thc by mouth it takes a very long time to reach a peak plasma concentration about two and a half hours and there's a delayed onset of activity which is why people say nothing's happened so they they consume more by mouth and then when you take the delta nine thc the main psychoactive ingredient by mouth when it goes through the liver on the so-called first pass metabolism the liver breaks the delta ix thc down into an even more psychoactive metabolite so that's why people get more zonk if you will when they eat edible products on the other hand if you inhale cannabis either via smoking or vaporizing not vaping i hate vaping that's the wrong word i'm sorry vaporizing then the effect is much more rapid the peak plasma concentration occurs in two and a half minutes and very rapidly declines over the next 30 minutes and since less of it goes through the liver than when you take it by mouth you create less of that 11 hydroxy more psychoactive metabolite so i tell patients if they would want better onset over better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect that inhalation is probably better than oral ingestion and when i say inhalation i mean vaporizing which means vaporizing the plant i've as an oncologist i've been quite concerned about this trend towards vaporizing an oil because i definitely know the long-term health effects of inhaling a vaporized or combusted plant but not an oil and i think that panned out to be a concern so i'm all in favor of vaporizing plant or even smoking in a bong or even cigarettes because i don't think the danger is very large we now have tinctures and oils and in fact even chewing gums and when you put these in your mouth you immediately absorb some from under the tongue and then except for the chewing gum you swallow the oil or the tincture so you get the sort of benefit of both inhalation and oral ingestion and i think more and more people are turning to these oils and tinctures people also in my practice have claimed that suppositories work who grows all the cannabis for the government research said that he doesn't think thc could be absorbed rectally but many of my patients make their own suppositories out of olive oil or coconut oil i forget and they say it definitely works and then there are topical products that patients often can use and get at a dispensary and find them very useful for local pain in arthritic joints or or muscle pain so there are many many different options for cannabis now again as an oncologist i am quite anti-sugar i think sugar is the worst thing that patients with cancer patients without cancer could consume so i am not a fan of the chocolate chip cookies that you see there i don't think edible cannabis products are ever medicine because of the sugar so as i said for better control over the onset the depth and the duration of the effect i feel inhalation is optimal it achieves the higher peak concentration and a shorter duration effect the slow onset of ingested cannabis may prompt one to overdose i mean you it's not like an overdose on an opiate you just feel uncomfortable and you need to get in a dark room and sort of lie down again the topical products uh probably have less systemic absorption uh and may have some benefits systemically but are probably best used locally so what are the potential side effects of cannabis well again particularly if people are not used to using it dizziness is possible especially if you stand up too quickly cannabis can increase the pulse rate and it can increase or decrease the blood pressure and that's why people who use cannabis and then stand up too quickly may experience dizziness dry mouth is common and again drowsiness is that a side effect or a desired effect i think for people who are looking for help with sleep it might be a good thing euphoria again there's that sort of being high is that a side effect or is that a desired effect uh you know i guess it's all not i have a beholder i certainly think that people who have a life-threatening disease are entitled to have some euphoria i think cannabis induced euphoria in my opinion is much healthier than the intoxicating effects of alcohol the blood pressure changes i mentioned red eyes headaches relaxed muscles and then there are some people uh who get paranoid uh increased anxious or depression and that's not good impaired memory is something that happens acutely but uh people who use cannabis chronically uh don't have any evidence of impaired learning or other cognitive issues on long-term follow-up tests we're often asked well what is the right dose and you know who knows what product people are talking about so it's highly individualized again everybody's cannabinoid receptors may be genetically different so some people smoke cannabis and they always get euphoric and some people smoke cannabis and get depressed and some people get paranoid and some people get no effect that could be set or setting it could be the cannabis that you have but it also could be the genetics of your cannabinoid receptors so giving a dose is difficult what we tell people this should be in quotes and have a s-i-c in parentheses after it because it's not grammatically correct but it rhymes so we like to say start low and go slow so start at the lowest possible dose and increase slowly to get to achieve the desired effect somebody asked the question 50 milligrams seems like a high dose while dr rodriguez was talking and i didn't catch whether that was thc which would be a high dose or cbd which in fact would not be a high dose because clinical trials of cbd have looked at up to 600 milligrams that's one thing about cbd people take from 10 to 600 milligrams that's a quite a wide range so again start low and go slowly but it's the mantra is go slow and then again you know talk to your doctor and see if they can help studies have shown that most physicians although they're in favor of medical cannabis don't really know enough about it to advise the patient so what i do is i tell the patients go to the dispensary tell the bud tender or the person behind the desk what it is you're trying to treat and ask them what might work another question that we get all the time is what is the right ratio of cbd to thc that i should take and again in animals cbd seems to reduce the psychotropic effects or the high if you will of thc when the ratio is eight to one or greater cbd increases the psychotropic effects of thc when the ratio is two to one or less so that's all in animals unfortunately and we don't really know that from humans and this little uh 18 to one eight to one four to one two to one one to one comes from care by design cbd which is a cbd uh company and this is what they uh postulate are the effects of the different ratios i tell my patients that the only ratio that's been studied in the medical literature is one to one and that is what the drug nabixamols is which is the drug that 12 patients got in the study that dr rodriguez described compared to the nine patients getting placebo so particularly for my patients with brain tumors who ask me what they should take i say well the medical literature right now supports a one-to-one ratio of cbd to thc so other safety concerns again older people people with cardiovascular disease coronary artery disease should be cautious i never say avoid really but should be cautious about use of cannabis and both thc and cbd interact with the system in the liver that breaks down prescription medications particularly cbd may cause a inhibition of that system so that prescription drugs are going to build up in the bloodstream and could become more toxic so that's why i'm often concerned about my patients who are taking these very highly concentrated oils of cbd or thc fearful that it may alter the dose of their prescribed medications leading to potential toxicity in our studies of the medical literature we really found that the only adverse effect in the lungs in people who smoke cannabis is increased uh cough and sputum consistent with chronic bronchitis we in fact did not see any evidence of increased lung cancer perhaps even some suggestion of decreased lung cancer and again people who have had bad experiences with cannabis excessively paranoid or depressed or too anxious should probably avoid it and then there's this rare condition that we're learning more and more about as more people use cannabis on a regular basis hyperemesis which means uh too much vomiting so you get repeated and severe bouts of vomiting uh in some patients it's a rather idiosyncratic reaction i would say because we think of cannabis as being an anti-nausea and vomiting medication but some people i guess because it's working in the brain on that center might get it triggered in the wrong direction and there are medications that people use to treat this some antipsychotic medications or many people say taking a warm shower is very helpful so do not drive if you're under the influence of cannabis is a recommendation that we're going to make but you know i'll tell you what studies are very unclear about what's happened in states where cannabis has become available recreationally whether or not there's increase in auto accidents is unclear and i think that people under the influence of cannabis actually are safer drivers than people under the influence of alcohol when this has been studied in laboratory conditions people under the influence of cannabis tend to drive more slowly and they weave a bit more but they stay within their lane this is quite different from alcohol when we looked at the adverse effect on newborns in women who used cannabis during pregnancy we did not see that many babies were born with a slightly lower birth weight but otherwise there were no long-term damaging effects but we're going to recommend that if you are pregnant you might want to avoid cannabis although many women who have prolonged morning sickness have found it very useful in the 60s and 70s and i think their children came out pretty normal so i just want to share a little bit about when you go to a dispensary you might be overwhelmed by the selection of products that are available so this is a menu from a dispensary that was online that i took a screenshot of you can see that the names people have done studies on these names and green dragon at this dispensary is not going to be necessarily the same plant as green dragon at that dispensary there's indoor and outdoor well why do they tell us the difference between indoor and outdoor well cannabis connoisseurs believe that you can really tell if something is grown outdoors in the sun and wind and rain or indoors under fluorescent lights and artificial fans and hydroponic water dripping or whatever so uh you know people feel that maybe indoor sometimes is a little more jangly as they say then they tell you if it's a sativa or indica and most of what you get in dispensaries are a blend of sativa indica it's unusual to get a pure product sativa in the folklore is felt to be up and mental whereas the indica is felt to be more down and physical so if you're having trouble sleeping you probably don't want a sativa if you're having trouble getting motivated you're not going to want an indica dominant blend and then this dispensary was just starting to look at cbd content the third one down has more cbd than thc the top two are the opposite and then they give you a little wine spectator one-liner a bright and cerebral sativa with euphoric overtones so you know we've come a long way in the cannabis world cannabis business i find a lot of patients that i see however are older a little confused they take a lot of different medications and they don't really want to go to a dispensary so a few years ago two pharmd's two pharmacists graduating from ucsf school of pharmacy came to me and said what would you think if we opened a dispensary and i said well that would be great so a year and a half later they came back and said you know what we found out it cost a million dollars down to open a dispensary so instead we started a concierge cannabis practice where we'll talk to patients and for a monthly fee we'll find out what meds they're taking what they want to treat and we'll send them as part of the monthly fee a tincture that we make up for them so many of my patients have benefited from talking to the folks at med1 specialty care their phone number is listed there in the spirit of full disclosure they want me to be more involved as a consultant and an advisor but we have at this point in time no financial relationship so i do offer this to people that are not cannabis sophisticated that might want to experiment with some cannabis products but aren't interested in going to a dispensary and being overwhelmed with all the selections that are available which certainly when i was growing up in the 60s was not a problem that we worried about so with that i'll thank you for your attention and hopefully we have time to answer some questions thank you so much dr abrams that's really wonderful information um dr rodriguez i'm going to invite you back up we do have questions uh that we had in the queue and please feel free to submit your questions using the q a function we do have about 10 minutes for questions so here's one of them i think i'm going to direct this to you dr abrams can you overdose if you consume too much cannabis again the uh overdosing usually means you know dying and and having your respirations turned off there are very few cannabinoid receptors in the brainstem which is where our respiratory center is so in fact there has never been a report of an overdose and it said that you would need to smoke 700 cigarettes in a very short time to overdose and that would be from carbon monoxide poisoning and not from cannabis poisoning thank you so much here's a question that came in um what are your thoughts on rso i don't know what that means but maybe you know yeah it's named after uh somebody who's currently on the lam this is a highly concentrated uh full cannabis extract oil that is being touted as being a cure for cancer and as dr rodriguez told us there is very little evidence in the medical literature that cannabis cures cancer i think if cannabis is going to have any benefit in any cancer it's going to be brain tumors because of the high concentration of the cannabinoid receptor in the brain but this oil and i'm not going to say the name of the man who is rs because i don't think he deserves that sort of publicity is something that's sold to patients and it's what i said i was concerned about highly concentrated oils being able to interact with people's other medications in a negative fashion so that those medications may become more toxic thank you so much um dr rodriguez this might be for you or for you as well dr abrams of email do you know if um medical cannabis is covered by insurance the answer is no no okay all right and for your study as well um eduardo it's there's no uh coverage as well they have to get it on their own and purchase it on their own as part of your study yeah but there's no cost for that it's just link surveys so there's no cost to be part of the study uh the only caveat that we have is that we we prefer people who are being treated at ucsf just because we also are pulling data from their medical records to to be a little bit more detailed on what information we get so if you come from outside of ucsf you will have to share those with us separately and that will that will be another layer but we can discuss if people are interested thank you so much um okay how do i know how many milligrams i'm getting if i'm smoking rather than using a tincture is there a measurement no no you don't know okay okay um and what sort of vaporizer would you suggest people buy any opinions on that well i mean we studied the so-called volcano vaporizer which is not a portable you know all of the studies that we've done have been done in the in-patient setting in the general clinical center research center at zuckerberg san francisco general the volcano is a table top centrifuge it looks like with a turkey basting bag was the original thing that you use to fill up by a heating element and a fan fills up this bed the company that makes the volcano stores in bickel has a number of uh hand-held portable vaporizers uh they are again much more intricate than a vape pen where you inhale oil um as i mentioned very concerned about inhaling oil into the lungs as a potential way to damage it so i would go for a portable vaporizer some people enjoy having their own volcano it's not cheap but it does deliver a vaporized cannabis which is probably associated with less harmful particulate matter than actually smoking a cigarette but a water pipe is also an acceptable way okay thank you so much and this is kind of a little bit of dovetailing on that what is the difference between vaporizing and vaping could you explain that again because you mentioned that in your i mean people people make use them synonymously but i think vaping has really come to be the term used for those little you know things where there's oil in one end and you inhale and it heats the oil and you're inhaling heated oil that is vaporizing an oil but that's become synonymous with vaping and oil vapor rising is heating to below the point of combustion the plant and inhaling that those vapors from the plant that hasn't been heated to the point where it's going to flame up and become ash but where it's just going to vaporize the active chemicals so i'm all in favor of vaporization but vaping has become a nickname for vaporization and i think it means something else okay thank you um in any of these studies how can you account for the possibility that people don't want to mention anything about their use of cannabis for example it's stigmatizing for their career um dr rodriguez do you want to address that first and then okay yeah uh fortunately this information that uh at least in the united states all the information that we collect is protected by hipaa so we do not disclose it and even if we share this information with others like we do in scientific meetings uh we do not disclose any any information that we call identifiers meaning dates of birth uh workplaces uh names uh even initials sometimes uh we change all those things to to be as anonymous as possible and um at least in our study of course this is study by study but in our study that information that is given to us does not go into the medical record so it's not subject to be reviewed by insurance or other third parties it just stays there for research purposes do you feel that that's the same for other studies as well they would protect that information uh in in our practice in our clinic yes um elsewhere i will i can speak for them okay thank you all right is there likely to be much political motivation either party democrats or republicans to remove cannabinoids from schedule one with dea federal government if not how is the cycle ever broken to do more research um rely on international studies anybody want to take that it's a very difficult question actually it involves many layers from my standpoint i think it's going to come down and probably dr abrams can say his own opinion is going to come down to how much money can people make unfortunately uh rather than how house impacting actually people's lives i don't know if there's i'm pretty sure there should be a partisan division there but i don't know if one side is more inclined to to move forward than the other well i think we'll just have to wait and see what comes up in the debates but uh my namesake the current has been the best president we've ever had on cannabis i have to say and it's because of what you said dr rodriguez he's a businessman and he appreciates that it's money and taxes and now pretty much every state has medical cannabis and even recreational cannabis and his opponent has always been an anti-drug person so i'm a little concerned okay thank you um there is a question about sugar use but i think i'm just we might table that um because that's a big discussion in and of itself and maybe we'll do another talk about sugar and cancer um so i'm going to read this question out this is one that that might be um difficult to answer because it's quite specific but dr abrams and dr rodriguez if you had an oligodendroglioma and it was 40 surgically resected would you go on a cbd thc regiment to hopefully resolve the remaining tumor so i'm just going to read a little bit more i do occasionally take um 90 to 90 10 ratio of cbd thc gummies in hopes that it will cure me i have no issues with my traditional cancer treatment side effects i only take these on hope to eliminate the remaining tumor so this is about tumor reduction any any thoughts about that for oligodendroglioma um yeah like we we uh stated before i think that um people need to be treated on a case-by-case basis uh these results that we are giving out on research is on the general level it's not an individual specific um but but like we mentioned we don't have uh the medical evidence to say that this will help in humans at least at least not not right now yeah i think that's the saddest thing i see in my practice or patients who are treating a potentially treatable sorry my dogs are being fed now people with a potentially treatable malignancy uh maybe not a brain tumor but who come to me having waited to see me for a number of months who now have a disease that can't be cured so i would say no you need to treat the remaining tissue the way dr rodriguez and his team would say to treat it and do not think that cbd or thc in any ratio will work thank you so much and i i think we're we'll have time for maybe just one quick question if you if you could um stay for one more uh why is thc associated with prop 65 label identified by the state of california to be a carcinogen to cause reproductive harm anybody want to take that one i think they have to say that about pretty much anything that they don't know enough about okay okay well i think that's all the time we have for questions from uh dr for dr abrams and dr rodriguez i want to thank you both so much for your time your expertise we really really appreciate it and um thank you again for for being here and thank you to all of you for joining us for this presentation it's wonderful to have you here we wish you well and hope to see you again in a

buddy is Daisy and for this special weed Wednesday we're talking which i think is an important subject yep so I decided to bring my favorite top school on the show and Daisy brought her Oh taco as well yeah what she made yeah yeah so for people who don't know topicals articles are cannabis infused creams lotions balms gels you know that bath salts that softens are you put it on your where you have the most pain so are this inflammation directly on that and headaches as well totally I have heard that topicals have helped with eczema yeah psoriasis and with anecdotal evidence from so many people thousands of people who can prove that this is actually a treatment that works for them and what's really cool though topicals is that you get that therapeutic cannabis relief without that cerebral hive non-intoxicating and so is generally teach seeing them yeah you know you don't get that like you'll get stone from getting its down exactly just let direct area that you put that topic along how it works is that the cannabinoids and turbines right on the surface your skin penetrates and it does bind to see bt receptors but it doesn't go into your bloodstream which i think is like what a lot of people are looking for in the middle of the day at work you know if you have a desk job yeah if you have adjust your neck kinko then in front of computer like this on it yeah just around all the time so like that it's yeah it's really lovely daisy has had lots of experience talk tool she actually has some fibromyalgia and it really does but we were talking about this earlier from and you're saying like the nine points that you get hit with and even like under the knee just left yeah so issue yeah so far grow I would say like probably eighty percent of my life is spent in some form of pain some days is really bad whatever yeah but chuckles that cannabis in general like really help with all of that right that's a great way to get some relief and I like about what topicals - thanks about I said 30 to 45 minutes to kick in Chris depending on what's in your topical as well so many different variations you can get so many different benefit like even these two are like me different like different ways of infusing the cannabis into them right so there's so many different ways that you know like maybe an olive oil is gonna get down deeper and also I know that like terpenes and stuff that are in those will actually help them penetrate deeper yeah yeah area filena you can find carry off I'll intervene and black pepper and cinnamon and terpenes really mesh well with the can her cannabinoids - entourage effect you really get that synergistic effect today I wanted to show off the one that I use I actually got this from the headquarters here in Victoria BC the ingredients in this is coconut oil peppermint spearmint leaf cloves which clothes are found in human dr. bean and that's an anti-inflammatory turkey yeah as well as the black pepper eukaryote filing that one's anti-inflammatory as well as an anti analgesic red seaweed in this wintergreen oil honey bees wax now I really like this one is every the peppermint and spearmint in it that cooling effect so if I want like a gnarly hike worked out really hard that day it's like that's exactly what you need a cold one see what other people talk opposed to is they're like you know they can be used for any purpose like we said they can be used like a casual height like the bengay or something yeah they can be used for like really serious like you know like series migraine pain yeah headaches okay you can actually just rub him directly where you're feeling pain that's where it's gonna penetrate and really I mean like I said I always have mine on me so it's like a co-worker's a thing complains but a headaches and I'm like no try some of this I do not have a deal yeah but but ya know people love it like people are always just amazed yeah people have that idea that you have to smoke or eat we to get that benefit of the pain relievers that yeah you have to kind of get that psychoactive high yeah thing is people you don't and I think that's like what a lot of people are looking for so if I personally like the psychoactive cerebral I yea recommended if you're not looking for that high but yeah tell me a bit about the one that you have here yeah all right this is from big temples actually sorry BC as well the super grade I used to work there on infection made this batch a little bit ago and yeah there's all kinds of stuff in this instead of the more typical way of infusing it we used cannabis leaf oil so it's like olive oil infused with cannabis which is cool that's got some vitamin E it's as mucolytics the eucalyptus also kind of has that cooling effect then you're gonna get peppermint and stuff like that it does have a little bit of peppermint wintergreen as well some lavender some cinnamon which as you said that and inflammatory Antion is what it's all about boom it is I think it uh when I found this out I just my mind was blown it's pretty actually I was little little terpene in it and that was like the calming more like you Florrick effect to it really strong instantly I smell cinnamon yeah the cinnamon is over that's what I smell yeah [Music] yeah and so like there is my bulletin to you but it's actually actually people at this that gives like cool that's cool I love that we brought two different ones kind of show people that there's something out there for everybody and like I said you don't gotta just get like the lotions or gels yeah bombs my friend sports the bomb around ya the bombs are really good too you know able to dry lips yeah anything like that it's kind of dry in here someone never tried any with olive oil let me try some like lotus flower it just has some lotus flower it smells so good here I'll put the lid back on but let me go on take them dude we have a lot of pain central kind of around this back of the neck area a little bit yeah awesome broken bones brains menstrual cramp oh yeah very good for mr. right is pain as well yeah this really yeah touches babes with all that direct pain [Music] and you found some anecdotal reports here we are crew yes and we both ground on two different types of tacos yes coconut oil bees yeah coconut oil pretty different textures as well but pretty much do anything yeah and we're gonna make one super lavender actually made a bunch of lovely stuff last year at some point and oh yeah oh yeah hmmm Ireland I wonder if every minute I pick out just recycling like tingly effect okay reminds me tiger balm no we've done but are you yeah I actually have my tiger balm ultra and I will mix it in some lines see with these topical is just to give that like extra spice you don't really cares a lot of people don't like that piercing of cool yeah somewhere everybody yeah yeah but my tiger balm ultra you can make your own that's the exciting part yeah of course you can buy some from this stores and stuff but don't be sure to go online I've seen and read a lot of amazing recipes and it's always gonna be natural and medicinal healthy for your body and things all Avoyelles lavender exactly really take it yeah just like they have yes up before you try your own just like our beautiful Daisy has and it like it's pretty [ __ ] up honestly once you get the basics down you can toss anything you want in it of course yeah but yeah anything you want you want like a jalapeno and I have jalapenos in there get some spray yeah actually like the cooling exactly you can I would like to know what kind of infused tacos you guys have done is there anything that you would recommend you think it's like it weird spice or weird ingredient that really you thought helped and more people should know let us know we're open to more ideas here yeah yeah a lot of Monday Mary Jane videos telling baby we actually did a really cool string called Nakayama which was made by my friend Angela Devine and it was a really good outdoor honestly yeah exactly I would love to have you on a prayer we'd review sometime and yeah those are always my favorite every Monday people and if you want to stay updated on all the different segments reviews that we have in store feel free to pause like us on graeme to subscribe the absolutely love that website every word of it yeah but it is an amazing platform for a Canada yeah and then you got you - oh the topical talk so I guess what we're getting at is go get yourself some topical if you're a bit iffy on em I swear it's only gonna benefit your life be a believer but it's also a pretty good way of getting someone into the cannabis industry a little bit like maybe a grandma who is someone that you know is probably still a little wary of something like this is a great you know if for them maybe Vegas cream for you Miami what was all the ingredients scratched up just and then later on when they rant about I wanna buy more than you're like see I told you you could have all the therapeutic effects and no hi that's what topicals are for and I'm really glad that today's episode was revolving all around that got spread the word and also I want to keep your interest but she go make it home so cannot wait to read your guys's ideas like different things to try things yeah me did you make some fun topicals yeah oh if you want to learn a little more of a beautiful Daisy here check out our Instagram bug dot lady Daisy yeah I get a kick out of course the one is later day today go check it out so thank you so much for tuning in everybody thanks for all the support we are the best buds smoking the best buds so go grab your best buds and go smoke some buds thank you coming on thank you for tuning in till next time",

isabelle tebow senior manager of community research and i manage nia survey research which generally aims to gather information from many individuals about the eczema patient experience so we can better understand how to improve the health and quality of life of those living with eczema we'd like to thank our 2020 webinar wednesday sponsor sanofi genzyme and regeneron whose unrestricted educational grant has made today's presentation possible our presenter today is peter leo md fellow of the american academy of dermatology dr leo is a clinical assistant professor of dermatology and pediatrics at northwestern university's feinberg school of medicine and the founding director of the chicago integrative eczema center his clinical practice is at medical dermatology associates associates of chicago dr leo is a member of nia's board of directors and nia scientific and medical advisory council and with that i am pleased to introduce our presenter dr peter leo hi i'm dr peter leo and today we're going to be talking about cannabis and eczema what are the facts i'm just going to share my screen these are my disclosures let's jump right in this cover back in september of 2019 really caught my attention high on the hype the cover of newsweek pop culture says marijuana cures everything but what do scientists say and this really i think captures the zeitgeist of the moment cannabinoids and cannabis have really been talked about in this incredibly positive light as having all sorts of potential and i want to explore that with you guys for about the next half hour lots and lots of research has been happening and we can see the research in cannabinoids in general that's the general category that includes cannabis but all of its derivatives and we're going to get into in a moment we can see the studies in the 1990s look at 2000 and look it happened in 2010 things went crazy we're going practically vertical here blasting up with all these studies and look none of these are actually skin cancer neurological disorders schizophrenia anxiety multiple sclerosis epilepsy so lots and lots of different areas are being studied in addition to the skin the skin industry has seen a massive impact from this and this was a really nice uh comment under a section called comet controversy and they called it the growing trend of cannabidiol cbd which is one of those cannabinoids in skin care products and this is again just calling attention to how common this is getting and we're hearing more and more about it this was a really nice editorial from peter cogan and i like this a lot the title of this piece was on health care by popular appeal critical assessment of benefit and risk and cannabidiol-based dietary supplements and i think we're seeing again a big interest a lot of public outcry let's let's have these let's use them how how do we get them to us and i think that's exciting we want to we want to learn but i also want to make sure we're doing it cautiously and intelligently and carefully because you know if we look at the history of medicine we haven't been burned before we've embraced things very quickly and very openly only to find out later oh we rushed in maybe we made the wrong decision and the quote here that i really like is quote ongoing lack of meaningful regulation of cannabinoid supplements continues to put consumers at undue risk without clear evidence of therapeutic value unquote so we just want to be careful as we go into this now in dermatology we're a little bit buffered because we're going to be talking about some of the more genital approaches to this but i still think it's important we know cannabis marijuana has a very long and celebrated history there actually is mention of it in the ebers papyrus one of the most ancient forms of egyptian medicine that remains ancient documents it also here is pictured above the goddess seshat the goddess of wisdom knowledge and writing and then uh here on the syrian clay tablets so it's been around for a long time people have known to to greater or lesser degrees that it has been part of us in our culture and it has long been used for health and healing the preparations from the flowers and resin have been used in china for about 5 000 years it's been used for fever malaria constipation menstrual disorders gout rheumatism and pain and before aspirin i didn't know this but i learned this in reading reading a lot of the background history uh cannabis was a common pain remedy in western medicine in the 1800s i didn't realize that kind of interesting that you would just have some cannabis instead of popping an aspirin now so we've said that word cannabis which is sort of equivalent to marijuana and then we think about the chemicals from that plant right the cannabis plant what are the chemicals that group of the ones we're talking about here one of the groups the ones that we're interested are called cannabinoids so that's the group of molecules that have anti-inflammatory anti-itch and pain relieving properties among others they do show promise in treating eczema and other skin conditions with multiple possible routes of administration and importantly because sometimes people get confused they can be made and i think should be made in our case to have no psychoactive stuff so you think of somebody getting high on marijuana that's not what we're going for that's not that's not the look we're going for here that is um a very different part and it turns out that that part getting high is one particular cannabinoid in fact it's the tetrahydrocannabinol we'll look at that in a moment but that is different we're not so interested in that for our skin there are different classes of cannabinoids that come up and the first group is called the endocannabinoids those the ones that inside the body uh a-e-a-p-e-a-o-e-a-a then there are the phytocannabinoids the ones from plants phytos plants and that's the delta 9 tetrahydrocannabidiol cannabinol that's the thc that that is the one that's psychogenic and other ones cvg and cbdv and then there are some synthetic ones as well now pea we're going to talk about an oea they're not technically real cannabinoids they are just sort of binder enhancers they just kind of help but they function in a very similar way this is the crazy biochemistry pathway they start with these activated fatty acids and they go through a number of different synthesis pathways to get some of the big guys here's the dial to 9 thc here's cbd and some other ones too they have lots of different characteristics so the tetrahydrocannabida cannabinol thc is the psychoactive one but it turns out pretty much none of the other ones really are psychoactive which is kind of fascinating that really is the outlier in a way and that's most abundant in the drug type plants because we know hemp is really the same as cannabis marijuana it's the same plant but they've been bred slightly differently so the hemp ones have very little thc and they're more fiber and oil and then the marijuana plants have a lot more of the delta 9 thc cbd is one that we're really interested in dermatology it's non-psychoactive it's the most abundant in the fiber type plants or the hemp type plans and it really it can have an effect on these different types of receptors so we mentioned that it's been studied for many disorders so look at this pain multiple sclerosis anorexia nausea vomiting colitis you name it so lots and lots of things have had studies for different types of cannabinoids and more appropriately for our work is the anti-inflammatory stuff because when we think about a lot of the problems we're facing in dermatology and particularly for our for eczema it's the anti-inflammatory and anti-itch and again there's been lots and lots of studies here we can see pretty exciting one of the big things that are holding this back a hurdle is that there are still regulatory issues this is still listed by federal sources as a schedule one controlled substance so that's very different than you know in a lot of states has been legalized even for recreational use but from a federal standpoint it's still tricky and it's sort of slipping in at least the cbd products because the 1994 passage of the dietary supplement health education act created this big group of products called dietary supplements which we know you know you can see infomercials there at every store um and they get to kind of skirt around a lot of the regulatory stuff it was a very powerful act that was pushed very hard by these makers of different supplements said listen this is an important industry we want consumers to be able to have these options we don't want the fda in everything and that's sort of how some of these can get through there and many states say treat them more like dietary supplements which can be a good thing it can mean that again less regulation can mean much better availability cheaper prices of course it does have a negative side and that means it's the wild west sometimes we don't know if what they say you're getting is what you're really getting and we've actually written a couple of papers about this recently that many of my patients say well how do i know like even though it's legal in for example in illinois my job says it's not legal my job will fire me if i fail the drug test so if i'm using a cbd product on my skin can you assure me that i won't fail the drug test for marijuana exposure and it's a really important question and it's nuanced because it has a few steps the first is if they really do put what they're saying in there if it's just cbd at the percent they're saying and the patient's using it the way we expect then we can answer that question it turns out the answer to that question is almost for sure you'd be fine but because it's not regulated we don't know if they're really putting in just what they're saying they're putting in and the right percentage so that really throws things off so there are a couple layers that that make it a little confusing so we know the the fda then really does not limit these or regulate these which is good but the problem here is that we don't have a ton of data on these so despite all the people talking about them despite being on the fact of newsweek you're going to see i think kind of a frightening lack of information you know when we really really look at what's out there and some people talk on it with such uh confidence and expertise like they were like they know and i'm thinking gosh how do you know even if you've been recommending it to a lot of patients it's still we know that there's a lot of inherent dangers to just your anecdotal experience right and so it's fascinating to think that we haven't we want these so much and we have so much information about them but yet we have so little when it comes to actually using them in patients not a single product sold as a cannabinoid supplement has been assessed through a large randomized controlled phase three clinical trial so for better or worse now it probably doesn't matter if you're taking a zinc supplement right at this point um that hasn't been passed through anything either but you know it just it just may vary and i think it just opens up the question so cbd at the center of all these possible things neuroprotective pain relieving anxiety relieving antidepressant antioxidant and more how is it doing all this well this is a look at the endocannabinoid system in the skin and it turns out that the cannabinoid receptors are all over the place they play a role in fat synthesis hair growth they play a role in the inflammation and they also probably have a direct role in pain and itch which is really neat so all these things come together and make us very interested in harnessing this for our patient needs what are some of the adverse effects that have been seen well in general this is a little bit broader and this it really is including things like smoking marijuana so it's it's broader than it needs to be but i figure it's better to be a bit broader than than too narrow of course it can cause sedative effects psychological issues perception and motor changes strokes cerebral blood flow differences you know dispensing decrease with chronic use and again i would expect these are really all marijuana systemic marijuana this is not going to be a cbd product on the skin conjunctival injection the red eyes of people who are smoking marijuana heart issues as well respiratory issues again if you're smoking i think that's what they're talking about here coughing wheezing bronchitis decreased lung function it even has effects on the gastro gastrointestinal system reproductive effects and then the immune it's unclear for marijuana but there are some potential adverse effects i will say that for the topical products that i'm that i'm going to mention and kind of go into uh these tend to be cbd type products they're usually not having the any of these other issues i would say that the risks there are more um it is possible that you could become allergic to it it's possible that it could actually irritate you those are the big things we don't think there's a whole bunch of systemic issues that would happen from a topical well it turns out that eczema is not the only thing could be used for and i just wanted to talk for a moment on a couple of the other things it's been looked at as a potential treatment for acne and it turns out if you look at the oil cells the cells that make our oil called sibo sites and they kind of grow them in culture they actually found that adding cbd can block some of their ability to make the fat make the oil and that's really important because we know one of the issues when people break out with acne is they tend to be doing too much sebum production too much oil production so if you could bring that down a little bit and do it safely that would be pretty neat pretty handy we actually don't really have a medicine that does that very directly the closest we have is the isotretinoin medicine that kind of shrinks the sebaceous glands but that's a little different this is more of a signaling thing as we said it also has an anti-inflammatory effect too and they did this really neat little breakdown showing all the different parts so lipostatic means making less fat or oil anti-proliferative slowing down some of the cells from growing and again we know one of the issues in acne is the clogging of the pore so if you can kind of slow that down you might slow the clog and then the anti-inflammatory piece kind of interesting and they did a study where they to control group and then they added a little bit of this chemical that stimulates oil production and they showed all the oil that's the red stuff and then they did the chemical that stimulates oil production along with some cbd and the cbd decreased the oil production so really kind of neat at least you know in a glass right so this is not really in people this isn't in a culture and it's hard to know if this would actually play out on our skin but that's how it begins it starts with noticing something and saying huh could this work in people now for the skin there's very little but there was a study looking at three percent cannabis seed extract and a base cream as a control putting it on twice a day to half the face for 12 weeks and they actually found that the oil and the redness uh were significantly decreased at various time points and there was no safety issues that they noticed and most patients tolerated it well so this is a really good example it's very small i wouldn't base major national policy on this but uh we have what we saw under the microscope in the culture and then we see in a small trial a kind of a pilot study and a half half-face study that actually really fits it well so i think this to me suggests there is real promise here now there's still a long way to go you got to get the right dosage you got to get the right purification you got to make sure it's the right vehicle and you do want to do more testing but i would say very promising that that it could have an effect on oil production and if you have oily skin this could be a way to approach that problem which is kind of neat let's get to the good stuff what about itch so those receptors those cannabinoid receptors in are actually on nerves and they may decrease excitation so if you stimulate them they could sort of cool down the sensation of itch again that'd be a win-win for us and they did a small study in 12 volunteers where they actually put histamine in their skin right the itchiest thing in the world and half of them got this cannabinoid agonist so kind of a cannabinoid that would stimulate the the receptors the other half got a placebo and they actually found that the people that had the patch with the medicine did significantly better than the placebo patch so there's again something potentially to it lots of questions but the the principles are here and that's again where all this begins pea is one of those ones we talked about early on it's it's one of the sort of pseudoendocannabinoids it's actually they call it a cognate so it improves the binding of our own endocannabinoids to the cannabinoid receptors and it's nice because it also has some moisturizing properties and seems to help with itch as well so they did 100 subjects with itchy dry skin and they either got the vehicle sort of the base cream or the the cream containing the pea and they actually unfortunately didn't find much difference so i report a negative study which is never fun but it's important again just to kind of keep balance because we often will report the exciting stuff but we kind of gloss over the ones that didn't help so in this group it didn't seem to do much and this is kind of what it looked like at varying time points so there was a trend towards improvement but but not enough to be statistically significant now in atopic dermatitis there was a large multinational study now this was not placebo-controlled though and that's important to know but almost 2500 patients with atopic dermatitis that's a little different than the last one they were just dry and itchy maybe it doesn't do as much for that what about if you have atopic dermatitis you have economy of actually inflammation so they applied the pea containing cream twice a day to the problem areas and they actually did find that it helped p was the p-value was less than .001 so significantly improved in all the following patient reported symptoms the decreased use of topical steroids yes that's a win we want to decrease the need for those improve sleep a huge win and improve dryness scratching itch and redness so amazing so this is the kind of stuff we want to see now it's not placebo controlled though so we don't know if maybe just putting on any cream would have done the same thing so again we needed to do more and better studies but again possibly interesting and this is kind of what it looked like at the study start versus the study end the dryness got better the scratching exploration got better like cannification scaling i mean everything much better but can you tell me for sure that that wasn't just due to putting on a moisturizer i can't because we know that all of these potentially could get better from a moisturizer too it would have been so nice if they had the vehicle then we would really know another study looked at oral hemp seed oil and found that it also may improve atopic dermatitis this was a randomized crossover study of 20 adults with atopic dermatitis and they compared that to an olive oil control they found that consuming two tablespoons of hemp seed oil decreased the skin dryness itchiness and use of topical medicines compared to the olive oil group and it was thought that actually in this case it probably wasn't really related to cannabinoids at all because there's very few in in the purified hemp seed oil it probably has more to do with the high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in there so it may just be that those fats have an effect again this is a great example of why it can be confusing to try to figure out what the active piece is what's actually doing the work that being said this is something i use for a lot of patients it's very inexpensive it's very accessible there's no risk of of getting high or anything like that the hemp seed oil is is quite safe and even for kids i feel comfortable having them try some of this the only thing is it tastes terrible it kind of tastes rancid and you definitely don't want to cook with it i read something that said don't cook with it i thought oh let me try and as soon as the frying pan started getting hot oh my goodness it turned terribly ranced that it was the worst so highly recommended you just take it mix it in with something it's best in like a smoothie where you don't have to taste it at all this is what they found in the trial the hemp seed oil skin dryness at week zero versus week eight so it went down a lot skin itchiness dropping down use of medications dropping down all of those were significant other trials just summarizing everything here this is all that's been done so it's a little bit a little bit uh disheartening that after all we've talked about this is all they've done that acne one we mentioned the aesthetic eczema one which really didn't show it showed some difference but not much difference in the barrier and the atopic dermatitis one that did show an improvement and then the chronic itch one that also we talked about showed no significant differences so not too many studies have been done yet but i'm really hopeful and excited that we may see lots more coming especially in the next coming year or two we have a lot of people interested in this now finally the last thing i'll leave you with is a checklist how do we pick a good one what do we do so there's no great answer but a couple of things to think about is do we know that it meets quality standards and a couple things that can help us is if it has a current good manufacturing practices certification a cgmp from the us fta or it could have uh from the eu the australian or canadian organic certification that is associated with a higher quality because they have to jump over some hoops or the national science foundation international certification so any of these certifications can suggest that it is higher quality it's not a guarantee and there are some differences but i think it's definitely better than ones that have nothing does the program have an independent adverse event reporting program that's nice to know again it shows that they're committed it shows that they're long term they're not a fly-by-night operation and hopefully they're getting feedback and continuing to do quality control is the product certified organic or eco-farmed again while not a perfect connection with being a good one i think that's a higher correlation and finally have the products been laboratory tested by batch to confirm their stated ingredients and ideally the percentages and make sure there's no pesticides or heavy metals these are just generally good guides when we're picking supplements and the answer for some things is you can't tell or you can't get that information but it really can be quite helpful in conclusion cannabinoids have tremendous potential with very strong scientific underpinnings there's real reasons why this may help and may be useful there is some evidence for itch and atopic dermatitis and even acne there's speculation from some scientific folks from many conditions in dermatology even including some skin cancers but we have a lot of unanswered questions which one to use how to administer it should it be oral should it be a patch should it be a cream how do we do this what is the dosage what is the frequency and what are the risks for now caution is strongly advised until we know more but there is great hope on the horizon thank you so much for your attention i really appreciate thank you again dr leo for helping us get the facts about cannabis and eczema thank you to sanofi genzyme and regeneron whose unrestricted educational grant has made today's presentation possible and many thanks to all of you for joining us today you can find many additional eczema resources on our website at nationaleczema.org once again i'm isabelle tipo on behalf of the national eczema association thank you all for attending our webinar", "YJ1yxEbx1Bg": "as a first-year graduate student I was walking down the hallways and all of a sudden I heard a noise that noise was coming from one of the laboratories what was that I asked myself what was it it's like shooting ducks in the pond came the voice from the electrophysiology lab what I was absolutely amazed by that when I worked in electrophysiology lab I saw that this sound was actually voltage that was converted into audio sound and it was coming from a neuron a single neuron to which an electrode was attached is the way neurons talk it's fascinating and from that point on I was hooked on electrophysiology and hooked the neurophysiology I wanted to know how these neurons talk how they communicate with each other how they create neural networks and that information in neural network gets spread through the brain I wanted to know everything including how neurons work right now while you're listening to my talk right at this millisecond if we were to take a division of the brain or the whole brain and very roughly divided into two types of neurons we would have excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons all of these neurons produce very fast potentials that are called action potentials these are little electrical sparks and these electrical sparks caused the release of a chemical called neurotransmitter so if you have an excitatory neuron when it produces the spike or an action potential this very fast electrical change the excitatory neurons releases excitatory neurotransmitter excites a part of the brain the inhibitory neuron they also produce these fast electrical changes and they release an inhibitory neurotransmitter and that inhibitory neurotransmitter dampens the activity of the brain and so this is constant up and down up and down in different regions of the brain is encoding our perceptions our memories our emotions our motor functions and this complete picture is it's formed by interactions of these excitatory and inhibitory networks that are precisely balanced and acting precisely in time playing out the rhythms playing out the rhythms playing out neuronal beats if we look even further into different subtypes of neurons in the brain of course we're not just limited by excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons the brain is a very complex structure and so another way we can approximate the structure and function of different brain cells is subdividing them further into different subtypes and so if we were to look in the brain we actually have approximately 150 different subtypes of neurons and if we were to stimulate those neurons and place an electrode and listen to how there's near on stalk how they produce their dialect da da da da da da we hear that we have 150 dialects these are different languages that each neuron speaks it's a different dialect and these dialects interact precisely in each one of these 150 neurons subtypes has this precise role in creating this up or down oscillation and we now know in the last few decades that individual neurons play a very precise role in producing this fast electrical change and having these rhythms these oscillations that are controlled that are precisely controlled but of course that's all of our brains are not normal and unfortunately some of our brains have neurological disorders and so neurological disorders is where you have these neuronal beats neuronal rhythms that are upset so perhaps not surprising that after finishing graduates I pursued my studies in epilepsy why epilepsy well epilepsy presents a disorder neurological disorder that is actually a dysfunction of brain rhythms and one would argue that any neurological disorder any neurological disorder is really impaired brain rhythms in the brain and they would be absolutely right in my opinion however with epilepsy the diagnosis of epilepsy comes from actually recording abnormal electrical activity in the brain and ascribing or determining a specific syndrome of epilepsy based on that electrical activity and so how the neurons sound during seizures they scream what do I mean by scream well if you talk dialect normally that's one thing but what happens to you if you scream and you scream non-stop what happens to your vocal cords they burn and you lose your voice the same happens during seizures is that neurons during seizure scream if at normal brain activity neural are firing is not that frequent it's actually a pretty pretty quiet brain that produces some electrical sparks here and there and releases neurotransmitters excitatory inhibitory but during seizures this organization of beats is lost the beats become abnormal the cells get hijacked by this pathology and now they start playing the wrong beats and so the challenge that we took upon ourselves is to understand what contribution these different subtypes of neurons have in producing seizures and since I told you that there's excitatory cells and inhibitory cells you would probably guess the textile Ettore cells and the ones that start the seizures and are responsible for spreading the seizures these large electrical discharges across the brain so according to the words of my mentor it takes crazy people like myself and himself to insert electrodes in multiple cells at the same time and try to understand what these cells do during seizures and that's exactly what we did and what we saw was completely countering to ative we saw the pain Hammett ourselves actually start the seizures which you have here on top is the inhibitory cell in blue when that inhibitory cell this blue thing is actually producing lots of spikes and then after a while it fails to produce a spike and this excitatory cell over here that's in red it produces a whole bunch of uncontrolled activity and that activity spreads across the brain and that's what causes the seizures and so every time the inhibition fails and it doesn't produce a spike the excitation produces a seizure it runs away and it causes damage to the brain and this was absolutely fascinating for us to find that and the studies that we did we did these studies and brain slices taken from rodent brains and you will say well what does that have to do with human brain and human being and what one behold five or so years later the similar pattern of inhibitory neurons starting the seizures and failing during the seizures and excitatory information running away and causing abnormal activity was discovered and confirmed in living human epileptic brains in general I think this is a remarkable and most fascinating thing about the science is that you can have an isolated cell isolated Network in the dish and that activity that you record you can also find in the living human brain that's absolutely fascinating so one way that we can understand these neurons is looking at their spikes and we can convert these spikes into voltage but what we also want to know is how does this activity how do these brain waves these oscillations up and down look like and so in the last two decades neuroscientists have invented and other scientists many different ways of visualizing cell activity right now we can visualize movement of single molecules in one cell activity of one cell or hundreds of cells at the same time or networks and we can visualize this activity a hundred times per one set and we can visualize this activity real-time that's absolutely fascinating and so this is an example of what looks like a brainwave it's abnormal epileptic brain wave that is propagating in the slice where the red color here shows a very massive amount of activity abnormal activity that propagates through this tissue and it's absolutely fascinating we can actually now tell where this abnormal activity begins as a shown here how it travels through brain tissue we can measure the speed of these propagations we can measure the characteristics of this oscillations we can accomplish a lot using imaging and that presents a completely different view and understanding of how neural networks function how they spread this activity across the brain so now that we understand these abnormal oscillations one of the things that we want to do is neuro scientists and neurologists one of the biggest challenges that we have is to actually how to control these abnormal brain rhythms how to stop and control abnormal rhythms how to reset the brain as a rhythmic structure of silat airy structure into the right kind of oscillation and again you can view the drugs and pharmaceuticals that you take actually reset these rhythms they reset the rhythm they reset your mood the depression they do preset seizure they stop seizure they stop Parkinson's tremors you are changing the beats in these neurons with drugs or with electrical stimulation for the past few years smart work has been motivated and has concentrated on a dravet syndrome the dravet syndrome is a catastrophic form of epilepsy it happens in very young children it's catastrophic because children can have up to hundreds of seizures a week those seizures are untreatable uncontrollable in many cases it's catastrophic because children do not develop properly they're having too many seizures for their brain to process other activity and it's catastrophic because up to 20 percent of these kids die after seizure for known reasons and so this is what motivates me to understand how the brain works and to try to invent or understand new ways and potentially alternative ways in which we can treat this abnormal brain activity and what may come as a surprise to you is that these children along with many other children autistic children Asperger's children cancer children are using cannabis are using cannabis extracts to improve their way of life to control them controllable conditions of course that stirs up a lot of emotions children cannabis what are you talking about this is wrong this is right this is wrong here the deal that the devil is in the details okay so let's try to understand some of these details we know that marijuana has been used for centuries with the reported medicinal effects there is multiple publications report medicinal effects there are synthetic drugs that are compounds of cannabis that are used as medications and recently there's been an increase in use of these extracts and even more so the second half of the 20th century we discovered an endocannabinoid system so what is under cannabinoid system and the cannabinoid system consists of endocannabinoids these are chemicals that are produced naturally in your body without taking a puff they're naturally produced in your body and they can bind two types of receptors cb1 receptor cannabinoid receptor one and cb2 receptor cannabinoid receptor 2 and these receptors are very widely distributed throughout the body with cb1 receptors dominant in the brain and it will cause the psychoactive effect from the cannabis plant the cb2 receptors are distributed mostly in the periphery with the most predominant expression of CVT receptor in the spleen and that's the organ that is responsible for amassing your immune response so where does cannabis come in here well would we know of course we all heard about THC bad drug THC it's a part of cannabis and this is all we know about cannabis pretty much we just say cannabis is THC drug and and that's it and so what we have to know is that cannabis plants can't a cannabinoids what are cannabinoids cannabinoids is a whole group of chemicals that have different structures the second most prevalent cannabinoid in cannabis is shown here abbreviated a CBD or cannabidiol there's other cannabinoids that are expressed and it's over 70 of them that are found in the in the cannabis plants and on top of that cannabis plants and these extracts from cannabis plants not only can take an AB noise but they also contain these aromatic substances that are called terpenes so you will find terpenes and other fruits and vegetables limonene and lemon carry filling and cloves and hops lavendar will have line Alou and what we know is that these terpenes on their own have very strong biological activity and sometimes very beneficial biological activity too so they have medicinal properties the terpenes themselves and what has become a predominant thought is that perhaps this isolated compounds like THC or cannabidiol CBD may not be as effective as using the extract from the whole plant you don't just eat one thing from the beet you eat the whole beet to get the benefit of the beet however with that comes the worry that you are actually if you're talking about the children you are trying to give children a drug that is containing THC so let's understand this a little bit better THC has actually been shown to be anticonvulsant except in about 10% of all the cases where it can be broken violent it has other medicinal benefits that have been documented and THC bonds to the cb1 receptor in the brain causing the high affect can add a dial on the other hand the second most prevalent cannabinoid in the plant has been shown to have only anticonvulsant facts and this cannabinoid does not bind cb1 receptor so it's not psychoactive so how can we deal with this thing that we have th see we have CBD we have this plant we have medicinal effects we need to understand more about this plant we need to understand a lot more about these substances do a lot more research get a lot more funding so we can help these children we can help these children have better lives we can understand better the plant and the as it concerns THC so for example here is an analogy so your doctor tells you that you know you can probably have a glass of cognac before you go to bed it comes your heart it's good for you right would you give a 40% alcohol contact to your child you'd never do that but there's something else inherent in that connieyc that makes you feel good it's not just the alcohol so what if you could remove the alcohol what if you could bring down the alcohol level to 0% or half percent the same as cough syrup in the pharmacies and you knew that this cognac now that has no alcohol helps other children from seizures and from other neurological disorders what would your decision be then would you give that cognac to your child then if you eliminate it in the case of cognac alcohol and in the case of cannabinoids or cannabis you eliminated potentially THC and so I think it is time for broader specters of the society sectors of the society and more conservative sectors of the society to understand this diseases to relate to the disease's to understand the pain of the children and the parents the catastrophic pain that they're going through it is time to stop stigmatizing the parents and sending them away as neurologist because they bring up an illicit substance because there are plenty of drugs that are pharmaceuticals that can debilitate children and adults as well and so it is time for us to seek alternative ways to envision neurological disorders and treat neurological disorders and so what I thought is the last few minutes of the talk is I'm actually going to invite a musician a friend of mine arkady got this month to come on stage and instead of playing you the seizures that we've recorded in the lab with the electrodes let's change this a little bit let's have a musician interpret the seizures for you that's key is understanding them let's seek alternative ways to understand it let's seek alternative ways to treat it for the benefit of humanity and let's accept simple facts that thousands of parents are advocating and thousands of parents are giving cannabis yes cannabis and cannabis extracts to their children let's just face the facts and so this is the notes that Arkady is going to play for you and these notes are electrical recordings of seizures in these neurons in brain slices where the first two traces are individual neurons and the bottom two traces are networks this is three minutes of data recorded from the brain networks that is now received data that is now going to get played by Arkady you", "aJ7OzctAoQw": "this is 420 Ohio's medical marijuana product reviews butterfly effects one-to-one Tincher was cultivated and processed by Gro hi Oh in Zanesville packaging for this bottle is not unlike butterfly effects high THC Tincher but varies and that the box is white instead of charcoal gray design is appealing and fairly easy to open the bigger disappointment is the bottle itself which is also white making it impossible for patients to see the Tincher before buying or easily monitor how much of the Tincher they have left thankfully the white material covering the bottle is simply painted over clear glass I actually took a knife and scraped the paint off so I could track how much of the tin sure I had remaining alas I still had to buy the tin sure not knowing what was in the bottle and that left me a little frustrated the tin sure itself is slightly thinner and consistency compared to butterfly effects I THC Tincher in terms of flavor this tin sure aims to taste like yellow cake and hits that target with ease butterfly effects one-to-one cannabis tin sure contains 110 milligrams of THC and 120 milligrams of CBD 0.25 milliliters wrapper will deliver only about one milligram of both THC and CBD as such one full dropper will deliver roughly 4 milligrams of the compounds please keep in mind this tin sure is designed for a balanced experience with very mild euphoria for those with medical conditions that are benefited from the sensation of euphoria I would suggest a higher THC Tincher strain or product my license medical marijuana patient consultant at the dispensary suggested this Tincher for new patients who haven't yet tried cannabis they also recommended this Tincher for patients with stomach or gastrointestinal issues or pain as this tin sure is great for relaxation and easing inflammation this tin sure worked great for my muscles relaxing aches and soothing tension it was also excellent about an hour before bed helping me relax before sleeping overall while the bottles could use an upgrade the tin sure itself is quite excellent it can be used for testing your tolerance of THC and CBD while also delivering inflammation and relaxation if you're new to medical cannabis or you just prefer a mild experience this is a great gentle Tincher worth testing out final rating 4.3 out of 5 be sure to LIKE and subscribe below or share this video on reddit or social media and don't forget to visit WWNT Ohi o for the full

cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started

9 on your side's Tasha Davis takes a look at a new study and what it means one of the more troubling health effects to consuming marijuana is the risk of having a psychotic episode a new study published in the lancet psychiatry shows that consuming weed on a daily basis and using high potency cannabis is associated with a higher risk of psychosis doing an episode of psychosis an individual might have altered perceptions their thought processes might be different and they might lose contact with reality completely for example they might have hallucinations where they're seeing things or hearing voices or they might have false belief systems the study found those who used weed daily were three times more likely to have a psychotic episode compared with someone who never used the drug use of high potency weed every day almost doubled those odds and it gets even worse that if people who use high potency marijuana have a 5 times greater odds of having a psychotic episode the study defines high potency cannabis to have more than 10 percent THC dr. trues says one theory that connects weed in psychotic episodes is that marijuana influences dopamine in the brain a chemical that can affect hallucinations but she and a study stress that there really is no conclusive link of marijuana directly causing psychosis unfortunately marijuana has been classified as a schedule 1 substance by the federal FDA and thus hasn't been studied completely we would greatly benefit from having for the studies done so that we could completely understand what marijuana is doing to the human body and minds according to the National Alliance of mental health as many as 3 and 100 people will have an episode at some point in their lives Tasha Davis Kagan 9 on their side", "DGlNc6tjTT8": "the cannabis edible one of the many glorious ways to consume cannabis they're tasty they're filling and best of all they get you high so you've been thinking about trying a cannabis edible for the first time to see what all the hype is about you should know that eating cannabis edibles to party your relaxed can be a fun and rewarding experience but remember THC does have the ability to intoxicate and should therefore like anything else be used responsibly I have before us the ultimate guide of all you need to know to guarantee an awesome edible experience ladies and gentlemen I give you the puffs puffs posts official guide to edibles I shall start us off with a story that is all too common among so many edible users and me Gwen Gwen wants to try cannabis edibles for the first time and enjoy a healthy dose of THC with her friends tonight she's inedible and eagerly awaits the euphoric effects she waits and waits expecting to feel something at any moment a full hour goes by and still no feeling of a cannabis hi she waits and waits another full hour still nothing by now Gwen is growing impatient and suspects that the edibles she ate just aren't potent enough for her she eats another edible this one should do the trick no more than five minutes go by and suddenly Gwen is hit with a full-frontal TC sensation she is consumed too much and the effects are overwhelming her she spends the rest of what should have been a fun night feeling over intoxicated what went wrong here did the edibles do this - Gwen or an a momentary lapse of preparation did Gwen do this to herself to find out what happened here we need to delve into the rules of edible consumption and examine just how Gwen broke these rules rule 1 know your notes unlike alcohol cannabis THC is a very safe non-toxic substance with no known lethal dose however much like alcohol when somebody ingests more than they can handle there can be some undesirable side effects excess of THC beyond one's threshold can result in a temporary increase of anxiety agitation elevated heart rate or even vomiting one of the biggest mistakes when made right off the bat was eating a cannabis edible without inquiring what the dose was one thing to remember for your first time is to start low and slow with a more manageable 20 milligrams of THC eaten will give you higher than 20 milligrams of TC smoked so you may have to dial your usual dosage back of it most health experts recommend a conservative 5 to 10 milligrams of THC to start you off just because your party animal friend can down cannabis animals like their potato chips and function fine doesn't mean you should immediately follow suit understand that everybody has different limitations when it comes to metabolizing THC the process of knowing your dose is crucial to gauge how much TC you can consume comfortably without erling yourself into a sour experience know your limits stay within it rule to wait just wait there is a difference between smoking and eating cannabis when cannabis is smoked your lungs absorb the cannabis right away and you feel the high instantly but when you eat cannabis it is processed through the liver and may take anywhere between one to two hours to feel the full effects another one of Gwen's many errors was failing to recognize this waiting period she mistook the delayed process of the edible digestion as it being ineffective in doing so she overcompensated by doubling her dose unnecessarily now any negative sensations she feels off the first edible will compound two hours later when she fully digest the second one she what when should have done was relaxed sit back eat Cheetos and let the edible run its full course so if you take an edible and you were waiting to feel for its effects but they never seem to arrive don't worry just wait some more give your body the appropriate amount of time to fully digest the edible and then decide whether or not you want more THC in your system rule 3 know what to expect so you've taken the appropriate dosage that best suits you and you've exercised patience and waiting for the substance to run its course good job the effects kick in the process of liver digestion is much more thorough than lung intake and your body will therefore absorb more properties from the cannabis at best you may feel a very cozy and content feeling or experience a heightened libido and increase sensuality rule 4 there is a time and place for edibles especially if it's your first time try not to drink alcohol while on edibles whose can magnify the effects of THC potentially making the user too hot I also would not recommend driving working or operating machinery after you take them since they can't intoxicate you instead it may be wise to reserved an entire day set aside for them like maybe the weekend or on a date you can just sit back and relax these conditions are optimal because you can feel the effects of an edible six to eight hours after ingesting them so be ready for a long day of fun taking an edible before you go to bed is also an option since the effects can combat insomnia for many people just like baby pictures and recounting your last trip to Las Vegas there is a time and a place for edibles so I hope you learned a thing or two from our guy remember when trying any new substance do your research find out the ideal dose for you educate yourself on what you can expect to feel and know when the best time to consume them is with all that being said I wish you all the best of trips follow these rules and I can guarantee you a safe and fun edible experience every time thank you very much for watching and follow us like us subscribe to us for more news cannabis thank you", "2-as9CfTzEg": "hi folks so this weekend I've been trying some of these new major drinks to the get into the store they have a a mango and a pink lemonade that have been out for quite a while but this weekend despite the apocalypse and coronavirus and everything else we got new product which is pretty cool just for something new to check out right so I tried all three of them over the weekend I actually haven't tasted this one yet but I will in a minute the first one is called sacred grape and it tastes kinda like grape soda when you shake it up and drink it I drink it kind of in like three big gulps here the old ones they had a cap on top that you would pour the dosage out but here it's more like I you each one of these little notches is 1 mil is 10 milligrams so I tend to take like about 30 milligrams so I'll drink that much this one the only weird thing about it is it's like this weird grey color but other than that I was pretty tasty I liked it grape was kind of my least favorite flavor so I decided to try that first this one is Pacific Coast blue raspberry and I like the flavor that's actually a lot better it's quite blue as you can see and there's a little bit of an aftertaste to it but it's not all that bad it's um and I've noticed with these things that it's more of a upbeat canna hi it's more sativa ish feeling to me compared with some of the other edibles that I've had and especially like the some of the chocolates that have had those tend to make me feel more sedate but anyway as I open this thing up the last one is dreamin of passionfruit and it's orange and I'm gonna taste this [Applause] I like

but one doctor here Marin says it's not about getting high it's about getting well and he thinks he's on to something yes dr. Michael Moskowitz believes he has identified a rare component of marijuana called THC V that he says is helping one of his diabetic patients a patient whose blood sugar levels varies between 50 and 1000 in a single day it's not clear but it appears on a preliminary basis for the first month that he that he did that his the the extent of how much he varied seems to be less THC v is found in this subspecies of marijuana called black beauty its leaves are much darker than most marijuana this is a single bud nearly 11 inches long and although she doesn't have diabetes Nina Murphy has chronic neck and back pain she used to treat with meds I was a little skeptical I haven't used marijuana before so it's not something that I was just gonna jump into I'm extremely pleased and I hope to be off my meds in the next couple of months dr. Moskowitz says more study needs to be done with a black beauty it's just having the opportunity to work with something that clearly has therapeutic value but figuring out how to optimize that and make that work the best for the most number of people that's very exciting the doctor travels to Miami next week speaking at a conference to discuss his findings in San Rafael Don Ford KPIX 5", "2cJle9bsfV8": "Well there's a long history of research looking at the effects of cannabis in Parkinson's Cannabis extract contains lots of chemicals and most of the directed research is focused on two main components which is THC and cannabidiol THC or tetrahydrocannabinol\nis the psychoactive compound so that's the compound that will give you the high\nor the hallucinations and obviously that's not a desired effect! And if you take THC\nin combination with cannabidiol actually that reduces that effect of the\ncannabis to some extent We've been quite interested in the past and looking at the effect of cannabis in Parkinson's We did a study using an extract of THC and\ncannabidiol together in a capsule form to see whether there was any benefit for\ndyskinesia and unfortunately didn't show there was any benefit at all for dyskinesia We asked patients whether they felt better in terms of other symptoms There was a suggestion actually that cannabis extract THC and cannabidiol together might be of benefit for sleep or pain and those are aspects that\nwe're hoping to explore more There are also possible neuroprotective benefits\nof cannabis - in the lab work that we've done we've looked particularly at THC and shown that it has protected nerve cells from dying in our cell\nculture model, and we're hoping to build on that in in animal models. And it seems\nto work on particular pathways which we know are important in Parkinson's - so THC\ncan rescue mitochondria (which are the engine houses of the cell) - protect them\nfrom being damaged and it also influences a pathway which is known as\nthe PGC1 Alpha Pathway which we know is important. The\nwork we've done to date has been in cell culture models. We need to replicate that\nwork in animal models of Parkinson's and so we're still a long way off from\ntrialling it's in the in the clinic but it does show potential promise Subscribe",

the plant genus cannabis you have marijuana and you have hemp both of them contain CBD and THC however marijuana contains much larger quantities of THC which is the psychoactive plant ingredient in hemp the main compound is CBD if you're like me and you don't want any of the THC you don't want any of those psychotropic effects you can use pure CBD oil or CBD products that do not contain any THC we're talking about CBD that you can incorporate into your diet into your skincare products a facilitator for sleep and pain management it's a powerful anti-inflammatory basically this is a plant and our body knows what to do with it so I think CBD is a very exciting addition to have in our wellness arsenal you should always check with your doctor first to make sure that CBD is right for you but if you want to incorporate it into your lifestyle there are plenty of exciting new ways to do that and benefit your health you", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder

burgstahler ever hit those periods where you need more and more weed to feel high if you've noticed your thc tolerance has skyrocketed then you might benefit from the occasional tea break thc the psychoactive and intoxicating compound cannabis is most known for works by affecting cannabinoid type 1 or cb1 receptors in the brain over time too much thc can weaken the cb1 receptors response to thc or reduce the amount of receptors altogether both lead to you needing to ingest more thc to feel desired effects a tolerance break from cannabis is a beautiful way to restore your endocannabinoid

big mike and enjoy that day my sweet petunias", "Y87yxZsDQTs": "hello everybody and welcome back your burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's video if you like the video please don't forget to give it a thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed yet please do I

edible review it is Incredibles indica Fruit Chews it's a hundred milligrams each one of these is ten milligrams and there's ten of them in there so each one of these right here is ten milligrams so I'm gonna go ahead and give those a try I'm gonna pause the video wait till I start feeling the effects and then I'll start the video back up again and we'll see where we go from there are these it's been about 20 minutes and yeah they're pretty effective you can feel it right off the bat I'm sure as time goes on as time progresses they get stronger and stronger but about 20-25 minutes in boom you can definitely feel that they're definitely there it's you know I mean it's definitely very very very effective no indica I don't know how you're going to feel the difference between indica and sativa when you're eating when you're eating edibles I don't know because it affects your body so much I don't know how you would be able to feel the difference between an indica and a sativa but these are in different shoes so yeah I don't know you know I'll be able to tell but um yeah these are pretty effective the price point for these ten of these gummies which equals a little over a hundred milligrams cost $17 they were on special for $17 I think they were normally like $19 or $18 so they weren't special for $70 I think it's well worth it for seventeen dollars you get blasted out in your brain basically 100 milligrams is pretty good thousand milligrams is insane so yeah we just keep trucking with that once again it's your boy Seth we would do Channel Denver coming to you with another

Igor and Olga Kovalchuk put their efforts into looking at how cannabis could be used to fight Cova 19 they join us this morning from Lethbridge Alberta good to chat with both of you this morning morning good morning so Igor your lab was already testing cannabis I understand strains to combat cancer and inflammation where are you at in your research with kovat 19 right so in the past five years we have developed over 1,500 strains of cannabis and have tested today about 400 and we have actually found around a dozen of cultivars that were able to substantially decrease the expression of the h2 receptor took one that is required by virus to enter ourselves and out of those about two three strains can do it by 75% or more and all go so what would be the next steps here and what made you think that you should make that shift and start to think about kovat 19 well I think we all started thinking about Kovach 19 and when it hit and really disrupted our routines so a lot of scientists like ourselves decided to take a look whether or not something that we already have as Igor said we were already testing cannabis for its biological effects may be helpful so and you know luckily we ended up having some of the very promising strains so right now what's most important for us is to actually find partnerships and develop clinical trials because thus far what we shall we show in the lab and it works in the lab but we have to absolutely have to do a clinical trial to show that it really does translate into clinic that it really works in the scale of clinical trial ego you say the strains you're testing your CBD predominate why does that make a difference in getting a clinical trial up and running faster right so there are many strains that can be active but the main reason is that if you have a psychoactive ingredients like THC in Canada then the dose that you can give is limited so it's limited typically by about 25 milligram of THC day and as I mentioned our strains are predominantly CBD so they have twenty to one ratio to THC so that allows us to give up to 500 milligrams of CBD a day and still be within 25 milligram of THC so that the patients are not or do not feel impaired and it's critically important for patient and for a doctorate 12 although what could be any side effects if any well cannabis is on its own has actually very good safety profile it has been studied its components have been studied very very well separately and so the because again the strains that we are talking about are CBD dominant they have really high levels of CBD and very low levels of psychoactive compound we do not predict there's gonna be any major impairment there of course could be some things like like more positive ones let's say anti-anxiety benefits and some betterment of sleep but those would be not really sight of those actually would be quite beneficial effects that people can sleep and there may be a little bit of improvement of appetite as well so some quality of life aspects may also be improved it's absolutely fascinating we'll be watching very closely your work dr. Igor and Olga Kovalchuk thanks for joining us this morning thank you for your interest thanks for watching if you liked this be sure to subscribe here and you can check out more your morning videos right here", "Y690LtyjvFc": "hello I'm mr. Karen Becker and today I have an awesome guest revisiting us here at pergola healthy fats dr. Rob silver is joining us dr. Rob graduated from the Colorado State School of Veterinary Medicine and he is the chief medical officer for Rx vitamins he also is the author of medical marijuana and your pet he established a thriving integrative practice in Boulder Colorado which is where I'm guessing Rob you kind of mastered the art of learning putting all of the information you've researched into practice for decades at a time when it comes to using therapeutics for patients so that is the topic of the day is cannabis or hemp derived products how to use them and how safe they are so first of all thank you you for joining us my pleasure glad to be here yeah awesome and I really view I think the entire veterinary industry kind of used you as the expert when it comes to understanding this very confusing topic and I know that as you have learned and investigated you have been able to apply a lot of the principles that you are being educated about to the veterinary realm and for that we're forever indebted to you but let's start with topic number one which is usually at least for my audience safety so doctor I've talked to us about we know that these are that these herbs are fanatically safe if they're used appropriately and really I think that this herb is a gift to modern medicine and I'm so thankful we have it however there there are some risks if it's done wrong or if you don't know what you're doing talk to us about how your top safety tips for navigating this confusing world of cannabis and happen and what your suggestions would be okay well I think the first place to begin as far as safety has to do with the choice of the product because there are a lot of products in the marketplace as more and more companies we're seeing an opportunity to to make money and some of the companies are launching products which may not contain what they are supposed to contain some prisons hemp is a form of Canada has very very low levels of THC non psychotropic levels of THC and dogs we have found are extremely sensitive to the adverse effects of THC so if you have a hemp product that is improperly labeled or improperly extracted so it has an excessive amount of THC in it and you could have an adverse reaction this is one reason why I think that for most situations we don't really need the THC to get good response so there now our products in the marketplace which are zero THC which are less likely to cause any kind of THC reaction so I think the choice of the products important and you need to talk to the company you need to ask them to give you evidence and proof as far as you know what really has been measured in terms of what's in that bottle which should be what's on the label we have done several safety studies down for CBD and dogs and we found that essentially it's really quite safe we don't have all the details worked out but it but at dosages that were given that were maybe four to five times higher than what we need to use clinically we saw some diarrhea we saw some mild elevations in a liver enzyme called alkaline phosphatase but it was transient and the other liver enzymes were normal so it appears that CBD is is relatively safe especially when given at the dosages that are currently being recommended higher dosages might run into problems so well kitties actually do very well with cannabis with CBD and an aren't as sensitive to the THC as danza so everything I'm saying a bit but we just have not had the studies yet and cats cats are a lot harder to study they're a lot harder to give things to they're not hard to keep blood from so you know those studies have not really been conducted yet but hopefully they will be and then we'll get the details as far as cats but appears that cats are it's also safe for cats in spite of their their livers particularly difficulty and metabolizing certain types of things and what about this concept I've heard from many many enthusiasts that having the whole plant including a team fraction of THC having the entire plant including of my fruit that maybe I would call it homeopathic amount of THC maybe more therapeutic I talked to a number of veterinarians that believe that cannabis dira a CBD has been more effective in their patients than hunt driving can you research any information about that well I personally I think that's kind of an urban myth that you'd meet tac for a product to work there is there I would like to make a definition there is something we call isolate which is like ninety-nine point seven percent pure CBD and studies have shown that when you're using that pharmaceutically purified CBD that you need much higher dosages of it then you would need with what they call a full spectrum or a broad spectrum extract full spectrum broad spectrum extracts simply mean that you have all of it you have the full spectrum of terpenes and major and minor cannabinoids and flavonoids that are naturally occurring in the plant also are in the extract and as an herbalist I can tell you that the whole plant works much better than any isolated part of it and that's why we're able to get good clinical response at lower dosages with broad or full spectrum as compared to isolate for the last three and a half to four years I work for a company where I've designed a product that we sell specifically to veterinarians in the last four years we've distributed a 150,000 bottles of this product and put it into the hands of veterinarians who have then gone ahead and just and dispensed it to their clients for their favorite pets problems and this product has zero THC in it and yet we are getting remarkable results with it without any THC without you only a perfectly small amount of it so so I think that THC has good effect and I think that the THC could have good effects when combined does have good effects when combined with the CBD but it's not necessary and I think there are risks associated with THC and dogs who are sensitive to it so I think that you know as long as you're using the right potency of the product enough milligrams of the CBD whether it has THC or not may be more important whether you're treating more severe pain you're treating more aggressive cancers those seem to be needing more THC then simple uncomplicated pain anxiety epilepsy in fact THC has been shown to maybe precipitate some epileptic seizures so it's so we're still learning you know and there is controversy around it and I think that as long as you're using low levels of THC that aren't going to be you know adversely affecting the dog I think you're okay but I don't think you need it I don't think it's based on this experience that I've had this empirical experience with you know one hundred and fifty thousand bottles it's a lot of conditions of course in your research are you so we can cover that seizures pain anxiety what are some other indications that you would consider reaching for CBD for when it comes to managing either mental or emotional issues of dogs and cats or physical issues and and and would just to talk to me a little about dosing with some of those are there is there like a lower dose for anxiety versus obviously higher doses and more frequency of dosing in certain conditions how does one go about navigating that is that one question okay so those are good questions so I'll start at the end we are finding that for conditions like anxiety or behavior issues that using a lower dose seems to work just fine and I've established a range of dosages and I'm going to be using the metric system to describe this although we probably need to translate into pounds for for your average pet owner but in general we're looking at a tenth of a milligram per kilogram of body weight at the low end and five tenths of a milligram per kilogram of body weight at the high end so at the low end of 0.1 maybe two point two point two five that's a realm that works well for anxiety and can work well for minor pain and we've even seen it have some effectiveness with epilepsy so my suggestion to the the pet owner who's looking to introduce the CBD to their pet is to start with a low dose because oftentimes we'll find that an animal will respond really well at dosages that are much lower than we would expect they would respond to and you know the stuff isn't cheap and and there is always the potential when you're using something new and an animal that it could have some sort of an unexpected reaction so I think it's always best to start low try that for a couple of weeks see if you're getting the response you want and then bump it up a little bit we know that you know I'm talking about a tenth of a make per kick twice daily but we know in the safety study they were doing five MiG's per kick and that was safe so there's a lot of wiggle room with dosage and the the mantra with human medical marijuana is start low go slow and stay low but really you're best off working with the lower dosages the more physiological dosages than the pharmacologic dosages but you know there are in terms of applications you know certainly anxiety it's interesting how it works because the cb2 receptor will connect with the same receptor that produces the serotonin the serotonergic types of neurotransmitters and that's where we get the relaxation but when we have but we also can use it for pain response anything any condition that's an inflammatory condition so irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease asthma these all could be good applications for it a lot of people want to use it for atopy for you know allergies and it should work for allergies because there are CB receptors in the skin of dogs that measure we've got some studies that show that but I don't anecdotally here clinical reports of animals who have atopy responding well to CBD maybe we're not using the right dosage maybe we're not looking at the right things but theoretically it should work but we haven't seen it action work and Rob do you ever dose more than twice a day or not really you could the the pharmacokinetics study that was done showed a half-life of four to six hours which implies really three times a day dosing but it's not that practical for most pet owners to be able to do that three times a day so we're reps and twice daily seems to work fine and in fact even once daily sometimes works fine so I think three times a day would be more for where you're trying to you know get even higher dosages and maybe the animals little is that isn't compliant with larger volumes of the the CBD or is it are there receptors and all of these tissues so it could be beneficial across all types of pain it is good for many types of pain especially neuropathic pain because CBD has an affinity for the nervous system crosses the blood-brain barrier it actually works directly on the nervous tissue to reduce inflammation to reduce pain so it does work on all kinds of pain as you get into more severe pain that's where we need to bring in the THC well because CBD and THC actually treat pain in two different ways CBD treats the pain by reducing inflammation THC reduces the pain by actually interfering with the pain signals from the no sassette nerve endings so when you use both of them together you get a much better pain response and in respond you know going back to your question about do you need THC when you start getting into more severe pain yes you do need more THC but it's problematic because you need more THC than is available in hemp which means you're going to have to be going to marijuana you're going to have to be going to a medical marijuana dispensary to get a product that has enough THC in it to affect the pet to reduce pain and then you've run into a slippery slope because if the animal if the dog has no exposure to THC it's given accidentally too much it could have - could be sent to the ER by having an adverse response as we're seeing many dogs do so that's that's another reason why I'm advocating not getting too involved with THC and really the the use of the THC is something that should be recommended by a veterinarian you know this is a it's a drug like sub-teams is much more drug like than CBD veterinarians need to be involved we need to be like a medical marijuana doctor does and give advice to human patients about how to use THC how to introduce it and how to develop tolerance you don't have adverse reactions and yet veterinarians are having their hands tied across the country by veterinary medical boards who are saying we can't get involved in this and this is all because as you and I mentioned privately before the legislation when it was passed for medical marijuana for humans did not include language to include veterinarians in the process and conversation and that's wrong and we have to go back now we have to go back we have veterinarians aren't very politically active but we need to enlist the aid of pet owners we need to do petitions when you do political action so veterinarians can be consumed language can be inserted into the legislation allows veterinarians to give advice about the use of THC we're seeing something like that starting now in California dr. Gary Richter has done job getting that legislation moving in the right direction it's moving in the right direction it's not perfect but it's good first step many desperate parents are seeking the advice from a dispenser you know a 26 year old without any pets at a dispensary who has no knowledge of a Denari medicine and that's where those sometimes things even further south because there was not knowledge of canine and feline internal medicine basics well and it's crazy and the pet owners are desperate I don't blame them you know they're their animals get really sick many of the conventional therapies that we have are not as effective as we'd like them to be they could be toxic they could be just figuring they could be expensive and they might not work anyway you know as cm and cannabis does seem to offer some solutions that are non-toxic and safe and not that expensive but you know I've spoken with pet owners who have who've actually had marijuana sent to them from dispensaries in states where it's legal when they're in states it's not legal taking great risks yeah terrible risk yeah okay the Big C just recently been a little confused yeah because I I didn't realize I read two reports and I have no idea how how the study design was set up I just don't know enough about the topics to speak wisely about it I assumed that cannabis or hemp drug products would all be safe and every type of human cancer but there I've seen I read some reports that in some instances it appears that certain extracts could actually feed a cancerous process and then I became very confused and I'm anxious to talk to you about this is there ever situations where pepper cannabis derived products would not be indicated or could be contraindicated in certain types of cancers that's a good question and really we don't have all the answers to that parent I know that I've seen some remarkable responses to cancer even with just sea alone without I have not but I also think that we're seeing a lot of backlash people that are trying to to to latch upon one little negative aspect that may if may be real may not be real as a way of kind of countering this trend towards accepting cannabis there's still are quite a few people out there that are negatively disposed towards it but I worked with an oncologist out in California one of the leading largest referral centers in the country who you know clients are coming in with putting their animals on THC and CBD from dispensaries in California and she's been helping them tweak the dosages and make sure it's safe and she's been getting some remarkable remissions but we do know that not every tumor cell is responsive to to cannabis it seems as though carcinomas are more sensitive than sarcomas just kind of as a general as a general kind of rule of thumb and I did I with this oncologist I was actually able to get accurate concentrations of the product and accurate weights for the animals so I was able to determine what how many makes per keg of THC were being used in these animals that went to remission and none of them went higher than 0.85 milligrams per kilogram twice daily of THC something women's highest 4 or 5 MiG's per kick twice daily of the CBD so it's not like you need a whole logs like they have to be little walking zombies all the time totally stoned out in order to treat the cancer I think really lower doses can work just fine tumor cells have receptors on them for THC for 4 endocannabinoids and that's why the that's when THC can down regulate the growth of the cancer so and CBD promotes increased blood levels of our own endogenous THC which is why CBD can help with cancer as well that's it's the science is just beautiful cannabis words I'm really I'm really just addicted to it I'm gonna take you to the science your knowledge base that the rest of us are learning and so we also appreciate desire and passion to share your information it's obviously really important it's a totally confusing topic so then along this same kind of vein when it comes to administration is is there a difference between teachers capsule powder patch talk to us about administering these herbs well we know that that CBD THC are not very well absorbed orally but they are absorbed well enough to have an effect it's just numerically the absorption is not not that great and yet we can take them orally and still get very very good results so if you're giving if you're going to be giving it long term it may not matter whether you're using a product that has a rapid onset or you know it's better absorbed or less absorbed because over time it all kind of evens out and you can get even blood levels with it I think the most convenient the most popular format right now is what they call it texture which is an oil infusions liquid and the value of that is that you can actually start low with just a few drops and as you see how much effect it needs you can start adding more if they need it or if they don't you might have two different sized animals in your household and rather than you know and you could just use one single bottle that could treat both of them maybe five drops for one and you know 15 drops for the other but you know some animals don't like to have liquid put in their mouth you can put the patient on the food but it's best if they if you if you put it on a small amount of bribe food in between meals just so this very expensive poorly absorbed oil doesn't get lost and all the digestion and just gets pooped out versus gets you know absorbed properly but whether it's a capsule whether it's a liquid think they were looking at some transdermal technology the patches there are patches already the problem with patches is that you have to grip some skin some hair in order to get skin contact I think for transdermal I think the peel of gel in the ear is probably more appropriate there was a study done at CSU last year where she compared the absorption of squirting into the oral cavity so it absorbs through the trip through the mucosal membranes taking it orally so it goes down through the limb to the stomach and digestive system of liver or transdermal and she compared the pharmacokinetics in terms of the absorption of each of those and she found the trans mrs. dr. Stephanie de Graaff at CSU she found that the trans and COSO had the most rapid onset and had the highest blood levels that the oral was second best in transdermal third-best but when you compare it over when you compare the blood levels over a period of several weeks they pretty much all are about the same which is therapeutic so I think that as companies are trying to differentiate themselves what's becoming a very crowded marketplace we're going to see more and more of this sort of marketing spiel about ours is better because that better bioavailability it's more easy more compliant I think you know I think that's good competition is good I think the consumer the pet owner needs to choose the product that fits their budget that's easiest to apply that has the best quality control so we're certain that we're really giving what's on the label and and from there I think over the course of the lifetime of an animal consumer you'll probably try a variety at different types of formats to find what works for them best personal that makes total sense but then when it comes to actually taking a product rub when you say third-party validation is that something that companies would have on their website that it's third-party valid or how does one go about making sure that what they think is in the product is really in the product other than calling customer service and having someone say oh of course it is I mean you need to do more than that so how do you what are the steps that are necessary to really choose a good quality product you the consumer and this takes time and we're and but this is also how you sort of vet the company the consumer has to ask the company for what's called a certificate of analysis and it should be done by a third-party lab and the certificate of analysis will tell you what the potency is of it in terms of how many milligrams per milliliter or milligrams per shoe or whatever it is a good certificate of analysis will also have analysis for heavy metals from microbial contamination for solvent residues and for pesticides so to get and more and more companies as that as the competition is getting more crowded are offering these maybe they will have them posted on the website maybe they're available upon request when the company doesn't have that that is a very clear signal that the consumer should go and try another company there are some products which are labeled for veterinary use like my own company our excitements we sell exclusively to the veterinarian and there's two other products right now that are also targeted for the veterinarians with products that were used for the studies at CSU and Cornell and I think that's a good indication if a veterinarian is carrying a product that's labeled specifically for professional use it has a higher bar of standards for quality control so you know consumers should trust their veterinarians to be able to provide them with the best quality materials whether it's a cannabis product or as a rumor or whatever it might be and what about different extraction techniques that's another thing that you'll hear companies kind of attack each other about is this we need to be concerned or not so much well each method of extraction has some pros and some cons to it you know the higher temperature ones tend to lose some of the more delicate volatile components of the plant the lower temperature ones don't yield as well but you know but still but given that given better distribution of these delicate of these delicate elements ultimately it's not just what you're able to pull out of the plant but whether you're able to remove the solvent after you've done that so alcohol extracts can wind up having zero alcohol residue after you're completed the whole process so it doesn't really matter whether you're using alcohol or co2 the best the best extraction solvents right now are co2 liquid co2 under pressure or alcohol extractions they have the the highest yield and the lowest solvent residue so those are those would be the best whether one's better than the other really you need to look at the certificate of analysis to make sure that has all the constituents of the plant that you want the terpenes and the minor cannabinoids and the content of CBD it's a technical thing I understand a lot of confusion by consumers it's a lot of chemistry in between lot numbers and you know it's a plant and plants change with moisture and seasonal variability and I know that these plants are grown in controlled environments but there's still uniqueness between strains and plants and soil conditions or fertilizers how you know what the solutions that they're using to supply nutrients to the plants I've had some people say that a bottle worked for a while and then that brand quit or this lot number quit is that a possibility that there could be that much variation within one brand of product well if it's poorly regulated yes I mean for for the arts vitamins products that I get from a hemp grower in Colorado called folium Biosciences which I also happen to work for them as chief veterinary officer we make sure that we third-party test every batch and we make sure it stays consistent we've recently had a change in the color of the solution it's gotten a darker green probably because the carrier oil has a slightly different color to it now but when we look at the analyses as far as the content of CBD and the terpenes and the freedom from contamination they're all fine and so consumers are you know are calling us up and asking us about it but we're not seeing any problems with the efficacy but another company's not doing that much testing or maybe is deriving its oil from a variety different sources you could see there and it has a limited shelf life depending on how it's stored and maybe maybe their measurement measuring technique isn't as accurate as it should be so it certainly could see a variation from batch to batch is it something that should be used would you say in a year six months three months with the aging studies with the aging studies that we've done virtually with the with the hemp teachers it's it's it's about an 18 to 24 month window it's pretty good but it makes me kept cool needs to be kept out of light needs to be kept sealed you know and people will take the the bottle and they'll put the dropper inside the animal's mouth and then without cleaning the dropper off they'll put it back in the bottle and then they'll start to see scum battle up in there so you know it's should be aware of that you know if you're going to put the dropper in the animal's mouth or it gets contaminated you should wipe it off before you put it back in the bottle should probably be kept in the refrigerator which will also maintain better shelf life because it does deteriorate I had a batch in my refrigerator a bulk batch about a gallon of oil that was been there since October and I just recently had it pallab reanalyzed and went from 30 makes per keg a 30 migs per ml down to 28 makes 4 ml in a period of nine months it's good but it's it does show some gradual deterioration and that was under the best of circumstances captain refrigerator and Rob how often are these plants spray with glyphosate or potentially other when these when these plates are being mass-produced is it a plant that is highly attracted to insects where in theory pesticide application would be a commonplace or is it more resistant to pesticides generally speaking is there it would be should we be concerned about pesticides well pesticides need to be tested for period I mean because we know we don't know if there's some some drift you know from a neighboring field that where pesticides are being applied so that's why testing is very important and the hemp plant is what we call a bio remediation which means that it will pull up stuff from the soil and actually they used hemp plants around the Chernobyl accident to draw toxins up from the soil now you can't use the plant after that you have to burn it because it accumulates these toxins in it and certainly plants that are grown like let's say in a high selenium soil could have high levels of selenium that could wind up being a problem could be toxic as well so that's why analyzing is really important to know you know what she got and but they have plant itself the cannabis plant itself is very resistant to pests and very resistant to to most everything you know when it's grown outside grown indoors we tend to see more mold we see insects and things like that but outside the plants are extremely Hardy and usually don't need any kind of pesticide or herbicide applications generally honey you need that much in terms of fertilization your their weeds and they grow they're very they're very robust they grow very well that's awesome so really when it comes to evaluating what parents are kind of faced with this what grain do I go with the bottom line is the company of choice should be happily able to provide a certificate of analysis we happen to answer your questions we offer to provide third-party validation or transparency well we need to move along exactly exactly so that's a real good first place and many companies are recognizing this now and offering you know there's difficut seven ounces the website it's it's something that has to be done you know in order to reassure the consumer that what they're getting is going to be safe and effective well this is a fantastic update these are all the questions that people regularly ask me but it has been a couple years since we've covered this topic so I appreciate you weighing in with your vast expertise thank you it's always fun it's my favorite subject I can't stop talking about thanks so much thank you can dr. Becker pleasure to talk to you", "dE5eY__w_Cc": "- [Inverse] So, what is CBD? CBD stands for cannabidiol and it is one of the roughly 500 compounds\nfound in the marijuana plant. CBD is perfectly legal and is actually the second most prevalent\ncompound found in cannabis. Falling short to the more\nfamous and semi-legal THC or tetrahydracannabinol. These compounds are very\nsimilar on a microscopic level. Both CBD and THC share the\nexact same molecular formula. C21H30O2. Both compounds also interact\nwith the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are found on the\nendocannabinoid system present in all mammalian species. But while THC is known for\nits psychoactive effects. - I feel like a slice of butter melting on top of a big ole' pile of flapjacks. - [Narrator] CBD acts\na little differently. Early research shows that\nit has the opposite effect on dopamine compared to THC. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with the feeling of reward\nthat you get when taking drugs like cocaine and heroine. THC causes dopamine activity to rise, but CBD seems to decrease its activity. Some researchers think\nthis raises CBDs potential for understanding and treating addiction. Early studies have shown that CBD is also fairly helpful in\ntreating anxiety, insomnia and sleeplessness and chronic pain. There's also early evidence\nthat CBD can prevent seizures and some forms of severe epilepsy. And can help normalize brain\nactivity linked to psychosis. In the last few years, its found its way onto\nmillions of people shelves and topical, ingestible,\nor oil-based forms. It's still the early\ndays for CBD, but so far, the world health organization\ndeems it pretty safe. Cannabidiol is, for now,\nlegal and potentially a pretty helpful compound\nfor a lot of people. (light music)", "db3sIVwDbUM": "- I feel like CBD is for people who do not have a weed plug, and can't afford a psychiatrist. (upbeat music) - I want to try CBD because a health food store near my apartment sells it for so much money, and I don't want to buy it. So I pitched a story on trying it for Jezebel. (laughing) - Cool. - I'm generally very angry, and filled with hate. And, I also like to get wavy, and weed makes me paranoid. So hopefully this will be a good remedy for all of those things. (laughs) - I was picturing like a Monopoly piece size. - The thimble, yeah! - Yeah like the thimble. - These are like, I don't know, the size of like, a large thumb, like the tip of a large thumb. - I really thought of CBD gummies as something that rich people who love Goop and The Wing are into, however, it comes in this sort of fancy cigar box, which makes me think that they're french. (chill beat) - It's like slime, kind of. (techno beat) - You get that sort of undertaste of weed, like when you eat a regular edible marijuana. - It's more flavorful than my antidepressant. - Okay - Which I don't chew. (all laughing) - I feel pretty much the same as I did before eating the gummy, but I also just ate a lot grits and pork, I think, so I feel a little tired from that. - I feel like my normal self. My normal self I think is like, everything is fine because it has to be. - I also can't tell if it's like, oh am I just feeling the effects of something, and feel more relaxed and having a good time, or like, maybe I'm just having a good time being around all of you. - [In Unison] Aww, yeah. - But it could just be like the gummy I ate, yeah. - Oh, interesting. Cool. - I kind of felt a little light outside the studio, I had a bagel before this, so, the results might be skewed, I don't know. My results might be different, 'cuz I didn't eat it on an empty stomach. I wonder if that's better or worse? - I think that this is gonna be a video that's partially about Jezebel understanding how we react to food, because I think that some of it coincided with the lunch that we just ate. - On a daily basis, I usually feel very anxious. Constant anxiety every second of the day. I'm not feeling anything right now. - I do feel something that sounds like descriptions of people, almost when you're like, coming up or something. Almost like something's mounting, just like, very subtly or something, there's like a slight tingliness in my feet. - Sometimes with edibles, I can't really tell if I'm high, either, but then some of them I feel it like, 10 minutes after, and I can like really tell. This is more like, I can't really tell. - It's subtle. I mean I feel like, slightly different maybe, but I can't tell if that's just because I want this thing to work. - It doesn't compare to most of the other drugs that I've done, in any way shape or form. However I would actually, like, I do feel very relaxed, and I would say that it is akin to my SSRI. I did feel like actually pretty tightly wound, and quite angry, I do not feel that way anymore. So maybe it is working. My arms feel slightly weird. They kind of feel like... - Like jigglish, like kind of loose? - Kind of just loose, yeah, and it's not like when, don't do this at home, kids, it's not like when you take like MDMA or whatever, and you're like, \"Ah, I have to put my arms over my head!\" - This works more than I thought it would. I think. For sure. - Yeah. Yeah, like I wanna take the leftover box. - Yeah yeah, like, we would split the, yeah sure. - Yeah I'm not sure yet, I might just like, stick to my SSRI, but I mean, again, obviously I took my SSRI this morning and felt rage, and now I don't, so maybe I should. - Maybe you could supplement your SSRI with this. - With CBD, yeah. It just seems like, a little bit, like it's more expensive than my SSRI. It seems like a little pricey, and so perhaps the CBD industry should think about making it where it's more egalitarian, so that more people can use them. - I think these gummies might be good for people who don't want to go full-on into weed, or they maybe don't feel like vaping, or having an edible. And they just want to like, feel something nice, or calming. - I definitely think that it works, and I feel like whereas before I was very Daenerys Targaryen with my rage, now I feel more Cersei with it, where I'm very like, sort of removed from the rage, and then therefore I can use it more as a weapon, which is exciting to me. - I think it reduced my anxiety, in combination with lunch and friendship, and I think that the pain of being alive is a permanent condition. - I must agree with Katie, actually.

But when they try it\nthey're like, holy cow, why didn't I know about this before? (light cheerful music) - [Narrator] Cannabidiol,\nalso known as CBD, has been taking the health and\nwellness industry by storm. One of the hottest new\ntrends is the addition of CBD oil in massage therapy. Meet Zac Smith, founder of the Traveling\nHands Massage Company. A service which offers CBD and full-spectrum\ncannabis-infused massages. - When we launched the company in 2016, there was no other companies out there advertising this service. - [Narrator] According to Zac, using full-spectrum\ncannabis oil that contains all components from the\nplant is more effective than just using CBD oil. Nonetheless, the compounds found in CBD include natural anti-inflammatory\nand analgesic properties that offer relief from anxiety,\nbody pain, and sore muscles. - So we all have an\nendocannabinoid system, and in the endocannabinoid\nsystem we have the CBD receptors. So when you take hemp-derived CBD, it bonds with those receptors. We always say it's best sometime to put it right at the nape of your neck. That's the top of your spinal cord, the bottom of your brain. It's incredibly effective. - [Narrator] CBD is one of more than 100 cannabinoids\nfound in cannabis. And if you're wondering if\nyou can get high from CBD, the answer is, no. THC is the psychoactive\ncompound in cannabis. That's the stuff that gets\nyou stoned when ingested. While CBD, on the other hand, is the medicinal compound\nworking with the body as a lock-and-key system to target those irritated nerve receptors. - CBD works, regardless of who's applying it, or in what other product it's in. When you get CBD into your system it helps a lot of people feel better. - [Narrator] As legalization\nacross the country continues, and success stories are shared, the awareness around the benefits of CBD is expected to rise. Statista shows consumer sales of CBD will approach two billion dollars in the Unites States alone\nover the next four years. And it's not just a healing tool. For some, it's even\nreplacing pain killers, and providing a more sustainable and side-effect-free solution. - We got onto massage ultimately to make people feel better\nor help people feel better.

heavily heavily requested so I think this is one that y'all are going to enjoy a whole lot today we're going to be talking with my good friend Kevin Chen he runs a very fascinating company that is engineering yeast to produce all sorts of interesting things we've talked about yeast engineering many times on the streams and in videos and generally a lot and so it's I think this is gonna be really cool to talk to someone who is doing this sort of professionally and and commercially and also just making a really interesting compound so without further ado let me introduce right your life my life okay oh there we go knocking okay cool ah I'm on TV hi everybody tonight today I introduce myself first or how do you want to yeah just start cool so yeah pleasure to be here and pleasure to a see you all I guess on this nice Saturday afternoon you know it's it's a this I guess just asked me to do this a while ago and that to think about it a bit just because like I got my own obligations with my my company and it's a some professional that I do so there'll be a bunch of stuff that I won't necessarily get into and of course you know opinions are my own when it comes to talking about a lot of the stuff that we'll get into here but yeah we're a company were called hyacinths we've been around for a while now since 2014 working on this particular pathway and doing a lot of yeast engineering we've done some really really interesting stuff with this pathway which we'll talk a little bit about but otherwise you know the whole cannabis industry has been amazing to kind of watch it grow with the past six years and watch the science of it grow and watch the companies kind of develop and being in Canada and watching belts happen it's been super interesting just coz it's like weird yeah that nationwide like legalization or regulation in progress kind of a thing do you remember daddy has been do remember getting the little little card in the mail like saying like it's officially gonna be legal soon oh really I don't know I don't wanna get in that car no oh my god I I don't know if I saved mine but I wanted to frame it yeah and that's like one I mean it's super super interesting to kind of watch all this happen and and we'll talk more about the science stuff but the whole policy around this stuff and and everything is is also huge and it's you know interesting for Canada as a country you know nationwide to kind of create this stuff and kind of force it out in some ways like a lot of people you know we're pretty reluctant about the whole topic and want things to go longer you're not go so fast or whatever else but I guess the the government at the time then he wanted to push it out and for many you know for many reasons it makes a lot of sense to legalize cannabis but anyways yeah so so pleasure to be here you know we I thought this was like a nice thing to do just cuz like it's it's an interesting and fun for me a lot of the reason why I do what I do is because like I like to talk and share and promote science and stuff my my day job as the CEO of hyacinth involves a lot of more like business development in finance related stuff unless so like technology stuff so you know if there's any deep technical questions then I probably won't be able to answer those necessarily anyways it's cuz I haven't been in the lab in a while but I do follow all the tech very closely and watch how everything develops but anyways I think I think that was kind of like you know how how I first met you Justin as well we're like we just we just people who like to do science and people who would like to share what we do and in science and and that's why it's like super fun to kind of be here and and spend a Saturday afternoon with all 411 people I can probably be more by the end of all this cool but yes I mean so so in Kevin Kevin's a very cool guy he does very cool stuff and I like so I mean especially because I'm also working on engineering yeast he has been a fantastic resource just to just to like Santa Santa D Chuck stuff and and just be like hey you know am I am I going crazy am I doing this right he's like and so you know that's been that's been really great so I've got a hyacinth page open write a link to it in the description if you want to check it out it's a really cool company they make so let's talk about the the obvious thing the you know the the stream title says THC but as THC the only thing that you guys are working on no definitely not I mean we like THC is one of a hundred different cannabinoids that exist in cannabis over hundred I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff going on there finding more to like every every time we're like we know all the cannabinoids and they were like no wait there's a new functional group on that one yeah yeah and there's yeah it's all the time new stuff so I mean it's almost I think what we work on is a good reflection of it's maybe a reflection of like how much interest there is around different cannabinoids so you know of course we read all the papers about new ones coming out and and those ones might be you know years away from the market but it's still something that we kind of put on our radar as like hey you know we'll have some development in that maybe one way or another depending on you know how we're broke those all come together you know there's a lot of that's like we're having a bit of a yes dream for use here we can get back in good okay so before the the stream went to [ __ ] we were talking about there are you know all sorts of different cannabinoids and also lots of other things that you guys were working on so let's let's say we can pick it up up from there and I'm just gonna try and keep my eye on the the thing and see if it freezes again hopefully we're good alright so you're saying so so are you are you just mostly working on the different cannabinoids and things in that pathway or are you also looking at compounds from other organisms as well no I'd say we're pretty much set on the cannabinoid pathway other things they look at in my spare time just for fun but or business business-wise that cannabinoids are yeah I mean and that's more than enough of like industry and and market to kind of you know develop and and to work on so it's huge okay fair enough so cool I'm gonna just bring up my notes and and see what the next topic is oh okay so let's talk about the the legality of derivative products in Canada so that we know that the the plant is now legal I mean there's literally a store down the street where you could just walk in and buy stuff yeah but talking about the derivative products specifically because I remember you were you were working on this before the derivative products were legal for sale so like you know you you could still work on them from like a research perspective but I remember there was like a time when you know you were still kind of waiting for the government to catch up before the things that you're making would be sellable basically so how is how has that changed and like it do you know how does that you know affect your your business now and yeah yeah indeed block these comments I'm reading too many of them they're funny anyways so so yeah with the where we sit with respect to regulations yeah it's been dishing to kind of watch things evolve over the years the derivative products that you're talking about is is it pretty so I guess in the history of Canadian legalization first it was like hey you're allowed to use cannabis and cannabis oils for medical purposes only and under prescription stuff and then in October twenty twenty eighteen it was like okay you're allowed to now buy cannabis and stuff in a store and there's like all nine ways to buy it as well just for consumers and then that evolved recently into you like you're allowed to now sell like you know chocolates that have like you know cannabis stuff in them too and things beverages and like a more broad category of things that that contain cannabis for the work that we do you know in general where we're interested in making THC CBD and other cannabinoids as ingredients so we're not gonna grow anything that would be so Keable necessarily but we might you know do something that or it could end up in like a pill or in like a cannabis oil of some sort or canet have been like you know other consumer product areas depending on you know where we get the most amount of interest but I hope that kind of explains like water derivative product is when we're talking about that stuff it's like anything that's that's not a cannabis flower almost and and I'd be like from a consumer standpoint where we fit the most we hit best okay but I would I would have like one one slight caveat to that which is that we might not necessarily see ourselves as a company going you know having a big role in that direction it really depends on who else we work with and how we decide to go to market in different areas and you know the area where we definitely have like a huge you know edge in is in like pharmaceutical manufacturing where you have to have like really strict call a standards really strict like you know supply chain and it has to be really robust to kind of supply people who are actually like using this as medicine and that's where like of course these production versus planned production start to make a lot more a lot more sense that you're going to be from a genetically modified organism I think we're I think they might be like me again damn it some people were saying it's because of my website yeah I mean I scrolled down that okay yeah the little animation thing was was slowing it down right hold the whole website runs out these little animation things that's what I mean you might wanna okay well Celeste open this page although in a bit like now the freaking site hub thing is gonna have little animation do so alright [Music] yeah okay it's still very present well this is definitely gonna hurt the concurrence but that's okay I'm gonna just you know what I'm just gonna pull up your face [Music] yeah I mean it's kind of frozen hopefully the so it says screen froze audio okay so we're just gonna we're just gonna keep chatting and hopefully that'll eventually the video will catch up or something yeah yes the screen froze audio is okay I don't know what the deal with that [ __ ] is but well we'll figure it out okay so um speaking of so speaking of legality waiting for the streamed video to catch up but as long as the audios fine we can still talk about this so the the thing comes from a genetically modified organism so is there extra restrictions oh there is there like extra paperwork that you have to do and like testing before you're able to sell your product because of that or is it still relatively straightforward I mean it's it you know always like kind of it's it it's complicated it's so complicated and and yeah having a GMO thing doesn't nationally make it that much more complicated than there wasn't a moment I would say it you know we've we've had to go through a lot of different regulatory changes over the years and let me think I feel like when we first started out it was actually easier for us to do it this way then it was for us like you know trying grow cannabis plants and now maybe it's a bit more reversed I guess from a regulatory standpoint and in the end it kind of varies from every every country to country that you're thinking about and this is like you know I think I think in the old regulations it actually took a bigger level of permit to grow cannabis plants for research than it did for like chemical synthesis or for biological synthesis of THC website nowadays I think it's all in the same okay and almost so it's actually being a bit easier to work with plants and and as easy it is to work with like a synthesis and stuff but then so in that sense it was maybe easier over here but I guess when I talk about the game over again they get regulations that usually comes into play more when we're looking at you know manufacturing and sales and and what you're actually selling and you know where you're shipping your strains and stuff and where you're doing all the manufacturing stuff like that and then it gets a bit more hairy city life you know if you wanted to do so yeah so like if you're selling the because I guess you're not selling the the organism itself you're selling one of the products so like chemically it's the same thing there's no difference right like GM like organic sugar and not organic sugar it's just it's just [ __ ] Chuck but so like if you were selling like a genetically modified corn for example that seems like it would be more of a regulatory hurdle than if you're just selling a product from a modified yeast cuz I guess there's a lot of precedent for selling modified yeast because like insulin and all the other and a lot of other pharmaceuticals are made through modified products I mean even even like rennet is made through like genetically modified organisms so yeah I guess I guess that would be a little easier like it there is that that precedent and precedent already kind of yeah and there's even like I mean there's ways a complexity that go beyond that of course and this is where like it's it's been a it's part of what makes the job fun you know here every time you look at a new regulation it's always a bit different or every time you look at a new different country it's a bit different as far as how they weight might classify one thing another thing but you know I guess one day people will figure it out and there'll be like more clear regulations for everything but for now I guess it's a you know we're paving that road you know all right that make sense so so so moving on and I guess the one of one of the big question is when do you when do you expect to see the stuff that you're making in in stores for the first time like are you are you getting closer is it still away a while away or like you know on a scale of like one to ten ten being like it comes out tomorrow one being like in ten years like where do you where do you figure you are on that somewhere between one and ten oh great okay I mean it's it's actually it's funny it depends it turns very much on the product that we were working with and how we which market we end up going on first and of course like you know I would say there's a reasonably good chance that we'll end up having products available in like Canada before we end up in the US for example and and there is like a pretty you know clear route to market in you know that we can take and then have our products coming out here you know soon soonish and by soonish I mean like maybe within the next like 1/2 years kind of thing but I get to some extent again it depends a bit on our depends a lot of different things that might like you know get is there and also depends on which product we end up wanting to you know push that route just cuz each you know each can I mode is different and do we want to like you know have you know do we want to partner with somebody else or do you want to do this ourselves or how do we do manufacturing and it's always different as of things I sort of come together have to come together in order to make this all work so so that's the the long long answer to that question by the way as far as like you know what we're able to do now is already like quite good in terms of producing something that you could put to market so technology wise things like are really working and we're really happy with how how we being able to progress you know on that topic like so I guess the big question have you actually managed because I know there's a lot of like theoretical technical stuff of like you know this is how it could be done or you know there will be companies where you know they will kind of pretend that they've managed to do it and then get all bunch of funding and then proceeded to do nothing so like happiness so have you actually done it like do you have a yeah of course yeah yeah yeah so like you've you've got a you've got a yeast that makes that like makes the compound right yeah cool very very cool so moving moving on this let's talk about why yeast is preferred over say just growing the plants specifically like it so kind of from a couple different different avenues like why why I mean like why why yeast versus just you know a factory full of plants like what what is the the just like most obvious benefit intersect I think it I'm thinking like there's a lot of benefits but like what's the biggest one right because I mean there's been something if you if you went down this route right like what was the what was the thing that really made you think that like yes this is the the way to go yeah I mean the biggest thing I would say is just having control over you know what exactly you're making and all of the processes that are happening like in that system to to do manufacturing is the biggest thing there's other advantages in terms of like scale and efficiency and how you can of course like put yeast in a big steel tank anywhere in the world and they'll don't know how to grow it and stuff there's there's a lot of reasons why why used to make sense but I think having having the ability to turn off on and off certain genes to be able to produce one compound or another compound or to discover new ones all of those you know things are are maybe the one of the most interesting things for right now in terms of growing growing a yeast over going a cannabis plant or trying to breed and you guys plan to do something different yeah okay and also it's so I think it's one thing that's that's kind of interesting like when we think about growing the the plants like there's sort of a bit of a misconception that it's this like super green that I mean you know pardon the pun but it's this like green technology where you know all you need is just sunshine and dirt and you can just grow these things but like the reality is most cannabis is grown inside which means that it's grown primarily using grow lights which is actually really energy intensive like I was I was reading a little while ago about the energy requirements of this specifically the the use case was in Seattle and as they were they were moving towards legalization like the amount of energy that the city was consuming I almost doubled just to like power all the lights whereas if you're doing the yeast thing like there's no there's very minimal in the way of power requirements like it's put yeast in a tank you know keep it mixed at a bubbler like you're not you're not you know burning thousands and thousands and thousand of watts on just keeping the freaking lights on so there is that little bit of a misconception and also like all that power generally I mean because most places are dumb and don't have nuclear so it's not like you're if you relieve you like you know if you're running all those grow lights off a nuclear reactor then yeah sure it's very it you know it's carbon neutral but or even carbon negative but like it's that's an almost not the case like it's almost always like natural gas like generators that are powering all of this stuff so like it's very energy intensive so I guess I guess in that regard like the the East thing is kind of good because you can also rely on the like tried-and-tested technology of essentially it's making beer basically like that's like it's making beer except the the end product isn't the liquid it's the you know the stuff that settles out to the bottom like that's that's really the the difference and like we've spent a lot of yeah like a lot of like thousands of years basically making like perfecting the art of making beer so it's like there's that there's that you know president of like we know what we like we know how that works like you get a big tank and you do the thing and you know and also like you know depending on so we were we were talking briefly before we before we got started about what you're actually using to grow the yeast and so something that you'd mentioned was that right now you're using kind of like the ideal growth media but potentially in the future you can use things that are less ideal but maybe cheaper or more environmentally friendly or you know maybe like offshoots from other production of stuff so so can you tell me a little bit more about that like what are you using I mean I know you probably can't get into like super super specific the secret sauce yes yeah yeah I know you probably can't tell me the secret sauce but like it in essence it's basically sugar water yeah it's like sugar water with some nutrients yeah I mean it's it's a there's there's all kinds of different ways to grow yeast on different kinds of media and and you can have been fine control of all the different components in like your your media composition and part of that is what will give you like more or less maybe yield a product too and so it's all it becomes part of like that the game is to figure out how all these different things and do the science into the research to figure out what the best thing is and and get there I guess but yeah you're absolutely right about like you know growing cannabis being like kind of more expensive process it's not growing like the same way that a lot of other agricultural crops are growing that are that are a lot cheaper to grow of course and and as far as future goes I mean yeah we were I guess but yeah we gotta talk about this but for the sake of the audience yeah once I mean once you have a yeast that does this you know yeast can continually be engineered and optimized in different ways and that could lead to a lot of improvements when it comes to the efficiency or environmental friendliness or sustainability whatever costs of of the whole thing and yeah that's part of the you know among the many reasons why this is like an interesting technology and why why we're doing this is that you can you know actually have these futures exist whereas you can't just kind of like you know suddenly get a kind of as plan to start you know consuming a different substrate you know overnight where like you plants or plants like they kind of they're sort of set in their ways like like engineering a whole plant to do something different is I mean it's much more difficult than like tweaking a gene or two and some yeast yeah so actually speaking of that so the idea of like okay so being able to grow THC in a tank obviously has its benefits and it has its immediate scalability so so why couldn't you say because like suspension culture for example exists for for plants right where you can take a little tissue sample and then grow the plant essentially in a liquid where it sits it doesn't grow as like plant it grows as like you know tank of weird green sooo so so why couldn't you do that for cannabis for example I guess I mean I'll never say I won't say never like somebody might be a figured as I would somehow and get to work properly but generally speaking like we like to use because it grows fast it that you can replicate it quickly plant cells are you're taking them out of like the preneur mole growth environment and trying to grow them in these fermenters and then that's where like you had you have to do a lot of special things to the playa cells to make them grow that way and then is expensive like really expensive yeah I mean I'm not like a plant cell culture expert but it's you know you can look at different products that are made from plant cell culture and I think they end up being like you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a kilo gram versus like you know tens of thousands of dollars a kilogram for example or millions of dollars a kilogram kind of thing you also so I've done a little bit of plant cell culture and like the the plant media usually is composed of what's called more chic and Scoob base because biologists are [ __ ] at naming things but also it's a lot of sugar so like you still need sugar like it it's instead of just yeast where it's like you know sugar and a nitrogen source and some air basically I mean like wine like a tube a wide nutrient for example for like growing what yeast like you need like the tiniest little bit per gallon of liquid whereas for plants like you need the more chickens cook and then you need the buffer and then you still need the sucrose so like it seems like you're kind of cutting out a lot of the the middleman with the the yeast versus trying to do it with with plants yeah and I guess the other idea that's important is that when you're growing like the canvas plant grows and it produces teach seeing this trichomes and that's where the kind of accumulates you know the thing reading right student put these big flowers on the plant that that's where the product accumulates and that's like a physiological property of the plant that's like super super interesting but to get a plant cell to do that exact same like effect in the cell culture then you end up with like a much Carter situation because you know clientele culture you got like at just sugar or sells they're all like flit around there and it's not the same environment as like of course you know a cannabis flower right yeah from some of the reading of it's doing like they don't like when you grow cannabis in suspension culture it doesn't even produce THC so you'd have to engineer the thing anyway to get it to be producing the compound in an organelle like in like in an organ of the plant that it normally doesn't in cells that it normally doesn't so it's like a huge engineering challenge more expensive media and it's finicky er like if something gets in there it like it gets contaminated the whole batch is [ __ ] and then you get to start again and it's like so it really does seem like when it comes to if you're like if you really want to grow THC in a tank like yeast really does seem to kind of be the way for it although I mean then there is a the question of like why yeast right like if you just need a microorganism why yeast versus say bacteria or algae yeah so it's there's a whole interesting interesting bunch of questions that come along with that and it really depends on maybe the product that you're making and that's where like I can I could argue that for some products plant cell culture makes perfect sense to manufacture the thing but it really depends on the the product and the cost of it and the complexity of the the actual pathway and everything like that but this is also like you know part of the reasons why you can choose you can choose which organism you want to do in in many ways yeast is great because it's easy to engineer it grows fast you has a lot of different kind of metabolic parts you can play with and and you don't see as much of that in like other kinds of bacteria or in in algae or whatever else you know you have to you might have to fight harder to get it to like take up different genes you might have to fight harder to get some of the genes to actually make function properly in different cell types and or you might have to like do more engineering with the metabolism to get it to like you know do the right thing that you wanted to do right there's more questions beyond this but like yeah growth growth rate and how they react to different products being made and how well it makes different ya can get into this like fun and complicated science of yeah metabolic engineering and I mean I think there was something important that you mentioned in there where it's like you know basically like yes you could express the genes in sort of whatever organism you want but it's not enough to just have the genes there like there's like all pathways require feedstock so if you can't also mess with the genes that control the feedstock you might like have great expression of the the couple of genes you want in like e.coli but if they don't have the ability to produce enough feedstock it kind of becomes a moot point where like you're just you're just not gonna get a very good yield even if you can express the genes just fine like like e.coli are very easy to get genes into but if they're missing the the like basement and metabolism to get you the the stuff that you need for them to even work like your yield is gonna suck yeah yeah and that's like I mean so many that's where it gets to be like yeah pretty complicated interesting science I mean it's why it it's part of the fun of the scientific job I guess and you can you can have a whole two hour session just on that or something like that right so there's there's been a couple of questions asking about the pathway so we'll get into actually talking about the pathway in a little bit I just wait I've got like a list of questions that I'm just kind of working my way through so once we've kind of talked about all the the background we'll talk a little bit about the pathway closer to the end because I mean it is a very interesting pathway there's some like really really interesting chemistry in there that I'm excited to talk about and also I'm gonna be showing there were some comments about the side link like I've you you provided a paper that from a different group that is doing this and and you know one potential pathway that they're using and because I think one thing that it'll be important to talk about later is that you know there's there's there's many ways to skin a cat right like you can you can get to the same end product chemically through very different rats like their might and and you know one route that might be easier to engineer might not necessarily have the best yield and and that kind of thing so we'll talk about that a little bit later so let's just kind of keeping to the the you know talking about the the industry and the like kind of business aspects of this cuz I mean really like at the at the end of the day the only thing that makes any of this work is the fact that like you've got the you know money and backing to do two thing so where do you see the the industry going like this I mean this is a very new interesting take on the the thing that the industry I mean in in Canada within the first like weeks of them opening the industry up made millions and millions and millions of dollars so like where do you where do you see the the industry going now that things are becoming more legal and and more products are available and all this kind of stuff well yeah for starters all the products gonna be made by yeast one day there won't be any kind of this production going on anymore very soon people will still want to go cannabis in the future someday but a there's I think that I mean the industry as a whole where do I start so one of the interesting ways to think about the industry is you know looking at the alcohol industry you are the tobacco industry and see how those have gone or are going and see where cannabis like could head eventually and you can draw all these like interesting cultural comparisons between like all these different things that exist I mean as a whole it's like a lot of interesting questions that like you know everyone has to ask for themselves culturally and also black politicians have to figure out like how do they see this unfolding and and how do you see you know legalization existing or continuing just kissed or do you see it going or not and what else you know it's it's I think one of the cooler and more interesting ideas about this stuff is that you know it's this industry that's coming from this very like taboo black market into like this legalized market and if you think about like you know the way these compounds actually work and and how beneficial they are or how not beneficial they are for different you know cases and compare that to like you know alcohol for example then you know you could argue that the the health impact of alcohol is a lot worse than the health impact of like you know cannabis related stuff or those compounds that are there that are interesting well I mean like alcohol kills literally millions of people per year whereas I think cannabis is killed zero yeah I think that that's like and also like the only the only reason that like cannabis was illegal in the first place was racism Oh like like yeah back I mean was it was it Nixon I remember but the whole the whole war on drugs started as a way to basically shut down like government dissent because they knew they had nothing on the protesters so they're like well if we can just make there right so it's been it's been really you've been watching at one of the Netflix the 13th cuz that the documentary where they they really I haven't seen owe us that ones no I haven't seen okay you talked about about this stuff which is secret it's actually super cool but I recommend watching it you're gonna happen but but yeah you're right you're right it's this interesting set of laws I can devote which didn't necessarily have a solid basis of like reasoning why or it's just like general you know fear of stuff that people wanted it to go one way or another right yeah I mean I remember back in it what like while I was in university just having like casual conversations with people who were like really against cannabis like they're just like no it's evil and we shouldn't enema like I wish but at the time I didn't know that the whole reason it was illegal was because of racism so like I I'd had that like a little bit of tidbit to be like so so oh you don't like it why well you know it's illegal yes but why was it illegal like well cuz it's bad for you know cuz of racism so you know that's yeah I mean personally I'm and this is totally just my opinion I think the war on drugs is really [ __ ] stupid like just it's dumb like it's it's it exists basically as a way to funnel people into prison and then use them as slave labor like it's really [ __ ] for and it doesn't hurt anybody like like someone smoking some pot is not gonna hurt anybody like there's definitely a conversation to be had of like it's not the like magical cure-all that people pretend that it is and like it definitely has health effects like it can totally [ __ ] your lungs up and that kind of thing but it's also not the like evil boogeyman that that it's it's often made out to be especially by what's the best way to put this older you know politicians in the 70s or something like that right 70s it's still all right like like earlier yeah like politicians still think like love to demonize it as this awful like horrifying thing when it's like it's just a [ __ ] it's just a plant chill and it's cool I mean the cool thing is like how many people maybe are being convinced now of the opposite and the way that this is all being reconsidered where it's like you know you can actually ask the question like how dangerous is this really and and actually have you know science back up some of these things and that's part of you know the cool cool things that are happens in this industry and and now that is even being like you know the the leading edge of these kinds of thinkers are starting to do stuff like oh we can do like clinical trials with like MDMA or without science and treat PTSD and start to push things in that direction too which is really really cool because you can you know it started to see these new medicines that are being considered which whereas in history they would not have been considered at all because it was in the legal taboo around them and seeing this like yeah nice way of stuff in cannabis and even more like newer waves coming in like other areas too which is which is exciting too yeah and I mean as and I mean on that topic like there's other plant or well organism derivatives because I wouldn't I mean a fungus is not a plant but like you know there's all this fantastic research on how like psychedelics can be you used for like like really serious benefit for people with depression and all this other stuff and obviously like I I always like to you know put the little asterisk on that one where people get a little bit too excited about this and then less that becomes their only thing it's like okay like you you still probably could use some antidepressants but the fungi are good too but or you look at the opioid the opioid crisis has a can either case example where like that's something that was you know pushed legitimately by like industry and then turned out to be like the worst thing ever right like you can put them in prison for us yeah yeah it's really crazy right so it's this funny so it's nice to kind of see these stories come out and be be open and be like popping the stories and people can kind of like a look at those and say like oh yeah we did that wrong very obviously and and now we can think differently about things which is nice also there have been some really interesting research on in areas where they've made cannabis legal like the use of opioids goes down because you know people have other methods of I mean because it's not magic like it doesn't just like make pain go away perfectly like that's it's not how biology works but I mean when it does make it better and more tolerable and so like there isn't necessarily as much of that like need for like narcotics so you know that's that's been really interesting and I'm and I'm excited to see kind of how that continues to develop especially I mean especially in Canada where we were essentially becoming this like really fascinating use case although I do find it also very funny when like so in Quebec for example like they tried to make it illegal to grow the plants yourself like you could only get it from and you know they always make the same stupid justifications like we need to protect the children what if the children get into the plants I'm like well then you're with the fight then you can make first of all what child goes around just like chewing on the plants like if your kid does that you have bigger problems because it like if they're doing that with like a cannabis plant oh they're gonna have real exciting time when they tried that with anything that's outside they're going to die yeah but you know so for people who are not familiar with this the federal government set it so that each individual province could set how many plants you're allowed to grow and Quebec being [ __ ] Quebec decided to be dicks about this and decided to set that your the the number at zero but this was struck down by the Quebec Supreme Court where they're basically attempting to make something illegal which the federal government has explicitly said is legal so because they've tried to be dicks when the law got like undone and it got set to the federal maximum so instead of just like being you know kind of conservative about it'd be like you can have one plant they tried to be dicks and now it's four so like I just I find that deeply entertaining like because I mean the the people who are in and I mean this is getting into all the politics and chick which is not particularly interesting but the people who are in charge in Quebec are you know they're they're very you know that you know they're they've got that like old-school stance of like all drugs are bad and and also they're fairly racist but that's another problem for another day but yeah so that's that's been very interesting and it also it like you know they'll make the excuse of like we're trying to protect the children when in reality it's like no they just want to have a monopoly on the sales it's most of what it is but anyway so that's that's that so let's let's move on from the the kind of like politics and vitriol because as entertaining as I find it it's it's probably not super interesting to listen to it yeah you know different guests different Channel just for that yeah right I could have all sorts of people just to like you know [ __ ] on the government that's it's my favorite thing to do moving on so so actually well speaking of the government are you preparing for the eventual legalization in the US and are there are there other countries that you're also lying because I know there's like in like the Netherlands like there's some amount of it's it's some somewhat legal like so are you looking at other markets outside of Canada or like you know what's you know what's it what's your take on that yeah short answer is yes definitely looking at at its South out of Canada and and that's one of the nice things about the East system is that there are many vacuums so inside of Canada that you can leverage to do this very quickly it really like everyone Dreier like everybody well I guess we'll talk to me we'll get any more into that later and then why is different a bit but are there either wait that does the air side there is many packing facilities that you just like around the world that do this kind of stuff with with yeast and the production so yeah a lot of different uh versus we go a lot of different regulatory considerations for each different country and definitely yeah I don't know what will happen in the u.s. like we'll see how that goes I think I haven't heard too much recently about who's the next one pushing for like cannabis related legalization and stuff but there's been a lot of activity there and of course now I think the majority of states have at least some like you know legal access to cannabis and maybe that's the way that'll go will just be that all the states legalize and then eventually a federal you know government has to make a decision but it's all yeah interesting exciting stuff to see see who will do what and there's even some like finer differences between like whether you're looking at like THC at the product or as like CBD is the product and then whether you're going like hemp or whether you're going like cannabis and then it's also gets a bit funny but yeah a lot of a lot of interesting lot of doors that are that are opening very cool very very cool I mean I personally I look very forward to seeing it it all get legalized in the States just because it's I mean kind of getting back into politics it's like it's just funny watching the like old stupid politicians being like there's Brad whereas like I think it's it's the like a significant majority of Americans are like no this is fine the [ __ ] you talking about like so you know that's that's been very interesting okay so let's get into some of the the more technical aspects of this and you know fingers crossed that as soon as I tap off of Skype that the stream doesn't just [ __ ] the bed but okay let's let's start with the the simplest cuz it was something that you sort of just mentioned um when it comes to actually growing the yeast like what does that look like like so I mean it's it's some flavor of bioreactor I assume but like what what does that look like is it a big steel tank is it you know smaller little reactors like how is it is and like do you is it gonna be grown in like a large batch that you then harvest or is it something that you're kind of constantly pulling off you know small amounts of the yeast and media like howhow are you looking at that like what's the because i mean like you said it like you said that it's not like growing beer so growing beer you do it is as big batches so I guess you're doing kind of constant systems no not necessarily and that that's something I'll defer to like you know we it's it's pasta development it's like a workflow that you try to figure out like what's the best way to make something and and maybe it is by doing a batch maybe it's by doing a continuous like extraction process there are different ways to to go about it and and it's a lot of stuff that you know might become like trade secret stuff will become patentable stuff one day someone get too much into exactly what we're what we're doing but it is fundamentally different than like growing a beer yeast where you're trying to get it to produce like you know ethanol and and you have like these you know maybe somewhat similar kinds of feedstocks that are always being used there so you know I wouldn't say we could I would say like our manufacturing will look a lot more like insulin manufacturing right where it's like a big steel tank very sterile conditions very controlled environments very controlled like media and all this other stuff and and less like a like a beer fermentation and that's like a yeah and the students we really want to go that way but I don't think I don't consult I'm just just really quickly we just had a donation from mon stead he says I couldn't afford 420 like 420 and for four dollars and twenty cents seemed a little bit too low so he donated $42 so thank you very much Mon stead greatly appreciate it so so getting back on do it I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna see if I can pull up some images of what an insulin bioreactor looks like I am very sorry if this bricks the scream and if it does we're gonna we'll switch back to the Skype view so bear with me if this if there's bricks but assuming that it doesn't then it'll actually let us look at some more images you know not not that also I just noticed that you've got a Spira card thing in background yeah which [ __ ] yeah shout-out to to Elliott Spira and Elliott both - very cool [ __ ] we talked about him on the last stream actually so okay let's let's pull some stuff up so this is the so this is the the paper that you linked to me and it says the complete so the name of the paper for those who want to follow along is called the complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in East so I mean it's exactly what it sounds like it's using yeast to make cannabinoids and included is a wonderful little biosynthetic pathway and it might I mean it's definitely complicated like it's not a you know one enzyme and then it just happens kind of thing like there's a lot of different enzymes in here I mean you can even see that on the you know some of the unlike one one side there's like one two three four five six one eight like there's like nine different enzymes just to get to like one of the initial feedstocks so like it it definitely has its its quirks but I mean the main thing here is basically it's it you get two two different products so GPP and oay and we'll talk about those second I'm just trying to keep out of the corner mud and see if the stream is lagging and it doesn't seem to be so I think we're I think we're good okay so obviously the route that your company is going down is potentially different than this like we said earlier there's lots of ways to skin a cat so which it's a very weird expression but I think about it but don't don't skin your cats leave them as they're cuter that way but you know so this isn't necessarily the pathway that you're going for but it's one example pathway so to me the things that they really stand out here are first off GP p so GP p is actually something that we've talked about in many streams before because it is sort of it's it's one of like two compounds that basically act as the the feedstock for most are not most but many many different metabolites so I've got a window pulled up over here so this is hopefully not gonna break the streaming empty but so for example I'm just gonna I'm gonna move your your floating head here so GP p is geranyl pyrophosphate basically the way that like yeast and plants and and this sort of thing will go about making compounds is very different than the way like we would do this in like a flask in a chemistry lab right so just just the thing that I've got pulled up here I'm starting with this one initial compound like you can make literally hundreds of different compounds depending on which enzymes act on it so the fact that THC is made from GPP is actually I find fascinating because it like I said it's it's something that is you know extremely ubiquitous in in biology um so in this case it's GPP inouye and so the Oh a is a little bit tonic but I'll live tall olive italic acid [ __ ] biology it's hard to browse thanks but so again this is another really interesting example of there is absolutely no reason that we would ever do this this way at a flask but like in a biological system it makes a lot of sense so you can see that it's this really weird long poly key tide this being that the ketone unit polyketide that gets cyclized into the the aromatic group so in this case you've got one long weird compound that ends up with you know aromatic on one end and a dangly hydrophobic bit on the other end and then when you combine these two so like once you've got GPP inouye like a suit is just off the top of your head do you know if away is present in yeast normally or is that something you've got to add so Oh way is not present in this normally yeah definitely at that that's that's the first first recombinant step I guess okay so that makes sense because I know GBP definitely is so okay cool so you'd have to so I guess that the orange is probably stuff that is already in the yeast whereas blue is stuff you have to add and you can see that it all starts from acetyl co a like it's it and or like hexanoic acid these are both like fairly basic simple things we actually looked at hexanol in stream very recently I think was the last week week before so you know all but just to be able to get to this end product because you need this thing you've got to make this whole pathway work which I mean that's a lot of enzymes potentially so I mean I'd like you'd like we said like obviously you can't comment on the exact way that you're going about it but like already just just to get the process going this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 enzymes just to get this first feedstock here like that's a lot of engineering just to get to this point so it's I I'm I just want to convey like how potentially difficult the thing that you guys are doing is like there's a lot of work that's got to go into making these things work and function and just just to make the end product and so I mean it seems like a fairly simple step once you get to this point like you've got your GPP you've got your Oh a and it just looks like it's too in like two enzymes basically just to get to either THC or CBD and this is this is also kind of cool like you can start with these same two feedstocks and just changing one gene dictates what your end product is which so I think that kind of leads into or harkens back to something that you mentioned earlier where you know changing one or two genes lets you tweak the the end product and so you can get these two very different very valuable products using only a small amount of modification like once you've got the like initial stuff set up which I find that very cool and I mean by the by the looks of this this is these are both the THC or CBD a and you can see that it I'm gonna make this little bigger so this is obvious you can see that there's a little T here this is not an enzyme this is just Heat okay good old-fashioned heat so yeah there's just just kind of interesting into it which to me I find this interesting because that's the exact same thing that happens in the plant like when you like it's if somebody is like smoking the plant for example that's where that heat is coming from so it's like the the it becomes the active form when you heat it not necessarily in advance so I just find that interesting so I guess actually that's I mean that that raises an interesting point are you gonna have is one step in your process like say you decide to make your product into a pill or you get is is you gonna have to like roast it at some point like is like to do that that conversion like is there gonna be a like a cooking step and like do you do you expect that to mess with your yield a little bit like cuz I mean as soon as you're heating something like you're definitely gonna destroy it a little bit so like is that something that you're you're already kind of trying to account for yeah it's part of the process overall I'd say and something that also needs to be looked at yeah you're gonna have to deal with that one way or another okay no I think there's something else that we've got going on that's like mainly gonna like you know kind of find an interesting way to cut around that but I won't get into that but basically yeah I mean when people make like cannabis oils for example like you you're extracting from the cannabis plant and then you're ending up with like you know a THC a in this like oil or whatever and then you you have to heat that to to get it to be like decarboxylated and then you actually have the active ingredient in the oil because normally you normally use smoked cannabis right that's where I get me carboxylated but like I'm making an edible like it gets decarboxylated I mean a lot of people will do it before they even start the cooking process but a lot of the time it just happens in the cooking process so it's like at some point you got to put that that energy in there to like knock the blonde off yeah yeah I guess so and there's a lot of actually interesting things beyond that when it comes to like using just see th CA and CB da in their original forms as like more like therapeutic products but you know usually when people talk about these compounds are talking about THC and CBD as being the ones that are the active you know things that that people really want to use that will have like kind of an impact right but you might even go to find more things beyond that so actually speaking of this light so and I mean of course you're you're free not to answer if this is but is there a like because I mean THC and CBD are they like really famous cannabinoids but is there another cannabinoid that you find particularly interesting like something that you're thinking of maybe pursuing one day or has interesting properties like are there any that stand out is basically what I'm asking let me think there there are many best and it would actually maybe I'll think for a second and then come up with something that ferno's maybe more specific but let's see I mean one of the if gonna look at something interesting that's what we're talking about is like a recent publication with a compound called THC they gave it a name which is a bit silly but THC P I guess which most everybody things cuz you never know what's gonna come up yeah hopefully you'll get this paper which is which is talks about this compound just a slightly different variation on th see that that apparently had some kind of like higher affinity for like the receptors which doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be like better or worse than then THC originally was its but it was like kind of a funny headline to see that come out and then like be like oh that might be like an interesting thing and and then but in reality if you know you're gonna file chemistry you'll be like oh cool that's nice to see that they've proven that and like cell lines and stuff maybe you got on transit to humans then it could be an interesting target but do we actually need a stronger form of THC like maybe not really okay with the regular form of THC that's right that's really interesting kinda like they're like it's it does the same thing it's just stronger like yeah and actually if you want to get into like the history of this whole like industry and it's the the perspective of like you know compounds that are stronger or weaker or whatever it's all said this is you is this found in the plant like as far as this synthetic as this found in the plant so you could I think this is one that the recent so we've seen minor camino it discoveries so like you could breed the I mean this would be a shitload of work but like in theory you could you could breed plants for this cuz I know that like the actual biochemistry of the plant itself like you kid there's a there is a hard threshold of like how much THC you can actually get in the plant before it just dots so like I think it's about 24 or 25 percent it just it plant gets real sad at that point like it does it doesn't like it yeah so I guess that that that raises a really interesting possibility of if you could breed this stuff and select for this rather than the traditional THC you could get more potency in the same amount of like gram for gram worth of stuff and and kind of surpass that strength threshold which sounds kind of [ __ ] like 25 percent cannabis is already very strong thank you you'd have to be like have a heroic tolerance to be able to even like deal with that casually without it just knocking you on your ass for a week but you know hyperbole obviously but like it's that's a really acting concept as as people like especially now that it's legal and people are able to study this more that it'll open up these like new discoveries of like hey you know maybe we've been selecting for this the wrong cannabinoid all these years maybe there's you know maybe there's something better so that's that's really interesting and I think it's yeah I mean it's like one difference of bond-like it's a trans instead of a syst bond or something like that's that's yeah wild you could get into actually I had two things to say on that one is that it's it's a fun thought experiment think about like why why wasn't this compound not already selected for in the book history historical of like you know use of cannabis like people say like oh yeah you know kind of busy be so much weaker like years ago and then people selected for it now you have like these high THC strains or whatever but why why wasn't why it was THC P not the high you know high THC strain or whatever and I guess I'd ties back to like you know some fun name is a evolutionary geneticist watching and who can dig into this and sugar and seven or something like that but I guess like Brussels sprouts like how Brussels sprouts used to suck and then people kind of went back through all the old heirloom varieties and found ones that were not gross and so like those became suddenly this is why like there's been this weird Renaissance and Brussels sprouts so I almost wonder if that would happen with this compound like if people start going back through the old like weaker strains finding one that's much higher THC P content and then just like using that as a new breed stock like that could be fascinating maybe but this is a this is my other point there's a there's a big big asterisk there which is which is that you don't you don't want to mess with this system almost in that and that in that in that way and if you look at the history of of the endocannabinoid system I guess and you can you can google around like all the the drugs that came up for the system and basically long story short there was a compound that people try to develop which is for when you've lost them for obesity and it did hit like the same receptors that THC hits and hit them pretty hard and it's kind of like optimized for that almost like it's one ease designer you know when when you look at the the structural biology of it and you designs things right and what ended up happening is that that drug got to mark it and then got recalled and eventually cut out I think altogether just cuz it was one of the big side effects was like really hard depression suicidal thoughts okay so you can look at the story it's the park is called Ramona bunt and think it was Sanofi that that was the one working on it and I don't get into the too much of the complications of how big firmer works but basically yeah you don't you know they want to have this compound exist and and have it you know be the main driver this industry because you might start to see those kinds of things and that also gets into the argument of like you know the term like synthetic cannabinoids which are like you know chemically synthesized compounds that are hitting the same receptors but they're not TV and also you need enough coming from plants and just these new compounds and that's where like yeah you have these stories of like I think it was the bath salts stuff that was a huge controversial in these new black market drugs that are coming out and causing all these problems so I mean THC is good because of the history of it like there's literally thousands of years of safety data in the sense that like people have been using it for thousands and thousands of years whereas all this new stuff you don't have that like historical precedent so yeah maybe THC P is way stronger but like like you say it could have horrifying side effects that maybe that's not what you want necessarily so that's that's really a thing that but I mean you could say yeah but I I look forward to those clinical trials like yes like but this is also the most fascinating so interesting things about this the endocannabinoid system thing right it's like this this system of receptors that you know does it seems like it has its hand in a lot of different things related to like human development related to like psychosis and all this other stuff obviously but there's there's it's still people are still trying to piece together these different receptors and how they all work together and whatever else it's not like a super simple system and for example like CBD people like CBD doesn't hit these two yeah you're looking at I guess looking at the live stream but I know this is like a few seconds behind so I'm like I don't know where we're at now see you on CB t receptors if you look at those receptors in like what hits them that's not like it's not like if you hit the cb1 and cb2 receptors harder you're gonna get more or higher or whatever you might just have like you know worse things happen is sometimes it breaks yeah yeah and then that then you had like these yeah stories that people using cannabis for things and so it's like this weird all those like weird backwards stuff happening with this this plant and what people are using it for and how that might one day become like mapped out from like a receptor standpoint but for now you know it's still a lot of science that's being done a lot of figuring out like how each compound works with which parts of the you know I like the biology and humans that it's hitting and it's one of the big challenges and I think if it was a simpler system than like you might not even have a as much attention towards this this stuff but because it would be solved to kind of cook the meeting but anyways right I mean it's fascinating I yeah and I mean this is this also like that that really does touch on the like I mean so I took a like a pharmacology like pharmacokinetics course at one point also just we've had a couple of donations that are like 4/20 themed so we just somebody donated four hundred and twenty rubles that was so thank you but you know so it and it was it was really interesting that like you know there's a few main like targets for for drugs generally but it's these tiny little changes can be like the difference between something working really really well and also having a horrible side effects and especially like when you get into the like generic versus like the original thing like sometimes they'll just like stick a functional group on a on a compound and technically it is equivalent and so you know they can there's basically like these these weird examples where if you stick specific functional groups on things like you can just barely shift it enough that it's not patent-protected anymore and you know because it's so similar you have their amount of clinical trial that you need to get it approved is way lower but because you've added this functional group there is the chance that like it might have been really important and then like it can have wildly different effects and so like that can be really really tricky and that's why some people will have [Music] like you know really unpleasant side effects when they switch from like the the name brand to a generic so that's really interesting I'm sorry that we just had a question it says all trips down is this more cool than economical so what do you think is this is this more cool than economical I don't I don't think so I think it's I think it's well you know I mean it's not really cool any cool pretty cool but I also think like it's very economic like my drawings also very very cool like Hank of THC and like swimming around in it sounds entertaining but like also it sounds very valuable yeah I mean I mean very quickly it starts to get a yeah sometimes my depends on my my days like sometimes it feels more cool but but it is still very very cool we got her yeah like I mean the number of days that I've been working on the spider silk thing and I just want to like light everything on fire just you know switch to gardening well I think it's a thing it happens but no okay cool so I mean that's no sort of what I expected like no but one thing just to quickly come back I'll correct you on this that the generic generic versions of a pharmaceutical product are supposed to be identical like factually identical I think what you're talking about is something called biosimilars where it is like a slightly different modification and gets around these like patents and then you end up with like maybe different different effects and but I don't want people to start buying brand-name drugs and that's really changing the economy but that direction is not like a good thing necessarily for like the the main compound isn't necessarily the difference like some sometimes in a generic like the the main compound is the same but they might have added a different like filler or something that [ __ ] with the exact behavior of the hill in the person not that not but I mean that's not to say that a generic is worse than a brand name I mean it is I mean I'm like I'm on a generic and it works just fine but there definitely have been cases of just I mean it's it's biology as soon as you [ __ ] with one thing like somebody's system is gonna respond to it differently so yeah and I guess there's a there's another interesting area of like experimentation that's just around like hey like can we take like yeah again I used to keep these apples DTC is available in like as a pill you can get like THC pills under prescription and so it's a product that exists it's usually used for helping people with appetite and symptom management when they're going through chemotherapy you can also get something that's called Sativex which is a product from a company called GW Pharmaceuticals and that's like a it's actually a cannabis extract that's I think CBD and THC together also available under prescription for the similar kinds of situations and then just recently there's a newer one that came out which is actually a liquid form of of THC essentially which is just like I guess it again it'll get absorbed differently it'll it'll maybe react a bit differently but it's you know all variations on the same same sort of thing and maybe in the end this is better for consumers because you just have like all these nice options that you can choose from and if you if you can't swallow pills and great and take a liquid option right and also I mean either with like speaking of THC specifically like I know lots of people who are totally fine to smoke it but as soon as you put it into an edible they're like nope I'm I'm done like they'll they'll have like you know heart palpitations or whatever whatever the case may be like wildly different effects even though it's exactly the same compound like that that delivery mechanism really can radically change just the way your system responds to things and I find that fascinating I mean it's it's totally not necessarily fun to experience it firsthand but but from like a detached scientist perspective like no this is fascinating apparently if you deliver through one organ it goes this and you know that kind of thing so like that's a find that fascinating totally yeah and this I mean the crazy thing about the cannabis industry specifically when you think about that stuff is that you have so much experimentation already happening when it comes to like you know the different edibles different oils different ways people are dosing themselves at the stuff like both illegally and and legally I guess and that's that's what I mean where things start to yeah it's a little bit backwards where you have a lot of first-hand experience that's coming back and being put into like the pharmaceutical industry maybe and then people developing products like has a reaction almost but yeah I mean like especially because it was illegal first like yeah and and that whole the whole culture of it developed whilst it was illegal and now they're trying to like you know back propagate that essentially like I mean I remember when like concentrates were first becoming a thing and I mean cuz like hashish has been around forever but like the the like the butane extractions and now the the co2 extractions and all this kind of stuff like we have lots of data on what happens when you interact with the plant but we don't have a whole lot of data what of what happens when you're like literally just taking in the pure thing so you know that's that's been very interesting that now there I mean know that it's legal they can actually study this [ __ ] properly which really is what they've needed to do the whole time and like I still think it was done that was illegal the first place but like it's I I hope that now especially now that they're looking at other things like MDMA ketamine all those kinds of things and looking at them for pharmaceutical or like from a pharmaceutical standpoint like I think it's I think people are kind of learning their lesson from cannabis and that like you really do need to like get as much studies done as you can but because I mean inevitably it's gonna be applied to millions and millions and millions of people so you know getting getting as much of that info in advance before you have to find [ __ ] out the hard way is definitely definitely valuable so I think that's yeah yeah so like everybody's learning a bit from how this is uh this whole industry is developing and you know what and this is like why legalization is also such a complicated thing we're like yeah sure it's a you know statistically or whatever else economically you can think of all different reasons but also like you know the hope and dream was that you legalize cannabis nobody gets hurt right but then in reality maybe some people do get hurt and then you have to you know deal with that I guess and I don't know I'm not an epidemiologist or like a policy analyst or whatever else so I kind of can talk about these things and not feel like I'm trimmers are supposed to do anybody I guess yeah and I mean that's the rest the responsible thing like I mean there's there's nothing worse than somebody pretending they're an expert and then being wrong yeah or like I mean there's actually funny if you everything so it's it's all it's all super cool it's all really interesting biochemistry if you want to like you know think another funny thing about you know cannabis legalization stuff I think one of the points that I remember being a the age at which you're allowed to start buying cannabis in Canada was one of the ones that maybe was the gay bigger conflicting point when people had more flexibility on how they wanted to do that and that was like very much a on one hand I think the science was saying like not until you're 25 or like there's like a task force out coming together with within Canada it kind of said like yeah we should set the age here but then the federal government decided that actually should be kind of either 18 or 19 and then of course Quebec I think is 18 and then other provinces are 19 it depends on how they how they match it I mean Quebec is trying to push into the 19 actually I think they wanted to put out like 21 like they really wanted to push it back yeah and actually legitimately that could be the right thing to do of course and that's that's why I like the task force recommended to 25 or whatever something higher and then but I think that might have been I think one of the main arguments against that was that actually you know a lot of the use cases of illegal cannabis end up being that age smaller age range anyway you kind of want to be able to address that with like the legal market and then it becomes an economic decision rather than like a health care one but and also like if you try and restrict it to 25 then you end up with the exact same problems that you have with alcohol or cigarettes or any of the other things it's like yes technically it's illegal but if it's available people are still gonna get it regardless and like I mean it was and that's the thing it was illegal for a very long time and it's not like people in who are like 15 or 16 have any real trouble getting it like it's a thing so you know that's I suspect that they probably took that into account as well like it's like from a science standpoint like yes you should avoid it until at least 25 so because then it can sit as you know interactions brain development and all this other stuff but then from like an economic standpoint and also just a legal standpoint and a like functional standpoint like how do you actually keep it out of people's hands and like because if you make it illegal and people are just gonna get it anyway like now you're just running right like headfirst right back into the same problems you had when it was legal where now you're gonna criminalize people for having it when you know like it's a kind of a personal responsibility thing and also like they're gonna do it anyway so like I think it's one of those like yes you can put out the recommendations of like but you really shouldn't but people are going to anyway like it's yeah yep so it's super interesting super complicated but a part of what it boils down to and this is I mean it's a nice thing to say cuz we have like a big audience here I guess I can say like hey you know when it comes to using this kind of stuff or anything in general in life just like try to be healthy you know you know like you've got you'd be probably everybody has friends or heard of different kinds of people and how they use even like the more psychedelic drugs and you can hear people using those things like really responsibly and having like you know experiences that make sense but of course if you don't do that responsibility responsibly then you're gonna have problems or they're obvious like you know situations that you really want to stay away from like you know you could you could easily argue that you know maybe actually I don't think stupidly like I would say actually a good thing the point that I can point to is like difference between like the culture around maybe alcohol and in different countries yeah where in the u.s. it's a lot higher drinking age in Canada it's a bit lower and in Europe it's even lower and then you have to think about you know which nation that has the most sensible policy and it might be more of a cultural thing where like the people in you know grow up with the right kinds of education and the right kinds of like understanding culturally of how to use alcohol safely or or how to enjoy it I rather than like abused it obviously and the same thing to some extent applies to the the Canada some use a whole and I think that was one of the you know dreading dreaded things about people you know legalization happening is like how many people are going to end up abusing this reason it's the wrong way and having a really bad you know effect and then and then they have to repeal everything which is you're fortunate things happen like that all sorts of problems also sorry not not to cut you off we just had a really big donation so I just need to say a huge thank you to Jack for you we've we've actually just hit our fundraising goal so that's super cool so on the on the next stream we'll be starting the next one thank you so much greatly appreciated I'm glad you enjoy the channel okay so it's back to the back to the discussion at hand sorry I was really exciting I've been so I don't I don't know if you I mean you can see it in the thing the donation goals are I've finally decided that I need a new editing computer because I've been using the same laptop for like five years and it makes very angry noises when I'm editing it doesn't like it so I'm building myself a like a proper tower so just I'm like doing I'm just doing the fundraising like piecemeal cuz you know I want to get good components and I want to make sure that I don't have to do this again for hopefully five or six years yeah you know doing that is greatly appreciated all the people who've been donating by the way super awesome so yeah very very cool so I'm just I'm gonna have just a quick peek into the end of the comments cuz I mean I think we've we'd actually gone through my whole list of stuff that I liked you know we've pre-prepared I don't I don't actually yeah I think we I think we've basically covered all that so I'm gonna just go through the comments and see if there have been any interesting and and also guys if you if you have comments or questions that you want to ask Kevin now is the time so yeah this so let's let's see what we go [Music] this is as soon as you do that like the like comments flood in faster so like as I'm trying to like read one it just the thing keeps moving on its own and [Music] [Music] I mean it's been a lot of like bickering I'm not actually seeing any any good questions yet hey come on like you know now is your opportunity opportunity of a lifetime asked asked the the magical east man some questions I you know I the thing is I saw some some earlier so I'm kind of like scroll up to it to see if I can find them I mean there's there's definitely been some some questions about like you know could other drugs be made this way and I mean the answer is is sort of a resounding yes but it also depends like you can't make LSD just because that's a weird like weird chemistry it just doesn't work but you can make psilocybin and there's been some very interesting papers we were talking about this a little bit before we got the the stream started where there you could totally make psilocybin with yeast you can you can take the genes out of the fungus and express them in yeast and works just fine but you know then it gets into the difficulty of the engineering process and a lot of that stuff oh actually there was one thing it was so you know you're you're selling or you're looking to sell the derivative products so the actual like oil itself but have you considered just sourdough well because I mean then the yeast is dead like you're no one's gonna be you know stealing your intellectual property if you're selling it it's like toast but but is that something that you've considered like or is it I think there's I think there's a some some of the articles that we get featured and had like a picture of bread and then has a quiche or the marijuana leaves on there something like that until I kind of it's just as like a header for like a article or something anyways yeah thought about this I think you don't end up with enough yeast in your dough or in your bread in the end that it actually be interesting in any in any way that's sorry what about like Marmite I mean barbecue grubs but it would do the J like it's not to say that like you know we'd concentrate is any better like yeah I mean if that's something you're looking at like rather than going through that like whole much more difficult process of like purifying the compound like would it be potentially easier to just like make some weird THC Vegemite technically yeah it might be easier to produce a yeast that way but I think you know coming back to like the different processes to use things I don't think you might get enough actually do you think for a second anyway the triceps we thought about this a bit and and but I think it starts to not work actually it starts to break down when it comes to like maybe which yeast is actually used for these different things and like you know do we actually want to try and you know will that Marmite that we might make with our yeast still tastes as good as the Marmite that because I mean because you play so much with the metabolism of the East and the types of yeast that you're using then you might actually end up in this spot where like it really doesn't make any sense to try and do that and and it might be even like fundamentally impossible to like have the metabolisms work you know in such a way that you do end up with both scenario as possible actually and and this is why also like you can't just throw this into like a beer fermenter and get the same amount of product out you but you need some maybe some fire control or different kind of conditions that are gonna really turn up those yields okay so here's an interesting question I've been seeing some questions on like a like a biosecurity standpoint like are you worried about the yeast ever getting out like how are you gonna be controlling to make sure that like nobody accidentally because like if somebody else got a sample of your yeast like they could totally make some but like do you have I mean obviously you're not gonna have to comment on like the specific what are the security features of your warehouse and yes yeah is this something I mean I assume this is something that you you take fairly seriously and this is something that is is on your mind so it is it is something that is on our minds definitely thought about before you know if it were to get out then I think there's it's just get more technically difficult to grow this kind of yeast and that's where I would be like less worried if somebody on the street like happen to get it you there's different this room I could argue different reasons like why it's like make sense or not in the end we're just very careful with how we handle westerns at least and I'm just not gonna let it happen okay but I mean that's that we're only one of a bunch of companies working on this stuff so maybe eventually there will be somebody who does who does get the Jews released and I think I think that's it's a common question in like biosecurity in general is like how does this work and what happens here or there and and maybe hmm I mean have you heard of the the case of the the phage theft but I think we might have talked about this at some point in you know months ago but so there's this with and obviously this is not a one-to-one comparison with yeast because they don't they're not a virus they don't just get on everything but there's this really famous example of there was a lab that was working on a phage that killed a particular type of bacteria and another lab wanted it and you know had sent them an email be like hey would you set share and they're like no so they sent them a physical letter like I'd like an actual like written like please can we have a sample of your phage and so because it was a written letter they had to respond with a written lit written letter so somebody from the lab that had the phage wrote them a letter and was like no sorry we can't give you a phage and then the the lab that wanted it took the letter like sterile e blended it and just plated it and got the phage because there was a little bit like just from the being in the lab like it was just all neatly present and they managed to isolate it off of the piece of paper so like it's a file right like is so is that something that you might be concerned about like are like that may be someone in your production plant might get some on them and like you know so it was like hey man I'll pay you 10 bucks if I could swab your face or whatever like is because I mean that that seems like it could be terrifying from from like a security point of view so yes I guess you but but then again it's also with the yeast so let's someone's like sticking their hand in the VAT like this isn't really like a problem and you wouldn't do that anyway because it's got to be super sterile and all this kind of stuff so yeah yeah basically yes yeah you know it's not it's not so easy to just like get it and then grow it and then you're off to the races you know there's if you are really really smart biotechnologists that maybe you could try and like do something bad but I think we we just it's just part of being a company and having really good security protocols for handling all this stuff and getting gun situations and through it properly so it's not like something we haven't thought of or something that we're like you know particularly susceptible to and yeah you can almost you can also imagine it sort of like the same case where like like Humira or whatever is like this 11 billion dollar revenue drug or something like that imagine if somebody stole the strain that produces Humira and tried to produce that you know on their own probably the company that makes you mad will find out and then also sue the [ __ ] and then you get into trouble yeah but also you might you might have just have like a much does not grow the way that it grows the when we wrote it and then then you end up it's like just it doesn't snot feasible to actually like get a strain that way I mean and I guess like they'd have to be intimately familiar with your process because I assume it's on some weird selection agent with weird media and all this kinda [ __ ] so like unless it was like an ex-employee who like stole a sample and do the recipe and like we're getting into like Willy Wonka territory it's like I will pay you $10,000 for a never-ending Gobstopper kind of thing like yeah the park is like that isn't it yeah right exactly yeah well we all know what happened to the guy in dress the park right yeah I mean the thing is might have not actually seen Jurassic Park so oh really uh which I feel very stupid because like I'm I for all the [ __ ] that I do I really should but I I think it was one of those like it was the best way to put this I have a very low suspension of disbelief threshold and that one does in like it's like the concept doesn't work so like I it's it's hard for me to enjoy it because I'm like that's not that's not that's not how that works that's not how a anything works also like the like then there's the and this this has nothing to do with anything but like the the dinosaurs do not look like that like all of the which admittedly was an older it like especially the original one was an older movie so like some of the newer research where like most dinosaurs had feathers like hadn't been found yet but I just I wish they'd had a big feathery t-rex that would have been so much more fun like so yeah that's that's the thing but I know I'm gonna take a lot of [ __ ] for not saying Jurassic Park so now I'm gonna have to go from now I'm gonna have to go watch it but yeah anyway okay so let's let's see what other what other questions we've got I saw it because I saw a couple interesting ones goodbye I mean there's so there was also a couple of questions from the like offhand and you can't make LSD thing and the reason is that it like LSD is not a biological part like the the precursor is so either like the ergot derivatives or LSA or all these other things like those things can be made bio synthetically they are made by lots of different organisms it's it's that last step where you like take the precursor and actually like chemically transform it into LSD that you can't do by I mean as far as I know I could be wrong maybe somebody's made some weird freaky enzyme thing that does it but like as far as I know there's no enzyme that does that that last switcheroo so you make the precursors be like I mean you could totally make a yeast that makes her got her got amine or LSA it's just the the that is that last step that you just can't do [Music] [Music] oh so so what a question why yeast over algae because algae is also something that's that's typically thought of as you know being grown is the in these huge facts so is there any particular reason why you would go for for yeast over algae like what are their like are there any specifics uh yeah I mean we talked about a bit about earlier but it's kind of depends very much on like process metrics and also like the science going into like how you actually can engineer that organism so for example like the yeast metabolism is fundamentally different from like a holiday metabolism and you could argue that the yeast metabolism is more suited to producing these particular compounds because it has look you know that active you know this was precursors that are need to go into this pathway for example I assume you could get an algae to do this stuff which again there's differences in how you how a yeast will react with like you know being recombinant and having DNA in it versus how in algae would and that's where like this is pretty reliable the so after you've engineered the algae let's say then you can think about how you're gonna grow that and how you're gonna separate out your end product and you know if you think about algae you're more likely thinking about like white and co2 getting into to make it grow faster or better or whatever and that's where like you start to hit some hard like physical limitations you can't get more more light into an algae tank like you can't add more sugar and add more water and that's like even really fast and get it to high density cultures that are really efficient but the algae situation can be more complicated and then you could get it argument like oh but you can grow algae off of sugar too and then right I'll leave it at that like yeah it's processed yeah it is the process in the end and you know yeast is a pretty familiar process and very efficient process and a very vigorous process and then algae you may be like West less so okay I mean I and that makes sense also from from what I know like just the actual engineering of algae is more difficult like it's there I mean they're just kind of they're picky organisms and there just hasn't been like yeast has been extremely well studied because it's used for pharmaceuticals and all this other stuff like there's literally textbooks on all these different kinds of yeast strains on how to and how to engineer them and how to work with them and how to grow them whereas algae like we're good at growing it but actually like messing with its genetics is hard and just things don't don't necessarily cooperate so oh so have you looked at all at terpenes because you you know you've got the the THC have you have you thought about growing the you know the the flavor to go with it or is or are you more focused on the actual like pharmaceutically active compounds definitely more on the the active compounds there although some of the terpenes are starting to let me show some promise of in terms of being actual pharmaceuticals - okay but it that also like those are different pathways that are going to be different you know it could be made more easily by chemistry or extracted from another natural source and then it becomes there's already a process that exists for some of these ones as well like I think women even is it maybe is one of these ones that like limiting this kind of becomes by its industrial chemical it's also forget it yeah yeah we have lemons there's yeah so you know you don't need a yeast that can produce eliminating maybe where you could argue that and work at the economic I have that does that actually okay I got the only reason I haven't tried it is because there's no I think it uses uracil dropout media as the selection or like dropout media with with Europe no yeah it's you're still drop of media so it's it's missing uracil and I just don't have that like I don't I don't have drop up media so it's the only reason I've tried it because like oh my oh my yeast engineering tends to be using gee for Nate just because it's easy and g418 is cheap and drop OBD is expensive and annoying although actually so I bought some tryptophan dropout media I didn't even I didn't even want it I wanted the I came as a I got it as a kit from Carolina they sell the their bio builder kits one of them is a keratin yeast kit and I just wanted it I thought the kit came with this is actually really frustrating that so the kit was supposed to come with pre-engineered keratin producing yeast and that was the only thing of the kid I wanted they don't sell it separately you have to buy it as the kit so i bought the kit and the one thing that was missing that they forgot to pack was the pre-engineered yeast I was so annoyed but it came with a bottle of tryptophan dropout media so I'm like alright well now if I've got anything so I found a plasmid that that's Curie recombinants and the keratin plasmid that I currently have has loxp sites next to every single gene so if I take my pre-engineered yeast that I've already managed to make and I'm you know throw in the the creep plasmid which is on tryptophan selection I can now use that media to make like an integrated version of the thing and then I should actually get like really weird like color differences because depending on which one of the genes is running and in what quantity like you'll get different colors like if the if the keratin synthase stops working but the lycopene synthase is still working you get a red colony whereas if you've got both they look orange whereas if you know you get really low lycopene and really high kara didn't looks yellow so it's all this kind of stuff so that was just something that happened recently but like all so it's it's a very interesting thing of like you know when you've got all in like when you're trying to make a product that requires more than one enzyme like it's very interesting to see the dynamics between them so like especially with something like THC where you've got anywhere from four to eight to ten enzymes that you all need running at the same time like your your yield can vary wildly just in in small changes in the expression and like tweaking the individual enzyme so I think that's what the fascinating if you want to violations an interesting one I think that's another one of these a proof of concept kind of pathways that people like to play with because it makes a purple color and if you if you mess it up and it makes black instead then you play with the enzymes a bit yeah cool and so I'm not really gonna get into like talking about the specifics of Endre enzyme engineering but I suspect that you have had to do a little bit of that like the natural enzymes maybe aren't as active necessarily especially in yeast right like they're the plant enzymes for a lot of them so I assume you've had to do some work and I mean you don't need to go into the specifics but like what what does that process been like like how how do you go about that like what how do you decide like this is the enzyme that we're gonna mess with like you know do you is it done rationally or is it done randomly like do you just kind of like start messing with aminos and seeing like which ones like which end up with an enzyme that works better or is it something that like you find in research and you just try and replicate that so it's it's more like the I guess rational and and irrational approaches on I'm doing is I'm engineering stuff I would say like you know we have done is build like a really efficient way of going about doing that and that we're pretty pretty happy with I would say like our like our genome engineering or and the hydrating platform is really nice the and that's like that's what I get that's all I could save we're good but yeah I mean that's the that's the it's it's an interesting topic to kind of get into like different techniques events and some engineering that you can look at and and how I think if there's any good publications on this clear pathway in general or if anybody's really dug deep into that but anyways yeah getting a bit more technical there but yeah enzyme engineering is fun we do it do it pretty well okay yeah so and and I mean you can you can not answer if this is you know something that you shouldn't talk about but do you spend more or equal time messing with the enzymes in the pathway or have you also started looking at messing with the metabolism of the yeast generally and I this is definitely something we've touched on a little bit but like is like like is it a lot like do you really have to go in and seriously tweak the metabolism or do you more focus on just trying to make the enzymes themselves in in the pathway you care about better it's it's a bit of both and and a lot of like maybe crossover between the different teams that are working on this stuff I suppose yeah what should I say about this so actually I mean that do you have different teams in your company that like focus on the different aspects so like you know one group or some okay so you've got like a metabolism engineering group an enzyme engineering group that kind of thing and then presumably like process engineers and that sort of thing yeah yeah total okay cool how many people do you yeah how many people do you have working at your your company now like because I mean I know when it started there was like three or four you but like it's it's grown quite a bit yeah we were at about over 20 people leading into the month of March and then business is where I stood shut down and stuff and then we've made some like changes to our team since then I guess but that's uh yeah okay so but about about 30 people yeah actually that that brings up an interesting question how has the the the ye old plague affected your ability to do the thing like is it as it like interfere do the research has it interfered with production like how are you how are you handling that because this is I mean your your business is very different than like your average retail business but like it's got to have been affected so like how how has that been handled it's uh it's been okay actually I would say like so so I just thinking about something else for a second we it's been hard because like we're yeah we're kind of a smaller company that's funded from like investors and stuff like that and so a lot of like the support and a lot of like the the way the government was like funding things like you know sporting stuff wouldn't leave applied to us right away in the end you know we we we deal with money in the bank to kind of like lead through the stuff and still make some like really interesting achievements over the course of the past past few months but so I would say you know some hard stuff to deal with being a CEO at this time is like a pretty challenging kind of stressful thing anyway anyone yeah anyone be anyone beating companies through this this period is like under a lot of pressure but but as a whole I would say like we've handled things like reasonably well and and we're doing okay okay fair so actually I think this this actually leads into another interesting question you know let's let's fast forward a few years let's say you're already at at the point of scale and production and you know you've got a product on the market how differently would your company hold up in the case of you know a plague event or serious [ __ ] happening compared to like a more traditional farm like would you have an easier or more difficult time easier okay I would say I mean if you depending on them yeah hypothetical plague in the future like what the next one yeah how's it gonna transfer but I guess you if you think about like you know managing a production plant that does like he's manufacturing versus having to like you know trim cannabis flowers like there's there's interactions at that like you know you don't never have to touch the east if you're ever if you're doing this kind of manufacturing ever when it comes to doing doing this at large scales and so in that sense yeah any also doing you know need to as many staff to kind of run it like a big facility like that compared to you know the number of staff that need to like watch over the plants and make sure that they're all growing the right height and everything like that right so they I can think of all these different reasons why it might make more sense to in the future how's it become more automated right like I mean if you're if you're just processing yeast it's just liquid handling basically like yeah and so that's like right right I mean it's you're handling liquids and goo whereas if it's a if it's a traditional farm like someone has to harvest all the plants someone has to trim all the plants someone has to package all the plants and so it's also more hands-on especially in a the age of hey maybe you don't want to be touching things so you know maybe like at the end of your process it can be mostly automated and you just get like a 55-gallon drum worth of concentrate at the end versus when it's plants you still might get a 55-gallon drum and concentrate but there's a lot more people involved potentially right so that about sum that up yeah basically okay I mean one day we'll have robots that will farm all of our plants too and they maybe it doesn't matter anymore although yeah but farming robots are hard firming a robot very difficult and they're it's very expensive and I mean when you compare the the difficulty of a liquid handling robot on an industrial scale versus you know some robot that has to want like understand and interpret the shape of the plant as its trimming it and harvesting it and working that you know getting it's it's you know hokey bets up and up in the plants space like that is a much more difficult engineering challenge and and like even just computer science chomps like how do you teach a plant what a plant teach a [ __ ] teacher a robot what a plant is supposed to look like and all this kind of stuff and then you know properly interpret all the signals so that it handles it properly and have you know whatever grabby arm thing that you know it's it's a it's a more difficult challenge and it's more expensive and it's probably more parts whereas with your stuff because it's all just liquids like it's just you know turning valves and [ __ ] on and off they tank us up yeah yeah drains fast right like drain every drain into the ground we're being you to go right you know have that tank get hot that that tank is cold you know you know spin that one's a centrifuge that one's solvent you know whatever the case may be yeah that's very interesting so it's theoretically more robust so I think that's also an interesting prospect for both I mean other pharmaceuticals but also just whatever other end products and and cannabinoids and other things they end up making like it adds a layer of robustness in this in the face of the world shutting down which yeah and this is this is the heavy hitters of this in bio hype circle are all in favor of this kind of thing right we're like going good yeah grow yeast in space and then you can do it that way too right and then you have to that's just anything you want uses very true right plants do you look forward to one day sending some stuff up to the space station see if you can t need like a little like petite like you know you know they like the rackmount units they've got on the ISS you know it's like and this is our stove or oh yeah yeah you know do you imagine just having like an itty-bitty one and just like astronauts vaping in space like maybe nothing Esperanza vaping in space or something I don't know what the relevance of bad to you okay I wonder if there might be something there too if you ever wait six months you know in the void of space going to Mars yeah yeah that's something to do yeah somebody is somebody's butt actually bone bone development and degeneration maybe there's something related to the endocannabinoid system there so you might actually have a a therapeutic use okay but for science I like it no no it's your safety babe I mean maybe maybe the astronauts whether you want the video do they do they want this kind of thing up there do they even I don't know what it's like to anyways well cuz I mean they get like weird issues like co2 pockets so it's like if you'd end up like if you if you like hot box your corridor as quarters it just might just hang there okay that's so have you I mean this has really nothing to do with anything but like have you thought about the like the physics of growing pharmaceuticals in space cuz like you're like you know it's fine what it's a tank of liquid on earth like you've got gravity to hold your [ __ ] in place but like I feel like that would be a huge engineering challenge to make that work in in space like things would would slosh around and just float in weird like you'd have to like get the tube into like at the center of the liquid somehow it just did like I don't know it's just I think geometrically it would just be a very interesting a very interesting challenge to like deal with the fact that your liquids don't sink yeah I haven't I haven't really thought about it actually yeah yeah I mean that's fair although although there was I came pretty close to actually this it was a competition that that was gonna be related to some like getting our yeast strains into space as like a research experiment somehow anyway that was like a years ago that I'd tried to do this thing but there there is some interesting stuff when it comes to microgravity and yeast and other microbes and how they grow when else other stuff and I guess there's work to be done and interesting things that I guess all organisms kind of change whether you end up in that environment you know humans I mean it's a trash it also the radiation environment too so you'd have like this is something I've been thinking about like if you try and grow your pharmaceuticals in space like it's a heavier radiation environment you have a mutation it's gonna [ __ ] with your product so bad like it could like it could wreck your batch really really easily I mean there's been a lot of experiments where they try and grow bacteria in space and they get angry like they do not like it why they just they Butte ate really hard and have really nasty products are being produced and it's just it's very strange it's entertaining yeah it from like a from a science perspective it's fascinating but like I would not want to be the guy in charge of that oh man I have they done slime mold in space I feel like they did but also if they haven't they need to because that would be such an interest in your experiment yeah I wonder I haven't I haven't looked into it what else yeah space is weird space is weird stuff it's very weird I like the idea but I'll get there eventually but like yeah yeah I guess you gotta figure out I think so I still frozen at her waist I think moon is probably where a lot of this stuff is gonna end up happening uh yeah anyway cuz I mean that's that's like sorry like [ __ ] Mars thank you the the moon is where it's at and like I'm like I think Mars bases are stupid but I'm a huge fan of moon bases just because it's close and it's it's just a very fascinating thing but I I think you know I mean also there's enough gravity that like your liquids would still probably slosh around in really weird ways but there is still enough gravity that like a tank of liquid will settle and so like I think being able to grow pharmaceuticals in the way that you are will probably be very valuable technology on the moon I almost wonder if that's like because I know there's grants and stuff for for moon project I almost wonder if that's something that would be worth like you considering like if I need a grant all that means I'd be entertaining just like she very fun but III think like long-term like being able to because the only time like that sort of base would really be stable and viable long-term is when you can produce all your own stuff and like pharmaceuticals I think is gonna be one of the most difficult to produce because you know each pharmaceutical has its own quirks but I think you know if you had like a hundred tanks each one produced you had a yeast that produce some different useful thing like that seems like a really viable way of overcoming that problem in this because just cuz it'd be like technically easier than trying to do chemistry interface like well there was there was that I think it was craig Venter that was the one that kind of suggested like oh why don't you put like a DNA synthesis robot on the moon that just like spits out DNA and then you don't even have to have a yeast collection of these various type of DNA being synthesized in here yeah the presumably although that works [Laughter] I guess you could imagine that giving a a you know basic yeast strain and then you transfer me with different pieces of DNA and then depending on what you give it and then it'll it'll make a different public right and then you have to have a right in theory that sounds good but as someone who's actually done like a lot of you know toiled away at yeast transformations like it's not that easy it sounds really good on paper in practice you know but this is this is later in the future when we have a synthetic version of yeast and that actually takes a teenager yeah we yes sure first that and then make that you strain now can can I have it please I want magic yeast that makes my life easy [ __ ] I mean it like forget growing THC that would be way more valuable just magic east yeah make anything that'd be fun okay so let's let's see if there's if there's any other questions but and we've been going for two hours so like if you want to if you're ready to wrap it up we can do that let's just let's just see if there's any other interesting the question was really quick I'm just gonna like skim through so yeah you know it's if anybody's got like a you know a pressing question you know speak now or forever hold your peace we have you a minute or two just cuz I know there's lag on the stream so yeah if you've got some questions leave them in the comments and we will try and dress them but otherwise it's been fun I'm glad we finally I'm glad we finally did this this is things has been a really interesting conversation we got to cover some really interesting ground it seems people have been enjoying it so that's been good yeah I think it was I think there's a pretty significant lag on the stream so it's gonna take them a second to actually start sending some questions if they do that otherwise they're probably just gonna continue bickering amongst themselves as usually goes [Music] okay so there was one question on the stability and reproducibility versus like a cannabis monoculture it's like how's that comparable I mean I don't know that much about cannabis monoculture I would say but like I think like for yeast it's no problem that's easy you do it all the time like it's it's just part of the game for cannabis I think there's a more specific things that you have to do in order to get it - yeah grow consistently and to do that like you know for I guess you think you might be think about like 20 years that you're using this like it's same exact plant in the same exact way to make the same exact compounds for somebody to use for therapeutic whatever and that's I think you know some companies that are doing more the pharmaceutical aspect of this stuff are like you're working towards that or have spent a lot of time like mastering that one aspect of it like for in cannabis consistently and then but that was like I think that's a big challenge earlier on in Canada's industry and still is hard to get like you know uniformity across like every cannabis plant that you grow just about different different conditions that might tweak it a little bit I mean that makes sense Oh will you be doing an IP out like at some point are you looking at taking the company public are you gonna stay private for the foreseeable future yeah good question we'll see who's fair good yeah well when you do that is the question oh yeah yeah of course right a lot of I mean that's like the the whole sort of story right like what do you end up in future and it's like you know hopefully you you find a way to to keep to make the company exist and actually take it like in tests huge a successful thing and then you can decide if you want to sell it or if you want to be doing they don't want to take it public or whatever else right right yeah that's possible fair enough and this I I assume this is something that you'll only be able to be like yes or no but do you do computational analysis to predict the structure of better and more efficient enzymes I think when we talked on that we talked about this a little bit but like short answer is yes yeah but I guess generally speaking you know I did that did this work in my undergrad about like how to use computers to predict stuff with enzymes and it gets to be pretty I like despite many years of computational enzyme discovery in prediction and design whatever else I'll say that the results from computational predictions are like pretty limited yeah so so you know even the best people in the world at this science technology of like particularly protein structures are still still having a hard time with a lot of different cases right I mean that's that's sort of what I expected like do anyways yeah it's a cool topic I love it I love the topic of computation with that prediction that's super cool it is super cool it's just also enzymes are hard yeah and and all the things that we think will work don't often so like a lot of the time it's it's you know you know I've got this great idea and what if we just tweaked is one thing and or you but then you just like mutated randomly change something that makes no obvious sense to you and it just ends up working way better than like okay what right so it's like okay cool there's been a lot of questions like do you are there are there internship possibilities of your company and also like just asking about your hiring practices like are they mostly like PhD and master's student like or people with PhDs masters all sort of thing or do you have kind of more of a like a open range more more open range actually I think we've we've got like a good mix of things and and we don't necessarily you know I mean we have some philosophy where it's like we don't necessary want to hire a PhD to fill like an entry-level role of course that's gonna be more like a bachelor's or master's student that will fill those kinds of roles so you know every rule has its place and person has its place that accompany so I mean yeah that's fair enough but so you're more looking for like talent and skill set rather than like magical piece of paper I say it generally yes yeah I know that's where I'm all about it that's that's good [ __ ] okay that questions already been answered like a hundred times [Music] no okay I've not seen anything particularly interesting so I think we'll probably wrap it up there well either way thank you very much for hanging out this has been a lot of fun I know we were we've been trying to set this up for a little while so I'm glad we finally finally got it done it seems like people really enjoyed it and I mean I think we got to cover some really interesting ground I mean I learned some things this was this was really great so yeah thanks for thanks for hanging out cool yeah this is this as fun as a pleasure hopefully people learned something from this exchange here otherwise people if people have questions is there a spot that they can contact you or and do you have any other I mean there's the the hyacinth link in the description but is there anything else that you want to plug while you have the opportunity good question I don't think so I think just follow that link if you want to hang out with other people who like to do DIY bio stuff and and you can go check out Rico bio I guess that's pretty good bio and we'll I think the websites out of date now but he'll updated maybe and then even the future when people watch this they'll realize like oh yeah this is cool otherwise yeah nobody can send questions to you and I'll answer them through you maybe is it also another approach to that fair enough is there is there a contact page run on Python or is it there is but we're usually pretty slow to answer that just cuz like okay that's that's totally fair alright well thank you very much for hanging

Joseph al chief of the American Journal medicine and I'm here today to call your attention to a very interesting article in this month's Journal it comes from a sub study taken from a young adult coronary risk factor trial that's been following a large number of young American adults for various habits that might or might not impact on their risk for developing coronary artery disease well one of the things that they studied of course is something that's been sweeping the country that is cannabis use and they looked at occasional users they looked at frequent users and they looked at non users and what was really interesting was in fact the inflammatory markers things like CRP and fibrinogen were actually lower in the cannabis users so this is a very interesting observation clearly it needs to be followed up with a lot of research but it reminded me of an article we published a few years ago in which the frequent users of cannabis actually had lower hemoglobin a1c values when they were diabetic so there's clearly something here that that could be used I think clinically to help control coronary risks and definitely needs a lot more research and fortunately I think finally the federal government has realized that we do need more research in this area and they're beginning to approve studies and so stay tuned for more work about cannabis is very interesting you", "pAOZ1Z_KFrw": "so we have a regime in Canada where there's actually laws that allow for recreational use as well as for medicinal use and the medicinal side patients have to register and the cannabis use has to be authorized by a physician rise on the recreational side basically anybody can go and buy cannabis at an approved licensed location so you have two regimes which I believe creates some issues when it comes to use on the medical for medical purposes because patients basically have open access to cannabis what we're seeing is that there's this expectation and the patient side that cannabis is going to be this wonderful treatment for their pain and on the science side there isn't the evidence to truly support that and so I feel very strongly that there's a there's a need for well conducted trials to truly evaluate the benefit of cannabis in this setting but it's almost like the horses are out of the barn patients want it and we have to find ways to better educate patients engage them as well as do the research to actually show whether it's going to be helpful or not as health care professionals we are because the scientific evidence isn't there there isn't the knowledge to use cannabis for medical purposes pain management for example in this setting and so we have a large information gap from the perspective of cannabis and its use in the setting which product to use how much THC how much CBD the dose which way and it should be administered so there's a lot of questions that as healthcare professionals we have and yet again I go back to my comment earlier that patients still want to use it so we have to find a way to embedder engage patients so the consultation service at our Center was really the result of clinicians telling us they were having patients ask them about the use of cannabis for medical purposes in the oncology setting and not knowing what to tell them we had developed some expertise within the pharmacy department I basically went to them and said we can do this we refer patients to us we screen patients we try to better understand what the patient expectations are in terms of the use of medical cannabis or cannabis for medical purposes we assess them in terms of their symptoms and then we feel if there's a need for cannabis or that cannabis may be an option once traditional ways of managing that say pain have been exhausted then we lead the patient and the clinician through the process of registering with with the government approved grower choosing the products and then dosing the product helping the patient go through the dosing of the medication to see if it's going to benefit them we also follow the patient to assess whether it's working or whether it's having any side effects so in a nutshell that's the program we're trying to ensure the safe use of cannabis for medical purposes in our patients can stay with the medical the cannabis side I think there are I actually believe there is a role for cannabis in the management about adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or the symptoms that cancer can cause itself there's a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and that's the exciting part in terms of understanding the underlying mechanisms in terms of side effects and how cannabis can be used to address or to target these underlying mechanisms so we have a research program that we have started looking at very specific adverse effects of chemotherapy that may be immune related and how cannabis can actually modulate the immune system to reduce the side effects for example taxane acute pain syndrome is a is an area that we're very interested in we think that potentially fatigue could be managed by cannabis certainly anxiety seems to be a really important issue with with our patients and we've had some success in managing anxiety with with cannabis in that setting through our consultation service sleep disorders also seem to be at least from our experience and the consultation service seem to be amenable to the use of cannabis as well so I think there's a potential for a broad range of uses once we have the research to prove it",

Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "uhqZBcQscz8": "hey everybody today's video is about how to HC and CBD affect your sleep this was a video request and I was quite interested in researching this there's some cool information stick around [Music] so here in Canada there's been a lot of talk about cannabis lately and there's plenty of stores popping up all over the place so first of all what is cannabis cannabis is the Latin term for the plant itself and there are more than one species of plant therefore each species of plant has varying amounts of the compounds THC and CBD amongst many other compounds within the plant so some will have more THC than others and others will have much less so the species of plant really does make a difference and there's many blends of various plants you can get so that you can get the desired effect that you're looking for so what does THC THC is one of the compounds within the cannabis plant it's a cannabinoid and it is it stands for tetrahydrocannabinol CBD on the other hand is another cannabinoid within the cannabis plant and that stands for cannabidiol so what's the difference between the two quite a bit so THC is that compound within the cannabis plant that gives you that feeling of being high CBD does not have that effect so one is psychoactive one is not psychoactive THC is psychoactive CBD is not so looking at how each one effects your sleep I found that pretty interesting because you know I've I've heard of many people lighting a joint before bed to fall asleep easier and they think that they sleep better but if that joint that you're smoking has THC in it then yeah you are going to fall asleep sooner but it's going to interrupt your REM sleep and that can be a problem especially long-term it can be a blessing or a curse so looking at it this way if your REM sleep is disrupted that means that you are not you're not dreaming you're not getting into that dream state and you're not processing your memories and emotions this can be a blessing if you suffer from anxiety or PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder and the next day you will feel groggy as well just just like you would if you had a hangover so that's THC CBD on the other hand now apparently too good to be true it can help you fall asleep sooner it can help you stay asleep through the night I'm not sure about how it affects your REM sleep or not I couldn't find any definitive information on that and it also helps you feel even more alert the next day so this sounds really good there's not enough research to say definitively if there are any long-term problems with taking CBD so the jury's still out on that one and just to add a little fly into the ointment not everybody reacts to either THC and/or CBD in the same way as the next person each person each of us has a different number of receptors for cannabinoids and so THC tends to lock on to those receptors more so than CBD and that's why we get that that psychoactive effect now if you can flood your system more so with CBD rather than THC then those CBD they will take up those receptor spots instead that are therefore leaving less space for any THC that might be in there CBD has been shown to relieve pain which can be very good a lot of people use it for pain relief and and for getting a nice deep sleep so that's all the information I could find on THC and CBD regarding your sleep at this point like I said research is still fairly new a lot of people will say oh there's no problem with CBD but I think you have to take it upon yourself if you're wanting to try it to use yourself as an experiment and start low and then work your dosage up I am NOT giving you any medical advice whatsoever this is just what I've read and since everybody responds differently to it it would be wise to start small so I hope you found this information helpful and if you do use it and you've had good or negative effects you know maybe just write that down share your information so that other people can also help decide as well have a super day thanks for watching bye [Music]", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the

if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "7wwX5ShkDsI": "new canadian research has found a direct link between cannabis use in pregnant women and an incidence of autism the study found that children whose mothers reported using marijuana during pregnancy were more than one and a half times more likely to have autism than children who were not exposed researchers looked at 2200 ontario women who gave birth between 2007 and 2012 and said that they used cannabis while pregnant the research was done by the ottawa hospital chill born ontario and the university of ottawa joining me now with more is dr doreen alchar co-author of the study good morning thank you so much doctor for being with us good morning first of all give us your thoughts on what the research found sure so you summaried summarize it nicely but our research was really looking at maternal cannabis and neurodevelopmental outcomes after having looked at it previously in obstetrical outcomes last year and we noted the increase in the diagnosis of autism that was made in children born to mothers who had consumed cannabis during the time of our study period which is about 10 years when you look at the follow-up period of when they were born and then to how long we followed them so were the researchers more interested in looking at why autism occurs or what happens if mothers use cannabis during pregnancy what was your starting point yeah so for this study in particular it was around neurodevelopmental outcome we've previously looked at what happens to pregnancies and we found an increased rate of preterm birth and some other obstacle outcomes which were affected like birth weight and other placental issues um so we we generated more work from that existing uh interest uh to now look at the feed the the babies and the infant outcomes so this is focused on the neural development and brain so autism was one but we also looked at other intellectual learning disabilities and found less of a significant association so there are health warnings out there about using cannabis during pregnancy is your feeling that those warnings are not being followed it's hard to know right now and as you mentioned yes health canada society of obstetrician gynecologist we still recommend against use because we don't have enough evidence to talk to our mothers about what it could mean i think that we probably are seeing similar rates and maybe a little bit more upfront patients telling us about the use because of legalization so that we may be seeing however we haven't looked at the numbers yet but we plan on doing that now to see what the numbers are post-legalization in 2017. right i guess i'm wondering why people why pregnant women would use cannabis is it because it is legal now people think that it may not be um harmful during pregnancy to their baby so certainly that's one there's always the impression that if something is legal it may be okay but we know that that's certainly not the problem the issue with other substances like alcohol and smoking so i use the same analogy um as in terms of why they use it certain moms do need to use it because they've used it for other medical issues for pain management or uh dealing with other symptoms so certainly we have to be aware of and helping those uh patients with other uh uh you know other medications that they will need to have to deal with their uh medical issues as well as there's some people who use it recreationally still as well as for potential help with nausea so this was a big study what do you hope to do with the results uh yeah so this is one of the largest studies and more recent times published we hope that this will help sensitize you know and help our care providers counsel their patients about some of the risks and certainly we know we need to do more studies and continue looking at the cohorts of patients as this was from 20 2007 to 2012 so we need to look at more recent data and continue doing linkage and we also need to look at whether timing of use and other substances affect the outcomes as well as different types of cannabis as you know there's many different forms that can be used doctor thank you so much really appreciate you being with us this morning on this study very important",

used in treatments to prevent infection with Tsarskoe v2 the virus that causes kovat 19 actually this isn't the first time cannabis has been investigated as a prevention and treatment strategy for a corona virus earlier studies have been done regarding the corona virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome which caused an outbreak in 2003 but having said that don't think to up the cannabis intake in the hopes of preventing or treating kovat 19 infection because smoking more cannabis is likely to put people at a greater risk of infection as it causes serious threat to those who smoke tobacco or marijuana similar to other respiratory pathogens SARS Co v2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets SAR Co v2 was first isolated from human airway epithelial cells it uses receptor mediated entry into the human host via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 that is expressed in lung tissue as well as oral and nasal mucosa kidney and the gastrointestinal tract the Cancer Genome Atlas and functional annotation of the mammalian genom cap analysis of gene expression data sets revealed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is expressed in oral mucosa and is enriched in the epithelial cells of the tongue hence angiotensin converting enzyme to expression in oral lung and intestinal epithelium may constitute important routes of SARS Co v2 entry into hosts similarly numerous studies have reported high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in the lower respiratory tract and higher levels of angiotensin converting enzyme to expression seen in smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease angiotensin converting enzyme 2 involves in lowering the blood pressure by catalyzing angiotensin 2 of asada later angiotensin angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a promising drug target for cardiovascular diseases modulation of angiotensin converting enzyme to levels in these tissues may prove a plausible strategy to decrease disease susceptibility these strategies ought to be accessible easy to use and ideally should fall into the generally regarded as safe category cannabis sativa especially one high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and is under investigation for several potential therapeutic applications against cancer and various inflammatory diseases in the study we mentioned earlier to analyze the effects of cannabis sativa on angiotensin converting enzyme to expression the extracts of 22 novel cannabis sativa lines were used to treat at oral intestinal and their weight tissues that were previously treated to induce inflammation at the end of this study they have found that some lines of cannabis sativa successfully down regulate the gene expression of angiotensin converting enzyme not only that they also found that serine Pradas which plays an important role in the Czar's COV to infection by priming the viral spike proteins and allowing the Czar's COV to entry into host cells was affected by cannabis sativa therefore cannabis sativa seems to have an encouraging effect on lowering the risk of

pushing out the black market which is full of people who have been part of the cannabis community for years and pave the way for legalization some of those people are in the high five I met up with their co-founder Sarah Gillis at one of her markets and while other black-market pop-ups are male-dominated this one appeals to women and the LGBTQ 2 community so we're gonna bag there should be a hundred what led you to start doing the pop-up market so I have like my own brand of baking and we just thought it's so cool to be able to meet the makers when we started we were very like okay what would a legal market look like and as a entrepreneur how would you showcase your products so we thought of dosing lab testing children's warnings nutritional information your packaging how that looks

after October the high five are at risk of being shut down at any time we spoke to Toronto city councilor Joma havoc who says that there is still a lot to consider before making edibles legal how will you control dosage how will you educate the public on the effects we need standards we need to know how we're gonna monitor this and it's not it's not a way of saying no it's a way of making sure that

And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you.

right I brought a couple choices for you to smell here tell me what you think so we'll just do the you know so you can really just pick based on okay there's another one okay I know I'm definitely rule out the first one this one's really it's between the second and third but Ryu sounded kind of surprised that I would you up with the first one like I would pick any one of these um this one in the lineup I think is the most kind of a coffee like the second one that used to smell of is called snoop lion oh gee if that one's kind of a sour earthy og and then the last one was the orange believes it does have that sort of leather eNOS that you and then it's also citrus I've had coffee cocktails that have like citrus elements in them and they're super interesting what happens if you like put in all three would that just muddled too much honestly I would smoke all these things together in a joint since you said the first one is what you would do we were kind of going lean towards the bird so maybe we could try some of the first and the third yeah I think that'd be super cool actually so we're gonna use half a gram of each of these will be right at about eight milligrams per personal person and we're putting this on a cup did some corn flakes per oh that sounds amazing I didn't know about that part that's great I go play on breakfast you know it's all stuff you pi-1 eat if you're high yeah I definitely want to eat that and I'm definitely high right now so looking forward to that so this is the amount of condensed milk that we'll use in the recipe right okay great so I'm just gonna kind of sprinkle that in there and then we're going to boil it in a pot for about two hours that'll both activate the THC a and the THC and then it'll also in into the sweetened condensed milk", "C8TYuKOcVkE": "welcome back to another video at reveal cannabis calm today we're talking about cannabis for seniors so we'll discuss why cannabis might be the most beneficial for all age groups we'll discuss why cannabis might be the most beneficial to seniors of all the age groups we'll talk a little bit about dosing and why that's so important what about drug interactions and then how to maybe gently nudge the senior in your life to giving cannabis a try hi my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis wellness coach and educator at reveal cannabis calm at that website you're gonna find lots of great stuff including a free video and a free recipe book for you about cannabis plus you can check out my online upcoming events or my online classes there's lots of stuff going on there so please head to reveal cannabis calm thank you here in Canada where I am seniors really love their cannabis in fact for first-time users of cannabis seniors are the quickest growing group which I think is so exciting but this isn't just a Canada wide phenomenon these same the same pattern is happening all over the world that more and more seniors are coming to cannabis because they've heard about how beneficial it might be so how could they benefit what are the conditions that some seniors are stuff is suffering from that cannabis might be able to help well arthritis is huge what about neurodegenerative diseases things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and dementia cannabis has been shown to help with all of those and there's many exciting studies coming up about this topic pain cannabis is excellent for pain helps with depression it helps with cancer and the side effects of chemo or radiation it can help you get a good night's sleep and a good night's sleep can make all the difference in the world for all your other conditions it helps with increasing your appetite helps with eye pressure from glaucoma it helps with brittle bones and there's so much more but seniors are also the group who may suffer from the most stigmatization from this plant even if they were consuming cannabis in the 60s and 7 is the huge anti-drug propaganda you know that just say no campaign didn't really get started until the 80s so even if they tried cannabis and loved it and their youth they may still have gotten the same program even but all of us have gotten about how evil this drug is so it might be really hard to convince them that there's some therapeutic value and seniors have lots of questions about this but there's not a lot of reliable resources for them to turn to it's very difficult for most seniors to talk to their doctors about cannabis because most doctors at least in Canada don't have a real clear handle on how cannabinoids work in the body so let's talk about dosing here because this is really gonna be make-or-break for everyone not just seniors but if we think about dosing we're thinking mostly about THC so THC is one of the components in the cannabis plant and it provides that high or you fork or stoned feeling at high doses which some people really enjoy and they need that uplifting perk but for some people that's really off-putting but in low doses you don't feel any of those things so starting with a very low dose of THC around 2 milligrams is a great way to start or you could avoid THC altogether and stick to some of the other cannabinoids so lots of people have access to CBD and it is excellent for pain and sleep and inflammation and for mood or there's some other molecules that the cannabis plant grows none of them make you feel high or stoned except for THC so maybe looking at cbn or CBD or some of the other beneficial properties that the plant produces or if you only have access to high THC plants THC doesn't actually grow on the plant when the plant grows it grows a compound called THC a and in order to get THC we have to heat it up so you do that by lighting your joint or heating up your vaporizer or cooking your cannabis for a bit before you infuse it into butter and oil and putting it into an edible if you do that process first which is heating it up it's called d carbon if you don't heat up your cannabis your high THC cannabis you're left with high THC a cannabis which still has many of the same properties it's anti-inflammatory it helps with brain cells it helps with throwing up and nausea it helps with sleep it helps with muscle spasms but no psycho activity so maybe thinking about THCA is a way to approach dosing and again there it is start with really small doses to start what about side effects so yes cannabis has some side effects all the side effects that you hear about are from high THC flower CBD even at very high doses does not have any negative side effects except for some people don't deal well with the oil that they're taking like it's a lot on their gastrointestinal system the oil so CBD no known side effects THC has them all but all of these side effects dissipate with time so just like when you're starting to take a new pharmaceutical medication and the doctor says you know you might have a headache or you might not sleep well for a couple of weeks but it'll go away the same thing happens with THC most people get used to the side effects and they don't bother them anymore here they are so paranoia and anxiety dry mouth dry eyes hunger no munchies sleepiness short-term memory loss like if you ever can't find your keys Racing heart and this is very startling for seniors the racing heart usually lasts about 15 or 20 minutes and then goes away but it's still scary and blood pressure might be affected so actually your blood pressure might lower because cannabis causes your your blood vessels to open up to dilate a little bit so those are some of the common side effects that you can get from THC and again that's very dose dependent so I always suggest to people who have lots of cannabis sorry lots of conditions or lots of or there are lots of medications to speak with a cannabis specific doctor here in Canada we have access to them for free you do most of the appointments just over the computer over or over the phone so you don't even have to leave your house in the States it's a little bit trickier you have to be in a legal state and then find a doctor who will write you a prescription some of the things that they might look for our if you or the senior in your life is taking prescription medications that the doctor has said to them don't consume grapefruit while you're taking this prescription med you must be careful with CBD as well the same enzymes that break down certain drugs CBD interferes with them so your drugs don't get broken down as quickly which means you might have higher levels of those pharmaceutical medications in your bloodstream then you're supposed to so it's important to speak with a doctor if you're on any um drugs but interact with grapefruit things like opioids benzodiazepines which are for sleep and other psychotropic meds and a sleeping meds all of those can have an interaction with cannabis as well and seamless um blood thinners I don't think I have it on here but if you you're on coumadin or a blood thinner it's very important to speak with your doctor I recommend Apollo of cannabis clinics I just really like their model of patient care and there's a link down below so that you can get set up with them if you'd like and here in Canada lots of seniors lots of people think that the only way to take cannabis is to smoke it and it's really exciting for them to see that there's other ways to consume this plant that don't have to do with smoking people smoked for a reason it's quick and it's convenient and as soon as you consume cannabis but via smoking you start to feel relief instantly it doesn't take very long but lots of people don't like the smell or the taste of cigarette of joint smoke so um people are moving to vaporizing which is a small handheld unit that heats up cannabis flour so you put some cannabis bud or flour in the device it heats it up and it vaporizes the molecules so it vaporizes the THC and the CBD and you inhale the vapor and exhale the vapor so it works really quickly but it doesn't have any of the same smell or the tar or anything that we associate with smoking so moving to a dry herb vaporizer is a good option for many people just because it works so quickly edibles or capsules so lots of seniors prefer to start with capsulized cannabis oil because it's familiar it looks just like a regular pharmaceutical pill so people are familiar with it it also makes dosing really easy because they come in pre dosed they come in pre dosed little capsules edibles are a little bit more tricky because they have to be metabolized and sometimes when you get older your metabolism doesn't keep up so it could take quite a lot longer for the Edible to kick in so just being aware of that that to leave a really long time between edible doses to make sure that the dose is working transdermal patches are great for those people who forget to take their meds you just slap one on your arm and then next week you slap a new one on it's a slow week slow release CBD or THC mixture under the tongue tinctures are fantastic too you just drop some cannabis oil under your tongue and hold it there for about half a minute and you feel relief relatively quickly within about 15 or 20 minutes again no smell and it's very discreet but in my opinion the like gateway drug for people to get on to cannabis is to give them a sab or a lotion when you apply cannabis cream - let's say painful hands or feet it works very quickly and you don't there's no possible way for you to get high so even if you gave even if you tried a very high THC cream you might get excellent pain relief but you'll have no psychotropic feelings so for lots of seniors once they see or feel the benefits of pain relief from topical cannabis they're more interested or curious about taking it in a different way so how do you convince the senior in your life to give cannabis a try here are some things that I've come up with just some thoughts that maybe you can chat with them about so lots of like we talked about lots of baby boomers once tried cannabis a long time ago and now they're coming back to it so maybe talking to them about the difference of how some cannabis plants are grown now that there's lots of producers and growers who are growing for medicinal purposes maybe they're going to grow the best strain for sleep or for pain relief it's not all about getting high anymore so talking to them about that talking to them about how cannabis is much much are potent than it was in the 60s or 70s maybe about three times as potent so if somebody was used to smoking a joint back in the day and they decide to light one up now in 2020 it could be a very bad experience for them so giving them that information again try starting with topical or maybe a capsule because it looks more familiar and be considerate about the cannabinoids you use maybe you stay clear of THC like we talked about if you have questions about this or anything else to do with cannabis please just drop them in the comments below I do answer all of them and please go ahead to my website check out all that I have going on there I'm also on Facebook and Instagram and I offer our private consultations as well so check it all out and please like and subscribe it really does help other people find this content thanks for your

cannabis and cardiovascular health a warning from the american heart association they find that marijuana is linked to an increased risk of heart trouble including heart attacks and heart failure janae norman has the details good morning janae hey george good morning yeah would you believe that during the pandemic the marijuana business is booming already on track to outpace all of last year as the aha took a look at how both recreational and medicinal use impact cardiovascular health this morning as sales of marijuana soared during the pandemic a new warning from the american heart association that the marijuana millions use may actually be hurting their hearts in a new review of studies the organization finding cannabis use may be linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure there have certainly been reports of people with heart rhythm abnormalities hospitalized patients who have more complications of their heart attack for example when they're hospitalized with a heart attack or heart failure dr rosemarie robertson the deputy chief science and medical officer of the aha cautioning more research needs to be done after multiple studies found smoking the the in cannabis could shrink blood vessels that feed the heart and lungs i think it's clear to us that using marijuana thinking that it might help your heart or be good for the cardiovascular system there is no evidence for that the evidence that it can harm you is also anecdotal but there is some researchers also finding that edible marijuana appears to be associated with even more harmful heart and psychiatric complications because of the amount of thc absorbed into the body system but cbd is different studies finding that the portion of the marijuana plant that doesn't produce a high has actually been associated with a reduced heart rate and lower blood pressure this as purchases of marijuana spike when the country went on lockdown in march more than a dozen states deemed cannabis stores and medical marijuana dispensaries essential businesses in colorado retail marijuana sales in may were 35 million dollars higher than in 2019. and both oregon and washington state seeing their cannabis sales spike through the late spring and early summer as consumers spend more time at home and so more research is needed and the aha suggests that the dea remove

Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp.

they're all mixed in and incorporated off the bowl now we'll go with the pecans you just want to run it slow until it's all incorporated just a couple turns will do that's good now we do pretzels these are little salted pretzels that we love to use the salt is nice it gives you a nice contrast of the sweetness of the cookie marshmallows these are vegan marshmallows and last but not least potato chips so the potato chips are gonna crush themselves inside so we just fold them in I'll let the machine do the work now we're doing this at the slowest speed possible and that's it we'll take the cookie dough right out of the bowl and so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna grab small handfuls and just form them and then almost into a patty shape almost like little pucks and you lay them on a sheet pan and then we'll bake them in a low oven we bake these at 320 degrees you really don't want to bake anything with CBD in it higher than 320 degrees because you'll lose those wonderful effects that it has so we bake these at 320 degrees seven minutes on one side we'll rotate the tray and bake it seven minutes on the other so they're nice and even so everything kind of melts the marshmallow Browns a little bit you see the pretzel sticking out there chocolate chips are nice and gooey and it's just an overall fun cookie [Music]", "AwseTJ_kvr8": "[Music] hi this is jeff the 420 chef and thank you for choosing my thc cbd calculator today i'm going to walk you through how the calculator works and all the different bells and whistles that it includes let's start with the bottom of the page you'll see that there's a home button a calculator button and a heart button let's just click on the home button to start here you have access to a lot of my recipes for example my can of butter recipe my can of oil recipe how to clean and prep your cannabis before you infuse your cannabis and how to decarb your cannabis before you infuse it into your butter and oil and more recipes will be coming soon in addition on the bottom of the page you'll notice an area for recent calculations here is where you can view all the calculations you've done in the past let's get started click on the calculator button on the page you'll notice that you have two inputs one for thc and one for cbd the strain i'm working with today is called harlequin harlequin is a high cbd strain low thc strain i'm using it today to illustrate how the calculator can work with both thc and cbd simultaneously this strain has 5 thc so you'll move the bar to five for five percent and it's 15 cbd you'll move the bar to 15 for cbd the next step is to enter your final dry weight this is the final weight after you have dried and de-carved your cannabis whether or not you're using my cleaning process or you're just straightly carving but before without putting it through my cleaning process you're always going to lose at least moisture weight i started with seven grams but i'm not going to put seven grams in this space at the end of my cleaning and drying process i'm left with 5.2 grams so i'm entering the number 5.2 the next step is to enter the infusion are you infusing your cannabis into butter or oil and what type of oil each calculation is slightly different let's click on butter because it's the first one now when i infuse butter i like to infuse an entire stick of butter an entire stick can be measured in tablespoons so i'm going to click tablespoons and i'm going to click eight if you need a quick reference guide for this you can look down in the green box and all the information you need is there now click the yellow button that says calculate that'll bring it to your results page at the top of this page you'll notice an area where you can actually put the name of your infusion at the top we're going to call it infusion 1. [Music] underneath that there's an area called strain name since we use harlequin we're going to put the name harlequin in there now in your green box you'll notice your total potency your total potency for this infusion is 95.55 milligrams of thc and 286.65 milligrams of cbd but that doesn't really help you that much more importantly look below that you'll see your infusion results are actually called out by tablespoon that's very important information so now you're left with 6.1 milligrams i'm sorry 6.1 tablespoons of canned butter that you produced meaning that you've lost 1.9 tablespoons in your infusion process and each tablespoon of your can of butter is going to be 15.6 milligrams of thc and 46.81 milligrams of cbd but that still doesn't really help you you need to know how much of your butter you're going to need to put into your recipe in order to achieve a specific infusion per serving that's really simple just go down to the bottom of the page and click on the toast button this brings you to the most important page in the calculator you'll notice that you can figure out just how potent you want each serving of your brownies for example to be now i want to serve 10 brownies i'm going to put the number 10 in the recipe number of servings but now if i don't know how much of my can of butter i need to use to achieve that all i have to do is move up where it says recipe can a product and start clicking on the little plus button you'll notice that if i only use one tablespoon of my can of butter i'm only going to have 1.56 milligrams per serving of thc and 4.68 milligrams per serving of cbd but that's not what i want let me click it again oh there we go now i've put two tablespoons of my can of butter into the recipe and each brownie is now going to be 3.12 milligrams per serving and cbd 9.36 milligrams per serving now let's go back to the previous page you'll notice on the bottom of this page you've got an area for notes you can type whatever you want in there since i love you guys i'm going to just type in here i love you and if you really love your infusion and you want to save it you'll notice that there's a heart button on the bottom all you have to do is click that heart button and you've saved it now if you don't like what you've done or you want to completely get rid of it you can either click the trash button to throw it in the trash or you click the start over button and start all over and that's it easy as pie i hope you enjoyed this demo and i hope the calculator brings you many years of use if you like the calculator

marijuana via and edible versus smoking or vaporizing it sure so so the first thing is your body deals with cannabis very differently when it's ingested it if you're eating something it's actually processed by the GI tract and processed by the liver it changes from Delta 9 THC to hydroxy 11 which is more potent and the biggest thing is that takes time right we when we drink wine with a meal we don't get drunk like that right we let it kind of prickly and enjoy the experience so edibles are very similar when consumed there's other uptake or delivery systems right your oral mucosa is a very efficient delivery system our mints for example are dissolved in the mouth or tinctures right go under the tongue those are quicker one of the hardest things about edibles is the delay and getting consumers to understand that you have to be patient we are not a patient people so there is a learning curve there right education we have to talk about it we have to talk to tourists we have to be able to have a dialogue and not be afraid to ask questions especially because if we do have history with marijuana maybe smoking marijuana it's kind of an instant gratification thing we know if we're at a six or even an eighth about five minutes in edibles it can be anywhere from what an hour maybe sometimes more than two yeah so the the state language is this will this product may be delayed by two or more hours what we see is depending on the product type really you're looking at 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on a lot of things right are you eating an edible and then putting a meal right on top of that that will get the THC into your system much faster than if you eat a meal and then take something that is a slower process the state changed some of its regulations regarding labeling just earlier this year on February 1st and and and part of that was being more explicit about this could take more than two hours but I know before you guys were before that regulation took place the Dixie had some really creative activation illustration on the back of its products and and I'm wondering have you guys tweaked those since the states regulations have kind of caught up with you guys on that level yeah you know we always continue to tweak those as we get feedback on on how long products are taking to affect someone we will adjust our barometer right it's a strength time scale and one of the things we believe really strongly is we can have a whole paragraph of warnings that no one's going to read or we can make a visual icon that someone's going to see and get information from quicker so when we say that a serving size is 7 milligrams or 10 milligrams and we'll take 60 minutes that is a easier way for a consumer to understand faster what they need to do and and everything we do on our labels as much as possible is to get consumers to understand how to take that product and how to dose that product", "IB4Z7_XBopc": "[Music] well I'm standing in a beautiful field with barb Iverson now you usually see barb in us here the spring talking about their wonderful tulip fields however barb you've you've gone down a different path of opening up another part of your business your big business and that is a growing hemp now in my world my mom would have thought this was the bad stuff but it isn't is it no the bad stuff has the highest THC in it that's like the cousin of this is a whole different place this plant has low THC under 0.3 percent THC and high CBD and the CBD is what but people that use it really say it works wonderful on so many medical problems with them and pain right right that's what we're after so you actually then you grow this but it's not like you just got some seeds and throughout here this is really tracked by the state of Oregon it is something that they write and make sure it's right right we have to buy a license from the Oregon Department of Ag and then they monitor the field we pin it where the exact location is the number a KERS and then we have it tested and it has to test below that point three percent THC or we have to destroy the crown I just have to get rid of it so then not only do you grow this and I know I've talked to a lot of people who want to buy it as a medicine type thing is helping with them in some way which not have that really been proven but they still have used it they believe in it so they're concerned about the stuff being healthy you grow this right here in this field we grow it and you then you make it you you do all the processing of it right that's right we chop it down we dry it we and then we make it into an oil well then I think we should leave this beautiful field and go over there and see and find out some more about how you process it how's that sound sounds good wonderful barb come on okay but her so this is a very clean room it is plans this is you've done the harvesting and this is where you bring those harvest oh no first one after we harvest we have to dry the material first game that creates biomass we call biomass and we separate that biomass we take the woody parts out of it then we bring it in here to extract it and these are co2 extractors so you say extract it extract so what's tracked so we extract the plant waxes and cannabinoids out of that dry biomass okay and that this is a process that you have to go through to actually do that it's not just like ringing a minute no no no you go through this process and it's temperature and pressure and then that separates out all the cannabinoids and plant waxes and then is that CBD no no no eh then that's raw well from there we take it into our lab where we refine it further we take it down and and we separate out the plant waxes and purify it a little bit more and then we warm it up to decarboxylated so we're really yeah it's not just a simple process of getting the oil from the plants I mean youth there are so many steps that you have to follow and legally to make sure that it's right that's right wow that's so interesting now after all of this you have some of the the product has been made into different things that you're selling now so let's go to that store and and look and see what ultimately we can get from that that's good all right so now we are in the store which is a barn red barn hemp right right this is still part of a business is all family family a family business and what I love about it is you can actually see the products that were created and really go from from seed to sample you take care you can come in here we'll give you samples so you can try it out right here so let's talk about some of the products tell me about it well we've got an Evan sub cream that's great for your hands are three cans things like that is what we recommend it's good for Emma Sam cream itself is good for your skin CBD just makes it that much better all better for it yeah we have a muscle gel you have tinctures peppermint and plain you can take it under your tongue or you can put it in your coffee or your drink however you like to take it capsules for those that like to take capsules want to know what their dosage is think about our product is we put in how much CBD is in there so you can dose yourself you can figure out Oh 25 milligrams works for me or I need two capsules or one time a day two times a day okay so you if you're just searching online to try to find places to buy this stuff you can guarantee that the information you give about it is right we ever oil tested at a third party lab the same with our final product right right and then what I love about this besides the other products used to set it up out here was you even have them for dogs dogs right right dogs are mammals they have an endocannabinoid system just like us they have the receptors so you have a dog old dog that's having trouble getting around right they work great and then you you have personally had a lot of people actually talk to you guys and say this works for me this I use it stories are amazing oh it just there we do the tulip festival and create memories this this is again quality of life we use it with my dad when he came home with cancer and we had 42 days we felt that we wouldn't have had otherwise when we pulled him up all the narcotics and just had him on the capsules he could talk to us we could take him around the tulip field it was it was an amazing experience and I know it is to it the same thing happened to my mother and I we came out here and I saw this when you started selling it I bought some Chico it worked on her in a Rob with the energy I really was so thankful that you guys stepped in to and sometimes uncomfortable of growing something and then making something beautiful out of it it love that about great and it's been a huge learning curve for everybody everybody involved not only us but but our customers wonder that's what we want to do is teach you teach people how what this product is all about and what it can do for them well for more information we certainly would encourage you to go to garden time TV we'll click over to their website you can find out the information you can come out here and buy it when they're open you can find those hours on the website as well or you can order it all online which I absolutely love that is available to everybody so barb you know how much I love the tulips I love this too thank you so much all right you're welcome thanks for coming out [Music] you", "cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out factory6cbd.com watch more of our videos this is trent the wizard with factory six factoids again we'll see you next time you", "Q8XAXIZuKLU": "alright so the first product I'm here to show you today is some flour this is tangerine haze here and this would be one of the products that people would buy that is smoked or vaporize and we sell it by the week very popular somebody may use this particular strain and some people report that it's very uplifting good for the morning time to get your day started so everyone's experiences may vary what may work for one person may not necessarily work for the next but in my personal experience tangerine haze is really good because it uplifts mood gives me a clear head without getting anxiety so it's a good way that you can start off your morning one of my favorite parts about the bar is if you see here there is child resistant packaging so I actually have to squeeze both ends here and then and then to show you what the actual chocolate bar looks like on the inside and the really cool thing about this - which is important for the adult use regulation is for edibles the serving sizes cannot exceed 5 milligrams per serving and it cannot get more than 100 milligrams per package and each one of these pieces of chocolate here has our contains THC symbol with the little leaflet located right on the bottom and that is required to be on all so this consists of five pre-rolled joints so I'll show you the child resistant opening we got here and when we lift it up as you can see number 1 2 3 4 5 are your 5 joints and on the back which is the really cool part is it gives us testing information so we know how strong each individual joint is and how strong it will be and again like everything else we got our contains THC symbol on here so we got Moomins here which is another edible that you may purchase here at meta which is a strawberry gummy and just to kind of give you an idea of what they look like this is what they look like here and one thing you may or may not notice is on the actual edible itself and again it has that contains THC logo that's required to be on all of our edibles and our one person might choose to have a gummy is because they may not have dietary restrictions and they prefer gummies say choc over chocolate so this could be another way to medicate but just keep in mind that all edibles work the same so go low and slow and wait a couple hours before you begin pretty simply it is a vaporizer that works similarly the smoking step to a Down of the carcinogens that happen with combustion so with this this is a great way to get medication that if you need to be more discreet or anything along those lines and the one thing I like about this is for people who may have hand dexterity issues there's no assembly required you simply just your inhale will trigger the battery and then you go from there so one thing to keep in mind about the apex one is it's made with our distillate oil which happens to be the most pure and potent in the store so I may not recommend this to somebody who's starting off or if they are trying it too definitely again go low and slow and try it in a safe space to see how it makes you feel so the lotion is really good for localized pain relief myself I had a lot of back issues so I will put the lotion after a hot shower my pores tend to be open more so the medicine gets absorbed and it really helps with the inflammation and loosening my back up in that particular area and one thing to note is that most people report with topicals it's a non-psychoactive so a lot of people could use the lotion and go about their daily lives doing the activities they want without necessarily the psychoactive so for the lotion in particularly for most things I would say start with a couple pumps but definitely depending on the pain will determine how much lotion you're gonna want to use now elevation oil is a grapeseed / NCT cooking oil now you could use to add to all the recipes that you'd like I know some people use it for salad dressings some people just take it in the TSP and eat it and some people even use it as a topical application but the really cool part about this is it's dosed out by the TSP and for those who have dietary restrictions this could be a really good option for those who are looking for an alternative to a tables is a singular pre-roll that we sell here so you do not necessarily have to buy in the packs you could buy it by the pre-roll and this is about how big they are and what they look like so people can either have the choice to buy the loose flower like tangerine haze and roll it themselves or if they wish that it rolls for them for any reason so the next product that I'm going to show you is what we would like to call shattered now a little disclaimer with shatter it tends to be a bit potent so I wouldn't necessarily recommend this for somebody who's starting off with cannabis but just to show you why it's called shatter shatter is a butane hash oil that is then purged off the butane to give it a glass like translucent appearance so this is something that you so those who are inexperienced I might stay away but if you do again have a greener right sized piece and the Colorado middle some people tend to be more used to more regimented medicine meaning taking it at certain times in the day so we tend to make this a little bit easier for them and then also again with dietary restrictions this should be another great edible for people to try", "Q4SzpaHq-u0": "[Music] so I'm in a massive cannabis field right now and we're not in Colombia or Colorado we're actually in China near the Himalayas local farmers have been tending this field for the past five months and today they're ready to harvest the fruits of their labor they're about to top down 24 tons of cannabis the whole mission their company about how the heart cannot be you'll find your plan the whole woman the ha she knew and by the way it's like some that whining flu a few months ago this clot was all tobacco in court but now young Lou who manages this field says they're growing hemp a strain of the cannabis plant known for the increasingly popular non psychotropic component CBD the CBD market in the US will grow by 700 percent this year and be worth more than twenty three billion dollars by 2023 in China wants a piece of that fields like this in Yunnan Province are now a part of a growing CBD boom in China research analysts say UN and Heilongjiang provinces alone produced just over 11 percent of the global CBD supply last year the extract is taken from these plants then sold in the US demand for CBD from China has ballooned because of its supposed health Frenchie's consumer products increased with CBD like coffee bath bombs and gummy bears claim to help with pain and relaxation whatta man the CBD honey would go Edie ones yeah oh wow kind of sweet and fruity in a way wonder chefs here we're in Quin being here dozens of startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the u.s. the city has become a trailblazer for cannabis much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the u.s. Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match the home the country is quickly catching up to the US and Europe and entrepreneurs believe their country will eventually surpass competitors as a CBD powerhouse in production but most importantly consumption yoga since in the trainee at the Tantra pompe oh ho Chun Chiu geranyl woman shampooed on the tree most Wakana shaman a fan for that room to come here time at sea for sure young leo says China can only succeed because he expects the country will do to the CBD industry when it has already done to dominate other industries like smartphones plastics or clothes what can you make voice in the sugar-free trinomial the I woke up you will I depart from your dumb out that wrong with the changing wait wait huh [Music]", "uuZwjeiofE8": "POLICE POLICE ASK POLICE ASK THAT POLICE ASK THAT YOU POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER YOU POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER YOU\nSEE POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER YOU\nSEE THERE POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER YOU\nSEE THERE ON POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER YOU\nSEE THERE ON YOUR POLICE ASK THAT YOU CALL THEM\nAT THE NUMBER AT THE NUMBER YOU\nSEE THERE ON YOUR SCREEN.

instagram at daverny freeman i will be doing some giveaways so you want to follow me on instagram that's where i announce all of my giveaways and if you want to be a young young young young guy go ahead and hit that subscribe button and the notification bell so let's jump into the video so this is everything you're going to need you're going to need some heavy duty aluminum foil it doesn't really have to be that heavy duty you can go get the 99 cent one whatever fits your grip baby so i'm gonna use some aluminum foil and with my aluminum foil i'm just gonna place them on a flat uh surface and you you will be putting this inside the refrigerator so boom pow now what i'm going to do is i like to create my own little mold i don't know if you guys want to go on amazon to see if they have these molds but i know a lot of people were saying they could not find any nerve rope mold so you really have to do them by hand so this is what i'm doing now i'm just making my own little molds which is just popping the aluminum foil up a little bit so it can have this barrier in between the two i'm doing that on each side so that's what i'll be doing right now [Music] and you guys do want to be careful when you're making your little liners because this is aluminum foil and it's easy to kind of tear through them [Music] so you guys i prefer to reuse these package this the packaging that comes with it so i ain't i'm not gonna buy normal packaging y'all don't play with me we're just gonna reuse these packaging what you do is you take where it's sealed all at either end of the rope and you kind of open it up like you will a bag of chips it's very easy to tear so you do want to take your time to open up the seal and once you open it up there should be a like a little cardboard against against the seal and you put your fingers in between the cardboard and the foil and you gently slide your fingers down in order to tear the packaging apart so that's what i do i do that then i set it aside and i take some nerds now this i do this all the time so i have additional nerve ropes and nerves in there and i like to take the nerves off of the rope which is very easy um so i don't have to buy a thousand boxes of nerve ropes yeah i mean i'm nerves when i could just use this now that you have separated your gummies from the nerves you're going to place them in a heat safe microwave safe bowl and place them in a small one i do recommend doing small batches at a time because if you do so many it's going to be kind of hard to control it so now you want to take your infused coconut oil i like to use liquid coconut oil instead of the coconut oil that goes back to solid and you want to use your tincture i'm using my eva clear tincture that i already infused with your cbd and they're going additional box of nurse just in case i need them but i don't feel like i will it's just whatever floats my boat and you also want to get yourself some type of piping bag or you can get a a condiment um container i think a ziploc bag is cheaper well not really cheaper but it's it works for me and i do reuse these so it's not like i throw them away because i know i hate plastic now i'm taking my coconut oil and i'm just coating this ziploc bag with the coconut oil if you do not want to use your infused coconut oil you can definitely use pam to coat this bat this ziploc bag but i'm saying if you're going to infuse something why not have everything be infused you get what i'm saying you're going to share but yeah so i'm going to do that and i'm also gonna do the same thing to my aluminum layers that i made my little molds because if you do not it will stick i don't care what anyone says in my i've been making these for forever in a day and they will stick if you put them in the freezer you put them in the refrigerator you will have pieces of aluminum stuck to your gummy now you looking at like a food like you're in third grade with goat with with aluminum foil in your mouth like it goes so yeah that's what you want to do just make sure everything is evenly coated then move on to the next step [Music] all right you guys so to my two rope gummies and six additional gummy bears i add half a tablespoon of infused coconut oil just to give you guys some type of starting point but this is definitely a trial and error type of situation so as you guys i have my tincture right here and i'm going to use five milliliters which is a teaspoon of t-shirt and i'm placing it to the side in a condiment disposable condiment container because i wanted to be you know on hand and you guys also saw that i had my liquid lecithin next to me just in case i'm going to need that as well so you want to take your rubber spatula or you can use anything that you're going to throw away i like to use this silicone rubber spatula because i could just wash it off and reuse it now i'm making sure that everything is evenly coated and i'm going to put this in a microwave for 10 seconds and it's going to look like this now i'm just stirring this around to make sure that my oil and gummies are combining together i microwave it again bring it back out stir it around and as you guys can see a little bit you see how they're the gummies in the oil is not coming together so what i'm doing is just trying to stir it a little faster and a little harder just putting a little bit of elbow grease into it to see if it's going to combine together and once it does as much as i would like for it to at this point i'm going to add my tincture to this i only add a half of the teaspoon into this at this time because you can always add more you really can't take it away so that's why it's super important to do this in small batches so you won't gotta worry about anything but as you guys can see the oil really did combine well with this so now i'm going to go ahead and add that t-shirt and do the same steps stir it around kind of be careful because it will splat it out okay y'all see what i'm saying i told y'all it'll splat out and that's nothing but my tincture splatting out honey that's why i'm like uh um let me let me try to put you back on in there girl then i'm stirring it around again just just to make sure that it is fully incorporated because if you do not do this you will have it will be set like oil and vinegar separate yeah this that's exactly what this will be baby your gummies will be to the right and your tincture will be to the left so you want to definitely make sure that it's fully incorporated microwave it again then you're going to place it in your ziploc bag or your piping bag remember this ziploc bag is already all uh down so i'm trying to give you guys a good angle but this is hot girl i'm like oh i'm about to stop the camera this is hot so you want to go ahead and pour that into there i use i try to use my rubber spatula to get the rest of it out but do what you can because it will kind of become you know it'll cool down a little fast so you will be working very quickly boo boo so once you get that together you're going to just whatever side you're going to cut it out you're going to cut it away from your workspace okay i cut it on the ground so you're going to cut it away from your workspace line a little bit of nerves just a little bit unless you want it real thick to the bottom of this pan and we're going to pipe on our gummies [Music] [Music] so you guys i am starting off with a thin layer i like to use at least when it when i like to make beans nerd robes i'm showing you guys how to make one and a half so with the measurements and things that i will put in the description box to my preference it makes one long nerd rope and kind of like um a quarter of one as well so what i'm doing now is i'm just going ahead and piping out my gummies and once i get done piping out the gummies i'm gonna take some additional nerd rope and sprinkle them on top of the gummies so they can have gummies on both sides i um really do this as a preference when it comes to how many nerds i'm actually putting on the rope so like i said this is really trial and error for some people you guys gonna have to figure out what what you like and what works best for you [Music] so all of those nerd roasts that you put on the side or if you're using a new box you're just going to go ahead and sprinkle as many nerves on this as you want to help you out you kind of want to make sure that all of the gummy is covered and go to your next step [Music] so [Music] all right so now you want to just go ahead and put your nerd roads in the refrigerator for several hours and once they harden up you're going to come back to them [Music] all right so now that it's been several hours i'm going to get my packaging my flat irons i don't use them on my head but i should use them for this okay and i get my nerd rose as you guys can see that it was covered up so you don't have to worry about anything getting on them [Music] now this is why it's super important to spray down that aluminum foil you guys see how easy they're coming out of here i'm definitely being gentle because i don't feel like anything cracking breaking or anything like that or in between boo-boos so you see how easy they're coming out but i'm just plopping them out ever so gently and now once i plop them out i'm going to put them on the cardboard that every nerd rope come with and i'm just going to place it on there and we're going to go ahead and package them so that's just what i like to do [Music] so now what we're going to do is i put them on my cardboard liners i'm going to flip them over so that the cardboard is facing up and i'm going to get the two ends of oh sorry you guys then we're going to get the two ends of the aluminum foil kind of put them together where where nestle had the glue already there so i'm just going to line them up as even as i can and we're going to heat seal them with our flat irons with my flat iron they go from like a one to a five and i believe i have them on a a two maybe a three i just want them to get hot enough so when my hand touch it my hand is not burning and i can kind of just like close it all together so heat sealing something together is really really easy you guys and that's just pretty much it you just heat seal them together and you will be all done with your diy infused nerve bros thank you guys so much for watching this video if you guys want to see any other type of infusion definitely put a comment down below and i really do appreciate you for watching this video i it means a so much so here go the little small ones that i did as well now this one i'm going to just do the same thing that i did with the longer one i'm just going to cut the nerd box so it fits this size you know what i'm saying so or you could just put them in your odorless airtight containers but you guys see how i have the little miniature one right there in front and that's pretty much all you do sorry for the noise you guys brandi and devin are outside playing tug of war with a stick yeah yeah yeah talk to you guys on my net video", "EBLmGBlEnMY": "[Applause] [Music] what's the first image that pops into your head when someone mentions the word cannabis for a lot of people it could be this or maybe this and for those of you that are better at planning ahead maybe even this basically we're all thinking joints bongs and getting stoned but modern cannabis has become a lot more complex than that nowadays when we talk about cannabis we're no longer just talking about a plant we've broken that plant down into extracts compounds and building blocks with tremendous therapeutic potential as a result cannabis is starting to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this and that's actually great news for all of us because the new version of cannabis is a lot more exciting than the old one in fact cannabis has emerged into a modern-day superfood and if we can reset our image of this plant cannabis might actually become more important to your daily routine than coffee so let me tell you how cannabis became a regular part of my daily routine when I was in my early 20s I had a moment of what you could call youthful indiscretion that set my life down a very challenging path I applied for a job on Wall Street to make matters more complicated they hired me it was fast paced and high-stress and in certain situations that stress could become pretty overwhelming so I tried everything I could to manage my anxiety including prescription medications but those came with their own side effects on my mood and my energy levels so I searched for a different solution and it took years before I actually found one I stumbled upon a little-known can extract called CBD it toned down my stress levels but still allowed me to feel clear-headed and focused and suddenly I was back in control of my daily routine I felt confident and composed and relaxed and I just sort of felt like myself now before you all get the wrong impression let me clarify that CBD does not get you high that effect comes from a completely different chemical called THC and CBD does none of that you could take all the CBD in the world watch the entire Beatles Yellow Submarine movie and you're still not going to feel high and trust me on that one see CBD doesn't impair you instead it seems to have the opposite effect which sounds a little bit like magic until we dig into the science we all have a built-in system in our bodies that keeps our internal functions in balance despite imbalance in our external environment it's called the endocannabinoid system and it regulates things like stress mood and appetite think of it like the conductor of an orchestra when one piece starts acting out of rhythm for example an overactive stress response the endocannabinoid system can step in and smooth it out CBD happens to be one of the chemicals that supports the function of this system helping that conductor to maintain rhythm throughout the body in the brain and brain imaging studies have actually proven this through these studies we know that CBD can help to modulate activity in key brain regions involved in our stress response like the amygdala in other words CBD helps your brain to function in a more balanced state when stress level spike ok so why am I telling you about biological systems in brain activity well for one I paid a lot for a degree in neuroscience and I'd kind of like to get my money's worth the other reason is that this little-known cannabis chemical it's about to change the way we all think about our daily health it's made such a big impact on my daily routine that I now dedicate myself professionally to creating healthy CBD options for people that want to give it a shot and it's not just for people with extreme anxiety or panic attacks either CBT has this gentle calming effect on mood and stress levels similar to a meditation think of it like the volume knob on a stereo CBT doesn't shut the noise off entirely it just turns that dial down a little bit so you can hear the music and because of that it's being used to help people perform better in a wide range of daily stressful scenarios from interviews to networking people that used to have a drink to calm the nerves are now trying CBD instead it is even effective for public speaking [Laughter] [Applause] multiple studies have actually been done on the effects of CVD on public speaking and have found a significant reduction in stress and discomfort compared to a control group and the potential benefits of CVD you go way beyond stress management to because of the broad function of that endocannabinoid system CPD itself can have a wide range of benefits professional athletes are now ditching prescription pills and painkillers in place of CBD and insomnia acts are turning to CBD is a potential natural remedy for more restful sleep but before you go and toss out any prescription pills I should note this does not mean that CBD is going to cure your anxiety your insomnia or your arthritis there's no one-size-fits-all solution these things and for many people prescriptions will just be the best option but the implications for CVA are pretty fascinating particularly when you consider that we may have stumbled upon a natural remedy to common ailments that affect millions of people every single day better yet you don't have to ingest a handful of pills and supplements to get those results CBD is commonly infused into foods and beverages in a way that's healthy and convenient you can get everything from CBD waters and juices to CBD olive oil and hummus but before we all go run out of here and share a giant bowl of CBD hummus it's important to consider the risk factors is CBD actually safe and what happens if we take a lot of it these are all very good questions unfortunately we do have some answers reports currently indicate that daily dosages of CBD up to 1500 milligrams are well tolerated by the body which means they're safe and to put that number in perspective here's a graph that shows common CBD dosages and food products today versus what those reports deemed to be safe and you can see it's not even close you'd have to spend thousands of dollars every single day on CBD infused food even come close to those numbers the World Health Organization has also weighed in on this stating that CVD has a good safety profile and that no public health problems have been associated with CVD use even the FDA which sets the gold standard for safe food policy in our country seems to agree with all this just last year the FDA noted little indication that CBD has abuse potential or presents a significant risk to the public health even more remarkable CBD doesn't seem to be addicting either the FDA's data also found no evidence that CBD causes physical or psychic dependence so let's recap CBD comes from plants doesn't impair you safe for adults consumed and could help millions of people it's a pretty amazing discovery right I think we should all pop open a bottle of CBD champagne to celebrate well actually not so fast because we currently sit at a pivotal moment in the history of cannabis regulation one that will determine if when and how we're even allowed to purchase cannabinoids like CBD C as a country we don't like to change our canvass laws very often we've really only done it once before when we effectively made it illegal back in 1937 and since then cannabis has been vilified for its recreational use the idea that weed equals scary is so deeply rooted in our culture that it even affects the way we think about versions of this plant that have absolutely nothing to do with its recreational use like hemp so now after an 80 year failed experiment we're finally about to revisit the cannabis question and the decisions we make today will set the course of this industry for generations to come now this is obviously a ton of responsibility and it's very important that we get it right this time part of getting it right means doing more research setting the right market marketing standards right safety guidelines because as much as we know today there is still more work to be done and a lot of products on the Shelf today just don't hold up the right quality standards but we can't continue to put it off to kick the can down the road because the longer we delay our regulatory decisions the longer we deny access to a natural solution to common ailments that should be very treatable we need to move forward based on real science one step at a time now I'm talking you about CBD today because it happens to be a pretty great first step it's healthy its natural and we have a growing database of research to support its efficacy so how do we move forward on CBD regulation well first we all need to determine what it is there are a lot of people out there who will tell us that CBD should only be a prescription medication those people are called pharmaceutical companies and there and they're well aware that this industry is projected to be worth 22 billion dollars in a few short years but maybe we're a little skeptical of those motivations because if we removed the veil of cannabis stigma CP is nothing more than a natural plant ingredient with therapeutic potential it's really more like a superfood and fortunately we already have a pretty good blueprint for that thanks to America's all-time favorite functional food caffeine now I know it might seem strange for me to stand up here and to compare something from cannabis to an everyday item like caffeine but bear with me are they really all that different they both come from plants they're safe for adults to consume and we use them to improve our mood and our energy levels interestingly enough caffeine was once vilified too back in 1909 the United States government filed a federal lawsuit against coca-cola for marketing a product that contained caffeine which they deemed to be unsafe nowadays caffeine can be found in all sorts of products from food and beverages to cosmetics and even medication we ensure that caffeine products are safe and labeled properly and then we let people decide if they want it when they want it and how they want it and since I'm sure everyone here has had some form of caffeine today it's safe to say we're all pretty comfortable with that system we need to take the same step forward with cannabis because cannabinoids like CBD should be no more threatening than a cup of coffee and if we do it the right way this time we have an opportunity now to give millions of people access to something that could improve their work lives their social lives and their overall happiness but we need to take a step back first in order to move forward and toss aside those outdated stigmas because this plant is a lot more than just weed cannabis should be viewed as therapeutic so let's hit the reset button on our image of cannabis starting with a fresh look at CBD and if we can change our perspective on one aspect of this plan maybe we can take another look at the rest of it - thank you [Music] you", "ubOiVHbCkwU": "is this a medicine cannabis has been a medicine for 3,000 years it only hasn't been a medicine in this country for 70 years I mean first of all I think just to talk about the the polarization of marijuana you know as a plan I think people have some ideas but people don't really understand like the journey so we tried to put in a little bit of history and context you know without it being like a big you know kind of write film it's not that kind of film but you know we put in the history so I think people are surprised to learn about that it's in the same schedule as LSD and you know that cocaine is in a less dangerous schedule and people are surprised to learn that the US government has a patent on the compounds in marijuana at the same time the US government is saying it has no medical value this is her cannabis oil regimen that we have right now we give her the size of about a half a grain of rice two times a day with baby food and in fact that it's actually at doing something with these can't with cancer on these children I mean we you know what we were able to follow from five years of making this film watching these subjects get better from this medicine not everyone not not everyone but yeah you know most of the kids and so it's it certainly is something that should people more people should know about and we're looking at this window I mean I think what's amazing when you really start learning about cannabis is honestly like how many people that could help I mean we're talking about like autism a DD Crohn's disease you know it's just this huge list of conditions we focus on pediatric and society we we focus on pediatric cancer because it's dramatic and also it's you know takes the stigma away it's not smoking joints and what people think you're really looking at you know medicinal properties but I think like we were amazed we went to Israel and we went to Jerusalem we went to like the top laboratories to look at the science because of course there are light years ahead of the us because they didn't have all the research blocks and you know it's fascinating to see like different strains killed different cancers but the same strain doesn't kill the same cancer and just the mechanism of how cannabis fights against cancers like super interesting so it's you know it's it's just this world of potential of healing and it's so criminal that it has been kept from us for 80 years there is some cell death the tumor is actually dying in certain areas there's no new growth I'm just thrilled this is the most amazing news we could have ever gotten", "DU5BWP8M97o": "early anti-marijuana films more viewers that we could not only kill you but maybe also lead you to murder your whole family with an axe yes I remember only a point of the drug he killed his entire family with an axe although we may be past bat moral panic some people believe cannabis can be deadly in the form of a lethal overdose there's no doubt that abusing marijuana can lead to dangerous situations but can ingesting too much actually end your life we asked dr. Chen director of the UCLA cannabis research initiative can you lethally overdose on cannabis as far as we can tell there have been no recorded cases of lethal amounts of cannabis ingestion resulting in an overdose not a single lethal overdose but how is that possible I mean cannabis is a drug after all with overdoses we tend to think of substances like alcohol benzodiazepines or opioids and the reason that these can result in overdoses is that these receptors also tend to reside in the area of the brain that control breathing since these drugs influence the part of the brain that regulates your basic life support functions they can potentially end those vital functions too and if you can overstimulate these receptors when you take too much opioids for example or drink too much alcohol you can actually shut down the neurons and the part of your brain that control breathing and as soon as you stop breathing that's when you can have a lethal overdose so what exactly sets cannabis apart from the others with cannabis the cannabinoid receptors the cannabis acts upon they are not particularly abundant in the air of the brain that controls breathing and so for this reason ingesting a large amount of cannabis or cannabinoids as far as we can tell isn't going to shut down the respiratory system but there was one instance that caused a lot of controversy in the medical field in 2015 an infant in Colorado passed away in the hospital after they found high amounts of THC in his blood it's still not clear what exactly caused the child's death the coroner at the time listed as having been related to cannabis overdose so that could be one of the first recorded cases of lethal overdose cannabis and again there's some controversy over whether or not it was the THC that led to the infant passing away that certainly is still an active area that people are wondering about will you die from smoking weed we're gonna say 'no you're most likely not gonna overdose for pot but like any other substance marijuana can be abused and lead to dangerous life-threatening situations so act wisely wait Leslie thanks for watching be sure to subscribe and check out more episodes of weed

smoking pot drastically increases your risk of stroke let's see what sources like healthcare triage think about that too the research the study we're talking about today published in the journal stroke reports that marijuana users between 18 and 44 years of age have significantly higher odds of having a stroke than non users using data from a national survey collected by the CDC the authors concluded that recent marijuana users were 82 percent more likely to have a stroke while the risk of more frequent users defined as those smoking 10 or more days per month went up to almost a hundred fifty percent come on a lot of people smoke pot if those between the ages of 18 and 44 were really a grave danger of stroke don't you think we'd be seeing a lot more strokes in this age group feels like I've mentioned relative versus absolute risk you know once or twice but here I go again 80 to 150 percent are the relative risks and since absolute risk is way more applicable in real life that's what we should talk about relatively risky over on Twitter took the time to figure this out for a lot of studies sensationalizing the news including this one and according to his calculations the absolute risk increase of stroke for frequent pot smokers is point five percent zero point five percent we've covered what we know about marijuana use before we did not specifically mention stroke risk in those videos mostly because there's not much evidence to justify it there just aren't a lot of non case control studies focusing on stroke and marijuana use the few that do exist suffer from the same problems mentioned here along with the fact that it can be pretty hard to get honest self reporting of marijuana consumption which is what all these surveys rely on and finally the studies that do exist contradict each other some studies like this one report an association between marijuana use and stroke another study analyzing only male data reported no association between those two factors the current study reported higher use for frequent marijuana users that also reported cigarettes and as the author's point out in their discussion other studies do not report an association between marijuana and stroke once cigarette and alcohol use have been adjusted for so all we can do for now is remind you of what we've said before the level of harm currently associated with marijuana is much less scary than that of other things like cigarettes or alcohol it's likely real meaning greater than zero so take that into account but don't panic we can always use more data especially with changing marijuana laws and more and more people use it and we'd probably need it to be better data especially for it to be newsworthy hey did you like this episode you might enjoy

I'm a 36 year old\nwriter and single mom. I microdose marijuana to\ntreat pain and anxiety, and I have no problem admitting\nthat makes me a better mom. I do want to preface this by saying that I'm not a medical doctor. I'm not in a position\nto advise anyone else on how medicinal marijuana may help them or make their lives better. I can only talk about\nmy personal experiences. I have stage four endometriosis, which is a chronic pain condition. It started about 10 years ago. I've had five major abdominal surgeries. Pain has been kind of a constant in my life for the last decade. As a single mom to a six\nyear old, that's hard, especially when my period\nhits and I'm stuck in bed. - Hello.\n(laughing) - What's your name? - Josie. - Josie, who are you? Are you my daughter? - Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. - Are you my best bud? I was not the person anyone\nwould have ever expected to be advocating for\nmedicinal marijuana use. I grew up in a family of police officers. My father was a narcotics officer for many, many years of my childhood. My whole life I've heard\nthat drugs are bad. I was 25 years old before I\ntried it for the first time and honestly, I hated it. Smoking marijuana made\nme wanna sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, which isn't a great thing for an introvert who already kind of is drawn that way. And I was pretty sure marijuana\nwould never be for me. So when a friend suggested\nI try microdosing, I was pretty against it, but I happened to be\nvisiting her in Seattle for another friend's wedding\nwhen my period started. And it kind of seemed like my period was about to ruin what should\nhave been a really fun time with people I cared about. So we went to a pot shop, and we discussed all the options and I bought a couple of mints that came in really low doses, and I followed the instructions\nof the employee there, to basically do no more than about two milligrams\nevery one to two hours. For most people getting high\non a medicinal marijuana edible would take five to 10 milligrams. So I was taking much smaller doses. I found that it really did\ntake the edge off the pain, especially the cumulative effect. So it didn't necessarily\nkick in right away after the first pill, but as I continued going\nthroughout the day, I was able to be more and more functional without really being high. And that was the key point to me, was that something was\ntaking the pain away without taking me out of commission. When I got home to Alaska,\nI started experimenting with marijuana more and more, and I kinda found that my ideal dose is about 1.5 milligrams,\nagain, every one to two hours depending on how bad my pain is. But another benefit came out as well, and that was that I started to realize the anxiety I've dealt with my entire life was leveling off on the days\nthat I was microdosing as well. And that was huge. You know, as much as pain\ncan knock me out of my life, anxiety can as well. If I'm having a high stress day or I'm just not in the right head space, I have a hard time working. I have a hard time being\nthe friend I wanna be, the mom I wanna be. What is that? - My tooth fell out.\n- Yeah. - [Leah] Can I see your mouth? Did it hurt very bad or\njust a little bit bad? - Just a little. - [Leah] You pretty brave? - Yeah. - So for me a bad pain day\noften means being stuck in bed, which is hard as a single\nmom to a six year old who wants to be going\nout and doing things. It's not really fair to her either. She can sit in bed with me\nall day and watch movies, but why should she have to? I do a lot of things to manage my pain. Marijuana is really just one tool in a great big bucket of tools I have. But in terms of pain\nmanagement in the moment, microdosing helps me, not\nmore than anything else, because honestly, prescription\npain killers I've been given knock out the pain better, but marijuana helps to\ntake the edge off the pain while still allowing me to be functional, whereas the prescription\npain killers I've been given knock me out too and, as a mom, that's not an acceptable solution. So these are some of the products I use. These are really small mints, and the thing I like about these is they come in the small doses I prefer. It's like 1.6 milligrams a mint, which is usually my preferred dosage. So this is my favorite product. I also buy chocolate bars. These chocolate bars come in 5\nmilligram dosages per square. The thing I like about this is I can get even smaller doses if I want, just because I can take a small bite and I could break one of these squares up into five or six pieces if I wanted. All of these are kept in my freezer, in a special box that my kiddo\nknows is mommy's medicine. We've talked about it\nand discussed the fact that these look like candy,\nbut that they're not. Hey Josie. Oh, did you just wake up? Thank you for joining\nus, little sleepy head. (laughing) Can I ask you a question? What are these things? - Mommy medicine. - And are you ever supposed\nto touch any of this? No, how come? - Because.\n- Cause it's not for kids? Love you.\n(lips smacking) I think at the end of the day, we're all kind of just trying to survive and that may be especially\ntrue for those of us with chronic pain conditions or mental health struggles. We just wanna be the best\nversions of ourselves. For me, microdosing helps me to be the best version of myself. After years of trying\njust about every solution and every option available, it's one of the best that I've found, and like I said before, it's just one tool in my toolbox, but yeah,\nit makes me a better mom because it helps me to get\nout of bed in the morning when I'm having a bad pain day, and it helps me to clear my head when my anxiety is spinning me out. It gives my child the version\nof me that she deserves, a mom who is functional and happy and able to get through the day. I think a lot of people take for granted that not everybody has that\nwithout the additional help. Whether I were taking a\nprescription medication or this medication that I'm\nable to buy at the store, shouldn't matter. It's something that helps. It's something that gives me\nthe version of me I wanna be. It allows me to have relief and it gives my daughter\nthe mom she deserves.

down to San Onofre and go surf we get down there and she said well what do you think about trying some cannabis today I said I could be open to that brings out this beautiful bomb and I go to hit it and I held it in you should let that out now you should breathe choked it out I said I'm feeling all fuzzy what are these little stars he goes no that's that's just because you have lack of oxygen and I said maybe I should just go sit by the beach at this point and I look at him and I say I think we're having a tsunami I think this huge tidal wave coming up you guys let's go get the board this is the perfect time let's get out there and stop there on the board and I just remember feeling completely at peace with the world and then I just started laughing and kicking the water and he's like maybe don't make a scene but this is really fun and that was the first time I got high my favorite way to consume I love my joint I love it just having a nice classy joint now we're starting to get clever and roll rose petal joints just beyond nice classy cruising going for a skate that's one of my favourite ways I don't prefer being called a budtender I prefer cannabis consultant I've done a

get high just give me any flower okay so are you in the mood for creativity are you in the mood for relaxing your body or are you in a zone where you want to get going throughout your day but you're gonna smoke them in day so maybe you want it to ease into your night time and it just depends upon what they're coming in with that day you're not asking a question just about what they want from the shop it gives them a chance to dial in on where they're at in their own headspace in their own body what do I need right now and it's such a rare question to receive throughout the day so it's really nice it's a butane hitting DAB's it drives me nice to hear that somebody is dealing with chemotherapy taking adapt with a butane carton it's kind of like you're eating a bag of Cheetos and you're just going for it it's the same thing you've got to focus on the health element why don't you do somebody to something so full of toxins if they're trying to flush that out I always tell patients that when you are feeling a little too high you should get yourself some lemons get some vitamin C in your system go for some CBD we have these amazing little chews that you can pop in water [Music] the more CBD that you take in day by day the stronger you'll be able to maintain your high levels because it's going to help balance you back down so that the next time you get high you keep up with your levels but if you're constantly smoking THC it's gonna become more difficult for you to stay at the same level so get your CBDT sherry so you're actually saving money so you can still get I tend to look for the body what they're doing when they walk in and to kind of cut it over you know and they've got the hood on almost always guarantee they're gonna go for an indica and then there's like the

back surgery I was left with severe chronic pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "-oFotKamo5c": "some in the cannabis industry are considering using pot testing labs for

Los Angeles he believes that with proper accreditation and safety training on handling samples Kovach 19 testing could be on the horizon resources getting set up to do one thing and kind of repurposing part of the lab to do the other so not that it's not possible but there's certainly some challenges in doing so both experts say they are unaware of any labs that are currently doing kovat 19 testing right now it's only in discussions Jennifer Kastner 10 News", "-Yn9dXRFT4Y": "the Joe Rogan experience what was the last second ellic trip you had any I did mushrooms couple months ago yeah how is that it's [ __ ] awesome where'd you do him um did him with re on the show we did did him during a podcast really yeah and do you guys start tripping during the podcast yeah yeah we're having fun what is what does it sound like it was great podcast was great we didn't take too much yeah we took enough and what like you know no one can tell when you're on them like you can still function normally yeah I mean it depends on how far you go please you guys are so funny yeah you can go down the rabbit hole okay I'm you can go down the rabbit hole and be incoherent mm-hmm mushrooms it's dose-dependent I mean what you're doing is like you're getting you know you take a little bit you're like shaking hands with the Angels but you're not going to heaven you're not going to visit them you're like hi how are you oh my god you're so wonderful but you're not like riding on their wings going going to the other dimension but if you take enough that's where you go if you take enough you're not talking to anybody and have you done Alice T yes and good yes great experience yeah oh you had a bad experience on that no no I took it I took it later in life I don't think it's I think most of these psychedelics where you have bad experiences what you're having is your own psychological dilemma and then your battle with whatever the the drug or the psychedelic is trying to do to you versus what your ego is trying to control and keep it from happening I mean I've seen a lot of people have bad trips on some of the worst trips I've ever seen people have was from edible pot edible pot is one of the strongest things that people don't recognize mm-hmm it's it's a very different drug than smoking it and when you know you when you think of things that can take you down the rabbit hole you don't think of edible pot people think of pot is just like oh you're gonna get a high maybe you can get too high but you're just getting high but boom when you eat it it's a completely different animal yeah literally like physiologically it's a different really yeah it's create something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that's five times more psychoactive than THC and what it's like not even psychoactive in smoking it it's a different drug that's a little different totally different drug that makes complete sense yeah it's a different drug it's processed by your liver well there's something called the one pass that passes through your liver and the THC gets processed into eleven hydroxy metabolites Google it's trippy [ __ ] I've way stronger registered on some Micro dos versions of mushrooms that I have to add two of them and they were it was great it just made things a little bit brighter have you ever microdose yes you know does that all-time hey white oh really Ron white so micro dosing [ __ ] yeah cuz I'm on this new drug it's called mushrooms and I just take a little bit every day woah yeah I know a lot of people to do that yeah a lot like dozens dozens of people who microdose including fighters I know a lot of fighters from microdose yeah I forgot today was even on any I was like I was just like oh this room looks like cooler yeah I just feel so oh yeah I ate that little piece yeah you just feel a little better and you're like what is all I took mushrooms yeah I forgot [Applause]", "JehDIOKqrI4": "hey what's going on youtube it is nubia420 here and today i'm going to show you guys how the math that i use to calculate my edible strength now i get this question asked a lot everybody wants to know how many milligrams how do i know how many milligrams how do i know how to dose and we're going to go over that today now this video is going to be a bit longer than usual because not only am i going to show you how to calculate the strength of your edibles when you're just you know dumping a certain value of weed into it but i'm also going to show you how to figure out how much we to use to reach a specific strength in your final product now for today's example we're going to use some cherry star number 10 from a local dispensary here and you can see it is 18.47 percent so in order to really calculate your strength you have to know what you're starting with um you can guess or estimate guesstimate they say anything on the black market is usually going to be about 15 if uh you're using keith you could assume maybe 30 20 it just it really depends on what you're working with and you're going to need a calculator uh this is what my phone is here for all of you folks out there with your fancy iphones in your you know galaxy s10s you can absolutely do all the math you need to for this right on your calculator on your phones because i have like a motorola g7 or something and it does it so first we know that we have the weed that we have is eighteen point four seven percent okay now math is not my strong suit but i'm gonna try to do it anyway all right now we have or had an eighth of this so an eighth is 3.5 grams so 3.5 grams and also you know my handwriting is not the best so y'all just bear with me all right let me move that out the way so this is ultimately how much our final product can be we only have 3.5 grams of work weight and it's coming in at 18.47 percent now what does 18.47 mean it means that in one gram of cannabis flour of this cherry star number 10 flower now i put those on there make it easier you have 184.7 milligrams of thc that's what that means now how do we get to that number you can either take your percent 18.47 and you can move the decimal place to spots and it would give you zero point one eight four seven you will take that number and you would times by 1 000 milligrams because there's a thousand milligrams in a gram and then that would equal one eight four point seven so 184.7 milligrams per gram all right now that's in one gram we have 3.5 so if we took that whole thing and we decarbed it and then we infuse say a half a cup of oil with it because the recipe calls for half a cup of oil what would that batch look like so let's say our brownies call for half a cup of oil we have 3.5 grams let's just infuse the whole thing we just want to infuse the whole thing so we're going to take our 184 so that's our number so 184.7 milligrams and we're going to times it by 3.5 grams because that's how much we're going to use and you end up with you could do it right on here because math is not my ministry uh 184.7 times 3.5 equals 646.45 milligrams so if we just took all of our cherry star number 10 and we ground it up and we de-carved it and then we infused it into our oil the maximum amount of thc that the brownies could have let's say we're making brownies the brownies could have is 646.45 um that's the most basic of edible strange explanations that you can get now that's assuming we have a 100 infusion rate we don't infusion rates vary depending on what uh oil you're using so butter has its own rate i believe it's around eighty percent like 75 to 80. i know coconut oil i believe is about 80 um ever clear if you're making a tincture has the highest infusion rate that is commercially available and that's at 95 percent so when you're infusing with uh everclear you're you're getting everything pretty much that the plant has to offer now we'll we'll swing back to infusion rates a little bit later but let's say you want to make a batch of brownies and you want them to be 300 milligrams you want the entire batch of brownies to be 300 milligrams because you get six brownies out of a batch and you want each brownie to be 50 milligrams each all right so this is now we're going to to show you how to know how much flour to use from the beginning all right so let's see so we're making brownies i'm just writing down all the things i said so we have six each we want them at 50 milligrams each and of course you would just times here to figure out how much you need so [Music] 6 times 50 equals 300. so walk together we need to make an infusion with 300 milligrams that's how much we want our brownies to be all right now how can we work backwards to figure out how much flour to use of our 3.5 grams so this is how i set it up i'm not saying it's perfect i'm not saying it's the only way that you can do it i'm saying this is how i do it and it works for the most part so we have 300 milligrams this is how this is what we want to end with i put that over one you just do you just put that over one we have over here are per gram so we have 184.7 milligrams per 1 gram which means that we're going to divide 300 by 184 so 300 divided by 184.7 equals 1.6242 yeah we'll say 1.63 grams now if i want to make a batch of brownies and i only want to infuse enough oil to get to use in this one batch that's it i only want to infuse a half a cup of oil because i i only want that we're going to use 1.63 grams of bud to get to our 300 milligrams so that's great because now you still have somebody left to smoke or infusing something else later on like you know a lot of people you guys i know that you don't want a pound or two pounds of butter just sitting in your freezer or you don't want three cups of coconut oil just you know sitting on your countertop we do but other people don't you know it might just be for one special event and that's it you might have kids in the house you can have all sorts of things that you just you don't want a lot of infused um items just kind of laying around so this is a way to just do it by batch and to not waste like you know you're not going to have a lot of waste here but you will need a scale that goes to the hundredth in order to get it now if of course you don't have a scale that goes to 100 you can certainly just round up maybe it only goes to the 10th maybe it it's just a whole gram integer that's it so just do two grams and call it a day uh one of the other things is that we're assuming with this 1.63 that we have 100 infusion rates when we know that we don't we only have eighty percent infusion rate which means we're going to have about a 20 percent loss because we always use coconut oil i love it it's the most the most versatile infusion medium that you can use in my opinion um next to everclear yeah so we'll take this 1.6 and let's account for our 20 percent loss right we're going to times that by 0.20 because this is what we're going to lose 20 is 0.20 so let's do 1.63 times 0.20 it equals 0.326 so we'll say 0.33 let's come down and add that three two or one point six three and it should be one point nine but i'll show you guys just because 1.96 so that's how many grams we would need or 2 grams this is how many grams we would need to khaki it to infuse into coconut oil to get our 300 milligram strength so 1.96 grams and that's it that's our final number considering at 80 percent infusion rate and coconut oil not if you don't care about you know really splitting hairs here oh it doesn't matter then just go with that this is just an added step counting for losses that you really you don't really necessarily have to do especially if you're a home baker now if you guys are out here you know putting together packaging selling it on the black market you should absolutely do the math to make sure people know what they're getting um if you're out here spraying distillate on stuff and just hoping that it hits shame on you you are everything that's wrong with the black market um so let me know if you have any questions again i am not a mathematician uh i took the minimum math requirements that my college said i had to take to graduate and recall that a day but i do know a little bit of cannabis math so uh let me know if you guys have any questions it's really simple just take your units with you uh it helps to make sure that what you get at the end is the correct thing so again i know this is like already longer than i really wanted it to be but let's just do a really quick review here so when we're calculating our edible strength right you have to know what you're starting with so that was our eighteen point four seven percent and we had an eighth of it or 3.5 grams if you don't know the percent of what you're starting with guesstimate assume probably about 15 now there is a chance that you will be wildly inaccurate especially if you're not some really fire stuff but what you could just guess 15 to 20 of 20 is a bit on the higher side when you do it you have to figure out your grams how many milligrams do i have per gram that is the very first step if you don't have that you won't be able to do any of the other steps it all builds on each other okay so for our percent we know that we can times it by a thousand and that's how we're going to get how many milligrams we have per gram once we have our milligrams per gram we go ahead and we times that by the total number of grams that we have that gives us our total grams in the entire thing if we were to just take this eighth and infuse it that's exactly what we would get 646.45 milligrams now that's using the entire thing that's assuming a 100 infusion rate but let's say we have a batch that we want to be a specific strength so we want it to be 300 milligrams uh 600 is just too high for us you know we just got a couple of light weights eating 50 milligram brownies you're not a lightweight if you're eating a 50 milligram brownie that was a joke you guys um so we want to take a batch and make six brownies and we want them to be 50 milligrams each that's we need 300 milligrams in our infused oil in order to get the 300 milligrams we're going to throw that over one to make a fraction and then we'll go and we know we have one gram and in our one gram we have 184.7 milligrams so we're going to divide our total number of milligrams that we want by the number of milligrams programs that we have and we end up with 1.63 grams that's how much cannabis we have to use to get 300 milligrams in our total batch of brownies um now and again that's accounting for a 100 infusion rate but we know that that is not so we know that coconut oil only has about an 80 infusion rate which means we're going to have a 20 loss so to account for our 20 loss we have our grams that we got at 100 and we times it by 0.20 to get what we're going to lose we circle back and we add what we're going to lose to how many grams we need at 100 percent so we add our 1.63 plus 0.33 and we end up with 1.96 grams now 1.96 grams will get us to our milligrams including taking into account that we only have a 80 infusion rate makes sense right so it's not that hard at all and there are some calculators online that you can use that'll give you the same thing um again let me uh let me know if you guys have any questions but again i am also not a mathematician and uh stay safe and i hope that everyone is having a good day [Music] peace", "MhGFOk2WQ00": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabine holistic health is a non-profit organization that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs medical cannabis adds hundreds of dollars per month in out-of-pocket expenses for a safe effective medication that patients struggle to afford all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing a completely non-intoxicating way to use medical cannabis even when used with high thc strains topicals are lotions that are applied to the skin and can help with different skin conditions as well as relieve localized pain and inflammation they can also be very easily made at home so let's talk all about using medical cannabis topicals topicals are cannabis infused body lotions creams salves or oils that are applied directly to the skin since the cannabis topicals are applied to the skin cannabinoids do not enter the bloodstream making them completely non-intoxicating even when the topical contains high amounts of thc the skin contains cb2 receptors which are activated by endocannabinoids produced by the body and the cannabinoids in cannabis cannabinoids in cannabis and endocannabinoids produced naturally by the body are very similar they both bind to cannabinoid receptors in high concentrations throughout the body to regulate health and homeostasis of our most important systems cannabinoid receptors are located throughout the body in high concentrations in the heart brain central nervous system bones immune system vital organs and the skin this is what makes medical marijuana effective across so many conditions and why topical applications can be effective in relieving localized pain inflammation and skin conditions through cb2 receptor activation in the skin topical applications of cannabis are excellent choices for patients with arthritis rheumatoid arthritis skin conditions like dermatitis psoriasis pruritus chronic itching or eczema they can also be effective for patients who suffer from any condition that results in localized pain or inflammation as well as for treating lupus cramps headaches migraines and even acne endocannabinoids have been linked to the production of oils by the skin that is a factor in acne and also indicates cannabinoids as a treatment for acne cbd has been shown to reduce the production of sebum in the skin that produces acne dr ethan russo an avid cannabis researcher and well-known physician recommended a combination of cbd limonene linalo and pinene in a topical as a treatment for acne these cannabinoids and terpenes are all antibiotics that fight against bacteria and skin mechanisms that lead to acne it is also well established that most cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis are potent anti-inflammatories pain relievers and antibiotics therefore topical applications can relieve pain inflammation and bacteria associated with skin and other medical conditions as medical marijuana research grows it is probable that topicals will be discovered as beneficial for other conditions as well topicals should be available in several different varieties at the dispensary including high thc high cbd and equal thc to cbd strains topicals usually range from between 5 to seventy dollars depending on the amount potency state and dispensary they can be made very easily at home from cannabis flower as well use the links in the description for very simple recipes for making cannabis-infused body lotion and salve from cannabis flour these can be made fairly quickly if you already have cannabis infused oil prepared and in a few hours if you need to make your own cannabis oil they can also be personalized with the addition of essential oils of your choosing topicals are extremely easy to use they are simply applied to the skin wherever you need relief from skin conditions pain or inflammation if you are making or buying topicals for acne it is recommended to buy or use a strain that is high in cbd and also has levels of limonene linalo and pining for other skin conditions topicals high in both thc and cbd should be effective the skin contains cb2 receptors thc binds equally to both cb1 and cb2 receptors cbd binds more effectively to cb2 receptors since the skin has cb2 receptors either thc or cbd should be effective in activating these receptors to treat skin conditions or localize pain and inflammation you can find a complete downloadable chart of the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis and their medical applications to help you find your best medication and strain when making or buying topicals many of the cannabinoids and terpenes also have antibacterial qualities that would be beneficial to treating many skin conditions there is no risk of over medication with topicals because they do not produce high effects or enter the bloodstream however it is recommended to start by applying a small amount to a small area of the skin and wait several hours to ensure that you don't have an allergic reaction or sensitivity to the topical like a rash allergic reactions and sensitivities are rare but it is a good idea to make sure it doesn't happen to you before applying greater quantities to larger areas of the skin since cannabinoids are such potent anti-inflammatories they are most often very soothing to the skin even if you don't suffer from skin conditions or pain cannabis infused topicals and oils have been found effective in healing a wide variety of skin conditions including lesions and blemishes preclinical studies have also shown some anti-aging effects of cannabis topicals so they may be effective for wrinkles and just overall skin health clinical studies have shown that cannabis topicals and activating cb2 receptors in the skin can treat psoriasis pruritus or chronic itching and dermatitis cannabis topicals are safe and non-intoxicating and very beneficial for skin conditions inflammation and pain relief they will only relieve symptoms in the area in which they are applied making them a desirable option to treat skin conditions if your dispensary does not have a variety of topicals available or you would like to make your own there are many resources to do so the one that i have found the most beneficial is the cannabis spa at home a book by sandra hinchliff that is also linked in the description this book and several others by sandra hinchliff outline how to make all kinds of topicals including bath bombs lotions salves oils and more if you are interested in making your own topicals her books are definitely valuable resources while topicals can be especially important for skin conditions as well as other conditions like acne headaches migraines lupus pain inflammation and cramps they are also good for all people to maintain skin health making topicals and lotions with cannabis can also be fun for a girls night or to enjoy a relaxing spa night at home use the links in the description for more resources for making topicals as well as using medical marijuana in general and finding your best medical strain you can

research resources and information", "COxEoW_rsLw": "well hi everybody great to be with you today as an accent my name's Samantha Miller I'm the president chief scientists of pure analytics and chief science officer of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "LrPQrcRx0F4": "- Hi, I'm Dr. Tracey Marks, a psychiatrist and I make mental health education videos. CBD or Cannabidiol has become a popular go to drug to use for a variety of problems. If you don't know that much about CBD, here's the quick back story. The marijuana plant also called cannabis, is made up of over 100 chemical substances called cannabinoids. The most abundant cannabinoid is THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. It has mind-altering properties. The second most abundant\ncannabinoid is cannabidiol, also known as CBD for short. It does not have the\nmind-altering properties. So, when people refer\nto marijuana, the plant, they're usually referring to something that has a combination of THC and CBD. Marijuana is illegal in many states but more and more states are allowing for the\nrecreational use of marijuana as well as medical use,\ncalled medical marijuana. With medical marijuana, the amount of THC you get can be adjusted such that you have a\nhigh percentage of THC or a low percentage. CBD on the other hand is legal because it does not have the\nmind-altering properties. So that's the landscape of this situation. There's only one FDA-approved CBD prescription medication,\ncalled Epidiolex. It's approved for a specific\nkind of seizure disorder. But you can get CBD without a prescription and it's being marketed\nfor all kind of problems. Pain, anxiety, PTSD, depression, and ADHD among other things. However, there really isn't\nstrong research evidence showing that CBD consistently and effectively treats these disorders. For example, the Veterans\nAdministration did a big analysis looking at several studies for the use of cannabis and pain and PTSD. Now, just to be clear, they\nlooked at studies using cannabis which included THC and CBD. Nevertheless, in the\nVA analysis, they find, they found what they call, low strength evidence that cannabis may\neliminate neuropathic pain but there wasn't enough\nevidence that it was beneficial for other types of pain like arthritis. And this was using cannabis with a THC/CBD content of 1-1 or 2-1. The 2-1 means that it had\ntwice as much THC as CBD. What's low strength evidence? Low strength evidence means that the testing was not very rigorous or there may have been\ninconsistent results, like one study was positive while the other one was negative. To really have strong evidence, you need to see results\nthat can be replicated so each time you get the\nsame kind of results. There have been other organizations that have analyzed data and\nconducted their own research. And to date, the evidence\nis still inconsistent on the ability of cannabis\nand especially CBD alone to improve these disorders. In fact, in November 2019, the FDA published a news\nrelease on their website warning 15 companies for illegally selling\nproducts containing CBD. I'll post the link to their website so you can see the companies that received the warning letters. The FDA makes it completely transparent. They even give you a link to the letter that they sent to the company. Yikes. The FDA is serious. They even have sharing links so you can spread the\nword about their warnings. I don't know how I feel about that part. If you visit the site in this letter, you can see that it looks\nlike a great source of CBD, a very legitimate looking business. You may say, I thought CBD was legal, so why is the FDA saying\nit's being sold illegally? Because if you make\nstatements about a product healing or treating a disease, the FDA considers your product a drug. And if you're marketing a drug, you have to follow very strict regulations usually around showing effectiveness and establishing safety. The FDA also has rules\nabout marketing products as a dietary supplement. So why is the FDA being\nso hardcore about this? They speak to this on their website about their concerns for safety. Here's another page where they talk about what you need to know if\nyou're going to use CBD. As with any supplement, just because it's natural, doesn't mean it won't\ncause problems for you. Some of the side effects\ninclude liver injury and changes in alertness. Also, it's still unknown what\nthe long term effects will be for people who use it regularly. And get this, there were animal studies that showed decreased testicular size, sperm count and testosterone. And these changes even\noccurred in the male offspring when the mother's were given CBD. Do these findings cross over to humans? We don't know. It may not, but you won't\nknow until you know. Does this mean you shouldn't use CBD? Not necessarily, but it does mean you need to\nbe aware of the safety concerns and the fact that it may not work for you. In my own practice, I've seen people say that\nit helped with their pain more than it helped with their anxiety. And it seems to be pretty hit or miss. The reason I don't officially\nrecommend it to patients is sourcing issues. When I drive home from work, I see signs on the streets\nsaying, get your CBD here. How are these people\nmanufacturing this product? On the FDA website, it says that they're\ninvestigating some reports of CBD containing unsafe\nlevels of contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metal, and THC. So, I think we need some more control over how you get the product. When it comes to using CBD, I think that we're still\nat the beginning stages of exploring and recognizing\nwhat disorders it can help. The good news is, the research on the medical\nuse of cannabis has not stopped so just because we don't\nhave good evidence now, doesn't mean it won't come. The drug Sativex is approved\nto treat neuropathic pain and other types of pain, but it's not available\nin the United States. It's still in the clinical\ntrials phase here in the U.S. However, this drug contains\na 1-1 ratio of THC to CBD just like the drugs in the\nVeterans Administration studies. So, does this mean we really do need THC to get the therapeutic effect of cannabis? If so, that can mean\ntaking CBD alone is a waste because it subjects you to side effects without giving you enough benefits. These are questions that are\nstill need to be answered. So hopefully in the near future the science will catch up and we'll have a better understanding of what CBD can actually do and how much of it you need to do what you want it to do. In the meantime, it's experimental to use it for pain and other psychiatric disorders. Just investigate the source of it, look into the company that produces it, and be aware of the side effects.

Jay I have to say I did excellent so enjoy the rest of that bunch and we're gonna go put this to good use I've got my jar of fresh milk that I picked up from Cornerstone farm and I've headed over to Vashon velvet where one of Jodi's friends an amazing cannabis farm where she grows some really banging buds we're gonna pick our buds and I'm gonna go put this thing down cuz my hands are freezing right now [Music] before we do anything everybody needs a name tag state regulations excellent want to be in full compliance how did you guys get into the cannabis business when the state announced the rules for getting a license to grow cannabis they said there was a 30-day window and they might never have another window open so I thought chance of a lifetime we went for it and never looked back enjoyed every minute of it Bravo that is fantastic awesome and are you a cannabis enthusiast yourself I never know and then if it's a Saturday night I'll try some of the Laughing Buddha yeah so I wanted to show you the strain that I think would make some really great cupcakes this is our platinum blueberry this is a really space-age looking grow right here go ahead and stick your fingers in and take a sniff wow there are so many different flavors going on there I mean beyond just that tart blueberry aroma there's so much else going on like a maple syrup or yeah I can't get enough of that smell and as you can see we use exclusively LED lights which use about a third of the energy of regular standard HID lights so we're trying to reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible so Patrick how far along are these guys right here these are about two to three weeks from harvest at this point oh that good karma is paying off because I mean you've got these incredible looking buds so Jody do you think this is gonna go well in your cupcakes I like the sweetness I'm excited to see what it tastes like when these guys said they make stuff from scratch they were serious I mean every single ingredient comes from the source I met the cow that we got our cream from and I met the cannabis plant that we're gonna get our buds from and now I'm hanging out with the chickens we're gonna get our eggs from and then we'll be ready to make cupcakes [Music] we have all the ingredients right here to make cupcakes and it starts right here and we're going to skim the cream off the top how do we turn that into butter we have to churn it and this is a butter turner it's crazy steam punk jar that looks pretty arduous for one person but here check it out I have an idea if you just hold the jar and I'll go like this Wow don't hit this a little bit how long does it actually take it's gonna take about 30 to 45 minutes yeah that looks like butter all right and what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this butter into this bowl and we're gonna press it against the side to kind of squeeze out more of that buttermilk all right I think we are ready to melt this up and to infuse it with our canvas okay Jody how much weed do we have decarboxylate in here this is one gram of platinum blueberry from Vashon velvet threw it in the oven at 290 degrees for an hour and that allows it to decarboxylate which means it releases the THC what we're going to do with that we're gonna put this in this 1/2 cup of delicious butter we've been working so hard on and infuse it for 30 minutes from super low heat we're starting to smell good already so you're ready to strain it we got some cheesecloth in a strainer here with the bowl underneath it we're just gonna pour this straight through the cheesecloth there's all our spent weed flowers okay so what goes into a cupcake batter we're gonna put in the dry ingredients I have two cups of flour here then we have 1 and 3/4 cup of organic cane sugar so one teaspoon of baking powder and result is this gonna give you a little mix to combine them just a little make them next step we're going to add our cannabis butter yeah we put a lot of butter we get last wrap alright that looks good I like how it's breaking up we're going to take some of our wet ingredients and mix them together we're gonna start with four egg whites so we're gonna add to that a half a cup of warm water we're gonna add a half cup of sour cream we are doing in this recipe one teaspoon of vanilla paste and this is Madagascar per bone vanilla so we're just gonna whisk this together and now we're gonna incorporate this is going better let that mix a little and now we have a nice smooth delicious looking manner that is looking super creamy these are ready to go into the oven huh this is this is exciting as soon as we open that door back up we'll have cupcakes let's put them in the oven 325 we're gonna start with eight minutes and then we're gonna rotate it after eight minutes and do six more minutes or 14 minutes oh yeah those are perfect it's like beautiful awesome alright so while those are cooling let's open some good chip chocolate and get ready to make our buttercream this is our deep dark chocolate bar the Washington state serving size is 10 milligrams Wow tasty there's no plain tea flavor and I can barely taste it yeah you really gonna talk about it - yeah yeah I like it alright so what we're gonna do is we're gonna melt eight-pitch of chocolate bar so this is gonna be 80 milligrams of THC spread across 12 cupcakes that's about seven milligrams of cupcake we did the math on the cannabis cupcake batter and that is scene or so a milligrams per cupcake so you add that plus the seven and rectory all right great pretty potent cupcake we're gonna start with putting 2/3 cup of our delicious hand turn fresh butter so we have two and a quarter cup powdered sugar we're gonna add a pinch of salt blend it all up slowly so you don't get the cup cloud we're gonna put three tablespoons of fresh milk going back to the Madagascar I'm going to put one teaspoon vanilla and we're gonna add the cannabis infused good chip chocolate yeah that was amazing we're gonna let that mix in we're so close to having cupcakes so I'm a big fan of a hand swirl instead of piping on although you can do the other and grab a little dollop and then you do a

right thanks for watching", "CE3fqopiTBQ": "remember when cannabis was simple it meant marijuana pot THC drafts or weed it's getting complicated we're bombarded with CBD cannabidiol it's seemingly everywhere from medicines to supplements to foods and beauty products so what exactly is CBD and why is it different from THC used to get high let's make it simple CBD or cannabidiol is just one of about a hundred and fifty different bio chemicals called phyto cannabinoids that have so far been identified in cannabis plants the bio chemical is considered non psychoactive in other words consuming it doesn't get you high THC or tetrahydrocannabinol comes from a separate phyto cannabinoid THC a alone THC a produces no psychoactive effect but it converts to psychoactive THC when exposed to certain conditions of light oxygen and heat cannabis plants come in different shapes sizes Heights and widths and despite claims of multiple species only one exists it's called cannabis sativa it's the species to which both marijuana and hemp belong what makes the plants different among other things is concentration of CBD and THC a 99% of marijuana plants have THC a concentration between 2.5 and 22% hemp typically has THC a concentration of 0.3% or less marijuana CBD ranges between 0.1 and 12% hemp CBD Falls around 3.5% and can be bred for levels reaching as high as 20% the actual effects of cannabinoids including CBD are being studied for therapeutic use though research is still in its infancy non-psychoactive cannabinoid CBG is a suspected sleep aid CBC is a potential sedative there's also THC V and CBN both are psychoactive and suspected pain relievers what is known is that phyto cannabinoids bind to central nervous system receptors there's cb1 found primarily in the brain and cb2 found primarily in the immune system THC is especially adept at binding to cb1 brain receptors that edit non-essential memories to protect the brain from overload for example memories of what fellow commuters were wearing on your way to work these receptors tell your neurons to lie low it's that disconnect that THC seizes upon to make you feel relaxed and high but what about CBD does it calm inflammation relieve pain reduce anxiety does it belong in your morning latte the truth is detailed molecular effects of cannabinoids are unknown and research is somewhat crippled so far the FDA has approved only one CBD drug it's derived from marijuana and used to treat seizures while the 2018 farm bill decriminalized hemp marijuana research remains stifled because federally it's still classified as an illegal controlled substance it's for these reasons that researchers caution cannabinoids are part of a new frontier with potential to treat ailments from anxiety to migraines PTSD stroke and blood pressure maybe even turn back the clock so remember when cannabis was simple [Music]", "BzmZ_sb5dZk": "Cannabidiol -- also known as CBD -- is so\nhot right now. It\u2019s sold in pills, as an oil, in gummies,\nas a cream, a vape liquid, and even in bath bombs. CBD is one member of a group over 100 chemicals\ncalled cannabinoids that are produced by the marijuana plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, is another,\nmuch more famous one. It\u2019s the reason weed gets people high. So THC and CBD are produced by the same plant\nand their structures look really similar. Which raises the question: could you fail\na drug test by using CBD? Even though the structures of THC and CBD\nlook very similar, they act quite differently in your body. So far, the evidence suggests that CBD does\nnot get you high, nor does it produce any of the other classic THC symptoms: hunger,\ndizziness, hunger, difficulty concentrating, hunger, nausea, hunger, elevated heart rate,\nhunger, dry mouth, hunger, hunger, and the munchies. And what about drug tests? Urine marijuana drug screens test for one\nspecific metabolite of THC. They don\u2019t test for CBD. But there\u2019s two pieces of maybe bad news. First, because the structure of CBD and THC\nare so similar, some scientists were concerned that CBD might be converted to THC by your\nstomach acid. It\u2019s not too crazy of a hypothesis. Acids catalyze ring closures every day of\nthe week. And a few years ago, some researchers did\nin fact use a delicious sounding mixture called \u201csimulated gastric fluid,\u201d which is basically\nacid, table salt, and a few other things, to convert CBD to THC. But they did this reaction in a test tube. Or a beaker. Or maybe an Erlenmeyer flask. The point is, it wasn\u2019t in a person. A few studies since then have fed people pretty\nhigh doses of CBD and tested for THC in their blood and stomach contents, finding none. But CBD isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The bigger problem is that, because over-the-counter\nCBD products are not regulated by the FDA, there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019re getting\nwhat the label says you\u2019re getting. Back in 2017, doctors at UPenn analyzed the\nCBD and THC concentrations of 84 CBD oils, tinctures, and vape liquids, and found measurable\nlevels of THC in 18 of the samples -- that\u2019s more than 1 in 5. The levels were generally low -- but possibly\nhigh enough to set off a drug test. By the way, in that same study, only 26 of\nthe samples had CBD levels within 90-110% of what was on the label. If you\u2019re in the market for CBD, make sure\nyou look at that specific product\u2019s certificate of analysis first -- this a test performed\nby an independent lab to make sure the label is accurate. Make sure that the lab checked for THC, too\n-- sometimes you\u2019ll see relatively high levels of THC, right there in the fine print. You should also know that CBD has not been\nFDA approved for concentration, anxiety, stress, depression, pain, or almost any of the other\nthings it\u2019s being advertised for. As of right now, there\u2019s only one FDA-approved\ndrug containing CBD, for hard to treat seizures. So, could you fail a drug test by taking CBD? We gotta remind you that we\u2019re a YouTube\nchannel, and not a doctor, but our conclusion is: if you\u2019re 100% sure that your product\ncontains CBD and nothing else, you\u2019re extremely unlikely to fail a drug test for marijuana. But, given how often CBD products are not\naccurately labeled and how often THC was detected in them, it actually seems plausible that\nyou might fail a drug test because of a mislabeled or poorly analyzed CBD product. So in the end, your mom is probably right. Better safe than sorry. Have you ever had any unexpected CBD experiences? Let us know in the comments, and we\u2019ll see\nyou next week.", "2lsXC-BADyY": "- Nate started taking\nmedication for autism when he was around five years old. As Nate was getting into high school, the aggression levels just really started spiraling out of control. He randomly started running\ninto other classrooms, punching people for nothing. It took four adult men and\nhandcuffs to bring him down to the ground, cuff him and restrain him. At that time, he was taking\n18 pills every single day. And it wasn't even helping. I started researching the\nmedical marijuana states. We were able to come to California. I remembered seeing the\nbig neon cannabis leaf in the window, I'm like, \"Well\nthat's gotta be where we have to go.\" (laughs) (upbeat music) - [Interviewer] Why don't you\ntell me a little bit about your family, you have three kids. - Okay, my name is Jenni Mai. I have three sons on the autism spectrum. Each child is of course so\ndifferent, like any other child, and as far as them being on\nthe spectrum, Nathan is what is considered to be at\nthe very severe end. And rather than trying to\nfind the right medication, they just gave him more\nand more and more of it, and that was really the\nonly solution they had. I did not want him being\nchemically restrained in a bed, being (crying) taken care of by strangers. I'm sorry. I had come across this little video clip of a young boy who was just\nrepeatedly punching himself in the head. - [Reporter] 11 year old Alex\nEkels is severely autistic. His self-destructive\nbehavior brought on by-- - And it caught my attention because it was something that Nate had done. His parents were talking\nabout giving him some kind of an oil. I was confused, because it\nsounded like it was some kind of a marijuana derivative,\nand I was actually shocked and maybe even a little bit disgusted. - [Reporter] And after a\nfew months of treatment, the Ekels say they saw\na dramatic improvement. - Within just a few\nminutes of this boy taking the oil orally, he was\nsmiling, he was calm, and he wasn't hurting himself\nanymore, and I'm like, \"Wait, what just happened there?\" (laughs) I watched it a few more times, and I was completely\nshocked and desperate. - At that point, Jenni\nand her family just moved from Wisconsin to Missouri. Two states where getting pot\nlegally for really any reason is super difficult, but particularly medical\ncannabis to treat autism. Currently only 12 states include autism as a qualifying condition. Five other states and\nthe District of Colombia are considered autism friendly, meaning doctors can\nrecommend medical cannabis for debilitating conditions. So that leaves 33 states\nwhere you can't access medical cannabis to treat autism at all. - I was raised in the Nancy\nReagan \"Just say no\" era. - Say no to drugs, and say yes to life. - I would have never in\nmy life considered this to be a medicine, but I\nbasically told my husband, \"We have to try that.\" - Like most illicit drugs, the scientific and medical research of\nmarijuana has been challenging. But the tide appears to be turning. The first large scale\nclinical trials underway in Montefiore medical\ncenter in New York City. And it may be the key to\nunlocking access to treatment for children with autism, nationwide. Dr. Eric Hollander is leading that study. - I've been involved in research\ndeveloping new therapies and treatments, in\nautism spectrum disorders for about 30 years, and there's a big need to develop treatments for the\npoorer symptoms of autism. - This study focuses on a new\ncompound called Cannabidivarin or CBDV, it's an extract from\nthe cannabis plants similar to CBD, it doesn't include THC, the psychoactive drug that gets you high, and what Jenni uses to treat Nate, but it's the first step\nto studying cannabis to treat autism. - This particular\ncannabinoid has some effects on some of the underlying mechanisms that we think are essential to autism. The problem behaviors,\nthe destructive behaviors, and also in some of the\ncompulsive behaviors, or repetitive behaviors or\nperseverative behaviors, so it gets at a key mechanism\nthat we think is important. - There is reason to be optimistic. This new CBDV based drug is similar to one that's already been approved by the FDA to treat a severe form of\nepilepsy that shares some of the same symptoms that\nDr. Hollander is studying. This new research could\nhelp cement what has largely been anecdotal support of\nusing cannabis to treat autism. But while that research is\nongoing, parents like Jenni are moving to states that\nhave more lax marijuana laws. For Jenni and her family, that\nmeant packing up everything and moving all the way across the country. That decision may sound\nextreme, but for Jenni and Nate, it's been worth it. Their lives have been transformed since first visiting a dispensary. - We got home, and he\ntook a hit immediately. We got this one. - [Nate] Okay. - And within, not even five minutes, it was just like a light switch. He was happy, and just kind\nof looking around like, he had never seen the world\nin that way and he was smiling and looking at me, and\nI just knew right away, 'cause nothing acted that\nquickly or that positively ever. - Jenni has learned a lot since moving her family out to California. There she joined forces\nwith fellow mom, Ronda, to start the non-profit\nWhole Plant Access For Autism. Now it's a team of moms\ndedicating their lives to helping other families\nnavigate the challenges that come with getting cannabis\nfor their autistic kids. - I feel like a lot of people\nthat come to our booth, someone in their lives has\nbeen touched by autism, and they don't know that\nthis is an option for them. Other times we get people that you know, come to us after the event, they email us or they find us on social\nmedia and they want to learn. And that's kind of what we're\nabout, we're about educating. - We decided to take a\ndrive out to Joshua Tree. I had him vape and take an edible right before we left the house. He saw that I saw taking\npictures and most of the other pictures that I've\never taken of him in his life, it was kind of a vacant stare,\nhe wouldn't really look, he wouldn't really smile, and\nhe ran over in front of me and sat down. He sat there and he posed for a picture, like everybody else would\nin a situation like that. (sniffs) And I just, I'm like, \"That's it. That's basically his birth picture.\" You shouldn't have to go\nthrough the whole gamut of medications and side effects\nand long-term consequences of some of those side effects\nin order to get to it. Just look at cannabis as another tool in your tool belt to try. - Thanks for watching.

in fact illegal for you to use it doesn't matter if you have a prescription or even in your off-duty time it's still illegal in regards to the CBD oil there's a lot of companies out there that are speculating that they contain no THC or they contain the point zero three percent of the maximum allowed however since they are not FDA approved there is no government oversight to guarantee that those standards are met since there is no guarantee on those standards there is no guarantees that you won't test positive on a drug screen I've done a lot of research on these companies and have

claims behind these wellness products actually stand up to science CBD more formally known as cannabidiol is the cannabis extract but no that doesn't mean it can get you high so that's THC THC is the primary psychoactive component in in cannabis THC and CBD are both cannabinoids in the cannabis plant they differ because THC is intoxicating and CBD isn't and it has produces very little side effects

one of the more popular ones but it's also made its way into shower gels bottled water gummies and even tampons people claim that the wellness DVD helps with general aches and pains anxiety daily stresses and sleep but there's little evidence to say that it actually does help with this and now the NSA is cracking down on the sale of wellness CBD products under a law they're classified as normal foods this means the claims that they make and how safe they are need to stand up to testing before they can be authorized for sale there have been a few studies now where they've taken bottles

treating certain conditions that's epidural X which is approved for two very rare childhood epilepsies and then there Sativex which is licensed for like pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis only

know I'm gonna make it you know it's by mistake you never want to give your dog marijuana or anything like that I'll kind of talk and give you guys kind of the story of when I went down and I'll have some footage of the day you know going in and out and then the end of the video I'll have some more footage so basically what had happened was I have an ex-girlfriend okay I absolutely loved her dog like I grew up with dogs my whole life but me and her dog just had like this special bond and I just fell in love with pit bulls ever since I was up people just got pit bulls just cuz their look and they look aggressive and all that stuff but pit bulls are the most affectionate dog absolutely love them so I get a phone call alright I haven't talked to my ex-girlfriend in like 2 or 3 months she calls me she's like hey she calls me cry and she's like oh my god like Avis had a seizure or a stroke or whatever I can't lift her up and put her in her car you have to come over blah so I hop in my Jeep I fly down there like I freakin robbed a bank I'm like super like oh my god like this sucks like I love you know her dog so I get there and you know sure enough she's laying in her dog bed can't really walk is like drooling a little bit and I'm just like damn it like this is it you know I had to put her down or whatever so I pick her up take her to the vet and the vet gets to asking her questions she's like she's like okay how old is your dog has your dog maybe eaten anything or whatever and she's like oh she gets in the trash sometimes but she's never like nothing's ever happened to her and then she's like has she maybe eaten any marijuana whatever and then Desiree kind of pauses and she's just like and then it dawns on her okay her brother was over a brother I'd cancer and you know eating edibles and stuff like that really helps like his appetite and he doesn't have cancer anymore which is awesome but basically they they made like 20 pot cookies and somehow you know it dawned on her that she left the bag and that's what must have happened to Ava she goes oh my god that you know that must've been it she must have had the pot cookie so basically we go from thinking her dog is dying and having a stroke or whatever - oh she just is super high right now on weed and needs to come down off his high so it was actually like a really scary day that turned out best case scenario because you can't really overdose on weed like it's not gonna kill you or anything like that so after all of this desert was actually going on a trip and she was like hey can you watch Ava over the next few days because I don't want to just leave her alone when she's working you know tripping so I was like yeah sure whatever you know awesome she goes to my house and I bring the kennel all along because Ava with some pit bulls no matter like even if you you you try to train him good some of them are just a little bit dog aggressive so Ava happens to be very dog aggressive you know won't hurt a fly as far as humans and stuff like that but does not like other dogs you know and I had my my English taffy shadow but you know I had a kennel you know I could just separate them into rooms or whatever but I thought you know what this might be a perfect opportunity to kind of see if they can become friends because Ava is dog aggressive - random dogs but if she like she has been together with other dogs before in the past and it's worked out but I was kind of scared you know being you know my little puppy I don't want it like Ava freaking biting her biting biting him so I was like okay Ava's were very high right now when you're high the last thing you're thinking about is kicking someone's ass so I was like maybe Ava's super chill and whatever and I can kind of introduce the dog so I was super nervous to introduce shadow and Ava but it worked out perfectly so Ava had no aggression she was just chilling kind of excited and all this stuff so they became actually best friends after this Ava stayed over at my house and they cuddled together they were freaking licking each other's faces and all that stuff so definitely be careful guys if you guys smoke marijuana or anything like that if you guys have edibles laying around the house you definitely don't want your dogs to get into it Ava was high for like two or three days she had trouble walking running just we're actually weird like normally she just licks your face but she was like kind of biting you softly I was just just not acting like yourself so I can't imagine like what it would do 12 pot cookies to a 60 pound dog or a 55 pound dog I can't imagine me taking two of those cookies I'd be tripping out of my mind but yeah guys that's what happened kind of hesitated I'm making this video just because it's kind of a weird topic and some people could take it the wrong way and I know you have to be careful you can't just leave stuff like that laying around but thank God it wasn't like some pharmaceutical medications or anything like that because that would kill your dog even like ibuprofen or whatever but the marijuana happened to be in cookies and dogs [ __ ] you know love cookies so April was high for three days and then after that she was just fine and shadow and Ava have been best friends ever since you know me and my ex went out together or anything like that but sometimes like if she goes on a trip I'll watch her dog if if I go on a trip she'll watch shadow so but yeah I hope you guys like the video give it a thumbs up share this video with your friends and yeah just be careful you don't want this to happen to your dog I know it's kind of like it might be a little bit of a funny thing at the end of the day because it did go from we thought Ava was dying to oh she's just tripping out so for us it was kind of like a really awesome thing that she wasn't having a stroke or anything like that but at the same time be careful you don't want that to happen to your dog it's just you know it puts them through torture for a few days so yeah I hope you guys liked it and I'll see you guys next time you walk inside one thing she too long wanna see her walk come here evil walk to me okay yeah this definitely isn't funny but it's kind of funny it's just so relieved that she didn't have a stroke or a seizure or anything like that so this is like best-case scenario yeah we can link relax now well not relax that's better she's taking extra extra extra my neck come on longest pee ever just come oh my god she's so stoned look at her hey left how are you peeing again this Danish cheesy so weird come on Yvette come on you're just running everywhere come on what are you doing David Oh with that noise that noise tripping out so I found the bag I think this was the cookie bag I mean it looks exactly like it so this was in the dirt and it's been raining so it looks all gross now but she ate the cookies dude a dozen pot cookies a pothead you poor thing baby okay [Music]", "JsiiKH1pTk8": "what's up guys what's going on we are in Atlanta in this city right part of the city and when you go to cool areas they have flotation labs we'll get to that in a minute though but today full day of eating like Joe Rogan style we are in Atlanta we're outside of float - oh is that all it's a floatation tank Therapy Center and we've always wanted to do it but we thought today was the perfect day because Joe Rogan does it why not give it a go there's 90 minute sessions though so that's super long are all along Joe does it but we're going harder the first time around I'm doing the Oasis tank Matt's doing like the cave chamber for some patients so here we are Tonga you been trippin baby I know it's a cold world out there you've been missing out convos I could not live feeling great the pen is working in my head on straight top ten when I fell ill a y'all just [ __ ] what do you think don't tell me yet what is this there's underwear here his underwear on her door okay so I was in there for probably like 60 minutes I couldn't concentrate I couldn't lay still I wasn't relaxing I couldn't even keep my eyes closed saltwater was bothering me I started to get a headache and super dehydrated which is why I got out all that I came out so you're floating in a bath of water and I think there is magnesium and salt sodium it's like Epsom salt your body weight is like really easily suspended in the water the idea and the water is 94 degrees same temperature as your skin the idea is to deprive your body of as many senses as possible so you have earplugs in it's completely dark you can't feel you no sense of feel though it's just you and your mind I took my shower took an extra-long shower cause I knew I had time came out explained the situation to the woman and she was just like giving me this like tone like no that's never happened before I was like have you been in that tank specifically she's like I've been in all the tanks like have no one's ever had this problem and then she walks around back she comes back and she's like oh I'm gonna comp you I left the filter on so I was I didn't even get the experience I was in a jacuzzi it was just very uncomfortable and a terrible experience and like a waste of time so I got an espresso and luckily I found two but you go lime to make me feel better to make you feel a little better also I would say I didn't really like it much at all were you at least I was lay still I didn't ever really get into like a deep meditation like sometimes I meditate for 15 minutes and I would say I like that better than 90 minutes of this and it was 90 minutes so it's like really long did you feel like time went by fast or slow when the music started to signify the end of 90 minutes you if that was 15 minutes I would have believed you like I didn't really have any time is just like non-existent but I was wanting it to be 90 minutes like as soon as the music started I was like okay good so she only charged us for one person I don't want to do gonna come back so I'd say like cryotherapy is one thing we've tried this is another thing we've tried they're kind of like same category they're pretty expensive similarly price I would you guys therapy hands-down I agree I would prefer crying I prefer like a carpet therapy's three minutes musics playing I'm going I'm moving but she did say what was interesting she's never heard of Joe Rogan which I she was like who that and I tried to explain it she was again 90 percent of people that come in here say Joe Rogan and I've never heard of him yeah well this whole industry started after he started talking about it yeah one of Joe Rogan's rules is he only eats meat that he hunts and he eats a lot of elk so we don't hunt I've gone hunting with my dad a few times never actually got something have you ever hunted no but we got this it's from Roo nutrition com it's elk so we got one pound of ground elk if we try it Elka before no we're gonna try this alpha brain this is like a nootropic Joe takes most days I think I'll see how much it helps me focus steps update I'm at 2,300 taste-test ooh I like that it comes on strong at the end but it's like a really light flavor yeah I could drink this for sure every day okay so here's what I got six ounces of ground elk just like slightly seasoned I got four eggs cooked sunny-side up half an avocado and about what is that three ounces of black berries and then here's mega she has three ounces of black berries half an avocado three ounces of elk and two eggs first things first how do you feel about joe rogan I like him listening to his podcast he's funny but he's very just like stodgy and his beliefs I think he's pretty open-minded from what I know he seems very just like regimented and strict and like knows what he thinks is best and does just that few people have had a bigger influence on my life in Joe Rogan basically I started listening to his podcast when I was like 21 I'm almost 30 now I guess I started more like self-improvement based on what he was talking about a lot so I might sound dumb to a lot of you but I think there's a lot of people my age that were like heavily influenced by his podcast I'd say he's a pretty positive influence overall he's played zero yeah so that's why like my thoughts are not as valid I would say even as yours because you know him I don't consider him a friend even though I've never met him I don't know him so he has chickens in his backyard so we're doing four eggs they're not actually from chickens in our backyard arned did he yeah we're holding food here brokeback - farts up there from pasture raised chickens like at the grocery store you know like I told farms or it yeah those look fire you cook them like so crispy and perfect I've been cooking them like this more because the whites you actually get more of the proteins when the the whites are cooked and you get more of the nutrients in the eggs when the yolks are raw or like close to raw that true yeah and then we got elk here and I did cook it I think pretty rare are you gonna try it yeah so a cool thing Joe Rogan does is he only eats meat that he's actually hunted and killed with his bow hmm pretty indistinguishable from our burger yeah it's just a little leaner slightly tougher I would say it's really good oh my god it's like a burger black berries taste like candy very taste like candy what's so three ounces not even if I've got about four carbs you for net carbs that was a low-fat meal yes overall in that meal it was probably like 40 grams of fat kinda low and just like the general premise of Joe's diet I guess we didn't go into he does mostly keto mm-hmm he definitely takes some liberties though I don't think he's doing he doe and like constantly testing and making sure he's in ketosis 100% of the time but he does like Whole Foods I would say even yeah keto Whole Foods so like gave me some berries veggies but meal just wasn't as filling I know because I'm kind of feeling that too hungry or maybe it was the berries not bitter so Mikey berries all day one last thing we forgot to mention we had bulletproof coffee this morning Joe does that I think most days and also it's pretty hard to like figure out what he eats every day cuz he doesn't really say I'm just like gathered what I've heard on the podcast I looked up some articles no one really knows and I looked at his Instagram it's mostly meat with like a little side of veggies so it's 3 p.m. we had our first meal what like one now I'm having like a big glass of bone broth here it's we had this in the fridge I want to say the bone broth had about like two tablespoons worth of beef fat and then the rest of it was just the broth I want to say I was actually noticeably less full after the Joe Rogan yeah I agreed I was less full when I mentioned that as soon as the meal is over cuz usually I'm like really full right after I eat a meal till I had half a serving of pili nuts Oh spin-spin-spin so good at spinning now we have a New York Strip elk and a New York Strip bison and an excited Julius elk looks better Oh does it I think the Bison looks better has a nice fat cap on the side this feels very Hardy here's what we got going for dinner we got what are these called not broccolini they're some kind of baby broccoli Brooklyn let's broco let it was on sale at Whole Foods so I grabbed that and then over here we got the what this one is the elk this one is the Bison and then I got some shallots butter and garlic I'm gonna season with salt and pepper pretty basic we're gonna cook the broccoli afterwards where all the fat kind of renders off the meat even though they're not that fatty but there was some fat in the pan from yesterday right this morning coming at you with dinner and I'm feeling so about the what's that thing we tried yeah it's a alpha brain I want to say like mild effects from it did you say that I would say if you see it at Whole Foods $2.50 I think it was give it a try yeah see if you like it I first like I thought I really felt something like I felt like tingly my back and I was like hyper focus for like a second it kind of went away so I'm not sure like you feels like I had drank an espresso before like I don't know what was that thing okay so we have dinner here this is the elk and that's the Bison yeah okay and then we have the broccoli as you saw with mushrooms shallots garlic total cost for a German day of eating not necessarily every day but today everything we ate 34 dollars per person but when Joe's doing it I mean he's not paying for the meat which was about I think 17 dollars worth of the cost so anything else he's probably not paying for anything like he's not paying for alpha brain either one thing we do also want to touch on that Joe Parr takes in a lot is smoking weed so apparently he's like a high-functioning I would say smoker because he like smokes a lot but then is also just like super productive that's really cool like he's using it not recreationally or like to relax he's using it to like like caffeine he's using it as a tool most people when thinking like hey I'm gonna smoke weed and I'm just gonna like write a 16-bar verse it's gonna blow people's mind like that or paint a painting or write a research paper or whatever and a lot of people ask like the interactions with THC and keto not know it doesn't really affect reaction right I have never read anything that it it interacts at all but I thought it would be a decent time to talk about my drug use I don't even like saying drug use since I guess I never have talked about this on our channel I was pretty much like a square up until I was graduated college moved to San Francisco then I started smoking weed every day every single day wake-and-bake basically unless I had to go to work weekends were wake and bake during the week I was a square until honestly like as soon as I got home I would smoke weed I can attest to that because I dated him for like six months out of our relationship he was really just getting after like I don't know just to hardcore weed smoker oh oh my god he's just ripping apart this fluffy winter blanket we have and he's there's just like stuff out of his mouth I would have to say on the whole positive impact on my life but I do think it can definitely I would have considered myself at one point an addict like to where I couldn't stop if I wanted to which isn't good I walked into his life though and then he realized there's more to life than just smoking weed I've never been like super into weed I smoked it but I think a positive that came out of it were the times I did enjoy it with Matt you know smoke eat a big bowl of popcorn so this is preachy dough and like watched shows and then like you know laugh and goof around so that was the only positive but aside from that I'm not like a productive person yeah not at all productive I've seen it more negative in those situations that positive like Joe Rogan obviously is Joe Rogan yeah so I would say he wouldn't be who he is without it but I think that's the exception not the rule current relationship I'd say a protic maybe once a week to relax at night I'm gonna be straightforward I feel like we don't really have that many big stresses in our life so like for me smoking weed made me more stressed about things but like now that I have like the best pets and I have my soul mate and elk in front of me like you know life is very relaxed and chill I wanted to go over the 10 tenants of Joe Rogan's life be the hero of your own movie be the best version of yourself okay here's actually a cool perspective change that I've heard in the past and I apply it to my life now that really helps me is like say one of your goals in life is to be a millionaire you can't just be a millionaire you have to become the person that's capable of being a millionaire through self development through self-improvement that's what makes you a millionaire it's not just like you know got to make a few tactical business moves you have to be the person that's capable of making a few tactical business moves stop making excuses I love that we're so full of excuses man you have to be fully accountable for everything that happens in your life you get divorced it's not your wife's fault it's your fault everything is your fault I mean whether it is in reality your fault or not always if you use that perspective like this is my fault then it's just gonna push you to be the best version of yourself I think all these were little probably play into each other but yeah take it to the extreme your wife cheated on you it's not her fault it's your fault yeah extreme ownership really analyze that explore difficult tasks push forward there's gonna be a lot of setbacks in life today you're gonna have a shitty day because your boss fires you when you're gonna get home and your wife's gonna complain to you about like the kids in dinner I'll push forward okay work towards something a decent percentage of people just go through the motions they don't know what they're working towards like an abstract concept of retirement get married have kids like I'm more muscled yeah none of that stuff is really clearly defined and I think when you have it well defined honestly like I read a book recently it's called the perfect day formula pretty good read writing five years in the future a day in your life like very almost like fictional you know but then you will it into reality wait years I have a ed-up I've been putting this off for so long like I woke up today I have a wife my three beautiful kids I hopped into my Porsche you know like that type of thing just write out what you want to become real focus on improving they're all kind of the same yeah you just written differently but they they're all little parts of the whole don't get stuck in life I've been stuck in my own personal just like cycle of like thoughts and like patterns and it's like hard to break those things but like if you are just able to like sit down and analyze what's going on why could be going on you're able to what's his what's the role don't get stuck in life you're able to unstick spend time in nature we suck at this so I'm that's not on my list I think it should be though I'm far from nature what we have been doing lately because you got to get some sunlight some days I literally don't leave the house only to drive to the gym I've been doing three to four walks a day because of my step so a fitbit's allowed me to get bored with nature number ten pursue your desires mine is to have little mats and Megas running around and we are currently pursuing that it could be something as small as find the best show on netflix every night if you watch one episode of one new show pursuing that yeah let us know what you guys come up with we're looking for ideas we're on tornado hunters right now which is really good though just a lot tougher the alt is good but under very underwhelming in flavor this one's pretty good I like there's no play we're almost so the elk is way more tender this is probably more flavorful bison is better overall I think oh yeah this has been a full day of gyro can eating comment below with anyone else you want us to try doing days of eating around a patrick probably Dave Asprey Johnson yeah who else is good and it has to be like relatively low carb I think to do it we could do it dwayne johnson cheat that i would be hospitalized alright guys thanks for watching [Music]", "rMMHqxyvVAU": "so what's up everybody welcome back to chef Judy's TV on today's episode of in the kitchen we're gonna be cooking cannabis infused cooking oil so what I have right here I have about 34 grams of shake I have about two cups of cooking oil and have about two cups of butter this video is sponsored this video sponsored by blessings on blessings dispensary in LA there are just 2157 west century Boulevard on the corner of Van Essen century so if you guys are ever in LA go ahead and check them out I'll leave all their informations in the description box down below but yeah they actually provided me with the shake for you guys that don't know what shake is shake is basically the leaves that fall out put a flower and settle at the bottom of the container this is some really high-grade shake it came from a high-grade plant if you guys get if you guys that's not as very much like you're just filling up my whole house my neighbors won't be big on big beech over here some but yeah so blessing a blessing dispensary supplied me with the shake shout out to my homie swag City over there he didn't want to subscribe me with the shake thank you guys for sponsoring this video but without further ado we gonna jump into it alright so the first thing we want to do is we want to decarboxylate the weeds basically we want to activate that Tec so the way we do that is we throw it in the oven a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes and it activates that THC that way we can put it into oil and do a further second step to activate the marijuana into the oil so I'm gonna go ahead and throw this in the oven and I'll see you on about 25 minutes alright peace so it's been about 25 minutes we just got the weed out of the oven as you can see I got separated to two piles 17 grams each like I said if you guys can see that color it got a little bit darker so now all that has to do is add the week to the jars and put the jars in a double boiler not really a double boiler I'm gonna do is put the jar and in a pot in the water that's slightly boiling like a like a mouth simmer you want the water to be about maybe 200 degrees and you want to put that in the water for about an hour and a half - two hours all right so now we're just going to transfer the weed to the jar I like to use the napkins cause as you can see it transfers very easy yeah I can see downtown let's begin for a same thing with your butter sack just to the butter so once again that's 17 grams of shake and about 2 cups of oil 2 cups of fat if you want to use the flour you can use a flower but cut that use about maybe a 8 3.5 grams of flour because the flour has more THC to the shanks so we're gonna have to go ahead and throw this into our boiler that got fitted over here slightly balding and we're gonna leave that in there for about an hour and a half to two hours we go come back and start pretty ugly I'll see y'all when it's finished all right peace alright everybody so a bit about an hour and a half we can go ahead and take these off now this one was my butter so we're going to do the butter first we got our storage containers right here this was restored in we got our strainer we also use coffee filters excreted and also this would be a double strain on there right oh so we don't do that like that big I like that hopefully I won't make a mess I'm kind of rushing because I got a I got a flank that I'm leaving for in an hour so kind of rushing but we still gonna do this the right way alright so this been in the pot boiling for about an hour and a half now we're just gonna strain it out and store it and that's all there is to it and that's how you make the butter and the oil alright so go ahead goodies over here at that point we make a mess kind of hot really I really wanted to use cheesecloth but I don't useful it's gonna take forever I'm just using the gate to squeeze not everything all - next one medicated [Music] [Music] sorry about the TV in the background I forgot to take that TV off okay it's not good like I said I'm Russian so I'm gonna do a better video I'm doing better videos to show y'all how it's really done but

marijuana has slowly been moving out of taboo and has been decriminalized or legalized in these countries is this a fair sentence in the 80s maisha waged the war on drugs people were caught detained and hung this was echoed worldwide the u.s. Portugal Australia and many other countries while this war included many other drugs we are going to talk about just marijuana marijuana was deemed a problem because of its psychotropic effects other than causing a high it was thought to trigger psychotic episodes and harm the development of a growing brain since then many of these suspicions have been proven to be right certain individuals may be predisposed to certain mental health conditions and upon this kind of release into the brain it can trigger a previously dormant mental health disorder and it may trigger schizophrenia psychosis agitation and restlessness common sense tells us that if it can trigger psychosis and if it acts on neurons if it acts on pain pathways that with long-term use there is bound to be some sort of neurogenic changes and malaysia has some of the toughest anti-drug laws having less than 50 grams of weed can lead you to imprisonment of up to 10 years and more than 200 grams you will be presumed to be a trafficker and this will lead to a trip to the loose however after over 30 years the numbers show that the war on drugs has been a failure ex-home ministers are hit Hamidi reflected how the war on drugs have failed to curb addiction rates and this is not unique to malaysia reports have made it clear that an all-out offensive against drugs just do not work in the u.s. cannabis usage has increased since the 80s and while data formation is cast Facebook groups in support for marijuana and investigative reports like these just go to show that it's not that out of the ordinary Portugal ahead of the curve came to the realization that a war does not work in 2001 it radically decriminalized all drugs and treated drug abuse as a health problem instead and surprise surprise they've hit record low drug mortality rates being the lowest in Western Europe while Portugal's approach has not been without its flaws it shed light on alternative paths to dealing with cannabis decriminalization and legalization but there is a clear distinction between the two when we talk about decriminalizing it we are talking about removing all references to that particular drug from the list or the act once you decriminalize it that means that it's no longer an offence or any effects when you decriminalize in total and have no laws to govern it it renders that particular type of drug subject to abuse and misuse legalizing it would mean to the extent of allowing new legislation so most governments would recognize also the corresponding need to regulate any potential abuse or misuse decriminalizing cannabis is a good first step but that's all it is a first step our criminal justice system will be able to shift resources to tackle actual crimes and this also prevents cannabis consumers from being labeled as criminals which is a big change countless lives have been destroyed for just being in possession of marijuana but this still leaves a vacuum for the source of cannabis cannabis traffickers bringing in unregulated products will still be in place and that is problematic which is why reports like this have shown that legalization is the way to go stating that this gives more power to the government to control and more importantly regulate the flow of marijuana it takes away the power from traffickers and ensures that users are not on the receiving end of impure goods that can and have taken lives can you explain of the detail of how legalization would work decriminalized cannabis as a dangerous drug under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 have in place your more effective scrutiny and training of medical practitioners and pharmacists under the poisons I ensure that only they can prescribe the correct amount dosages to people who they to really be in need of its medicinal benefits if you were to do that for medicinal purposes because the law of the under the poisons Act allows for its sale and supply in retail by these people tax revenue could be collected but we you've read is bad why all the talk about legalization for one a warned drugs simply does not work and marijuana has shown to have medical benefits there are two main substances that has come under scrutiny that one is cannabinoid which is CBD and the other is nine tetrahydrocannabinol which will we'll call THC there's good research to show that actually it has a lot of medical benefits CBD can cause medical positive effects whereas the THC is the one that is the culprit in creating the high that you get when you smoke pot for some reason you can't get pure forms of CBD they always come in a mixture and we find that the medical uses are positive when the CBD ratio is higher than the THC ratio some of the key areas in which the medical community look at cannabinoids is for treatment in neuropathic type pain these are pain due to nerves multiple sclerosis where you get severe muscle spasms and they have shown successful use in this niche areas also quite useful is in cancer treatment as we know a lot of cancer treatment is associated with nausea and vomiting refractory nausea and vomiting which is not amenable to the usual medications that we have and in epilepsy it can cause a reduction in the nerve stimulation so that it lowers the threshold for triggers of epilepsy and what we added studies have shown that cannabis is safer than alcohol and tobacco this study found the risks of cannabis has been overestimated while risks of alcohol underestimated but both tobacco and alcohol are legal and regulated contrary to the belief that everyone's going to look like an extra to Bob Marley music video if weed was legalized there's a stark difference between medicinal and recreational marijuana in the medical community we don't administer any medical marijuana in a smoking form it's available as a tablet in an oil form in which people can spray and and just like a GTN spray for either improving appetite reducing nausea improving pain or treatment in MS when you smoke it for example it is in the form of resins and there are other chemical compounds that we inhale and these chemical compounds can trigger different pathways and that is one of the postulated theories of the adverse effects of smoking marijuana medical marijuana can be smoked but to minimize the effects of THC which is what causes the high CBD pills oils and sprays are alternatives that could be considered and with measure being recently reported to be looking at legalizing medical marijuana this is a conversation that we will need to have while legalizing recreational usage of marijuana is something up for debate that is a whole different ballgame that's a lot more contentious it's a conversation for another time with the current laws in place there's no room for a person in need to acquire medical marijuana which leads to it going underground case in point look man look man fill the gap in the market for people that needed it and he's not the first one to do this either there's also the case of the veteran doctor ganja who was also arrested and charged for trafficking marijuana luckily many including our prime minister has called for Luqman sentence to be reviewed that's not to say that he didn't do anything wrong making medicine should be left to the experts and done under strict regulations but he definitely does not deserve to be punished like a trafficker [Music]", "icGZxDFddBk": "some mental health professionals are warning Canadians about an increase in cannabis induced psychosis they say that although the drug is now legal that doesn't necessarily mean it's risk-free let's bring in Chris Somerville he's chief executive of this schizophrenia Society of Canada joining me today from Winnipeg hi Chris hello so before we alarm people now that marijuana is legal can you tell me a bit about the numbers how much has there been a spike in people reporting cannabis related psychosis well now that it's legal to talk about it or rather to use it people are here to talk about the use and so the skits of Korean society is across Canada are experiencing more people talking about use and even though they don't have psychosis or schizophrenia I mean people come to us for other reasons as well around depression and anxiety and the main point I think is that no one should think that cannabis is harmless or benign I mean there are warnings for women who are breastfeeding who are pregnant there are warnings about respiratory problems so when we come to the brain a lot of people think that this is some sort of conspiracy the government or the society to keep people from using cannabis what we're all about informing people about safe use we do think harm and be informed about the rifts that can be had with use of cannabis okay so we don't have a lot of time so I want to get right to the nuts and bolts what qualifies as a psychotic episode and who's most at risk the first and most at risk for experiencing hallucinations and delusions in which interferes their ability to understand reality are those under the age of 25 because the brain is Neil Development Green conception and 25 those who use high potency cannabis those who use daily are to greater risk and those who have a family history of mental illness have a 5 infiltrator increase 40% of all psychosis Native Academy ok some good stats there appreciate that but to hear what you're saying or to delve into it a psych on episode is more likely to happen if you are predisposed to some kind of mental illness already that's not necessarily true see that's the great assumption that people think is that you're going to all you will automatically have schizophrenia regardless of whether or not you use cannabis or not schizophrenia is much more complex illness than we ever thought it is a number of illnesses and it's not just one genetic factor we know that people live and impoverished states have higher rates of schizophrenia so environmental factors are part of the development of schizophrenia and so are hallucinogenic drugs just a few seconds left then to tell me what's the messaging you're trying to get out today Chris well before you use learn all you can about safe use try to avoid use until you're in your late teens avoid high potency and certainly do not use daily because those who use daily tea have a two to threefold for your risk of developing psychosis appreciate your time thanks so much you're welcome Chris Somerville joining me today from Winnipeg", "OqTuUd9-ytg": "making accurate cannabis products was impossible we came and we made that a reality [Music] ardan is a biotech company that's focused on giving people tools so that they can use medical cannabis better and more efficiently there's a reason that people have to smoke cannabis or have to make cannabis brownies those compounds that you're looking for the THC the CBD they're not active and you won't feel any effects so no you can't just eat weed you actually have to put it through a chemical process of decarboxylation and that process is a heating process think of it as activation this is about to activation you're not gonna have any effect some of the rays that people are dee carving now making a butter or oil or using the oven or using the toaster oven or even the crock-pot the precision in heating and the even heating is really lacking we've all heard the stories or experience the situation where we have a very well-intentioned friend who's made some cannabis brownies and everybody at the party has the terrible reaction and ends up having to be in bed for a couple of days people are just going by oh my treats or my medicine turns out and I get an effect from it they aren't really surprised to find out how much they're wasting by either over decarboxylated or burning or by under decarboxylated unfortunately an oven fluctuates in temperature 10 to 20 degrees in either direction when I say that the carb is really a precision process even the difference of one or two degrees will impact the process so there really is a science behind use of cannabis that was really the for me that said wait a minute in order to achieve this it's gonna require something that doesn't exist right now and I'm gonna make it first it needed perfectly even heating so these are the silicon heater that wraps around the entire chamber we use two precision sensors one that's actually on the heating element and one that's buried deep inside the cavity of the device to control and create these perfect zones of heating to fully permeate and activate all of that material in there you can take the material and you put it inside the inner container you just press the button and the light will turn red and after about an hour and a half to two hours a light will turn green and as simple as that because the material is active you can actually just take a teeny bit and just sprinkle it right into your food there's no need to extract it or do anything else with it at this point and because you're actually getting such precision D card you only have to use a tiny bit so imagine it's like sprinkling pepper or salt on to a meal you're really not even going to taste it you don't need to be a scientist or have this extensive background with cannabis to be able to use it well [Music]", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "N3Yw3dtj6Pc": "hey guys so today's video is gonna be me talking through my experience using CBD oil I've been using it for about a month now so I thought it was about time I share my experience with you guys and yet share if there's been any benefits for my skin so the CBD oil that I've been using is by Zen CBD I picked this up in Planet organic so any of you guys given the UK or live in London then CBD is stocked in Planet organic and yeah and you can pick this up I think the reason I picked this up is because it was firstly a really good price it would being discounted from I think 30 pounds to 20 pounds and I say a good price that it's still super expensive but yeah I went in there and actually spoke to a sales consultants and they taught me through the different options I'm I explained of what I wanted to use it for I liked the fact that I hadn't ever used cbz or before so they recommended this one it's a fairly low strength I think it's between 3 to 5 percent obviously it determines how much you use I've been using 1 to 2 sprays I started with one spray and I've built up to two so yeah this is the one that I've been using like with other supplements I think it's really beneficial to actually speak to somebody who actually sells the product or is experienced in using the product just because they'll be able to give you like an honest opinion or an honest review on which of those sort of things actually work which kind of brands might be more suitable for what you need them for so yeah like I said I started on a low percentage and that's what I've been using I know that you can build this up but for me I just wanted to start with yeah the lowest strength and just see how that worked for me first so the potential benefits because obviously there's a reason I wanted to try this in the first place I had read so many positive reviews on how this had really been able to help people manage day-to-day stress anxiety and a ton of other really great health benefits for me I've noticed such a huge correlation between my acne flaring up and like my emotional well-being like how much stress I'm under so I really wanted to find something that could help me yeah just manage the day-to-day stresses of life lots of people have reported that they've been able to lower inflammation that they've been able to regulate sebum production and tons of other really great things to your skin as well so yeah I wanted to give this a test see if it actually works and that's exactly what I've done for the last month so the lady that's we this in the shop instructed me to spray once two sprays underneath my tongue and hold it there for sixty seconds and that is exactly what I've been doing I haven't actually applied this topically to my skin because oil is for me really a clogging I know that some people have like miraculous results and are able to clear their skin using things like the oil cleansing method I've tried that but it just does nothing for my skin it just does not work it just makes me produce more oil it makes me feel really greasy and honestly I just I just know it doesn't work for me so if you want to apply this directly to your skin and see if there's any benefits for you then please come and report back because I'm just not going to put myself ones of that experiment but I'd love to know from you guys if that has helped your acne and yeah if you've seen any improvements in your skin so the first thing that I wanted to mention that I've seen as a result of using CBD oil is that my digestion has definitely improved now if you've been following my channel or you'd follow me over on Instagram then you will know that my digestive health has definitely been something that's been playing up since about November last year I've had all kinds of things going on from IBS to a chronic acid reflux and yeah I've just found that using CBD oil has really minimized any flare-ups I've had of those things like for example my acid reflux was really bothering me every single day all day from about January the first all the way through till the end of kind of April and it's no coincidence I've started using CBD oil and I've been able to just relax about it a bit more and I'm not saying it's completely gone please believe me it hasn't it isn't a miracle but it's definitely helped like I don't feel like I'm dealing with it all day every day it kind of comes in waves sometimes but yeah that has been the most exciting benefit I found of using CBD oil and yeah quite excited to see if I continued to use it and what will happen I've also noticed that my severe bloating which I get at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon every single day until I eat dinner and yeah it just continues to get worse and worse so that has definitely been something that's improved to I've also been kind of monitoring why I've been eating I keep a acne diary so I wanted to kind of when I'm breaking out the sort of things I'm eating how I'm feeling all the sort of things that could be tribute to a break out and I've noticed as well because I've been monitoring my in there as well that this is actually reduced as well since using CBD and again yeah it might be a coincidence but I really believed that actually the stress I put myself under about my health has reduced because of using CBD oil this is also really exciting because lots and lots and lots of studies have been done on acne and digestive health and they definitely have found correlations between the two so if you're somebody that struggles with your digestive health and you also struggle with breaking out then this could be a really really exciting thing for you to try and could potentially really heal up your skin another positive side effect I had for about a week was I started to have really great sleep like I was sleeping super quickly fall into a deep sleep and I felt very well rested when I woke up I wish I could say that this lasted throughout the whole month but honestly it didn't I feel like after the first month it sorry after the first month after the first week it kind of just sort of subsided and I just went back to my usual sleeping pattern I haven't slept really badly or anything I don't find that it's really kind of like given me that feeling before sleep where I just yet feel completely knocked out and just really well rested however lots of other people have said that this is an absolute miracle worker when it comes to insomnia and really bad sleeping patterns so if that's you then potentially you could give this a go potentially maybe I need to use a higher dose so I need to take it slightly further in the evening towards bed I've been taking it just after I've eaten probably like 15 minutes after I've eaten so that you're digesting the CBD oil with food I think actually on the bottle it says between meals and let me just check yeah it does actually say on the bottle to defy spray in between meals for best effects spray under tongue so potentially I could have taken this nearer towards bed as opposed to nearer towards dinner and maybe that would have helped me with my sleep better so the next thing the big thing for me that I really wanted to see some help with was reducing anxiety and just reducing like how you handle day-to-day stress so for me this is definitely the biggest one I've been wondering this very very carefully and I know lots of people have said that this is like amazing and has really helped them I honestly believe for the first few weeks it was most definitely helping I felt really well rested like I said and yeah just fell I don't know a little bit more able to cope with certain things and I just wasn't kind of like I don't know letting stress take over my life however for the last few weeks I just don't think that has been the case I would love to say that this has been like again a miracle-worker maybe I need to be taking a higher strength I don't know but yeah I haven't found that this is like miraculously help me manage stress and like I said at the beginning of this video if you're taking this because of stress it's also because you really want to reduce the amount of acne flare-ups you pads for me I've definitely noticed I've been breaking out around my jawline and around my kind of ears with the more kind of deep cystic spots so I haven't noticed a big improvement in CBD oil and my skin today I'm actually feeling like I'm really happy with my skin but this week hasn't been great but it's also worth noting that lots of things that help your skin that you take internally don't just work overnight and that is the case for like supplements that's the case for things like I keep saying that's the case for the pill nothing works within like a month usually so potentially if I take this for longer which I really plan to do to see if there are any additional benefits I think the three-month mark is really a good indication about whether something can really work for your skin however I also tried things for three months and they've absolutely not worked I'm looking at you best your book so yeah if you feel like something's actually making your skin worse than probably best to stop I've tried tons of other things that help me reduce my stress and my acne as well so I think the biggest trial for me was coffee like I am a coffee addict guys I know it can increase anxiety I stick to one cup a day but it really is something I look forward to and I love but last year I actually tried to give it up for two weeks and it was very very difficult guys I've actually filmed an entire blog looking at me quitting coffee the benefits I might have had in my anxiety in my skin and in fact our link it on screen now somewhere around here so go and check it out let me know what you think and I will see you over there I don't know if it tastes that nice I mean really no it doesn't taste like coffee that's for sure hmm just tasted", "zNT8Zo_sfwo": "hey you feeling rough week really and the best way to take it is to put it under your tongue and rub it in

cannabinoid system is very important in regulating motor activity that very type of activity that is impaired in Parkinson's disease from animal experiments we also know that boosting certain branches

could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is knowing that there is this untapped potential comes from what marijuana state

to the public Canada's proposed edible pot regulations have been made public and the 60-day consultation process has come to an end under the proposed federal rules a single serving would be limited to 10 milligrams of THC the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis and each serving must be individually wrapped this is considered a low to moderate dose of THC this dosage limit is sugar than in Colorado Washington or California where multiple servings are allowed per package so for example in a chocolate bar each breakable square can contain 10 milligrams each for a total of 100 milligrams pot meant for ingestion cannot have alcohol have limited caffeine and come in a plain child-resistant package the draft regulations say the products must not be appealing to youth and the packaging can't advertise dessert or confectionery flavors so no gummies shaped like bears one of the problems which were legalizing edibles were kids so kids came into the kitchen saw this wonderful nicely colored marijuana edibles and as kids to try it out the proposed rules are an attempt to address one of the main issues with edibles making sure they don't cause risk to public health especially for those who are underage but some are worried the black market will continue to thrive which are strict regulations a major cannabis edibles manufacturing California says it's been difficult to navigate within the legal market because there's still so much competition in the illicit market people that are heavy consumers of cannabis and like to ingest it can ingest you know hundreds if not thousands of milligrams of THC in a day and so if they have products that are available in the illicit market that are much cheaper and have a much higher potency they're gonna tend to go towards that so a problem with edible marijuana is that people are not used to it with edibles the effects can later and the people's oh I have now done this edible marijuana and there feel nothing and they'd more and more to avoid putting people at risk it would be better to start with low dosage and once we have clear evidence the black market is still thriving then we can reevaluate Health Canada confirms

infuse these the cooking show where everything is infused especially me today we're making lollipops this episode is brought to you by the body fast herbal infuse er you can save money on my favorite herbal infusion machine with the cove ruff house at the urban futurecom here's what you need to make infused lollipops you need 1 cup of granulated white sugar I have a cup of light corn syrup or a quarter cup of water and 2 to 3 tablespoons of infused tincture you can use alcohol or glycerin tinctures 2 teaspoons of flavored extract such as orange lemon mint or whatever flavor you like 6 to 8 drops of food coloring which is optional you'll also need some lollipop molds and a candy thermometer the first step is going to be to make your tincture if you don't have one already and you can use a vegetable glycerin or an alcohol tincture either way though you're going to need to deke are you for 250 degrees Fahrenheit for 25 minutes then put them in the hopper of the mighty fast if you're using that machine and then you're going to add in about a liter of 151 proof alcohol you don't want to go to the hundred ninety or any stronger with the herb oil infuser machine it will burn it up and then you choose the mighty long cycle that'll give you the right temperature so that four hours later you have a nice tincture just like this then you just need to strain it through the provided hemp cloth or whatever cheesecloth however you want to strain it out put it in a jar and then you have your your infused tincture that you can use for any kind of recipes such as this here now we're gonna proceed along now with the rest of the recipe we're gonna take our two sugars our that's both the corn syrup and the white sugar or put those into a very small saucepan I'm gonna put that over a medium to medium-high heat and just let it start melting and you also want ahead and add your water and at this point what we're doing is we're just making all this syrup turn into sort of a simple syrup and then we're gonna bring it up to a boil it won't be long all of yours Sugar's will be cooked together it'll turn real clear and start boiling and at that point you want to start monitoring the temperature make sure you have a candy different a candy thermometer that will go up to over 300 degrees because that's we're gonna do we're gonna boil this it'll take a little while but watch it very carefully because it can get hot really fast once it starts getting hot but as soon as it hits 300 degrees exactly we're gonna take that off of the heat [Music] and then that part we're gonna let it start cooling down now you're going to also monitor the cooling process because when eight hits to 250 degrees Fahrenheit that's where we want to start adding in the rest of the ingredients so I'm adding I'm using orange because I want to orange flavored lollipops here so magadh about two teaspoons of the orange flavoring then I'm also I'm heading in some yellow food coloring a little bit of red food coloring to make the orange lollipops and now I'm adding in the tincture you can use two to three tablespoons here I'm adding two I don't want to be too strong but you can add in two to three and you can evaporate it down if you want to first but it's gonna be okay but you can see now when I start mixing anything together it's still 250 degrees so it's going to start evaporating and bubbling out the remaining water for you already we're just going to continue mixing that down by hand very carefully it's still very hot until you see it'll all incorporate together and become very sort of translucent and sort of unified in color and you need to move pretty quickly here because you don't want to the candy to harden up which it does pretty quickly so you can put the lollipop sticks into the molds in advance and you won't have to be rushing through it like we did there but then we're going to pour that carefully pour the candy into the molds until you cover up the sticks of the lollipops and then after you have all your molds filled up you're gonna let that chill best in the refrigerator or freezer for one to two hours till they get fully hardened [Music] and once they're fully hardened you can pop them out of the shells really easy you can use these silicone molds that I used here they're perfect for this this recipe had filled up three of the molds that came with four in the pack but just filled up three of them came with the sticks if you like that mighty fast herbal infuser and these kind of recipes please check out the herbal infuser calm if you want

bite astray we're out here in the wilderness in Alaska still right now we are going to make something that's called campfire ice cream with weed ague Doug isn't Alaskan version of ice cream traditionally made with whipped fat mixed with berries yeah I know things are different in Alaska they had to make do with what they could when they came up here we got some oil preserves over here al are measuring and container stuff you also have a bunch of animal fat yes this does make sense don't worry you'll see there's usually nothing better than eating some the most important part though me I thank you all right the weed this is honey banana and it's not going to make this taste like banana at all but it's a pretty good weed that's a good piece you want to cut it up small I don't know why I feel like you could tell this is high quality animal fat I'm not well-versed enough in that but yeah that ought to that butcher who just uh got a bear what the  was that noise I got the repellent on duck also another thing about the Alaska world in this man there are so many animals out here that will be just like two seconds and I definitely cut myself get me your alcohol swab real quick one of the types of bears you're supposed to like stand up and make yourself big or the one that's getting the fetal position you can Google which ones I don't remember off the top of my head that's the cool thing about living in 2008 - you need to give you all the answers I'm just a dude out here making wheat ice cream in the middle of the woods like I don't know why you would ask me for anything we almost got a cup over here it's gonna melt down we are going to move on whatever you want to dose yourself with that's up to you I got a long day ahead of me want to go take a hike and climb that mountain over there nice a little bit it's about 2/3 of the bag so yeah it's probably like a between a quarter and the fourth in here I'm not that good at eyeballing shake oh you ain't not getting me today one so now we're gonna go over to this campfire you have to wait a little warm first it's not learning it release some of that stuff that makes weed so worthwhile and good and next thing you're gonna want to do is add that animal fat so then you get the fat melt it down find some place to rest it so you're gonna need a cup of oil now looks great doesn't it we're gonna strain it out use a cheesecloth so if you have a pool little pot like this with the float out handles these also make pretty decent clamps and then I stopped pouring the mixture into here so next up this is ice cream so I'll be right back I'm gonna go climb the mountain and bring back a good little bit of ice okay crush it up so I need about two cups of this so keep crushing alright so you could also use I loose snow for this but as you can tell it's not really snow season there's about our second cup alright so now we're going to take our reserves they need about 4 cups of this and about a cup and a quarter of this and now just mix all this together man this is so gross gonna start binding and congealing this ain't just gonna let it sit for then it let it all bind together let it turn it to a thing [Music] so now you've given it some time to congeal and all that this is what your campfire ice cream is going to look like the term ice cream is being used like about as loosely as you could use the term ice cream without starting to refer to soup here we go it's more like a soft serve right yeah I'm a pretty big fan I used to ask anybody who knows we go well it's not awful but not like I would not eat this  if I didn't have to not really that that you get like the preserves time to soak up into the fat can definitely taste the weed in there that's can't buy ice cream you don't want to see what's in the bowl [Music]", "qsK0IojtJ0k": "I'm gonna need some wine to go with the main that Marcel is preparing but I don't want just any ordinary wine so I'm up here in Northern California to meet up with pack smelly who's gonna show me how to make a cannabis infused wine that I'm gonna bring the dinner so you're actually infusing the wine by putting cannabis flour directly into it yeah the cannabis flour is added at three stages the first stage is fresh flour added to fresh juice pre fermentation and they soak together then we had about two pounds of crushed up flour this year the Blue Dream oh wow so the wine starts fermenting naturally with the cannabis flour for two three weeks and that extracts all of those terpenes and all of the flavor and all of the aroma that you get in the wine fantastic yeah I mean it already smells amazing so this wine is done fermenting and this flour is spent and so the flour pretty much floats to the top we're gonna squeeze out the flour that's been kind of steeping in here like tea and then we'll hop down here we'll open the bottom valve and we'll just drain it right out how exactly does the THC get in there the alcohol in the wine is what is extracting this THC I've heard of wine being infused with cannabis where they put in some kind of cannabis concentrate or something into it but this is clearly different than that it's like the flowers are fermenting with the wine for sure the terpenes and the flavor are all being extracted from the fermentation for me as a purist there's just something that seems very right about having the flower actually fermenting in the wine it just seems that you're really getting all of those terpenes that you don't get from just adding the tincture now that this has been drained off of the spent flower that it's been fermenting on for the last couple of weeks we're gonna take the same cured cannabis flower and add some of this to the clean wine just to add more flavor and more THC go ahead and like grind it up between your hands and so this aging process in the kegs takes about 4 to 5 months for everything to settle out of the wine we then rack that clean and then we stick it into a bottle and we got we wine then we got we learned right away you smell that fresh cannabis flower fermented with the wine [Music] Oh", "S8Wjj2d28rA": "Jason Eisner is one of the most creative\nbartenders I've ever met. Recently I heard that he's playing\naround with cannabis cocktails. Now full disclosure, this isn't exactly like pot\nand cocktails. There's an ingredient called CBD which\nis supposedly supposed to mellow you out, but not actually get you like, f#%ked up. Let's go check it out.   \"Today we're going to make three\ndifferent cocktails, with the one of my favorite ingredients in the world: CBD.\" \"I mean, is this gonna get me\nhigh?\" \"CBD is a non-psychoactive component in the cannabis plant, so more or less\nwhat it's actually used for is to kind of help with bodily aches and pains. It's\nan anti-anxiety, anti-stress, antidepressant. So really what it does is it just kind\nof makes you feel fantastic, but it's not going to mess with your\nsort of mental state of being.\" \"This is my twist on the classic cocktail\nNegroni. So this is a Carpano Antica which is an Italian sweet vermouth. I'm also going to use Contrato apertif. I'm going to do a bar spoon of Ruby port just to give it some body, because that\napertif is a bit lighter. So I'm just going to give this a little\norange oil, drop that in there. I very purposefully decided to use\noil-based tincture for these cocktails, because if you go to an Italian\nrestaurant prior to your meal they give, you know, some olive oil and balsamic\nvinegar, right? I want people to see what they're putting in their bodies, so that\nthey can have that kind of residual fun effect. So this is the ingredient that's super\nimportant: five drops in your cocktail. So this is the Stoney Negroni.\" \"I love the presentation.\" \"It's super buttery and\nsmooth and you have a very subtle hint of that like herbalness from the...\" \"CBD?\" \"Do you see what just happened??\" \"Now is probably a good time to\njust move on to the next cocktail. It's an interesting twist on an Old\nFashioned and what we're using here is this organic bourbon from Chicago Koval, Mescal from Oaxaca called Benesin, some homemade bitters, and a homemade sasparilla syrup. So this is the Rolled Fashion.\" \"What's going on right over here?\" \"So the\ngarnish on this is a mini homemade vegan organic churro...haha which you can turn into a blunt.\" \"Just a great balance of flavors. The smokiness in the mescal works really\nnicely with the sort of like warm whiskey. The CBD is a little more subtle but you\nget that like very like mellow herbal quality from it.\" \"Let's move on to the third and\nfinal cocktail, and this is a vegan sour. So what's going to be in this, it's\nactually quite simple, it's a little bit of organic mint, some agave, some lime,\nsome tequila Blanco, a pinch of sea salt, and then we're going to put some aquafaba in there. The beauty of aquafaba is there's no risk of bacterial\ninfection, it's vegan, it's organic, there's no distinct smell or flavor\nwhereas with egg whites it can get a little hairy.\" \"So all of this frothiness is from the aquafaba.\" \"So right now I'm adding some ceremonial grade matcha, so this is the Sour T-iesel.\" \"This drink as compared to the two prior,\nI taste the CBD more, I think just because the ingredients here are more\ndelicate and not as pronounced, and I like the mint, it adds a freshness and\nvibrancy to the cocktail, and I think the CBD pairs really well with tequila.\" I think that's a great sort of like\nflavor across the board. You're so creative, I\ndefinitely don't know anyone else doing this.\" \"Cheers!\" \"If you want to learn more about matcha, click here.\"    ", "dO7VuHMBPhI": "[Music] what's up everybody my name is sarah b and welcome back to the haze today we're going to be doing another edible review we are going to be reviewing the very well known but new to me wild edibles so let's talk a little bit about wild in general they are a portland-based edible company and they specialize in using things that remind them of the pacific northwest and what makes it special and using those ingredients and those fruits and other items found in nature to make these awesome little gummies now in this box there is a hundred milligrams and there are ten small gummies i also want to just talk about real quick how the packaging is it is so cool so you open it like this and out comes this little pocket super easy to open you just squeeze on the side like this bam pop open and you will find these small little sugar coated gummies these gummies are made all with natural flavoring i absolutely loved these edibles they are not overly sugary at all which is fantastic they taste like a natural gummy something that you will find like in a trader joe's or something like that i started out with 40 milligrams and it hit it hit good too i loved it i wasn't overly i didn't feel dumb which some edibles can make someone feel dumb i didn't feel dumb i didn't feel like falling asleep was just so awesome i've been finding too many edibles lately that make you just want to pass out and these guys kept me up kept me going and once the high kind of wear it off and the after effects kind of left i still was able to have a great functioning day which is really nice i love the artwork that will did i love these little huckleberry flowers you'll see all over it and i believe every box looks a little different it goes with whatever the flavoring is which is really awesome on the inside it gives a little message and i'll read that for you the edible contains hybrid perfect for preparing for life's adventure it's a little like the perfect balance of wearing pajamas to work i just really appreciate the the thought process that went into the packaging and making of these edibles now i believe these guys are the number one selling edible in all of oregon and it makes sense they're based in portland but i found them also all over california they are a little bit more expensive than your normal edible but they are extremely consistent some edibles are really great one bag and they can taste great they'll be just like mind-blowing you can give a bag to your friend next thing you know they say it never hits them i don't believe this will be a problem with these guys i'd say if you if you were going to be hanging out at the house like all of us are right now but you're going to be studying maybe doing something for work i'd say eat one of these little guys and you're going to be chilling you'll be chilling you'll be chilling hard yeah so if you guys see these little edibles anywhere i would say pick it up you will not be making a mistake i promise you all right guys so that will be it for my small little review again my name is sarah b thank you guys so much for tuning back into the haze if you like this video please hit that like please hit that subscribe if you want to see more

were reviewing is the extra strength topical pain spray from apotheca what you're getting is a topical mist with infused pain relieving plant extracts such as arnica peppermint juniper and of course cannabis it comes in a two fluid ounce or sixty milliliter container with 50 milligrams of THC and five milligrams of CBD and cannabis oils this topical spray is not intended to ingest in any form it's only intended to be used externally on the skin the applicator cap has a somewhat involved process to accessing the spray nozzle you do this by pressing the safety lock button then shifting the teeth on the top of the spray button to rotate it to the proper point of operation the applicator cap is pressed onto the container neck for a secured non removable cap Apothic Anas cannabis infused skincare has essential organic oils and plant extracts which focus on relieving pain through the skin this cooling topical spray is packed with powerful plant extracts such as arnica peppermint spearmint juniper and cannabis these flower extracts provide fast-acting your leave from pain and irritation usage is easy first spot test with a half a pump application if no irritation or allergic reactions occur then continue on spray one to three pumps on sore areas swollen joints and problem skin you can let it air dry or rub it in however be aware of the degradation from rub off and be advised that if you touch the oils with your hands keep your hands and fingers away from your eyes because irritation will occur upon application you will immediately experience a smooth and deeply cooling feeling as your skin is absorbing this topical treat allow 5 to 15 minutes for pain relief effects to occur while the cooling heat continues apply it respectfully as needed be advised to stay away from open cuts or wounds and discontinue use if irritation or discomfort is present the pros of the Apothic Ana extra-strength pain relief spray are is that it's fast-acting it feels great the child lock system is secure to keep it away from children and it's also a clean and secure appearance that keeps a peace of mind when you're applying it in public areas and you also get a lot of sprays out of one container the cons are is that the safety lock system although effective might be a little hard for some people with hurting fingers to use and also the labeling was not consistent on the two bottles that we had one of our bottles was labeled at having 50 milligrams of THC and 5 milligrams of CBDs while the other otherwise identical bottle was labeled as 50 milligrams of CBD and 50 milligrams of THC overall I give a path econo extra-strength pain spray 5 out of 5 blazin pot leaves in my opinion Apothic anna extra-strength pain spray is a great organic all-in-one body pain spray relief that relieves pain from your extremities down to your lower back if you'd like to learn more or to purchase one please ask for Apothic anna at your local medical marijuana dispensary I'm sure they can provide it for you or at least offer a comparable cannabis infused pain spray hope you enjoyed this episode of blazing gear reviews if you did please like comment and share this video

In Colorado where marijuana\nwas legalized in 2012, there was a four-fold increase\nin the amount of toxic cases that were reported between\nthe years of 2010 and 2015. On October 17th of this year in Canada recreational marijuana will be legalized, so I reached out to our\nfavorite YouTube veterinarian, Doctor Alex Avery from the Our\nPets Health YouTube channel. And he's gonna talk to us today\nabout marijuana poisoning. I'm Ken Steep and welcome\nback to McCann Dogs. (dog barking) - Thanks Ken and hi everyone, I'm excited to have been invited back to talk to you today about\nmarijuana effects on dogs. So for those of you who don't know me, I'm a veterinarian and I've\ngot my own YouTube channel, Our Pets Health and also the\nwebsite ourpetshealth.com where my aim is to help you and your pet to live a healthier, happier life. So let's jump in to\nmarijuana poisoning in dogs. It's actually something that's\nnot that rare in general and you won't be surprised to\nhear that marijuana poisoning, it becomes even more\ncommon in an area when marijuana goes from\nbeing illegal to legal. So CBD oil is all the rage at the moment and you might know that\nthat comes from marijuana, but is actually felt to be safe. So just how dangerous is marijuana? How poisonous is it? Do you need to be worried? Well marijuana contains a\nlot of different substances, with the most dangerous one\nbeing something called THC. And it's actually this THC which is toxic and has this psychotropic\neffects acting on the brain that we associate with marijuana. Thankfully even though it\ndoes have toxic effects, it actually does take quite a lot to cause a serious poisoning in dogs. And the risk of poisoning\ndue to smoke inhalation is really tiny and really\nall reports of poisoning are due to pets eating marijuana with 96% of cases being\ndogs and only 3% being cats. So it still does affect cats the same way but they just don't eat\nit as often as dogs do. The minimum lethal dose, which is the amount that can kill a dog is three grams of THC per\nkilogram of body weight. The average marijuana cigarettes\ncontains 150 milligrams and that means that a\nfive kilo or 10 pound dog would need to eat 100 cigarettes for a fatal poisoning to occur. So the situation is pretty\nunlikely to cause problems. Don't think though that marijuana can never cause problems though. If a dog gets into a large supply or it consumes something more like concentrated medical grade THC butter that might be used in baked products then there's definitely a\nrisk of serious poisoning and deaths have been\nreported and they do occur. As with a lot of poisons and toxins out there that our dogs come across, there is a variation as well\nin how each individual responds so a small amount of marijuana may affect one pet a lot more than another. So you really can't be too careful. The marijuana effects on\ndogs and signs of poisoning are numerous and come about\nthrough the drug's effects within the brain as well\nthe body as a whole. After eating marijuana\nthe signs of poisoning also can stop pretty quickly. So they develop within about 60 minutes. Mild cases of poisoning\nwill be seen as lethargy, a change in the way a dog responds to visual and noise stimulation, behavioral changes and their\ngums might become quite red. If a more toxic dose is eaten, then excess salivation might develop, the pupils will dilate and become large, vomiting may start along with diarrhea and your dog might also start\nto urinate uncontrollably. And muscle tremors will also develop. And in fact about 99% of\nmarijuana poisoning cases there are nervous or neurological signs. Whereas only about 30%\nwill develop intestinal, so vomiting or diarrhea. A higher dose again might\nthen result in your dog becoming unsteady on their feet, their blood pressure might drop, they might develop hypothermia. The heart can slow. And as with a lot of poisons, it will all eventually lead\nto seizures, coma, and death. The effects of marijuana\non dogs can last for hours and they can even last for days. And that's because the THC\nis actually partly stored in the body's fat and\nit's then released slowly over a number of days. So that being said, what's the treatment\nto marijuana poisoning? So while the likelihood of severe life-threatening poisoning is pretty low, as I've just discussed. You'll appreciate from some of the signs that in some cases\ntreatment will be needed to prevent any poisoning complications. Dogs that are severely\nagitated or hyperactive may need to be sedated. IV fluids may need to be given to help just control body temperature, to support blood pressure, and to prevent dehydration that results from vomiting and diarrhea\nand excessive salivation. Muscle relaxant or\nanti-seizure medication may be needed in the case of\nsevere tremors or seizures. And in rare life-threatening cases when large amounts have been eaten the stomach may even need to be emptied, enemas given and activated\ncharcoal administered. Just to try and remove and absorb as much of the toxin as possible. Now the big difficulty with\ntreatment of marijuana poisoning and marijuana poisoning in general, in dogs is knowing that this is actually the problem in the first place. So in many cases owners are\nreluctant to tell their vet that this is what the dog has\neaten or might have eaten. Now there are human urine\ntests for marijuana, but these are actually\nreally unreliable in dogs and so they'll often\ngive incorrect results. It's vital therefore that\nyou let your vet know if your dog has eaten marijuana. Without this information\nit really is impossible to differentiate the\nsigns the dog is showing from many other toxins. Poisoning with different\ntoxins or food items, it comes with different prognosis and different treatment options. And not knowing the cause of poisoning, it can just mean that a\ndog is given unnecessary treatment or it's actually\ntreated more aggressively than they would otherwise need to be in the case of marijuana poisoning. And that wastes both time and money. If your dog has eaten\nmarijuana in any form then just let your vet know. It's really important information and it should not be withheld. As with all poisonings\nprevention is better than cure and my tips for this is just\nto keep marijuana products and that includes edibles\nand baked goods in high pet-proof cupboards\nor in locked drawers. Make sure your pet is not\naround if marijuana is being smoked or consumed and only\nallow them back in the room once everything's been cleared\nup or all smoke has cleared. And finally just never give\nyour pet marijuana on purpose. It's really not funny although it's something some people do do. Now as I mentioned at the start, CBD oil is a different cannabis extract and that does not\nactually contain any THC. So CBD oil is considered non-toxic and it has several potentially valuable medical effects on the body. If you want to learn more about this then I've actually got a separate\nvideo over on my channel. For now though thanks again to Ken for inviting me back to talk to you all today. I hope that was interesting\nand until next time, take care. - A huge thank you to Doctor Alex from the Our Pets Health YouTube channel for joining us today and I hope this is the kind of information\nthat you never need, but I'm really glad that you have it.

(gentle music)", "-8kPucbOdT8": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're at our partnered manufacturing facility outside of Dayton Ohio looking at our all new line of KPD series of industrial extractors [Music] precision first conceptualized the KPD series of extractors about two years ago when we saw the shift towards a large scale processing both in cannabis and hemp what we did at the time is we searched for the best most well qualified manufacturing partner that we could build an industrial scale modular extraction platform with we found AMG engineering in Dayton Ohio and they've been a pleasure to work with ever since we've combined our expertise in the cannabis and hemp manufacturing arena with their expertise in the AG reprocessing and Industrial Engineering competency and what that's allowed us to do is build a massive but easy to use modular processing center that can be dropped on the farm can be dropped into a building and it's very easy turnkey ready to operate so a lot of people ask why build a modular self-contained industrial extraction skid and the reasons are numerous the first one is that this whole apparatus that you see here takes four people to operate the second thing is it's extremely simple right it's plug-and-play you drop it and you can drop it onto a slab in a farm you can drop it into an industrial processing building or any number of easy turnkey solutions the flip side of this is people typically have unreasonable expectations when it comes to batch processing batch processing is extremely laborious and if you think about having seven or eight or nine extractors to be able to equal the throughput that something like this does you're talking about running those batch extractors 24 hours a day you're talking about having three shifts of people and you may well employ 40 50 60 employees in order to do the same work that four employees could do with a plant such as this so it's really oughta mating the process its streamlining your efficiencies and it's allowing you to operate a business with an extremely low overhead and as we all know that the price of commodities of THC and CBD eventually are declining it's very important to be able to operate your business with very low operational overhead costs to be able to make margin continually as these large players come in and put competitive pressures on the market so we've designed all this in mind when you look at the design of this extraction plant not only does it have the modularity but we'll talk about some of the efficiencies that this plant does as you can see behind me one of the components we have reflux stills so that your reap roofing your ethanol so you're not having ethanol loss we have a number of different high efficiency methods to take the ethanol back out of the biomass and any a number of these small problems that you run into a batch processing all these losses add up and we've designed this with our processing expertise and AMG's industrial manufacturing expertise to be the most efficient most effective way to extract and that's what you see here today [Applause] so now that you understand a bit about the concept of the KPD series of extractors why we built it how we built it how we conceptualized it let's take a look at some of the more technical components on how it operates and why it's so efficient so the first thing that we're gonna look at is our contacts motor control center and basically what this is it's the brain of the entire operation so what's gonna happen is this skid will be placed on a slab somewhere in a warehouse but your motor control center and your plant control center will be separate the reason that that's designed like that is to keep all the components that could come in contact with any solvent that are flammable it keeps the the risk level down basically so that those flammable vapors aren't coming in contact with any of your motor controls so let's take a look inside the control center so inside what you're going to see is you're going to see all your variable frequency drives you're gonna see all of your motor controls and ultimately this is all linked through one interface right so it's all computer-controlled everything on this entire plant you can see all your temperatures all your motor speeds all your input your output your discharge every single function within that plant is controlled from this brain so you can see on your wall all of your shut offs all of your VFDs all of your control panels all of your power input everything is controlled from this room so remembering our HMI interface and our computer brain interface from our con X you also have a display and a touch screen interface on the actual plant so not only can your controllers see what's going on from your control room your operators can see what's going on in the plant from your HMI interface on your actual machine so the process all starts here and basically what this is is you're gonna have your conveyor feeding in your biomass and this is the first step of the process this is a cooling screw conveyor so what will happen is you take your warm biomass and you cool down your biomass in order for when it hits the solvent it's not warming up the solvent obviously you're putting a massive amount of biomass into this extraction plant you're putting a massive amount of solvent so you can understand that the heat energy if the biomass is not properly cooled is going to raise the temperature of the solvent and therefore that affect the extraction efficiency and the extraction quality so what we do is passing it through here this is jacketed and it's controlled to about negative 40 degrees centigrade in order to cool the biomass and take some of that heat energy away to have a nice efficient consistent extraction so the next step in the process once the biomass is cooled you can see that it drops into this first extraction tank and basically what this is is a counter current ethanol extraction so you've got ethanol coming in from one side you've got your biomass coming in from the other if you have a set retention time they mix the solvent strips that cannabinoids from the plant and ultimately you have your micelle a stream coming out so biomass into your first tank solvent into your third tank and through the entire process they mix through the tanks until they're ultimately separated you will have your cannabinoids and solvent go to one area and you'll have your biomass go to another area so let's follow the stream of the cannabinoids through to the next step once your extraction process is started you're gonna have your micellar stream which we call my salad your cannabinoid and solvent mixture in your micelle a holding tank right here this folding tank is constantly going to be processed through your finds filtration which is going to take out most of your fine particulates that might clog your evaporator any residual waxes and we actually do that with not only the Candela filters and the michela but we use a pre-code as well so this precoat tank will have any number of three coats it could be diatomaceous earth it could be any number of absorbance or things like that that will actually pre coat your filtration and allow for a more pure more efficient extraction so let's take a look at how this all works you have your micellar coming here you have your pre coat tank coming here both of these streams are mixed and they're pushed upwards into our filtration mechanisms which are up here so let's have a look at those so once that micelle a stream is coming up here it's being pushed into our filters and these are three candle filters that basically are filtered with precoat coating the filter membrane and then we have our micellar coming right behind that and basically that's creating a filtration mechanism that's taking out all those impurities highly refining your masala stream ultimately your filters will become caked when they become caked after a number of hours could be a day could be three days could be you know 12 hours it really depends on the consistency of your biomass and how you're extracting what you're going to do is do a blowdown on your filters so these filters are extremely easy to clean as you can see the graded bottoms what you're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bucket or some sort of a bag discharge bag you're gonna wrap it around here and you're gonna do a blowdown to blow down the filter and all your discharge cake is gonna come out again same thing you have redundancy so if you're discharging one filter that the other filter is still in use so that you're never losing your continuous process so that takes us through our filtration step what we're gonna do once we have that micellar filtered and we have it clean we're gonna move on to evaporation and evaporation is the process of actually separating that solvent from the original cannabinoids that we have so it's no longer going to be a micelle a stream at this point we're gonna have crude oil and we're going to have solvent so the next step in our process is evaporation and as we stated evaporation is taking that micellar stream of your cannabinoids and your solvent and separating it so we're gonna take our micelle and separate it into two streams ones are going to become crude oil one's going to become our purified ethanol and that's done with this section of the plant right here what you're seeing is you're seeing two giant distillation towers so you can see they started all the way up here and they go all the way down to the second floor beneath my feet about 20 feet tall and what that's actually doing is applying heat to the solvent in order for the solvent to vaporize once the solvents vaporizing it's coming it's separating from the heavier cannabinoid mixture and as the solvent vaporizes it reconned ences on a separate condenser column behind me which creates a liquefied solvent that's been purified and that leaves us with our micelle a stream that's been purified into the purified solvent of course and then our purified cannabinoids which we refer to as crude oil so let's take a look at the next step in the process which is one that's very crucial and often overlooked so once we have our solvent purified from our micellar stream it's very very important that we do a reflux distillation on that solvent and here's the reason why ethanol is what's called a homogeneous azeotrope with water as you know we're extracting a plant there's a lot of water in the plant when it comes out of the field we dry most of that water out through our drying process but you may have anywhere between 2 to 10 percent water and your residual biomass now what's gonna happen because ethanol is a homogenious azeotrope with water those two molecules are just going to want to stay right together the boiling points are so close that they can't be separated with the traditional evaporation why this is relevant is because over time your solvent becomes diluted and becomes less effective at extracting your cannabinoids so you can imagine that you start with 190-proof pure solvent and over time it's going to be diluted with water once you hit around 170 proof or a little bit lower than that your extraction efficiency becomes greatly compromised which is the reason that we have reflux stills so reflux stills are a different type of evaporation they're used with a very tall tower without with a packing material in them and what that does is it allows that very close boiling point to separate from the water and the solvent so we've integrated this into our plant so it's a turnkey system solvent never needs to be replaced in this plant because the efficiency is so high in terms of not only the reclaim rate from your biomass and your evaporation but also the reap roofing of the solvent it's a completely closed system which makes it extremely efficient and extremely easy to before when we were talking about operating your business on really good margins and maintaining efficiency and how you operate your extraction process this is one of the central key components to do that for for your ROI for your business now that we've walked through the evaporation process and the purification of the solvent we need to follow our crude oil through the other output stream so what happens with the crude oil once it comes out of our evaporator as it moves into these holding tanks and basically what these holding tanks are doing is holding the oil and heating it to perform the decarboxylation process D carb is a very very common process that's used in preparation of your crude oil for not only consumption but for final distillation that's what these tanks do right here and ultimately these tanks can be routed and pumped to a distillation machine or any types of popes post-processing that you would like to use so now that we've followed our micellar stream through the entire plant through refinement all the way to D carb and through re proofing of the solvent the other side of the aspect of the processing of this plant is the actual biomass that's coming out so we have a lot of spent biomass that's coming out of this plant and once it comes out of those extraction tanks that we looked at earlier it's ultimately pumped as a slurry up into these separators so we have these rotary strainer separators and basically what they do is they separate that pulpy sludge of biomass it's the first pass that takes the solvent off and what that's doing is it's taking kind of that like I said pulpy sort of really wet biomass and separating the ethanol from it in order for the biomass to then drop into a heated mechanism which is where you're going to regain the remainder of your solvent out of the biomass so let's take a look at that next the last and one of the most crucial processes in our plant is the reclamation of the final solvent from that biomass so as we saw before we separated the majority of the solvent from the biomass using our strainers but it's still think about you know wringing out a sponge you get most of the of the of the moisture out of the sponge by using that pressure but in order to get the remainder of the moisture out of the sponge or in this case our biomass acting like a sponge we need to heat it and that's precisely what this heated screw does here so you can see it's quite lengthy there's a lot of heat energy that goes into that but the flip side is we're taking a typical 94 93 95 percent efficiency and we're taking that efficiency up above 99 percent in terms of reclamation of your solvent now the reason that's important is because obviously we're on industrial scale here we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of processing per day you can imagine there's quite a bit of solvent that's being used there so when you're losing 5% of that massive amount of solvent you can imagine what the cost is last we checked Evan all's you know 32 dollars a gallon for for azeotropic ethanol around seven dollars a litre depending on your region if you're losing 5% of everything you're processing with which is the case with typical plants typical batch installations batch installations could be even higher than that you can imagine how that's going to affect your effects and how that's going to affect your ROI especially as you have margin compression on your commodity one of the reasons that we designed this in is exactly that so you may have been wondering what are these giant for tanks on the end of this skid and it's very important because these are our CIP tanks CIP stands for clean in place clean in place is a protocol that's used throughout manufacturing throughout GMP throughout any type of protocol that requires food grade or pharma grade compliance now these CIP tanks are meant to hold an acid wash a base wash and then you have a reuse tank so basically what we're doing is we're imagining any sort of contamination that can get into this system based upon what that contamination is you may need an acid rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you may need a base rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you made into ethanol rinse in order to dissolve that contamination which is basically what we have in this entire plant so again through the HMI interface through the control center you have a completely automated CIP process in order to clean this plant the reason that that's extremely relevant is has more regulations and more restrictions come into the cannabis and hemp space you're going to be subject to testing for pesticides for mold for mildews and you can imagine that if any of that stuff's on your biomass and gets into your plant that you're automatically going to potentially contaminate your plant with a contamination source from the field one of the prime examples that we could use is micro butanol in California it's virtually everywhere and in order to remediate micro butanol audit your processing equipment there's a variety of processes that are needed to do that right now in batch equipment everybody does that manual and it's very laborious and time-consuming but as GMP restrictions and regulations come into play you're going to need to have a set standardized process that can be replicated and duplicated in order to be accurate every single time that's exactly what this CI piece kit does and that's exactly what our control center an automation skid does thanks for watching our overview on our KP d series of industrial extraction plants these plants can be engineered to process anywhere from ten thousand pounds a day up to several hundred thousand over a million if that's what you want our engineering partners as well as ourselves with our engineering expertise and our product expertise know every step of the process we know how to make it the most efficient and that's exactly what we've done here and what we've seen today we look forward to working with you and please give us a call if you have any questions you", "fwcAey-JFsg": "Good morning John it's April 20th. It's 4/20. Which I guess can only mean one thing, uh, Blaze it? Look, I don't smoke pot. I have, I don't really like it, and I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that cannabis is not harmful in any way, and that it's gonna cure every disease or whatever. But I think it's ridiculous and unjustifiable that marijuana is criminalized while more addictive and dangerous substances like alcohol and tobacco are available at every gas station in the country. So here are seven reasons why marijuana should be decriminalized and three reasons why it's more complicated than some people might make it out to be. 1. Legalizing marijuana is good for local economies. It increases tax revenue and it can increase the amount of small businesses that are successful. And I think that we should regulate both growers and sellers to make sure that those businesses aren't just giant conglomerates. We should not let like a bunch of Richie Rich pants who spent decades sending people to prison for selling marijuana suddenly get even richer selling it. 2. Illicit marijuana is a source of income for drug cartels that we could just take away instantaneously. 3. THC, CBD, other compounds in marijuana are legitimate medications. They can help with autoimmune diseases, people with chronic pain, seizure disorders, vomiting in cancer patients. And yet, US law defines marijuana as having no medical use. This is scientifically inaccurate. 4. Because it can sometimes help with chronic pain, it can help people who are dependant on opioids. And that seems like a good thing to not put in the same category as heroin. 5. The most successful story, maybe in human history, of decreasing the use of an addictive substance is the story of cigarettes. You can decrease use without criminalization. 6. The criminalization of marijuana creates real and obvious harm. Arrests, including juvenile arrests, have long-term impacts on people's lives, convictions even more so, and felony convictions result in lifelong marginalization and disenfranchisement. And this is why when young white people get found out for selling marijuana, they often don't get arrested, because everyone realizes that ruining someone's life for selling pot is dumb. And what we see over and over again is similar rates of drug use among white and black people, but far more black people getting arrested for it. \nAnd finally number 7: I don't hear people talking about this one much. \nWhen we make something very illegal, that is less dangerous than something \nthat is perfectly legal, I think that weakens the authority of the rule of law. People start to ask, like, if you're gonna ruin my life for doing something that doesn't seem like a big deal to me, then maybe the legal system isn't out to protect me. Maybe it is in fact out to harm me. That's a big deal. The more people who feel that way about the law, the worse society in total is. Now let's do the part where we admit that this isn't as simple as a lot of people like to make It out to be. First reason why: driving while stoned is dangerous and has been proven to be so. But there is no weed breathalyzer. So this is a problem. It is also not a new problem, it's a problem we currently have. 2. In legalizing weed, I think some people will think that that's like basically the government saying weed isn't bad for you. But it is. Long term use of marijuana, especially by young people, has been shown to have all kinds of negative effects. Most worrying ones being that it can increase the symptoms of depression, and other mental health problems, \nand cannabis use is a risk factor for schizophrenia. For more information check out this very good healthcare triage video. And finally number 3: You can't just legalize it. Those are two nice little words, but it's complicated. What do we do with people who are currently in prison? Who can sell it? How much? How is it taxed? What commercial zones are dispensaries allowed to be in? Like, these things have to be figured out. But the status quo, is a law that harms more than the drug, and I think that we're finally waking up to that. John, I'll see you on Tuesday. Hey, I hope that the comments aren't a disaster And here are some videos that you can go watch if you would like to learn more on this topic.", "DSMBVGFIMNE": "what's up everyone it is 2pm on a wednesday afternoon thanks for tuning in to cannabis legalization news where we explain marijuana laws so you can change them today we're joined by stephanie mcgerno from thc production out in vegas we're going to get into cannabis extracts and infusions but first we do have to cover a little bit of canvas legalization news so tom and miggy what's going on in the news this week busy week busy week i just got an email 20 minutes ago from normal and they say that the house rules committee has advanced the marijuana opportunity and reinvestment and expungement acts h.r 3884 which removes marijuana from the controlled substances act and harmonizes the federal law with the state laws that like illinois or likes washington state yeah but this is just all semantics right because it won't matter until theater of of politics and so it's a committee and so it gets out of one committee now it's got on another committee and then there's going to be a full house floor vote up or down and then if you like that don't forget to hit the likes and subscribes to cannabis legalization news because we'll go live after the vote or during the vote and we'll try to see who we can get on because this is just a link like it see you you watching this right now or are listening listeners our listeners can't participate as easily but the viewers then you know it's just a link that we send out and this provided somebody has the internet they could come on here and we could ask them stuff so we're going to try to reach out to our former guests but man that's awesome it could be it could be like today it could be tomorrow maybe friday and it sounds great but i just like to remind people that keep your eye on georgia man like like if you're in georgia if you know someone in georgia you still have five days to register to vote and if you're 17 by the 5th of january you can still register to vote now yeah and then the other thing about georgia is this could be a lot of mail-in ballots because it's supposed to be in january so kobe should still be out there i hear that's going to be like 20 or 25 million doses of the vaccine in december and then like another 20 or 25 million in january but it's january 5th so if they can vote now i hope they are and then uh what's going to happen in this more act vote because it's symbolic because the senate's not going to vote for it but what if the senate was controlled by democrats oh my god dude that would just be a new america that's what i'm talking about just focusing on georgia point it would there would be so much not going on i mean i mean this will be bs but yeah it would be less you would not be dependent master anymore but it would be very interesting to see that's that's that's all pie in the sky bs let's talk about something that really happened this week the u.n yeah the u.n vote was huge man yeah this one's been waiting for a while too you read a pro who recommendation to rescale cannabis reschedule cannabis in a historic vote now this has to do with the united nations commissions on narcotic drugs and a treaty that goes back to 1961 the single convention on atari narcotic drugs and it was in a schedule four and a schedule four is different than uh how we do it in america with a schedule one schedule four was like the bad one with heroin and whatnot and so they've they voted on removing it from that so that's that's really awesome no i think uh this is gonna be huge nationally right like this is the reason why other countries uh started doing the same thing that we're doing making cannabis illegal in their country now we explored yeah it was it was after world war ii the united states was feeling itself and it's like i'm gonna go ban this marijuana plant everywhere and yeah and if you don't do it you're not gonna get any of our love i mean the money yeah pretty much funny but on top of that you know what other country uh decriminalized it or unscheduled it what's that thailand thailand it's awesome then removes cannabis from narcotics list well i remember when we were talking backstage in the green room uh i used to live in korea for a year you've been to korea it sounds like because of the navy and uh don't you remember hearing those stories that if you really wanted to have some weird crazy fun you'd go down to thailand because they have way more lacks drug laws and so people would go down to thailand and lose their [ __ ] they would do drugs like if you wanted to do drugs like if you is there like a quintessential what'd you do last week drugs that would be your trip to thailand for the most part but you know i've been to thailand and at the time i've been with pattia and the other thing that ireland is known for unfortunately is their sex tourism like some [ __ ] up [ __ ] [ __ ] that we just they were also really lacks on that it was like weird but uh they also have beautiful beaches i i hear i'm not saying anything you know if you if you're into that kind of drugs and and weird sex stuff thailand's there but i hear they have great beaches as well oh no it was gorgeous dude i mean for like 50 bucks we lived like kings a [ __ ] uh jet skiing and and had a little mound of beer cans around us like a castle i mean we're broke sailors living large but uh throw some wheat in that [ __ ] oh my god i want to go to tomorrow oh man uh thailand's also where they have that form of kickboxing which was hilarious because i guess i did that when i was in korea and they would the people that taught it they would usually go down to thailand to practice for so many times during the year and you would see the the fights that they would have and the records for the thai fighters you could always tell because it'd be like 285 and 64. because they like they lived at the gym they they were just so poor that that's that's what they did they got taken in by a kickboxing gym and then they uh helped around the house or helped run the family business but it's also uh technique because when we used to pull into thailand they'd always warn like don't get drunk and step in the ring like because you know the american ego oh i got this four foot [ __ ] no i'm gonna show this little guy who's boss and he will kill you he will kill you it's true yeah i remember like trying to fight this guy he was fast as hell and it's like suddenly his foot would be kicking me and it was like how did it get there so quick boggled the mind uh and then that doesn't have anything to do with cannabis legalization news except it was an anecdote and and thailand has legalized cannabis or taken steps there too uh what else was going on in the in the news this week we talked about uh the un we talked about the more act thailand oh tyson let's figure out the tyson sports yeah speaking of boxing that mike tyson mike tyson fought over the weekend and uh did you see the fight i didn't pay the 50 bucks i know a lot of people did you made a lot of money for charity but oh you were traveling that's right and i i just i wasn't gonna pay 50 bucks to watch boxing uh and so uh i i heard that he looked good and he and it was a draw oh i didn't hear results but i just saw at the end where he's all like of course i smoke that's what i do yeah that's uh i'm glad that we actually got uh meggy to do the impersonation of mike tyson so that he could explain that he'd smoked weed before and then of course after uh he boxed and it appears that it might be a performance enhancing drug if you're in your 50s and trying to have a boxing match but according to the boston herald cbd is not a performance dehancing drug because they said cbd doesn't matter when it comes to driving do we get that one why would you matter when it became the driving i just think if you're more chill yeah less less road rage let's do this right right yeah actually i could see an upside to it you know you're not gonna be freaked out and paranoid you're gonna be like all right well moving on i mean you'll be fine i'd like to add in my personal study i did this past week when taking my board of minnesota that thc doesn't appear as well either this is just a personal uh experience that i'm still studying and i'll work on a doctorate later for everybody to read and improve you have to see if you can confirm your hypothesis that it's okay and so like so far how many of these tests have you performed oh [ __ ] in a 10-year span oh yeah sample size yeah we can get an epistemological or something on this right all right no epidemiological yeah over the 10 years would you say that you've done it a hundred times oh more than that my friend okay so uh uh you're still fine yeah just that just saying uh but these are the fun things we get to do here on cannabis legalization news get a little nerdy about it and uh and then talk about various aspects of the cannabis industry well speaking about nerdy i mean our guess is infusing that that they're getting about foodies it gets birds are infusion yes i mean the the cannabis plant is complex and the technologies they use to do the extraction they aren't all some are some are quite old but then what is quite old decades yeah let's bring stephanie on hey stephanie thank you so much for joining us today thank you for having me it's great to be here can you tell us a little bit about what you're doing at thc production absolutely we're a really unique cannabis extraction company in nevada and what makes us unique is our innovative products there are a lot of companies producing great cannabis extracts in this state but we do things that are catering to different niches that other people ignore or reject so for example we produce some vegan and sugar-free edibles for people with you know dietary restrictions we have a line of we were the first line of ratio tinctures in the states so that would be things like different ratios of cbd and thc each designed to have specific effects as well as the first cbn rich product in the state and a whole line of wellness tinctures that combine the essential oil from cannabis with essential oils from other plants to enhance the effect for things like respiratory function and digestive function we also uh partnered with the oldest and most award-winning craft brewery in the state of nevada great basin brewing company to do the very first line of hops infused vape cartridges in the state so that's just a very brief overview of what makes us a little bit unique now how much science is involved in all that um well there's science in many different levels number one there's the extraction extraction i mean if you go into our our lab uh where we do the extraction our extraction room it looks like a bunch of erector sets i mean there's a co2 extraction a machine there are rotary vein evaporators there are all kinds of crazy distillation uh glass tubes and equipment took together for both distilling terpenes as well as distilling cannabis distillation is uh the most advanced refinement that people do with cannabis so you you pull everything out of the cannabis oil that is not cannabinoids and that is definitely scientific um you know you have to deal with boiling points you have to deal with um the vacuum pressure you have to learn exactly at what points to be uh changing gears and changing glass uh receptacles etc and even the refinement of it uh you know as we've gone we've gotten better and better by trial and learning and applying new methods as well as input from other people so there's a lot of science and then uh it sounded like when you were describing all this science a lot of infrastructure you said like an erector that so your overhead if you would describe your overhead in the terms of expensive to quite affordable would it be expensive um in terms of the startup cost yes there's a high barrier to entry into cannabis it requires a tremendous amount of capital so it's not like oh i'm going to start a consulting business or even i'm going to start a restaurant it's much less expensive to start a restaurant than it is to start a cannabis company and we're a small company even um you know one of our competitors uh they sold their company evergreen organics and they sold it um a few years back and they had close to 14 million dollars in liabilities on their balance sheet because of the cost of starting up and how much it can be we're a smaller company that's not what it took to start ours but it's still uh you know in excess of a million dollars yes and i and i just thank you for you know that and i hope that our our listeners and our viewers because a lot of them want to get into the industry and uh and i'm always like okay let's really talk numbers here because you want to start this where you're going to make these cookies or these types of things that means that you need this type of infusion license or you want to grow and create these extractions and these distillates it's very often its own licensed type but here in illinois it's just kind of smushed in with the growers and so you have to look at the type of operation that they're trying to open up and do it compliantly and then to do it correctly in the right way it's not a cheap endeavor no and then there's 280e which i know you've discussed um so you know it's very very possible in this industry to lose money over the course of a year but have to pay income taxes as though you made money um because you're not allowed to deduct sales expenses so if you pay sales commission to a sales rep for selling your product you're not allowed to deduct the cost of bookkeeping or accounting you're not allowed to deduct office supplies for your operations manager i mean there's so many costs and you you can you can't uh you cannot deduct the cost of delivering the product to your customers or the cost of cash collection we're a largely cash industry and so rather than have our you know 93 pound sales rep go pick up money uh we have an armed guard that goes and collects the cash for us and brings it to us so all of those kinds of expenses you don't get to write them off as expenses you have to pay income tax on those expenses unlike any other business right and i'll see that when we look because uh josh and i are launching a pitch deck thing so like we'll make a pitch deck for a team and we like to break that out be like now guys this is the money that you think you see don't forget to include this and so we'll have opex broken out from cogs and that can really just eat the profits of the dispensary or because yours is science and so because it's a lot of that science you have to make that product so at least a lot of those costs can be recouped so that the growers can very often they have an easier time getting around this but yes what we need in the more act which evidently is coming up i mean let's talk about some uh some help uh why don't doesn't the federal government have to disgorge all this money they've taken over the past few years talk about getting the industry involved then be like hey we paid you now we want it back you know it's going to start reinvesting and and uh and and fixing the war and the harms of the war on drugs this irc 280e to be honest i mean that is a a lead weight around the industry and the only reason it's there is because it is i mean it's but are you talking like reparations though because every time you talk about something like that repayment it's a tax over payment have it declared being a tax overpayment because if you know you're taking the money these states are legalizing it and then uh we're still getting just taxed through the gills because you're not allowed to deduct any of the carry-on expense the advertising the sales commissions all that stuff correct you know when when you think about it the federal government almost has a financial disincentive to get rid of 288 because they're going to make a lot more money continuing the status quo than repealing that honestly but if that's that's what the more act does it it removes it from the csa and so if marijuana is going to be removed from the csa and then there's policies in the moore act that says let's fix the damage that we've done substantively uh over the decades well some of the damage is quite easy to calculate because the irs has the records and it would be very nice if all that money is returned yes why couldn't they put that in legislatively i mean right but i doubt they will what about the money though well it's not going to pass yet you see it's not going to pass yet it's going to pass the congress it's going to hit a brick wall in the senate georgia's super important in january then the industry could be like wait a minute what if we do put that in there okay and then they start paying off their uh their their elected officials well they make paying contributions to their elected officials and then maybe then it would actually pass possibly i mean money talks um the the only way that even uh state legalization measures have gotten through is because of treating it like uh like a business endeavor where there's a lot of money and consultants and all kinds of people who've been brought in to make sure it happens so yes if you put money behind it there is a possibility yeah you know you talked about um social social equity and the injustices and things and it reminds me one of the things that's highly unusual about our company is that we are everyone who works with us is female a person of color or uh somebody who's over 55 and that is extraordinarily unusual in the cannabis extraction uh sphere um we didn't set it up that way it's not that we said oh sorry you're 54 you can't work for us or you know anything like that it just so happened um in fact we have the only head of extraction that is a female in the state of nevada probably one of very few in the country um so that's something that we embrace that you know we don't look at someone and say well oh you're not the typical cannabro so we're not gonna hire you man you know but we we allow chances for all kinds of different people to um be part of this and to contribute it's funny you say uh about the female owned extraction facility uh washington state halo labs has the female only uh it's a female-owned extraction facility and they're great and yeah they're working with i think terpenes and some other cannabis group or whatever but always putting out good information stephanie why extraction why did you choose to go with the extraction field not be a gardener say or whatever else actually it it just was happenstance um the there was a grow in north las vegas that had a an extraction license that they had not built out so they uh somehow got connected with uh the person who is now the managing member of the company his name is rick and they'd gotten connected with him and they said listen we've got this extraction license we're growers we don't know anything about extraction we don't want to invest any more money how about you put up the money and the expertise and you partner with us and build this out and so uh i rick and i were actually partners in a different company different industries in a startup company and i helped him look at the opportunity and helped him start the company i continued you know in my other my other business and then about nine months later he came to me and and asked me to to join the company um so first i did that as the controller part-time and then uh took over the operations so i've been running the company for the last three years and it wasn't something i planned it just kind of happened all of it just kind of happened but i'm so glad it did because it's such a unique industry to be part of um you know when i when i got involved with the company was only medical and frankly i thought medical marijuana that's code for i want to get high which i was totally okay with but um but that being said very quickly when you get into this industry you learn that the medical marijuana is no joke that that there's very real uh benefits for people struggling with all kinds of illnesses so um so definitely something that we're passionate about and that's that's fascinating and this is like a recurrent theme when we have a lot of these conversations well you said yeah it was code for you want to get high and then you actually start learning about the medical aspects of this plant and you find out there's a whole endocannabinoid system and then you should get upset that it's like wait i remember when i was a kid this is your circulatory system that you're nervous nobody ever even mentioned the endocannabinoid system and so if we had that knowledge i think we would have well the laws would not have been what they are but uh we didn't know it until like the early 90s and so it's it's one of those and it's it just it blows a lot of people's minds and i think the people that are growing up now are spoiled you know and there's like oh of course we do that well yeah you're lucky yeah if you look at the the transition of legalization right i mean first aids epidemic and cancer patients were the ones proving that hey this helps us right then uh you know even earlier in my activism online when you and i met tom you know people seem to come to you when you say hey this is you're not a wrong person when you say i've legalized weed now people coming out of the woodworks and they reach out to you say hey me too i had this one gentleman in louisiana uh he was in a wheelchair i think he suffered from ms but he showed me he's like hey man thanks for i appreciate you look this is what it does for me he smoked it he stood up out of the chair and you know for like six months i still was like i don't know i don't know if this is like no [ __ ] medicine because like you said it's that party we're still trying to get through our heads like okay it's feel good it's wellness what's wrong with feeling good and well and it's harassment why are we so in our heads like this can't be medicine this can't be i don't know i don't know but um stephanie how is it being one of the few women representing the industry uh what are some of the things that you think other women that are trying to get in the industry and like you said you just kind of fell into this position of leadership what's some advice you would give to those other female entrepreneurs out there wow that's a great question um really i've been fortunate um in my life that uh you know i grew up in the 80s and even though yeah you know the don't the you know speaking of the propaganda of the 80s and the you know this is your brain on drugs with a cracked egg and you just say no and you know thank you nancy reagan and all that stuff but uh but that being said um you know uh having grown up in that era um and you know having come from a yeah a quote-unquote middle-income you know family i had a lot more opportunities as a female than people who grew up in um either more economically depressed communities or people who grew up in an earlier era so um it's never even occurred to me that being a female would ever be a problem business if that makes any sense so the uh in it and it hasn't been um but really the and this relates to the advice portion you ask what advice i would give is is um is that if you are if you've got a lot to bring to the table then it's not going to matter what you look like it's not going to matter um you know what you your gender is what your age is in this industry particularly that's not true in all industries don't get me wrong um and there's definitely a glass ceiling you can look at who's the ceo of fortune 500 companies etc but in cannabis i find that it is a more diverse and open-minded space in that regard so this is a great industry for women to get into and in advance in um so it's it's really just about being confident in what you can bring to the table and making sure that you put it out there well like we said on the radio show you kind of infused your career right like you took your normal day job and just kind of transitioned it over a little bit and the only thing you're doing now is adding more paperwork to your layers of bs yes um and you know the everyone in our company half of our team doesn't actually use thc um and the other half does we've got a mix of you know old school stoners um you know recovered cancer patients uh people who are a little trepidatious about even drinking alcohol let alone getting high um so like a whole mix but all of us um use cannabinoids in some form or fashion and all of us are very very passionate about what we're doing um and that has led to you know somebody was touring our facility a week or two ago and they said you know most companies ever since recreation went into effect they've just shifted everything to the recreational market and they just ignore the medical market and i appreciate the fact that your company doesn't and what she was speaking to isn't simply that oh yes we have some medical chocolate bars that only people with a medical card can buy but that we're producing they just have a higher degree of uh thc in them that's it oh they could get even higher yeah yes exactly um but she was speaking to our our tincture line um because you know frankly if somebody wants to just have a good time they're probably not going to grab a tincture they're going to grab a joint they're going to dab their you know something more maybe an edible just like have a piece of chocolate um people who are using tinctures they're using it because they have a problem usually and so the fact that we have this whole product line that is a huge portion of our um of our inventory that is really geared towards people that have a an issue that they need to solve and that's important to us and we're going to be continuing to roll out even more um because that is important and then you know starting the radio show just really providing a lot of cannabis education to people so it's really just part of our mission statement almost to you know make products that not only make people feel good um you know on a recreational level but that make people feel good on a health and wellness yeah i level how you mentioned it oh good bro oh no no i was going to ask about market trends we can talk about that after your question well i'll just say i love how she mentioned that in our campaign system right and most of her employees are not say flower smokers or whatever but you learn too you walk in the store and how everybody's smoking weed everybody everybody some people like edibles some people will just put a little bit of concentrate rss or whatever receipt owners say cbd and i like to include i like it's the plant you know and so the when you and i like i was looking at your your website and you have uh ratio tinctures you mentioned that at the top oh the one thing that i really wanted to find out is how do you pronounce picture anyway is it tincture is it tinkature is it uh what's the appropriate pronunciation of this we call it tincture tincture and most people in our state do i don't know maybe in illinois they call it something different it's one of those words you always like i just read before and then suddenly people are saying it and then it's like well what is a tincture i don't know you know you put it on your tongue and it usually is can have cannabis i'm like oh okay interesting but uh i like how you have the whole plant aspect of it so there is a lot of cbd and so cbd's health and wellness and and beneficial applications are just ridiculous and so i just think yeah in the future it's going to be fairly common for everybody to be using some form of cannabis not necessarily for uh inebriation like they would for an alcohol but for some form of like health and wellness and rejuvenation so that's really interesting that you're is that part of your marketing strategy then you know just turning it into trends more uh because you're coming at the plant from a more holistic medicinal side and then from that what are the products that you're seeing for 2021 that you think are going to be uh popular um well there's a difference between market trends and where we're going and why um i mean right now flowers king uh certainly in nevada uh the growers can't they can't grow enough fast enough to meet the market demand flower has just become dominant even normally it's you know 50 of the market in many states it's become much more than that um over the last few months um so that is one market trend um and another market trend in nevada is actually products like tinctures are re reducing market share um but some edibles are gaining market share uh vapes have gone up and down uh you know of course when there is that whole uh lung scare with the uh black market vapes being sold with products that weren't good for you and it was causing people to end up in the hospital so there was a reduction in vape usage for a while and it's recovered somewhat so there's all kinds of different trends going on um but our strategy and you know how it relates to the market trends are all about what's unique and all about uh catering to smaller market segments so we're like a craft brewery in that way you know we're we're not michelob or budweiser um we are like the great basin brewing company as for beer in our state um we're a craft cannabis operation and so um we all the new products that we're releasing um are things that no one else is doing or that they're um we've gotten customer requests for so two things that are coming out right now or that just came out i can't believe no one's done a peanut butter chocolate bar in the state but no one's done a peanut butter milk chocolate bar so we just did it and it's delicious like i just want to eat this all day long it's so good well how dangerous of a proposition is that because i made these cookies over the weekend and i think i nailed it but like you know the goal was to try to make a cookie about 10 milligrams because then you can eat cookies and not like two in deep too quickly so how did you get a chocolate bar well it's 10 milligrams per serving um because that's the you know state regulated limits um but really it's funny because this very thing the fact that it tastes so good you want to eat more inspired us to make single serve little bites we call them that are the size of you know like a ghirardelli chocolate score they're a full treat so you get your 10 milligrams but you get a much bigger amount of chocolate so that you feel satisfied micro dosed five milligram ones because then you could eat another one it's only five milligrams we do have some micro dose products so um our most popular product right now is our chocolate covered almonds we introduced that within the last year and it has just taken off like hot cakes um the chocolate covered almonds we have chocolate covered blueberries chocolate covered uh espresso beans so our espresso beans are five milligrams each so that allows for a micro dose and today our chocolatier because we do have a chocolatier on staff he's making our chocolate covered dried cherries so that's going to be our next new product but you had asked about 2021 and and big new things the biggest thing actually is our soul delicious infused partnership you guys got to audio meet ben the founder of soul delicious and uh he's had a seasoning company for 15 years selling at farmer's markets local grocery stores and he makes his own spice blends so it's not like oh go buy cinnamon or go buy garlic he has a vegetable seasoning a chipotle fire rub a lemon pepper garlic black and rosemary all purpose all these different blends and we're infusing them and they will be hitting store shelves in about two weeks from now and it is the first product of its kind in nevada and everyone we've talked to from people that run cannabis magazines to people that run dispensaries has said this is going to be awesome because you can make anything inedible you can make your steak an edible baked potato but think about it like the prob totally with the baked potato and stuff like that but steak if it's an infusion and the grill is fire grill so it's like a thousand degrees or something right like they might burn off because it's it's a rub so be on that top layer but like you know if you braised it or something so like it didn't it didn't evaporate that smoke point full disclaimer tom's a vegetarian just saying oh whatever i'm still i'm just thinking about it propaganda i'm a vegetarian too so in fact our seasoning blends that we're starting with are not vegetarian um but we have approvals for three more four more blends and one of them is vegetarian because i said nope we've got to have a vegetarian seasoning seasoning blend bin so that'll be the lemon pepper garlic but thank you um you're welcome and you know i've actually what you've just talked about i've asked our chemist to look into um because our head of extraction is the you know master's level chemist she used to teach distillation at unlv not of cannabis obviously um they don't allow that yet but um but yeah so she's a chemist and i said you know look into this because even though he will convert cannabinoids there's also the time factor so if you put something in a 500 degree oven for 10 minutes the amount of loss that you would experience is very minimal for example when you make gummies um gummies usually the the liquid is very hot to get it to melt right and so you're putting it in this in this vat or a pot that's several hundred degrees and you're adding the cannabis to it yet the cannabinoids don't all just disappear so there's a time factor that also is involved so i've asked her to look into um this more so we can give users a guideline for you know don't put this in a very really really hot thing for more than x period of time um so it's not as it's not instant um but that being said you can make you know jicama slices apple slices um you can uh you can add it to your to your baked beans or your burrito you know after it's made if you like um and so this is great because there's no sugar in it most of the edibles are sweet on the market um and then this allows you to have a full-size treat because you can eat the whole burrito you don't have to eat just a tiny piece of the burrito and you could also you could also uh titrate the dose and move more seasoning in put less seasoning in yes because our seasoning is homogeneous um every product in nevada that is an edible has to undergo homogeneity testing um the so for example if you make a chocolate bar they want to make sure that all 10 pieces have the same dose in them um and we have to individually bag every dose of seasoning and put a little thc symbol on it so we can't have just a jar of spices that you pour on um it has to be individually bagged now the regulatory compliance segment of the show awesome thumbs up and subscribes for regulatory compliance but thank you stephanie yes you're bagging the individual seasonings and then what happens you know um so before we bag it the cannabis is already infused in the seasoning so that means that we didn't just add some thc after we bagged it so you have no idea like where it is if you're gonna get it if you only pour half no it's throughout so um so that means that you can use half the package and get five milligrams if you want um so it is really good for micro dosing so the package itself is the serving yes that's pretty dope can you keep talking like the type of extractions that you'd be doing like i have friends that are in history and like they can't get so i keep up i'm an electronics guy everything that has a light and beeps i like but like they get into like and tom does too like biology uh terpenes and then like solventless and solvent like you know i know it's a big deal to have an extraction and be able to dissolve it in water what kind of extraction are you doing so there are four main types of extraction in cannabis one is solventless that is no chemicals then there's carbon dioxide co2 it's 70 percent of the air we breathe um it's also used to extract cannabis uh ethanol alcohol uh so obviously we drink alcohol um but the the alcohol used to extract cannabis is you know 90 to 100 pure then there's hydrocarbons things like butane propane heptane etc uh we actually do three of the four the one we don't do is hydrocarbons and that is uh for two reasons one is that we're on the second floor and any piece of equipment that we put in we have to bring up the stairs we when we did our when we put our our co2 extraction machine in we had to cut a hole in the roof but um yeah so there's some physical limitations and you have to put like a bomb shelter in your lab when you have hydrocarbon they're just the weight limits the size we couldn't do it so um the second reason we don't do hydrocarbons is that we are a little bit concerned about the leftovers um so when you use ethanol or you use hydrocarbons to extract cannabis there's some leftover ethanol or leftover hydrocarbons in the product and you do what's called a purge there's sciencey stuff you do to try to pull that out and to the greatest extent possible and alcohol although probably like not super awesome to be inhaling it at least we drink alcohol you know um no one's drinking lighter fluid or if they are they shouldn't be so um propane hexane yeah all the other type of hydrocarbons that you know they're lighter fluid they're gas you know yeah so you know it's it's really important when you're using those kinds of products um just check the levels of at least in nevada it's all listed on the lab report the levels of residual um chemicals left but um the and people love hydrocarbon extracts because not only is it very cost effective but they love the flavor um so i would never fault somebody for you know doing it as long as they're doing a very good purge on it um so that being said when we started out we were solventless only by necessity um we didn't have a co2 machine yet and uh and so we started out we were the first uh company in the state to do old school hash so temple balls a la frenchy cannoli um um bubble hash rosin that you were doing the solventless extraction so fascinating so you guys were the is there a high-end hash scene in uh nevada um there's starting to be a hash scene in nevada um we were um you know four years ahead of the curve um which you know is why we were pushing to get the solvent extract as well because there wasn't enough market demand and we knew that from the get-go it was brand new so you know you know it's fine to be six months ahead of the curve or a year ahead of the curve but four or five years you can't you know run your business on that so uh so we were uh so we diversified um but the there's there's a growing market for solventless extracts in nevada um it's the thing about solventless extracts is that even though they're amazing they're more expensive because you get a lower yield so if you take a pound of let's just say flour and you put it through a solvent-less extract you might get 10 if you put that pound of flour uh through butane extract you might get 30 yield so um therefore just just that alone gives you an idea that the price per unit is going to be higher for the solvents um that's before the manpower cost isn't solvent list isn't that usually more difficult to make as well yes it is it's more labor-intensive and um because it's it's done by hand even when you use machines there's still a lot of human um labor that has to go into it um so you know there's for example washing machines use a washing machine instead of a bucket and a paddle and you put your cannabis in that washing machine and you run a little spin cycle well then you drain it and it goes into a bucket stack with mesh bags in it you gotta scoop the hash out and if it's not ready you put it back in the machine if it's ready you put it on a tray then you've got to freeze dry it then you've got to um to take it to like a cheese grater once it's dry i mean and then if you're going to service little grams eventually you have to wait in a little ground and then maybe do you put like a little uh a little symbol on it or something to have like a little uh imprint that you could make that has like your logo like oh it's our hash no we don't do that but we do our packaging um our epc we have two in-house brands epc experience free and cannabis and omg thc epc is our solventless brand um and all the packaging is eco-friendly so our hash packaging and our rosin packaging you can actually plant it in the ground and it will grow wild flowers um whereas our tincture packaging is all biodegradable or it won't grow wildflowers but it's even the glue on the labels is biodegradable or recyclable um so that's part of our environmental commitment and so that's how we put our mark on it so your environmental commitment was that a part of like your plan and your application did you have that environmental commitment from day one or how did that arise um no it's not part of our application it was just part of the bent that we those of us had who were starting the company um our original extractors and um our managing member and myself um so we said yeah let's let's do that and um we've continued that and so our epc brand is good for you and good for the planet um that's the that's the the slogan that we have for you right that's nice yeah i like that and then that's the an aspect of the industry that i i see often is this type of beneficial aspects so people are going to buy your brand because it's going to then continue to benefit them even after it's not waste it's what did you say it grows wildflowers yeah yeah you can plant it in your garden so yeah the um and our omg thc brand that's our solvent extract brand so that's where we use our co2 extraction um and we do some bucket tech ethanol extraction um so co2 is very clean but it has the lowest yields so um the extracts tend to be more expensive that's why the industry has gone away from co2 so five ten years ago co2 was the thing um but then you know quickly um ethanol and hydrocarbons overtook it for the cost savings um and the greater yields that are provided um so the co2 like i said it's very clean that's one of its advantages the other advantage is that co2 equipment is excellent for extracting terpenes so you can really preserve those natural flavor compounds that are in the plant and it's not just flavor but as you know that that impacts how the cannabis affects you it's that's really what makes something a sativa or an indica right yes correct we've she's done it we've won everybody she's just exploring the difference between a sativa and indica it really is just the terpene profile and the other the other uh what do they call that things when like the morphology of the plant so like you know sometimes the plant has oh it's short yeah sometimes it's short sometimes it's got the wide leaded uh leaves all those types of things all those genetic diversities that's really the difference between the sativa and the indica it it's still all the same plant it's still all the same thc but some of them like the the indicas they might have more mercy or they might have more uh lianowol which i'm not all that great pronouncing uh and that's really the difference and one of them makes you more upbeat because they're just more invigorating terpenes do you i've heard that like and i've never watched anybody operate uh a carbon dioxide extractor but i've heard they do a certain pass first for the terpenes and then they'll come through and do another pass for the thc or the cannabinoids can you explain that yeah it has to do with different settings so with the co2 machine um there you're dealing with temperature and you're dealing with pressure so the you have to have certain pressure and temperature settings that are optimal for extracting terpenes and then certain pressure and temperature settings that are optimal for extracting cannabinoids so um so that is you know why you can't run them simultaneously they have you know if you do one when you do a terpene extraction you're just not really getting cannabinoids out of the mix and vice versa does that make sense no no absolutely but i just don't understand how they actually do that through the machine i know that they have different vapor points and so like they would get the terpenes out of temperature a and then the cannabinoids come out of temperature b but i've never seen anybody operate one of these machines i mean i can i've operated an ethanol extracture extraction just as like a home you know the magical butter machine device that you can buy it's a very crude one but that's exactly what it is you know you could use an oil do you use any like oils for your extractions or infusions or or no no um so we don't do the can of butters and things like that um uh so omg thc our brand every package on it and it's we have a some some extracts under omg thc but that's where edible line is every package says damn delicious and let's face it if you're using canned butter it's not going to be damn delicious um it's going to taste like weed so um so instead we we take a distillate and infuse it into our our actual product that we're making gummies chocolate etc um but we believe strongly in the power of full spectrum extracts which are different than distillates distillates you've taken everything out of that oil that is not a cannabinoid and pretty much taken everything out of that oil that's not thc but spectrum extracts have all the cannabinoids and the terpenes and the phytocannabinoids and flavonoids found in the original plant you've removed the chlorophyll you've removed the waxes and the fats and so it's a much more holistic uh a much more holistic product the problem with full spectrum extracts is twofold one when there concentrates they're darker and people assume that that means that darker is bad that's like saying oh that whole wheat bread is brown instead of white it's dirty it's not good when in fact the opposite is true and full spectrum extracts are the same way but the market education isn't there yet and not enough people know that just because it's dark doesn't mean it's bad in fact it may mean it's better um so that's one issue um in terms of the concentrates and the other issue is that it's it's not going to taste good so we're actually thinking about doing a third brand you asked for what we're going to do next year and our trends we actually think about making a third brand centered around full spectrum extracts and we might do more of those cannabis infused oils and stuff it's not going to taste as good but the effects are going to be mind-blowing well i mean you could try to see if you're able to do some type of flavor preservation at the terpene specific level but that could be extremely difficult yeah it might be it might be like jumping the shark now you said you do use ethanol extraction though right yeah bucket tech old school you know um the kind of thing you go on future 4 200 and learn to do at home but yeah so we do some it's rudimentary ethanol extraction um not you know mass scale with a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand dollar ethanol extractor um so but we do use you know uh different temperatures and etcetera in the process um and that we do that's very specifically for one particular product um line which is our afghani hash so we have solventless bubble hash which i described um you know using washing machines to um cleave off the trichome heads of the plant which is where all the little sacks of goodies are that people want their kit um but with with the afghani hash it's uh it's different so in afghanistan one of the ways that they make hash is to take key for sift and then they'll add water or tea and work it to become taffy like almost but if we added water or tea to cannabis it would encourage microbial growth and it would fail lab testing so we don't do that instead we took our own spin we took the keef or the sift and then we made a full spectrum ethanol extract so it's the full spectrum oil and we mixed it with that keef until it had that taffy like consistency so that's our own take our own spin on the afghani hash um and so that's the product line for which we use the ethanol extracts ah man that sounds delicious so if i was in nevada how much would a gram of that that hash cost um it depends on which dispensary you go to um dispensaries have a markup of anywhere from 2.2 to three so what i mean is if they buy something for ten dollars they're gonna sell it for anywhere from twenty two to thirty dollars depends on the dispensary um and then there's the eighteen percent sales tax or recreational tax um so you know you at the places that have some of the lower markups you might be set back forty dollars plus tax um for a half grand okay stephanie thank you so much for joining us today where can we go to find and follow what you guys got going on at thc productions uh you can go to

cannabidiol otherwise known as a CBD massage the treatment I'm getting today is a CBD soak combined with the CBD massage and I haven't seen this at any place else I'm really excited to try this treatment come along with me let's figure this out let's see if CBD really makes a difference [Music] my name is Daisy I am the owner and founder of Despard spa it is a very popular service so she will be getting today soaked we are using Cecil combined with CBD we are gonna add some bubbles I'm a central oils to make it a little more fun and relaxed and fluffy she would be in there for 30 minutes and then we're gonna follow her move her into another room and then she's gonna be getting a nice relaxing sport deep tissue massage we're gonna start using our massage oil which is the carrier CBD massage oil though such that we use for the CBD infused massage is 50 milligram per 1 ounce and for the soap is 100 milligrams per 1 ounce the CBD you can get all the fun medical benefits but you're not gonna get high you're not gonna get a positive on drug test for so you can just get all that fun stuff without being high some people some people experience a little tingling sensation everybody's different the benefits are the next day when she goes home you should go to sleep she's gonna wake up like a brand new woman I'm let into this room with this gigantic copper tub candles burning low light huge bubble bath and there's a smell in the air that's a little bit different than a normal bath smell it kind of has a herbal medicinal smell a little bit strong but still looks super inviting the smell is interesting because it smells like well it smells kind of like weed frankly like smell but it's definitely a strong smell the minute I put my toes in the water it was super warm and I immediately felt warm tingles in my legs and once I settled in I started feeling warm tingles all over my legs are fully floating and like tingly warm and tingly not mad at it okay guys just leave me here to soak I'll be here for the next thirty I'm at work right now [Music] [Applause] [Music] so after the soap go into the massage and that was a very welcomed experience after that warm bath she's using a CBD oil and the CBD oil right when it goes on it immediately you feel like a nice warm tingle and it's mainly afterwards that I still feel that warmth and that tingly feeling from the massage and she left the oil on and I still have the oil on so I still have that heavy warm deep feeling of relaxation I would say it did feel extra relaxed after this because of the CBD which was surprising I actually didn't know if I would feel anything at all I worked out yesterday I worked out pretty hard and I would say all that soreness is gone please let me know what I can be your guinea pig and try next because I'm down to try any beauty treatment so let me know using the hashtag ET style feed [Music] [Applause]", "vsPaXApBsRk": "what's the best way to consume cannabis the only way to answer this question is individually it depends on how you want to take cannabis and what you're using it for there are a bunch of different ways to take cannabis you can smoke it or inhale it in other ways you can eat it you can drop it under your tongue for sublingual administration you could rub it on your skin for topical administration you can put on a transdermal patch so those cannabinoids pass through the skin each one of those has a different onset time and a different duration of effect it's important to realize what those differences are inhalation has the quickest onset time so you'll feel the effects almost immediately and certainly within ten minutes and it also has the shortest duration generally when you smoke cannabis the effects will only last a couple of hours and then they'll start to recede eating cannabis has the longest onset time and the longest duration so when you consume cannabis orally THC edibles or CBD gummy bears or whatever it can take up to four hours for you to feel the effects from that edible and then those effects can last six to eight hours it's a it's a commitment as far as time is concerned sublingual is kind of in between those so you have sublingual glands underneath your tongue that allow some things to pass through into your bloodstream a little bit more quickly and cannabinoids can pass through those glands into your bloodstream that means you'll feel effects within 45 minutes if you hold it under your tongue for at least a minute first and those tend to last four to six hours sublingual administration is usually combined with oral administration because most people swallow tincture is after they put them under their tongue and so you can get sort of a longer duration of effect if you do that topical cannabinoids usually you can feel the effects within 15 minutes and in my experience they would last about four hours there isn't a lot of data about a topical cannabinoid use out there right now one important thing to know about topicals is that they will not get you high cannabinoids are super oily and your skin is composed of layers of oil and water and so the cannabinoids can get through maybe the first oily layer but they can't get through the water layers and so it's just a surface level relief on a topical this is different from a transdermal product transdermal products go through your skin by combining cannabinoids with special carriers that help open up your pores in some way to get the cannabis into your bloodstream immediately and those products also work within about 15 minutes what's cool about transdermal products is once you take the product off fits a patch you'll also cease to feel the effects very quickly this can be really important for people who are a little bit older or maybe a little bit hesitant about trying cannabis for the first time because it can give them a very easy way to try and see what the effects are gonna be like [Music]", "ttkTDGMyPRA": "welcome back to marketing smarts i'm carrie o'shea gorgon your host and this is the interview series for marketing profs i'm talking today with ryan stewart about cannabis marketing ryan is the founder of the agency web risk how are you ryan i'm fantastic carrie thanks for having me how did you become involved in cannabis marketing was it like a passion project to begin with or like you did your clients bring it to you so so so i will say that i i am a cannabis user myself um so just being that i've always been open to you know and also just seeing how the market has exploded obviously because legalization um and commercialization all that stuff i have a friend who uh moved to la probably about three years ago and um opened up his own cannabis brain it's actually incredible they're they're doing very well now but he ended up introducing me to somebody who needed help with seo um it was a woman who had uh a singular cannabis product actually out of based out of boston and the cannabis product is a machine called a decarboxylation machine so for for for context what that means is when you smoke cannabis uh it when you actually apply the heat to it it activates the thc in the cannabis which allows you to feel the euphoric high feeling if you just try and eat cannabis on its own you're just going to get sick because the cannabis the thc isn't activated the thc is the element in it that you know acts as medicine acts as a drug what have you so she developed a machine for medicinal patients with cancer who couldn't smoke because obviously smoking if you have cancer is is not good for you frowned upon yes yeah exactly so her machine what it did is basically you just take the raw cannabis you put it in you push a button and two hours later it's activated it's a certain heating mechanism that allows the thc to be activated within the cannabis and then after that then you can take it and you can you know put it in food you can put it in oil you can put in tinctures there's a whole bunch of applications for cannabis especially now that i think it's being viewed on as less of a drug and more as a medicine for a lot of folks that um it's really a wide-open field so her product she was having a lot of trouble getting online visibility because a lot of cannabis companies are blacklisted from advertising um you know you tell me about that like even where it's legal you know to varying degrees yeah well i mean the internet the internet is kind of a global thing so they don't necessarily abide by state boundaries um you cannot advertise directly on google to sell cannabis um you can't advertise on facebook uh it's very difficult to even build a youtube channel organically around cannabis content you have to be very careful there's certain grayers that we can explore more that you have to understand how to maneuver which is what i ultimately had to help them do but also just increase overall organic so the good thing is that google organic obviously you can post whatever you want you get it to rank as long as it's not about hate or violence or anything like that um so organic search for cannabis is is probably the the main channel for a lot of companies for revenue um so they hired me to help with that my background is mainly an seo but then we also had to develop an advertising and uh strategy within google and facebook to help them just pile on more bottom funnel conversions so how does that work so the advertising restrictions on cannabis how do you how do you work within them so um again it's a gray area it's it's it's frowned upon i guess is what you call it but basically what you have to do and this is two years ago uh right now we they they brought advertising in house so we're only working with them for seo and content marketing at this point but two years ago when we were working with them basically you have to do is you have to uh number one so if your facebook page and instagram profile is about cannabis right which you can't get around you pretty much got to create a separate profile um so if you take a step back and you look at again they're not selling the actual drug or product of cannabis or selling a product that helps with cannabis consumption and from a dis a medicinal point of view as well so what we did is we created a facebook page that was called art and herbal they're called art and cannabis that's the name of the brand we created a page called art and herbal which basically we were just kind of posting pictures and blog content from a separate blog that i'll talk about in a second that was basically just talking about holistic medicine because again depending on who you are and how you view this topic cannabis in my opinion anyways is medicine for a lot of folks so um you know again like different usages for tinctures and oils for uh for for body aches for pains for stress for anxiety um for all sorts of different things so we're just building some content naturally on a blog again on a separate domain that was tied to this page what that does is it kind of get lets facebook's algorithm kind of turn a cheek to it and not view it as a cannabis page right as long as you're not posting smoking in an actual leaf then you're okay so after you have that up and running you basically got to set up another ad account that again is not tied to that brand but tied to that page and then from there just running very high level kind of again letting the facebook algorithm understand what your page is about understand what your audience is just running blog posts that are again talking more about holistic medicine um and not about cannabis usage after that after you go ahead oh i was just wondering so it's sounding actually you're talking to end users but really it's a b2b brand in a sense it's they they're they're b2b and b2c they actually hired me to go more b2b so sorry it's more b2c because when when cannabis was first decriminalized and made i guess legal for medicinal patients they were selling all b2b they're selling to dispensaries they're selling to you know building relationships with doctors and they were also wholesaling their product to dispensaries so they could decarboxylate at their dispensaries um and they were doing great with that they had a great sales model she's a tremendous entrepreneur she's an attorney she's an advocate for cannabis she's a cancer survivor herself so she had like a very good foothold in the community um but what she wanted she had a vision for this product to take it to the broader cannabis market people like myself we use it recreationally um you know smoking smoke every now and again for just like you drink a glass of wine she wanted to put this product basically in the home of every everyday cannabis user um so essentially going from a b2b model to a much larger b2c market then you were just about to talk about how you were you were continuing to work around so you're building content around holistic medicine not specifically saying marijuana not putting cannabis anywhere near it so go ahead and continue yeah so so for example a example piece of content could be like five holistic ways to reduce stress to reduce anxiety uh engine like a standard listicle article that you'd see like a buzzfeed type thing um and one of those would just be you know thc cannabis so just kind of like again feeding that into there uh so we're making sure to tie the content back to the brand in some way so it's not just talking about something that has no relevance to the brand um so what we were doing was just boosting that organically and if you're good with facebook ads you can get very cheap clicks we're talking about like 10 cents or less to basically again kind of build the authority of the website with facebook algorithm to understand who the audience is who might be interested in this content also just build the remarketing list um and then after that what we do is we start remarketing a conversion based advertisement that would push people for a pdf opt-in like an ebook about decarboxylation so it was basically saying like carboxylation sorry decarboxylation is uh so the machine that i said and i'll follow up with some content so people can can take a look at it themselves um the machine that they were selling ran the process of decarboxylation which is activating the thc and again stop because i'm so close to this topic now it's like second nature to me um but decarboxylation is actually a scientific process that just essentially means the heating of uh the heating of cannabis to activate the thc toasting your pot gotcha exactly it's actually it's actually exactly what it is um so like for example when people make edibles or something like that or again like tinctures or oils and stuff like that they put they basically put into a convectional oven but it wastes a lot of the cannabis because of the heating mechanism so she built a uh like a machine that literally looks like a mason jar metal mason jar um and it activates the cannabis um evenly and distributes the heat properly uh she patented that oh smart so now you're needing you're needing people really to opt in so that you can have a way to communicate with them exactly exactly so so so after we after we kind of um build the audience just through content and just distribute that content we then remarket for conversions to get people off facebook and then once you have their email then you can start to market to them directly in terms of the product and still though what you have to do because you don't want to just generate emails about people who are interested in holistic health you have to be a little bit more specific but you have to be creative with your copy because again you can't necessarily say cannabis decarboxylation you can't say like um stop shouldn't say that anyway um so so you have to be creative with your copy um you know so exchanging words like um exchanging words like um like weed with material for example you know i'm saying so instead of saying we do say material um so just exchanging copy like that both in the advertisement and on the landing page um but the good thing about facebook is that over time as you build up more equity with your ads like if you're running a lot of traffic on facebook and you're running clean ads you're not getting ads shut down facebook will give you a lot of leeway um so once you kind of build up that equity that's why it's important to promote those blog posts um spending money basically to get the algorithm to understand again who your audience is what your page is about um and if you look at it from the point of view too of of generally speaking most holistic people in terms of holistic medicine uh people who are open-minded to different alternative forms of medicine are definitely open to seeing cannabis as a form of like pain relief as opposed to taking like an aspirin or um you know something even worse that a doctor would prescribe um so basically just kind of using the content the out of them to go find people that are in market just very very broad so you do have to spend quite a bit of money uh just to do that audience building but after that then you can remark it with much more specific messaging um and then again once you have that conversion point you can just blast them with emails for whatever you want now you're talking about facebook and i definitely think that's a better choice than linkedin for something like i mean what are your other options like that you're using to adwords people aware kind of yeah adwords is another one because there are quite a quite a bit of people searching for so people who are users and i and i'm a recreational user i i i wouldn't say that i'm a user i'd say more than i'm an advocate for folks that um again i've had some history with cancer in my family and it definitely helps for a lot of people um so uh i've had a very open mind and i'm familiar with the cannabis industry but i still didn't know what decarboxylation was but uh a lot of folks do know what it is and um there's so there's a lot of people searching for decarboxylation um so this will kind of transition i guess into the seo and just kind of google strategy that we did for them so um i'm not sure how familiar people are with seo but um they had a kind of a brand new website and when you don't do a lot of seo for your website you don't have a lot of equity with google so you don't have a lot of authority yeah it was really tough for them to get visibility um so she had this really really good guide on how to decarboxylate cannabis um but there were a lot of major websites like leafly was based like the huffington post of cannabis for like you know i'm saying a big publisher okay about cannabis they had like the top three spots and they were all just like decarboxylation guides uh so we took a two-pronged approach number one is we started doing a lot of just kind of like pr style outreach using her name because she's a cannabis advocate um she's she's just a force she's just a really solid entrepreneur so we did a lot of pr style outreach to get her feature on like the forbes nothing to post and stuff like that to build the overall authority of the website um which over time helped quite a bit in terms of getting the other content on the website more visibility uh but then we actually reached out directly to the leaflets and just offered to sponsor their articles about decarboxylation so we basically sent them an email and said hey um you've got this really good article about d-carb can we sponsor it uh and we did so basically they gave us the author byline on it so it became like a guest post submission by her with her face on it and they also gave us banner ads on that so we were basically jacking the search traffic from that until we were able to end up ranking that article for decarboxylation which they rank for now so cannabis marketing is surprisingly serious you would think you saw a lot of fun and games but it is not yeah i mean yeah it's one of those industries where um how do i say this nicely there's it's kind of a gold rush there's a lot of people who have gotten into over the past couple of years because they're like oh cannabis is legal now like i can make a lot of money but it's a really expensive industry to get into like insanely expensive industry because of all the regulations um so marketing is kind of taking a back seat so while there's a lot of attention on it there's not really a lot of companies who necessarily know what they're doing and i don't mean that as an insult to anyone listening to this um so yeah we had to take a pretty surgical approach in order to get them the visibility again and still working around these kind of blacklisted areas because we couldn't just go to google search we couldn't figure out a way to get around google search like if you um this is back then but we could not get ad words we couldn't pay for the keyword decarboxylation so we didn't have a choice but to figure out the organic the organic play to get the visibility for that keyword um and then the same thing on youtube too like if if if we were to go back and do it over now i would definitely try and figure out a way to get youtube as the work um in my opinion guys are just the most effective way to advertise in the world right now by far um and because there's so much traffic on youtube for cannabis for the carboxylation just based on the keyword search that we did that was another approach that we wanted to push but while we were going through this with them youtube kept on taking down their videos and actually shut down one of their channels which was unfortunate uh again even though they weren't sitting there like smoking bonds they were talking about like the science behind d carb they were talking about the medicine behind um you know how thc can help folks especially those who really need it so they're more of like an advocacy advocacy channel than anything but um youtube didn't care they were taking them down left and right so uh it was tough so we had the the opportunities that we were able to create we had to take full advantage tell me a little bit more about the pr style outreach you did like there are cannabis influencers just like there's every other kind of influencer so how do you identify them and how to complicate a relationship with them so so we use um so our agency my partner i should say um is uh he's based on automation experts sql and python and he built us like a custom crawler that we could identify influencers with i've used a couple of influencer platforms but i find that they're either just the middleman that take a cut on whatever the influencer wants or they're just their inventory is so spammed out because all marketers are using it and hitting up the same people those accounts suck um so what we did is we built our own crawler to scrape instagram and youtube so you want to surface people that other people aren't finding exactly exactly um and also too because as a lot of people know and this is a couple years ago it's even worse now we actually don't do influence influencer marketing anymore i just think it's it's it's not worth it um but basically two years ago which is a long time ago in the school in the grand scheme of these things um even then there were influencers who just wanted too much um you know there's a surprising number of people who have like a million plus followers who are literally i kid you not just doing bomb rips on instagram and getting like tens of millions of views um so yours doesn't get taken down but instagram doesn't care i mean instagram is instagram's out of control especially now um so uh so yeah so basically we just built a crawler we were crawling profiles and then we have a small offshore in the philippines who was just qualifying those uh and just kind of hitting them with different tags in terms of followers uh you know sending them a dm just asking if they'd be interested in you know potentially working with the cannabis company uh we basically put together like a one sheet for them that like talked about what the product did talk about the company talked about the founder um so they knew that we were legitimate we weren't just like some again like this industry is riddled with people again i don't mean this in a disrespectful way but just rid of what people who don't necessarily know they're doing when it comes to marketing uh so we didn't want to waste people's time you know we also wanted to make the most out of our time because we're getting paid for our time so uh so yeah so we were just hitting people up on instagram with just a very basic pitch that said something like um hey so-and-so uh like we love your profile um you know my name is ryan i represent a company called arden uh we're looking to partner up with amazing influencers like yourself uh we have this awesome product if you're interested um you know we can send you a free product in exchange for like a video of you using it like an unboxing video if they had content doing unboxing on their stuff if not then we would just offer them money for straight up for it so basically what we're doing too is we're trying to leverage anyone not just the instagram and youtube side of things uh but also if they had a blog attached to it then we would also just make sure that they did a blog post review that would link back to the site as well so i think that'd be more valuable where you're trying to build organic stuff because you can't really get to it the traditional advertising yeah you know channels yeah exactly like if you hire my agency now we we don't necessarily do influencer outreach anymore because again the amount of work and the amount of costs that it takes to work with an influencer but back then when we were more of kind of a whole we all my agency right now only does seo we won't do facebook ads for any more you know so we just focus on seo so uh back then we were doing more holistic kind of end-to-end marketing so we're looking at it just if you we're killing two birds with one stone we're gonna get you the the say the the brand exposure also some direct sales coming from instagram uh but then also we're gonna have the long term impact of getting a blog post on their website and having that link value for seo so how does that change so you mentioned two years two years you're not doing influencer now do you still have the same challenges you faced when you first went into this two years ago or for this client anyway or is it easier now it's easier now because we know we're up against you know the the first time is always the hardest when you're doing something in new industry um so it's easier now because again i've also learned a lot as a business owner it's really hard to run it's really hard to run an agency that does everything well so we've really doubled down and tripled down in our strengths which is seo and really focusing on that that core process of seo specifically when it comes to certain protocols and now after going through and working with the cannabis company in that industry we know exactly what we're up against so now over time after doing outreach for this company other campus companies we've got a database full of influencers and bloggers um that we can just basically send an email to if we want to link if we want some exposure things along that nature but we're not going through the advertising for campus no so what would you do if you're starting right now today with say like a b2b cannabis type product that you need to market to dispensaries and i would i would say i would say i would say earmark at least two and a half three months of your time to figure out like you have to advertise to get it to get exposure um if you have if you want to turn around sales quickly um organic just takes too long and i sell seo but or if you have no authority if you're just getting started it's just going to take too long so i would say figure out uh i think i do think influencers are still a viable option if you've got the budget to spend and if you're managing it very closely um we didn't have that close with a handle on again because we're mainly focused on the link side of things not the sales side of things but if you need to turn around capital quick the good thing about cannabis influencers is that a lot of them are not getting hit up like a fitness or a fashion influencer would from like a fashion nova brand who's offering them like 10 grand per post again if most people are just sitting there taking bonkers there's not a lot of companies who want to be associated with that but if you are in the cannabis space and if you feel like their audience identifies with yours and you can definitely get some cheap attention off that um and it's still effective so i would say look into influencers i would say figure out how you can leverage social media advertising because again between youtube and facebook ads i still think that it's it's it's the best bet for for any business in the world in terms of generating sales quickly um figure that out figure out how you can navigate the platform figure out how you can get an account that you can baseline and forecast off of again that's not going to be getting shut down every week so focus first on audience building content quality understanding what and i can't tell you this because it's different for every ad account um but you know like i tell everyone like good marketing takes time it takes testing it takes patience and you're going to have to burn some capital to get there but once you've got that figured out um you know it's just like investing in your product for the first couple of months what have you like once you get that figured out then uh you can start to grow and scale what lessons have you taken from the cannabis marketing industry that kind of space that and applied to b2b generally like what's helped you do better with b2b based on your experience in cannabis yeah i mean it's a good question i've always done um i would call like the advertising method that i put up that we put together for them like a funnel right like run top funnel traffic remarket mid funnel conversion point and then at the bottom also remarketing more of like your sales like talk to a sales representative type thing um so it's a it's a it's a model that i've been using for like the last five years with incredible impact for all of my companies um but going through it with the cannabis industry it's since it's so hard and you have to pay so much more attention to it like after going through that refining it whereas before i had a much more kind of like yeah let's just run blog post the interested folks and then let's just remarket off of that like really going through this and understanding how to build content and i think content is always the variable especially now content creative especially with advertising like you have to be building content that your audience cares about you have to um and you have to test that you have to advertise you have to look at the data you have to understand what people are clicking on what people are engaging with how long they're spending on the website how willing they are then after they see that content to opt in off the back of that because with cannabis you're spending so much more money because of all the things that you have to get around that you have to hyper focus on these things so really understanding even more so how to leverage the data how to optimize all parts of the funnel how to really get things dialed in um and then again also just understanding that you don't get that many opportunities and the opportunities that you do get in such a crowded space you've got to make the best and you have to make it's just not an option it's not an option to not make it work you have to make it work you mentioned youtube do you think that podcasting or doing video blogs is that a really beneficial channel for cannabis marketers to use yeah i think it's in any business you know any business i think is it is i just think again if you're going to start a podcast now you really like the first thing i asked you when we got on is who's the audience like you and you answered right away like you have to have your audience style day i i make that mistake i have a podcast and it sucks because i'm basically using my podcast as as the back end i do a lot of video marketing on youtube and i'm just kind of pushing everything in the podcast and nobody listens to it because i don't smile then i'll be the first to admit it well i mean it evolved so i've been doing marketing smarts for like seven years and it definitely evolves you'll see certain segments you know swell and contract and certain episodes attract different types of people so you got to be careful how far you know field you go from the topic you said you were going to talk about so you know right so marketing like cannabis marketing is still marketing we're good but if i was just going to talk about cannabis just generally that i couldn't do that i mean i mean i i think you could but again you just it's just like every business you just really have to understand like who the audience is within your audience like it's not enough to just get on and start talking about cannabis like you you've got to have you've got to have and and i'm not saying that right away i think the first thing that everyone should do is just start you know like take the first step start um and you can like you said you you get it dialed in over time you want to like if you're say i'm a lawyer i don't practice now but i used to so if i wanted to be like a cannabis lawyer then it'd make a lot of sense for me to talk about cannabis actually it's easier to do a podcast about cannabis than it is to talk about law because law is regulated also in a different way that's a little bit harder to do content around so very true yeah i just think just any just to close that off anything that you can do any and like everything will help if you do it the right way um and it's not going to be right the first time it's just again just like the advertising it takes time to get it dialed in are there any challenges with marketing something like cannabis like do you get hate mail from people or you know people like parent groups objecting to you or anything um you know i i fortunately those didn't go to me i was just we were just the marketing agencies they didn't go to me yeah i didn't see that i have somebody else to get out there but but so so so weber says our agency but we also have an seo agency training platform called the blueprint training and we run a lot of traffic a lot of advertising traffic so i get quite a bit of people who comment who dm me who it's but like i'd like you just you just don't care you have to not care it's just i don't care what somebody says like i just don't care if you don't know me then like your opinion doesn't it doesn't faze me and i think everyone has to take that approach and it's unfortunate um especially now i've actually seen an increase because of covet i feel like people are just cooped up they're pissed off they're looking for a fight to pick um and it's easy to fall into that trap like it's happened to me before or someone hits me on the wrong day with just something really nasty and i'm like you know what like i'm gonna go in on you but like it's always helpful take a step back go get a glass of water and be like who cares like it's whatever so yes i'm sure that they got them i get them all the time but it is what it is what would surprise people about b2b marketing in the cannabis space i don't know i mean i guess just the things that i covered in terms of in terms of the regulations but um it's hard but all marketing is hard i've never actually worked in anything in terms of marketing especially now um what surprised me is how similar it is in a lot of ways it's like you're you have obstacles to overcome that maybe are unique but the way that you overcome them is not all that different from how a different more traditional business would have to do agreed i think good marketing good marketing every every campaign that we approach we follow a very similar strategy and process that all revolves around some form of content and creative because ultimately if you want to attract people who have no idea what your business is you can't just put a billboard in front of people anymore you've got to have something of value to them that's going to get them to be like okay like this is this is kind of interesting and then over time you just continuously kind of get back in front of them so i don't i don't think it's different than anything else but again i just think that you have it's it's a lot harder because you're cutting they're cutting off your fingers with what you can do you know um there's just not as many bullets in the chamber for for for what you can do whereas if you're going to come to be with like an e-commerce company that sold sneakers like we can just open it up and do everything um but it's just it's not the same with with cannabis b2b or b2c ryan where can people learn more about you and where can they get more information about webreth uh yeah you can go to webers.org that's our agency's website we've got a really good blog uh my youtube channel post the stuff every week everything marketing and twitter just at ryan was here not doing any smoking on your youtube channel nah keep excited thanks so much ryan thank you carrie appreciate you having me", "Ig-mNLIdGYE": "on today's video I'm going to show you how to make cannabis capsules or canna caps in two different ways well we're gonna talk about why choose canna caps whether you infuse or not all the materials that you'll need and then I'll do a demonstration for you and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about dosing hi my name is Andrea Hogg I'm a cannabis coach and educator we do a whole bunch of stuff besides weekly YouTube videos online classes workshops one-to-one consultations you can find out all about that and get some really cool three stuff by heading to reveal cannabis calm so why go through the investment of time and equipment and resources to make canna caps what are the benefits of them well for lots of people taking a capsule is a really familiar way to take medication so especially for people who are new to cannabis and might hold lots of stigma against it sometimes taking it in a capsule can feel really reassuring to them they're very easy to take just like regular capsules you just swallow them and they're easy to increase or decrease the dose so you can start out with one capsule and then see how you feel and then increase from there they're super easy to store you just keep them in a cool dry place maybe in the fridge if you'd like they're very discreet you can keep them in your purse or your pocket and medicate as you need and making them yourself saves you so much money over store-bought traditionally canna caps have been filled with cannabis infused oil so that's oil that's been infused with cannabis and then they strain the cannabis out they take the oil and they fill up the capsules with it but you don't have to go through that step if you don't want to so if you prefer you can simply D carve your cannabis in the oven grind it up slightly and then use the capsule filling machine like I'm going to show you in a couple of seconds and the scraper that comes with it to just scrape the cannabis flour into your capsules you want to bang the tray deee on every once in a while to make sure that you're getting about the same amount in each capsule but it really saves you a lot of work of doing the infusion if you do decide to do that just use ground D carb Canada make sure you take a little bit of fat with your kiddos capsules when you take them cannabis binds really well too fat so having some avocado or some cream or some butter on your toast is a good way to ensure that you're getting some of the fat that you need to help the cannabinoids bind well so for this project you're going to need cannabis infused oil and I have links to recipes and videos to make that down below or ground D carb cannabis so either one of those to start and then you do not need a capsule maker but it really does make the job a lot easier and a lot faster than hand filling capsules you need the empty capsules try to find it capsules that come with the tops and bottoms apart so you don't have to go through that step but it's really hard to find those so good luck you'll need tweezers for flipping the capsules when you're using the capsule machine a syringe or two or three because sometimes they get clogged up and a dish of hot water or a double boiler if you're using the coconut oil infusion method I get a lot of my capsule making supplies from Amazon but you can also get these at some pharmacies and you can get the capsules themselves at lots of health food stores so check that out as well I just want to give you a picture of what to look for this is the basic capsule filling machine yours might look slightly different but so long as it has these basic parts then you'll be good most of these capsule fillers only take zero and zero zero size capsules and I actually have a whole recipe quote unquote down below for you so that you have links to all of this as well here's a look at what your capsules will likely look like again if you can find them atop some bottom separated that's the best or even different colors is really helpful but this is what I can usually get my hands on make sure that you do check the capsule size there are different sizes and again you can read about that on the recipe down below these are the types of syringes that I buy you can buy literally a whole bunch of different kinds on Amazon I try to get them so that they are at least five milliliters so that you're not refilling your syringe often and some of them do come with the long metal tip I don't find it necessary but some people prefer it so here we go I'm going to show you how to do this the first thing that you need to do is separate your so bottoms from your capsule tops some of the packages come already separated and that's fantastic if not it's a little bit of an arduous job to do next you put this device I do not know what all the names for this stuff is it looks like it should be weight easier than it is and it takes some practice to learn how to use it and sometimes I wonder if it would just be faster for me to fill them by hand and then I go try and sell them by hand and I realize no not sure just taking out all the extras so I've got some here that are actually like upside down and some of the holes aren't filled so I'm going to go through and fix that way that I do it is by pushing down on the springs and just flipping these legs around that need flipped around sometimes I have to go and grab tweezers because just the way that it's set up but you do really want to make sure that you don't leave any of these unfilled especially with these clear caps it's hard to tell so make sure you do a super good like luff scan through because otherwise if you get cannabis oil all over this machine I know it's on machine but all over this capsule filler and it's hard to clean so yeah do your best to make sure that you learn from my many mistakes of capsule filling next we take this piece and put the filler on it again and we do the same thing that we did with the top after you're finished with the tops you can just set this aside for a couple of minutes because you're going to be filling up your cannabis capsules what I have here is cannabis infused into coconut oil and I'll link to a video on how to do that so that you can have that all ready to go and I have it sitting in a dish of really hot boiling water I do that on purpose because I want the coconut oil to be really warm otherwise it starts to solidify too quickly when I'm filling up the capsules and it clogs up your syringe and it makes it a real mess so try to keep this as warm as you can you'll get into a rhythm and you'll spill a whole bunch over the edge a whole bunch of times as well but you'll be able to fill these up relatively quickly and then we'll put the caps on them altogether that took me about seven minutes to fill those capsules up so it wasn't as bad as I thought so my capsules are filled with oil I'm going to put this orange thing on top of the capsule lid and then you flip it upside down smashing clothes they kind of clip closed then you have a bunch of Hana capsules now what I like to do with these right here is put them in the freezer for about ten or fifteen minutes and then you can store these in the fridge or the freezer for quite a long time it's just coconut oil and cannabis and then you have a really convenient way to dose full disclosure time before we get into dosing those kin of caps that I put in the freezer they're still in the freezer it's been about two weeks and you still haven't pulled them out because it's been busy but when you're done with your Kanak apps you can just pull them out of the freezer pop them out of the mold and store them in glass mason jar in the cupboard or in the fridge let's talk about how to dose them so I have on my website and I'll link to it down below a dosing calculator that makes this easy to figure out Emily how many milligrams of THC or CBD might be in each of your capsules again I really want to stress that this is an approximate range unless you're using lab tested cannabis and all of your procedures are really on point however even if you have lab tested cannabis and everything is perfect with your dosing with each new batch that you make you should always start low and go slow and see if everything is the same on the new batch do you have questions about this I love to answer your questions so please leave them down below and again head over to reveal cannabis calm to get your free stuff and to check out all my other offerings", "GaXu1_tgNng": "\u266a\u266a Yo, yo, yo, what up?

Hannibal: This is going\nto get interesting. -So is the stuff in the sauce? -Yes, sir. -Also in my batter. -You hittin' it from both ways? -Yes, sir. -These are crispy. That's how\nit's supposed to be. -I like it. -What's that? -What's that there? -This is the asparagus. -The whole thing is? -It's reefer, too. -Every piece. -I use it in my\ninfused olive oil. Oh, it's in\nthe olive oil. You can't even taste\nthe reefer in it. That's the tricky part. -That's the best part about it. I love that, too,\nbut I think that's low down. I do.

Well, you'll know\nwhen I'm feeling something because I'll panic\nabout the cameras, and run to my car\nand leave. [ Laughter ] When I run away from everybody\nscreaming it's like, \"Oh, yeah, I think\nthe asparagus got to him.\" Zairilla: That's usually\nabout $75 a pound. Really? So how much does\nthe Kool-Aid cost? -20 bucks. -20 bucks? -20 bucks for one thing. -For this thing right here? Yes, sir. She just drunk a $20\nright in your face. -After 20? -[ Laughs ] Yeah. You're looking at\nthis big platter of wings is normally about $1,500. -These wings about $1500? -$1500? -Yes, sir. -That's about 70 wings. So that's about, what, $7\nand some change? Wait, am I bad at math? -You're horrible. -Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Oh, that's about $20 a wing. $20 and some change,\na wing. -A wing. -Holy shit. I just ate\na little $40. Those are\nexpensive wings, I see why Viceland\ndidn't pay me to come here. [ Laughter ] I think that shit's\nstarting to kick in. This is\n$20 and some change! Tell me what you think\nabout the food. I ate\n$60 worth of wings. Tommy, I'm talking to you. Tommy. -It was only three of them. Shit's good,\nain't it, Tommy? I love the greens. These, whatever these are. Asparagus makes\nyour pee stink. Is that true,\nor is that just just a myth and we went with it? It has an acidic base about it\nand when it mixes with a certain chemical\ninside your body, it lets off a certain scent\nas you urinate. \u266a\u266a What you got\nright there? Zairilla: So we got right here\nmedicated crab legs. Come on with it. Now these crabs normally\na pound go for $275 a pound. -For real? -Yes, sir. When these crabs were alive,\nthey didn't even know this would be\ntheir future. These crabs didn't know\nthey would get shot up with weed and get... -Full of weed, man. ...eaten on Viceland. I don't know how\nto open crab legs. I should've watched\nmore Rick Ross videos and I would know exactly what\nthe fuck I'm doing right now. We got some --\nNow we've got some -- Is that crawfish?

For real. -$525. -This right here is $600? $525, you rounding. That was a big round up. -$500? -Very nice. Very tasty. $500 for a lobster tail. A small ass lobster tail,\nbut it got the dope in it. How much is in that? That one has\nabout 25 milligrams. Shorty,\nthis shit good, shorty. I feel myself\nbecoming different. -Can you feel it? -Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I ain't going to lie, I think\nI'm feeling a little something. Do you feel pressure to wear\nmultiple chains all the time? Shut your high ass up. 2 Chainz. I think chicken and waffles\nis overrated, over-hyped\ncombination of food. So is your heart rate\ngoing up, as well or is it just\nyou're talking crazy? The chicken is Alvin. The waffle is the Chipmunks. How long have you\nbeen smoking, Tommy? Over 50 years. Have you ever been eating\nchicken and then like, \"Yo, I wish I had\nsome waffles with this shit.\" You back on this waffles. What's going on? I never left. I'm a real player when\nit comes to eating delicacies. I remember back\nwhen my chicken wings was between 30 cents\nand 50 cents. Now they're 20 bucks. -You know lamb chops. Since '71. When the Northridge\nearthquake hit. -And I'm eating, getting big. -Sea bass, halibut. And then\nthe earthquake hit. What's your favorite\n2 Chainz song? 2 Chainz. I was in a urinal,\nI took a piss, some of my pee splashed up\nhit me on my lip. Ruined\nmy mother fucking day. [ Laughs ] Gave you pee breath. All right, look. [ Applauding ] Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you, guys. [ Cheers and applause ] Thank you. -Can I get a doggy bag? -Absolutely Yeah, we're about to\nget some take-home boxes. It's about that bacon. -Right on. -Bacon, bitch. -[ Laughs ] Thank you. Is it good marijuana? What up, what up. It's your player partner\n2 Chainz checking in and this is \"The Most\nExpensivest: High Roller. My boy, Adam, and my boy, John,\nwe're about to get into some real weed lingo\nand some real prices, y'all. Adam: All right, Chainz, we have\na few very special things for you to try, here. -All right, what you got man? I'm ready. Let's give this honey badger\na whirl. I want to show you\nhow this works. [ Roars ] John: It's got a ceramic tip\nas well as a bubbler. Its like a warm straw. It's essentially\na portable dab ring. Pretty cool. I think we should start\nwith the NBX King Louis, we've been waiting\nfor that. Now, what John is doing\nis he's actually mixing the King Louis\nconcentrate, it's sauce. All right, we're going to wait\nuntil that heats up and then you're going to hit\nthat nozzle. So what do I smoke,\nthe end right here? Yes, sir. As soon as\nI start touching, you're going to\nbreathe in, okay? There you go. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs lightly ] [ Coughing ] Pretty good,\nright there. \u266a\u266a Beautiful flavor profile. Nice and tasty. I'm gonna hit --\nI'm gonna hit it -- I'm --\nI'm gonna hit it -- Yeah. one more time. \u266a\u266a We've got to get it now,\nI like this. Welcome to the club,\nmate. All right. For real, how much\ndoes this stuff cost, man? So the honey badger itself\nis about $250 retail. The sauce itself roughly\nbetween $50 to $60. What makes it special\nis the high terpenes. They've probably got four\nor five different terpenes, like limonene,\nbeta-caryophyllene, myrcene. They're testing around\n13-15 milligrams per, as well as\nyour cannabinoids, so the cannabinoids,\nthe THC is testing probably around\nbetween 75-85%, so you're getting some really\namazing pure stuff there. Cool, so how much does\nsomething like this cost? [ Record scratches ] It's $250 retail. Should we try the buggy? This device here\nis our showpiece, though. Our friends over at Ziggy\nhave been kind enough to provide us this rig\nto be able to play with. Took 14 glassblowers\nseveral hundred hours of work. It's a $150,000 piece. They want\n$150,000 for that? -Yeah. -That's right. You think they would buy it\nand use it or just buy it and keep it\nas an art piece? Typically we wouldn't allow\nsomebody to smoke from this, but, obviously,\nthis is a special occasion. Let's load that up\nwith the King Louis and let's give him\nwhat he wants. Yes, sir. You're going to have to\nput something on that, man, you're going to have\nto put a real boog on that mother fucker\nfor me. -Yeah, I got you. -I've been smoking a long time. All right,\nlet me try this shit. Come on. \u266a\u266a Mm-hmm. \u266a\u266a [ Coughs ] What do you think of\nthe taste and flavorings? [ Smacking lips ] [ Coughs ]\nI like it. Excellent. That's what kind of\nmake this sauce so special. I think\nwe should also try, which one\ndo you want to try, Adam? [ Coughs ]\nOoh. [ Laughs ] -The Alien Bubba. -The Alien Bubba? All right,\nlet's do that one. [ Laughing ] [ Mumbles ]\nI like that flower. You like the flower? Yeah, all this shit\ngets you too geeked. He's too geek --\nIt's too geek -- It's \"2 geeked, 2 fast.\" We've got here a cannagar\nour friends provided for us. This thing's worth, roughly,\nretail side, $500-$600. It's 1,000 milligrams-plus. They're amazing. They made it especially\nfor you, my friend. What they've done is\nthey've ground up the flower, wrapped it\nin palm leaves, and then they dipped it in oil,\nthey've got kief in it. It's a super joint\nis what it is. Do you want to\nlight it up? Sure do. That was\ncustom made for you. It's not a for-sale product\nhere in this market yet. Mmm. So, it's, uh... So you're one of the first\nto have it. You could\nblow it out and... I know. It looks cool for TV. $500, man. This shit. \u266a\u266a \u266a\u266a I tell you what. To be able to experience this\nand get paid for it, I can't even lie this is\nlike what dreams are made of. Man, I'm going to be rapping\nlike a mother fucker tonight in the studio. Man, that's the vibe\nI was looking for. Know what I'm saying? It's that real vibe\nI was looking for. -Hey, 2 Chainz. -What up, man. How you doing? What's your name? -Good to meet you. Chris. I'm with Club M. \u266a\u266a I hear you've got a delivery\nservice or something like that. Yeah, we do\na monthly delivery service for a cannabis\nsubscription box. Marijuana, munchies, music,\nand merchandise. $200 worth of it\nevery month for 97 bucks anywhere in California\nand soon in Las Vegas. -How much marijuana? -A lot of marijuana. -Is it good marijuana? -Really good. -That's cool, man. -Thanks. So what made you come up\nwith that type of idea? I really, as a kid, loved to get the encyclopedia\ndelivered to my house, so I designed my box\nto kind of look like one. -That's some geek shit. -It is super geek. So, tell me more about\nthe box and everything. -This is a monthly box. -Are these pre-rolled? -These are all pre-rolls. -Let me try this out. This is all different\nkinds of flowers. Man. Topicals, vapes,\nconcentrates, waxes. I love the presentation and it don't look\nall hot in the mail and shit when it comes. It looks like\nsome encyclopedias. Oh that's where you get\nthe idea from you was\nencyclopedia boy. So what I displayed here\nis something special nobody's seen\nbut you yet. Okay. -This is our $24,000 box. -Why would it be $24,000? First, we've got\n24 1/8th worth of flower that are delivered\nwith it. -So three zips a month. -Then cannabis cigar set. Got cannabis leaf, I've got\ntobacco, and I've got gold leaf. Three months aged,\npressed, and with rosin and sap\nin it, as well. Then we've got 24 vape pens,\n24 edibles, 24 topicals\nand tinctures and then each one will\ncome with a custom... -Gold tip. -24-karat gold. 240 diamonds in it. You got to let me\nkeep this, man. This right here is\nsomething special, man. The other product that's part\nof the $24,000 box is this. It's our vape exhale. That's a $3,000 easy bake oven\nand a bubbler all put together. That looks too expensive. I don't want to be\nresponsible for that. On the plane\nthey might mess with it. We've got this vape pen\nwith the gold. This is nice. How do you use this? So this one will do\nvape oil or the flower. -Really? -Yeah. So we just open this one up\nand you grind the flower. I love this. I want you to see one\nmore thing before we go, here. This is my custom box that would\ncome with the $24,000 box. What kind of wood\nis that? So this is\na reclaimed wine barrel. That's dope. That's how I need to get one\nof my floors done, wine barrel. -Somebody locked it on me. -Did you lock it on me already? There it goes. So you open it up... -It's nice, bro.\n-...it's all gold inside. Got your flower all ready,\nloaded up. This stuff\nit'll keep you fresh. It's my box? Is this for me? -That's yours. You got a key\nand I keep it -- [Mumbles] Oh, man. -Look at this, though. This is everything. I appreciate you all man. You'll be able to roll\nyour own joints right here. Oh, a rolling tray man. Look. [ Angelic singing, stops ] [ Singing resumes, stops ]\nOkay. Now it's locked. Boom. -Boom. Boom. Okay. Boom. [ Singing resumes, stops ] You got it figured out? Oh, man,\nI love this, man. Thank you so much, man. [ Smooth jazz plays ] \u266a\u266a This is nice man. We're here with\nan innovator himself. This is next level\nin the cannabis industry. I'm happy\nto be a part of it. I'm happy to be\nreporting on it. I'm happy to be\na tester. Like I said, on this episode\nthere will be no stuntmen or no stunt doubles needed. I'll be here\nto try my own product. I love my job. I love waking up\ngoing to work every day, and so this is another\npart of going to work. Meeting people like you\nthat are so forward thinking. \u266a\u266a 2 Chainz. \u266a\u266a", "FTyY-sAxR-g": "CBD has become so popular that it's begun to rival its psychoactive sister THC you may know that CBD can't get you high but can using CBD make you fail a drug test find out on this episode of weed easy by the growth of drug tests that look for cannabis analyzed a urine sample and screen it for marijuana metabolites since CBD derives from the cannabis plant you might rightly wonder if I use CBD can it cause me to fail a drug test for cannabis on its own CBD actually cannot produce a positive result on a drug test for cannabis that's because drug tests that screen for cannabis are looking for just one cannabinoid and that's THC a or tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or the inactive form of THC click the letter I in the top-right corner of your screen to watch our episode on decarboxylation to learn how to HCA becomes THC and why that process is so important so if you only use CBD are you in the clear well it depends if you're using a high CBD strain of cannabis you'd likely think it's safe but this can sometimes cause you to fail a drug test many of these strains still contain high amounts of THC which will still set off alarm bells on a urine screen however if you're using hemp based CBD oils or pills these generally contain just trace amounts of THC at about 0.3% these products should not cause you to fail a drug test as long as you do not consume extremely high doses a false positive on a drug test can occur with doses of a thousand milligrams a day or more with CBD products though most people consume about 120 to 160 milligrams per day keep in mind that many CBD products are unregulated and therefore may contain cannabinoids that could get you into hot water for that reason we suggest sticking to CBD products that are lab tested and keeping your dosage at a recommended level while using CBD on its own cause a failed drug test no it won't but it's

screaming at the top of my lungs. Finally someone found me,\nthey went to the hospital, and they said, you have\nperiod cramps, take Advil. (ambient music) - Hi, my name is Sam, and I have PMDD, which stands for premenstrual\ndysphoric disorder. - I'm Laura, and I have endometriosis. - Biggest symptoms that I suffer from the most are mood swings. I can go from zero to\nblackout angry in a second. - Being in pain every day\nreally takes a toll on you. - The most powerful\nchange in public opinion in the past couple of years\nwhen it comes to cannabis has been children with seizures. Sadly, period pain is not\nthat obvious of a problem. It's something that women suffer from usually alone and quietly. - If there is a product out\nthere that can change that, then hell yeah I'm gonna try it. I'll try anything. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] Whoopi, you're on the floor. - Hey, thank you so much\nfor joining us today. First of all, we're just wondering what inspired you and Maya\nto create these products? - [Voiceover] My friend\nRick, who ran High Times, and he was telling me\nabout all of the people who had gotten into the marijuana space, and I said, is anybody doing\nanything in menstrual cramps? And he kinda went, (scoffs) no. And I went, really? He said, no, it's a niche market. It's a niche market that\nhas half the population. We're still doing this? It's kind of shocking. If a guy had these cramps,\nif a guy had this issue, there would be all kinds\nof shit out there for them. This was done in order to\nfind a way to relieve cramps, so please try it, and if it\nworks for you, tell a friend. If it doesn't work for you, not to worry, we'll continue to try to\ncreate something that may. (upbeat music) - So I'm about to start using\nthe Whoopi and Maya products. I'm not looking to get high, just looking for some sweet relief. It's not doing anything yet. Still feel like my uterus\nis trying to murder me. I only truly wish that\nyou could smell this through the camera, because\nthe smell is so good. So I've had it on for a while now, and it feels amazing. It's hard to explain,\nit's like this warm heat all over my abdomen, which of\ncourse, when you have cramps is all you can hope for\nis a built-in heating pad. - Day two of using the products. I took a tablespoon of the chocolate, and was PMSing pretty bad,\nand I went clothes shopping. On days where I usually just\nwant to sit on my couch, eat ice cream and watch Titanic while I sob silently into a\npillow, I bought crop tops. That feels like a victory to me. - I just finished the bath. Truly it was an amazing experience. All the bloated feeling and the pain just kind of melted away. It makes you hella comfortable,\nwhich is pretty much all you can ask for when you\nhave a really bad period. - I use the Tincture today, just did a couple drops in my coffee. Today was a little rough,\nI had one kind of outburst, but again, only one\noutburst, compared to what I can usually do, is pretty solid for me. These products allowed me to exist clearly while helping me maintain\nemotions that I do want to feel. - If you have endometriosis and you're struggling\nlike I am every month, I would absolutely\nrecommend that you try this. I think many women would\nagree that they're willing to try almost anything\nto get the pain away. - [Voiceover] People\nbelieve that you're gonna scratch 'em up because you have PMS, why don't you believe\nthat I'm also in pain? (ambient music)", "4GvVqB0_OAE": "so the biggest difference between the two plants obviously they look very similar the leaf structure is basically the same the biggest difference is going to be the amount of THC that's going to be in the plant basically that's the regulated the regulated chemical and these plants are going to be producing under 0.3% which is negligible in terms of how it affects your body so that's gonna be the biggest difference this is gonna grow typically about you know five to ten feet depending on when planting time is this variety here is going to produce more of a big flower variety it's gonna produce more oil typically you're gonna have two different varieties one is gonna be producing more more fiber fibrous hemp one's gonna be producing more oil typically the the fibrous plants will be growing tall skinny plants more of an industrial look whereas these will grow more bushy style and you'll see that the big flowers that you're typically used to seeing as the plant matures it starts to produce more and more cannabinoids as it gets older and older as it flowers so it'll start to raise all the percentages of all the camera' noids in the plant so you really want to keep an eye on those cannabinoid percentages so that you don't go over that point three that's regulated by the state and it can happen pretty quick you know you want to be testing at least weekly to make sure that you're not going to be going over those levels because it can happen in a matter of a few days once harvested basically we're gonna treat this plant like like medicine it'll be it'll be harvested with extreme care by hand it'll be maintained in a drying facility it'll be processed down into an oil that can be used in products lotions you can eat it you'll be able to put it in many different products so you'll be able to see the oil all over the place", "5MXhjRljHKg": "hi everyone my name is Lauren Gao and this is life above the clouds and today I am going to show you another great method of making a cannabis infusion you can use this with olive oil which is what I'm going to do today but you can also use coconut oil or butter right now I have a piece of cheesecloth here that's folded in half so you make sure that it's double layered and I also have a little strip that I've cut off already and here is half a gram of decarboxylated cannabis so I have my cannabis in the middle of my cheesecloth and I'm just gonna fold it up like a little present so make sure that it overlap and this little packet so I'm just gonna take my little packet and tie it up with my piece of cheesecloth I'm just gonna stick it in to my jar and I'm gonna fill it up with oil give it a little shake make sure it seals and here I have a pot of water it's not quite boiling yet we want it to be at 200 to 225 degrees so I'm just gonna carefully placed it in clear you also don't want your jar to be touching the bottom of your pan or your pot if you have another lid from another jar you can place it underneath there you can place a dish towel underneath there I actually have this really great metal basket that came with my pots and I have the water about halfway just one enough cover the level of oil in your car so we let this go for two hours I pulled it out and let it cool down and now it is time to unseal this we're just going to fish out our little packet squeeze out all the oil we can see this is about as much as we can get out of this guy and there you have it you're finished oil so you can use this oil by itself like you would any olive oil you can use it to cook with in your pan you can use it to make salad dressings or you can use it to bake with which is the first my favorite thing to do if you liked this video be sure to give it a thumbs up

today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide for you guys we have extraction guides we have distillation guides we have a hemp curing guide go to our website you'll see that there's a lot of products there for you to really look at when you get to the point where you need help with formulations give us a call alright this is dr john thompson for extract lab thanks a lot and take care you", "unvgJDMZ7kU": "dookey I couldn't be more excited man so we're gonna do some dry rub or toss like a dry seasoning or the chicken wings when it comes out we're gonna add some what are gonna happen to it oh I really like all this keep to that pineapple one of the best hands down okay so we have the black peppercorns that we just kind of ground-up mortar and pestle shrimp powder so this is for like umami that Korean add chili pepper powders for the little bit of spice right how much keep do you think we're doing you I think it's gonna be activated really that much I would just do you know like a good pinch like you would a normal spices all right we're gonna add a little bit of this pineapple Keith Keith has an interesting history right it's one of the oldest extraction methods just agitation and screens people recently have really been kind of elevating it to a new level before it used to have a lot of plant matter and it was kind of a less clean product but now people are getting it to the point where it's like 99% of just the gland heads which is like what you want in a concentrate this is the coconut sugar with the THC and I think we should toss the chicken in that to just be fun so you get this nice like almost our Encana hue from here we put equal parts salt the wings right when it comes out of the oil instead of hitting with just regular salt we're gonna hit it with this thanks the first time they've ever been fried chicken wings tossed and Keith is it good we could have more of that beef flavor how do we impart more that we could just like grate it in let's do it let's try the og I think it's good to put some California in there Alex beautiful yeah who's the guy this is your weapon and what is gonna be breaded in there this is gonna be for the fried chicken little baking powder cornstarch and some flour I have some cold water to it it should feel like watered-down Elmer's glue that is soju Rebecca some sort of alcohol where's my shot it's just a light light coating okay Mustard's so you see a little bit of that thank you yeah you can fry late for it it's me when do you want me to pull down it's not take like eight ten minutes hit me hit me now well we're not working sink [Music] and really smell that week I chicken and stuff oh my god awesome nailed it these are the fresh cannabis leaves rush these Oh so I figured we'd fry them yeah well do the same preparation as the chicken little bit of cornstarch a little bit about I think oh wow that looks fun deep-fried pot leaves that's a crazy thing let's do it little tester okay I'll come in on the deck just smells so good it's like pretty like solid oh yeah we gotta get you stoned Dookie then you'll finally see all these like new dimension firing thing in front of us you get the most inspiration when you're stoned apparently yeah [Music]", "pW66iiVNJtY": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I wanted to talk to you guys about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I

dough and I like to make sure that there's not too many M&Ms next to each other so if it is what I would do is I would take it out like here it's 1 2 3 it kind of close together so what we want to do is just take this one out this green one out and I'm gonna put it closer on this side I spread it away from these here but open here so like once it baked then we'll all be right next to each other so you don't have to do that but I just like to do that like I make sure that they aren't that close to each other [Music] all right now I'm gonna put this in the oven for about 10 minutes as far as the temperature I'm gonna put it on like 320 so let's get into it [Music] [Music] all right so we've been about 15 minutes so now you just want to take all right so now I'm some of it my cookies cool on

show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't forget to check me out on instagram at the NJ chef don't forget to

of wanted to make this video I'm going to be doing an eyebrow tutorial not really like a tutorial like I am NOT a new guru I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing kind of like an eyebrow tutorial slash edible review slash me just [ __ ] around so I am getting ready because my brother is performing down on sunset today and I have to get ready because I'm going to go and support him Josje oh sure my eyebrows or something that's like really important to me like in high school if I didn't wear makeup at all I at least had my eyebrows build it that's the most important thing your eyebrows shape your face like there I just can't stress enough they're just one of the most important things as far as your makeup routine so I am going to be reviewing I have some kiddo candied pineapple flavored sativa gummies I have never ever tried this before so that's kind of why I decided to make a video on this because since I haven't tried them before I 150 percent honest opinion on them as far as flavor goes as far as experience and all these things I really personally I have a pretty high tolerance for someone my size and weight normally I consume around like 20 to 30 milligrams depending on the edible I know some people take like 1,500 I'm not rich for myself I'm just trying to enjoy myself I just want to live up to my eyebrows how is that not something that everyone so I got these per recommendation of my pleasure I was like I need medical it taste it and that's going to be infected a hundred milligrams of THC and the entire thing each piece is 10 milligrams there's 10 pieces so [Applause] okay we're just gonna pour some my hand and see how that goes okay Oh baby we're gonna go for four is a good number I'll try to pull myself we're gonna messed up a little bit by getting pineapple I don't know why it's available in our shower they're pretty sweet they taste good don't get me wrong but I just don't think I that was it for me [Music] - now they don't taste like wheat okay don't get it twisted it tastes really really good just makes me when structures eat one two three dummies okay guys so I'm going to tie myself 45 minute they not 45 minutes I'm going to be doing my foundation I'm going to do contouring pretty much going to be doing everything besides my eyebrows a little buster [Music] so I went to the and they found I found cotton candy this is honestly the best thing that could happen I started getting hired like 2025 minutes and it has only been significantly up from there I'm supposed to be doing the eyebrow that's right I decided to sit down for this because when I was getting super high I was just like enough this sucks why not set make things easier for myself so I have this product it [Music] my bread my powder Brett brow powder duo who's just so hard to say I've used this quite a few times ladies this little end it's like a as you can contrast I forgot it has an angled edge chicken the spoolie side so [Music] okay there see where the angle is handy now [Music] I'm so into this eyebrow right now it just goes to show how good the eyes I mean so just happy and like just having a good time I hate pizza right before the comic and and oh my god it only took me like 10 minutes to my favorite so evident the good thing about like doing your eyebrows is you can just like go back in there as long as you have please blend it out later so don't be afraid to say this is so sad immediately is dark the very bargain it's okay hope you find one we'll see what happens with this one okay let's get it [Music] - like I'm Kris [Music] maybe the tail is essential Oh [Music] okay so now this is also a very crucial step you have to outline your eyebrows with like get this [ __ ] together I promise that's a huge issue me out there she's gonna have faith in the process okay [Music] my [Music] so we're going in on the top crusty dusty trusty PT blender this is honestly a really important step because it just changes everything it makes it look so much more [Music] [Music] it really is just like life-changing just like it's a whole different I really like this really wise [Music] [Music] so the answer was bullet that's all see the continued struggle so I want [Music] it has work point to me and I see supposedly they're made with all-natural ingredients they definitely tastes like pineapple there since me and they were so light but I expected them to a little bit more sour just because for some reason I know I thought there were sour gummy is a sentiments so they're made with agar locust bean gelatin glucose cane sugar closed strings citric acid capsule and not just it contains you know food allergies whatsoever however are not vegan they don't stay organic they're definitely not kosher but they need all the requirements like their lot tested free of metals [Music] Oh two hours later everywhere yeah I think this is better than I know that there's CVT in years [Music] one of the best combinations you can do and I can I [Music] really like they see this on the party [Music] [Music] [Music] wait huh is purple [Music] this is like a cute I hope you enjoy this video as much as if you know did I enjoy it

okay so i wanted to go over this article i saw this this morning i flagged this i was like we're definitely gonna cover this i know we have a lot of viewers that are from texas i know there's a lot of cannabis enthusiasts cannabis lovers people that want to see cannabis legalized in texas and so you know big shouts out to texas big shouts out to you know everywhere but you know uh the people in texas definitely want legalization uh just like in every state but a lot of people there anyways though i wanted to go over this dallas news article this is by written by alex braceno this is december 29 2020 this is published at 5 30 a.m i always like to [Music] you know i get you know typically whenever you look at local news um whether it's an article or video coming out of you know local media in whatever area you're looking at typically news comes a lot quicker earlier also i think you get some unique insights that you know national news maybe would give but let's go over this article we'll talk some more about it as well but yeah so it's by alex percino title is high aspirations marijuana bills look to push texas towards decriminalization and potentially legalization in 2021 with the legalization of hemp in 2019 will the lone star state take another step towards legalizing recreational marijuana in 2021 okay so with the start of the 87th texas legislative session less than a month away 20 marijuana bills have been filed as several lawmakers look to take the next step towards legalization in the lone star state right and these are just the updates on you know they're just kind of giving context of how many states have legalized that you know if you've you watched my channel enough i think you are aware of that but we had four states legalized recreational this past election and we had one medical we're probably gonna have a few three or four maybe five even in 2021 we'll have to see maybe texas is one of them who knows um but there's obviously you know in general i'll tell you right now and we can get more details on this article but texas right now is not the best chance of it passing you know in 2021 maybe some of these bills will but there's 20 bills there's a lot of bills there's a lot of potential for good things to happen so to see but here this is what they say here so while legalization for recreational use could be a long shot for texas at least in 2021 there are several bills that could inch the state closer to the goals of wheat advocates here's a look at some of the marijuana bills already filed heading into the holidays so decriminalization so on the second day of the filing period representative aaron zweiner uh sorry for mispronounced that filed hb 441 which could decriminalize the possession of marijuana for personal use resulting in a citation rather than an arrest and i think right off the bat that'd be awesome you know let's get these let's get our people out of jail for small amounts of cannabis it's a plant it's really you know ridiculous right we don't have to go too deep into that um so our current cannabis laws don't make sense weiner said in a press release we're leaving dollars on the table wasting public safety funds on enforcement and saddling texans with unnecessary criminal records that harm their ability to find work and housing couldn't said it better myself it's time to bring our cannabis laws into the 21st century and i'm eager to work on reducing penalties for the possession of cannabis so zweiner's bill is a follow-up to representative joe moody's 2019 effort with h.b 63 that passed through the house before dying in the senate so decriminalizing marijuana has been a hot topic in texas and it's a hot topic really everywhere because you know fact is there should not be people in jail for small amounts of cannabis or cannabis really at all so has been a hot topic in texas especially after governor greg abbott signed house bill 1325 into law in june of 2019 the law authorized the production manufacture retail sale and inspection of industrial hemp crops and products in the state the problem deciphering the difference between marijuana and hemp right so this is a big thing that i've talked about in a lot of different videos but there's this kind of in the south where a lot of the states where cannabis is not recreationally legal or it's not maybe not medically legal but there is kind of this loophole where hemp is allowed and a lot of times the hemp does have higher thc percentages potentially or has a different you know uh you know it could be thc there's there's a lot of different you know loopholes honestly um some have been closed up in some states some haven't but right here so while both hemp and marijuana derive from the same source the law defines hemp as cannabis containing less than 0.3 thc the psychoactive component found in the plant which can be purchased legally marijuana is above zero zero point three percent thc and it's still illegal but as prosecutors pointed out they do not have the time nor the resources to differentiate the two that's kind of been the huge problem right and we've seen cases and i've done a video way back when i can't remember exactly when but there was a there's a case where a sheriff destroyed estimated wise they destroyed about a billion dollars worth of hemp because they misread something they thought it was above the percentage which it wasn't and the farmer is literally the the company that uh that had that hemp that billion dollar hemp farm it could be a little bit inflated but it was around a billion dollars they said is suing the sheriff i don't know how that turned out um but would not want to be that sheriff okay okay so expanding medical use let's get to the second part okay so the texas compassionate use act as signed in 2015 legalized cbd oil containing less than 0.5 percent thc for people with epilepsy that was expanded to include people with multiple sclerosis uh incurable neurodegenerative diseases als terminal cancer autism after abbott signed hb 3703 in 2019. now lawmakers have returned with several other bills looking to expand medical use in texas once again sb90 as sponsored by senator jose menendez which i've covered this specific bill this is a pretty exciting one but uh a democrat from san antonio would expand the medical marijuana program to include people with ptsd shout out to all of my veterans i know we have some veterans uh watching i just want to say obviously thank you for your guys service and you know it's it's it's really disgusting that you guys don't have access to uh some of you may not have access to medical marijuana um or you know and that definitely be the case in texas i know i've talked to individuals that watch the show that are veterans living in texas that don't have access right and that's pretty gross to me because let's not give you know let's stop giving either athletes veterans really you know anybody like let's stop giving them these disgusting uh you know absolutely um potentially life-destroying uh you know pharmaceutical drugs right let's give them natural medicine that is much less harmful than let's say oxycontin or something like that right okay so representative ron reynolds a democrat from missouri city filed house bill 94 which mirrors sb 90 and brings the language to the lower chamber okay so sp 90 expanding the medical cannabis program provides protections for those who use medical cannabis especially our veterans with ptsd and then sp91 enforcing coverage of post-traumatic stress disorder and health insurance similar to other mental illnesses so kind of a little bit of a little bit of a package deal from the two but um absolutely i hope those can get done you know who knows but um those those need to be done because you know we need to make sure that our veterans are able to access that and and have health insurance covered as well so sweeping legalization bills so state senate roland gutierrez democrat from san antonio representative moody and el paso democrat are leading to the charge for legalization in 2021 with the two most ambitious marijuana bills sb140 and hb447 sb 140 sponsored by gutierrez and hb447 sponsored by moody would legalize the possession of cannabis for people over the age of 21 in amounts of up to two and a half ounces or 15 grams of concentrate these bills would also allow people to own as many as a dozen marijuana plants and implement the regulation and taxation of recreational marijuana use wow so two and a half ounces that's usually that's a little bit higher than typica than most states usually it's one ounce actually i don't know about possession i have no purchase limits is usually one ounce so i could be off on that um and i i remember i reported on this a while back too as well and this is that this is insane and this is just another incentive for us to you know for the state of texas to do this but as reported by the texas tribune i went over that specific article for the text tribune shout out to them uh gutierrez and moody believe that the legalization and taxation of marijuana would play a role in addressing the the gaping 4.6 billion dollar hole in the state budget right and i hope they left it out here so also they're you know they're potentially thinking that you know once you have full recreational cannabis there could be anywhere from 25 30 000 jobs to 50 000 jobs okay they didn't say this in this article but um that's also a a huge benefit right um so bringing in a ton of new jobs economic stimulus and the time that's needed um and you know overall this would just be great you know so you know there's a lot of different levels typically just like legalization just you know just like legalization on a federal level state you know there's different levels to it right um and just like you know in texas you know they're coming at this from a lot of different angles they're trying to do there's 20 different bills like we said um and they're all hopefully some of them squeak by chances are maybe not the best um i hope that's not the i hope that that changes you know like i said you know encirclement is a great way to force states to legalize like so let's say new mexico legalizes um cannabis recreationally let's say that let's say let's say that happens to 201. uh mexico right i'm going to be talking about that either tonight or tomorrow but mexico is going to be the biggest country in the world to have federally legalized cannabis hopefully very soon they've been putting it off for a while but if you have mexico legalizing cannabis and then let's say you have oklahoma go from because they're medical right now they have a massive medical industry in oklahoma let's say they go over to recreational right so now you're having you're starting to see texas get surrounded by states that could be potentially recreational in this the you know in this theoretical um uh potential that could happen right um and then you know louisiana i don't know how soon that will happen that's probably like the least likely but point being is if you surround a state with states that have recreational cannabis that is going to really put a lot of pressure on the policy makers because there's going to be a lot of people especially people living on the borders going to be just going right over the state state lines going over buying recreational cannabis buying their cannabis coming back in right so one it technically is obstructing the laws in the state but you know that's not how are you going to reinforce there's going to be tons of people doing it so that's not really the main point though is that local money from the local economy is going to start to be extracted it's going to be start to go into another state and just in general just baseline economics you never want that you never want to have uh local money leaving the local economy okay all right and and there's so many states there's countries too even but there's there's states in the united states there's there almost all this a lot of the states have terrible budget problems right now um you know pennsylvania they've got a massive i think it's like 3.5 billion a lot of states have massive uh budget holes right now and this could be a way to help supplement and help fill part of that in i'm not saying it's going to fix it all with all the economic problems that's definitely i don't want to say that but it can start to do a lot of it can start to make a lot of uh a lot of headway um and it's something that is there right it's not some like this is an industry that we could tap into and it's there it's ready to go and you know for them the the pros completely outweigh the cons by far by far um but yeah so so quote as we've seen a number of states engaging around the country in a retail market this is no longer an experiment moody told the texas tribune it is also no secret that we are heading into some rough economic waters and we need to explore every possible revenue stream so it also no secret that opposition is already lining up against these bills while complete legalization for recreational use may not appear to be within reaching distance for 2021 texas hasn't exactly been stagnant on this issue between the legalization of hemp and marijuana for medical use as limited as it is progress has been made recently now it's just a matter it's just a matter of waiting to see if marijuana abacus can take another step towards legalization in 2021. hopefully they can make some headway in 2021 and then hopefully 2022 voter initiative that would be you know ideal right um you know who knows though we'll have to see i just want to say shout out to everyone at texas there's so many people you know shout out to my my best friend my brother zenzo just had a baby um he's down in houston um miss you by the way brother um but shout out to everyone down in texas shout out to my veterans you guys deserve cannabis you guys deserve um you know this medicine that can help deal with all sorts of problems rather than these harmful pharmaceuticals

in my name's jack i do all types of edibles infusions and tons of other fun content on this channel so be sure to subscribe and check it out and see what's good today i'm answering a question i have gotten a lot how to calculate edible dosage let's dive into it and i assure you my buds it is very simple to figure out you're just going to need a couple pieces of information off the jump how much flour are you using in today's example we're going to be using a half ounce of flour and what is the strength of that flour what's the thc percentage see i'm fortunate i'm just going to read it off the back of here and it gives it to me 23.19 and if you don't know this but maybe you know the strain just going leafly or something look it up find you know the average percentage for that strain and you'll be good to go now that we're doing our example here so i'm doing a half ounce so that's 14 grams no matter the amount of grams you're using you're gonna times it by a thousand because there's a thousand milligrams in every gram so 14 times a thousand equals fourteen thousand five times a thousand equals five thousand and a simple way to remember this kind of bringing me back to grade school here just add three zeros to it so you're using ten grams add three zeros you got ten thousand so today we have fourteen thousand milligrams now i look at the back of this gelato pie here at the 23 percent so i take this 14 000 milligrams times 0.23 equals 3 220 milligrams that is our total thc in this half ounce that will be in our infusion not accounting for burn off or anything we'll get to that in a moment so we have 3 220 milligrams here and we're gonna be infusing this half ounce into one cup of coconut oil i like making my stuff extra strong so we have our infusion let's say it has this full amount we have a cup of coconut oil that has now been infused with three thousand two hundred and twenty milligrams so your recipe calls maybe you're making some no-bake granola bars you're making some cookies or something either way your recipe calls for a quarter cup simply take that three thousand two hundred and twenty divide by four and you're left with 805 milligrams so in that batch let's just say of cookies you're going to have 805 milligrams now let's say you made 10 cookies 805 divided by 10 equals 80 milligrams per cookie there it's really simple about like that and you're good to go now i don't even know why i've been putting off this video just i wrote it down a couple times and i forgot to be honest with you i got a question recently that kind of sparked it in my mind now you might be saying in some of my other videos actually most of my videos i get a lot of trim and shake that's like mixed together from friends that friends give me all this and i don't know the thc percentage so i can't calculate it at all so what do i do i use the t check ii potency tester this thing has been a lifesaver for me while the math you know can give you a pretty basic answer and it's great to know especially you know if you don't have a t check or you can't afford it or whatever it's good to have that math on the back end but like i said i'm using trim and shake i don't know the percentage so when i'm giving people stuff if i didn't have this to test it i would be even more like be careful i'm like be careful when people are taking edibles anyway start slow but this thing has helped me a lot now i'd mentioned something burn off earlier this can happen so there's a potential for some of the thc to burn off when you're decarbing your bud decarboxylation is the process of activating your thc so you're left with an active product you can also do a passive infusion as well but you know you could still have some burn off there so let's say we're doing what i do in most of mine which i decarb so there might be a little burn off there then you put it in your crock pot stove or whatever there might be a little more burn off during the infusion i love using the levo too i doubt there's really any burn off there and then depending how you're making it so say you are making cookies and you're baking them at a certain temperature there is going to be some thc burn off there so that total number of the 80 what did i say 80.5 milligrams per cookie probably won't be that high it'll probably go down a little bit because there will be some burn off now if you made the no bake balls you know that doesn't require going in the oven it might be a little higher these are just little things i wanted to bring up in terms of finding the percentage but it's just a really good baseline to find it like that just total grams times a thousand to get the milligrams times thc percentage and you're good it's worth knowing if you're making your own edibles and it's definitely worth checking out the t-check too as well i'll put that below this thing also text uh test alcohol tinctures it tests olive oil coconut oil butter it even has a flour expansion kit where you can test your flour so maybe if you didn't even know the strain you could test the flour and do it that way but you might as well just test the infusion too so that's that my friends you're having a good day drop a question if you have a question because i'm always curious welcome to the true buds family if it's your first time and if you're already part of the fan you know i love you guys so i'll see you on the next one let's burn one down and uh have a good rest of our day night morning wherever you may live i hope you're doing well and i hope things are going great and i hope this

I'm going to teach you how to make a very simple cannabis tincture. So I'm gonna move my camera down below so that you can see everything that you'll need, and I'll walk you through the process. All right. So to make a tincture, the first thing that you're gonna need\nobviously is cannabis. I keep my cannabis in a glass mason jar because it keeps it fresh. I am going to weigh out 14\ngrams of cannabis on my scale. The reason is is that I decarb my cannabis in this awesome machine. I'm gonna talk about it in a second, and that machine only takes 14 grams. If you're gonna do your\ndecarbing in the oven, you can decarb as much as you want. I have 14 grams here. Decarbing is the process\nof taking the cannabis and heating it up to a certain temperature so that the molecules THC-A and CBD-A, if you have CBD in your\nplant, turn into THC and CDB. So they need to be activated or heated up in order to turn into the\ncompounds that we're looking for. And like I said, I do this in this handy\nlittle machine which I love, and if you make lots\nof cannabis creations, I definitely suggest\nthat you get one as well. It's called a Nova, and\nit's by the company Ardent which is woman-run company which I love. And all you do is you\nput in up to 14 grams and literally hit this\nbutton, and it turns red. In about an hour and a\nhalf, it'll turn green and I'll know that my\ncannabis is decarbed. The number one reason why I bought this is that if you decide\nto decarb in the oven which is a very simply process as well, you just keep your\ncannabis in your glass jar, take the label off, put it in the oven at about 240 degrees\nFahrenheit for 40 minutes, and when it comes out it'll be\na little bit dry and crispy. Again, we do this to activate it, so you must do this\nbefore you make a tincture or basically any edible. When you decarb in the oven, you can lose up to 30% of the compounds, and you don't wanna do that\n'cause cannabis is expensive. So this little machine pays for itself really quickly if you\nmake lots of infusions. The thing you're gonna do next is grind up your decarbed cannabis, so this is some stuff that I did earlier, and it's dry and crispy, and\nit smells a little bit toasty, and you're gonna grind it up. I bought a coffee grinder\njust for this purpose. You don't have to do that, you can just cut it up\nwith scissors if you want. You're not looking to have it pulverized, you're just looking to\nbreak up the surface area so that the alcohol can strip off more of those precious\ngoodies that we want. So this one that we have\nis called Zombie Kush. I always recommend\nreally labeling your jars with as much information as you can. How much cannabis you put in there, how much alcohol you put in there, what kind of alcohol you put in there. Fill that green piece of tape up with everything that you\ncan, it's easy to forget. So this one I am going to do in vodka. You have lots of options, you can basically use any clear alcohol. If you're in the states, they tell you to use Everclear\nwhich is really high alcohol, really high proof alcohol. And we don't have access\nto that here in Canada, but I'm gonna post a link\ndown below for anybody who has a medical prescription. There is a way, at least in\nOntario, to write to the LCBO and tell that that you would\nlike higher-proof alcohol to do your tinctures with, and then you can go ahead\nand buy that at the LCBO. So I've got my alcohol in\nhere and my decarbed cannabis. You're gonna shake it a lot, and you put this little\npuppy in your cupboard and let it sit there for a long\ntime, the longer the better. You can see that I have\nquite a bit of liquid in here for how much cannabis I have. I maybe shouldn't have poured\nin a half a cut right away. I should've checked it. The thing with making your own creations is that you never really have\na great idea what's in it, so you always have to\ntest the product anyway, you start low and go slow\neven with your own products. But if you want a more potent tincture, put in less alcohol so that there's more cannabis and less alcohol. And yeah, you let this\nsit in your cupboard. Some people leave it a week,\nsome people leave it month. Some people leave it a year, it just gets more potent\nup to a certain point the longer you leave it. And you can add in more cannabis\nas you get it if you like. You can make this a\nreally dynamic process. So the other trick that lots\nof people don't know about and I love telling them about is that if you use a\nvaporizer to user your canna-- To smoke, instead of smoking cannabis, I ask that save all the stuff that you... All your kind of spent\nremains that are in here, save them because even though\nyou've already used them when you used it in the vaporizer, this stuff is still potent. It's not as potent as fresh cannabis, but it still packs a wallop. So this is called ABV oil which stands for already been vaped. Sorry, it's not oil, I'm gonna make a\ntincture, an ABV tincture. And you can see I didn't measure this, so I am literally just\ngonna pour this on top. This one is moonshine which had a pretty high alcohol\ncontent, but it tastes awful. So I'm just trying to use up\nthe rest of it to be honest. Yeah, so that's not enough, so I'm gonna add in some vodka here. It's just a tincture however it works out. Basically, what you're trying\nto do is to get the good stuff off the cannabis and into the alcohol. So again, you shake the\nheck out of your tincture, and then you're gonna\nstore this in the cupboard. So this is called a cupboard tincture. There's a bunch of other\nways to do the tinctures, but this is called the cupboard tincture. When you are ready, and you can test this every couple of days or every week by just\ntaking a little spoon of it, and putting it in some\njuice, and drinking it. You should notice the\neffects if you drink it, let's say within 20 minutes\nup to an hour and a half. I know that's a really big range, but gosh, cannabis is hard\nto really narrow down. So once it's at the\nright strength for you, all you do is you take a strainer and put some cheese cloth in it, and you pour this\nconcoction into the strainer and let it drain into a jar. And then you have a\ntincture that you can just-- You can take it in a little,\nsmall tincture bottle with you, it's really discreet, you\ncan drop it into beverages. Some people can handle it\nunderneath their tongue, I cannot. Yeah, so it's a really great way to ingest cannabis without smoking it. The other things that\nyou can do with tinctures is you can turn them into gummies. That's how people make cannabis gummies is they use a tincture base. You can boil off some of the alcohol when you're done making the tincture so that it's like a\nreally thick goo almost. You can infuse that into honey, so just to melt it into some honey. And you can use that and just\nswish it around in your mouth so that you get the benefits\nof how quickly it'll go into your system in your mouth, but you don't have to\nhow terrible it tastes with the alcohol, the honey\nreally helps with that. So starting with a really\nbasic cupboard tincture can be a really fun,\neasy way to get into it. If you have any questions,\nplease let me know. I'm gonna link to all the instructions for you to do this down below, so don't worry, you don't\nhave to write anything down which maybe I should've\nabout before but whatever. I do hope that you enjoyed it. If you did, please give\nme a thumbs up on YouTube and write me a comment, it helps, so that other people can find me.

Campos thank you so much for being here thank you thanks for watching if you liked this be sure to subscribe here and you can check out more your morning videos right here", "y-UlV_CJ-NA": "i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little [Music] hey and i know you guys are like sick and tired of me disappearing for months on end i legit have been gone for a month even after i said i was going to start recording again i've just ultimately realized like at least for me and my life and my health i i just have to do things when i want to do them and i've learned that in my relationships my friendships like you got to let people go when you want to not when it's good for them and put out good things you know when you have the energy to do so so i am finally feeling like i have the energy to record again and i figured why not give you guys something fun obviously this video is going to be about me trying edibles for the very first time but backstory i have never smoked before i've never smoked i've never legit done any drug ever like nothing ever every time i mentioned to somebody that i haven't smoked before they're like why like i'm 26 years old never smoked before you know nugs not drugs kids nugs not drugs i've always been interested in trying edibles or um shrooms weird enough i actually just watched a documentary i think called psychedelic on netflix i'm not sure what the documentary is called but i have just always been interested and i guess an easier high where you can just eat something and experience it i genuinely think this is probably going to be the first and last time but i mean who knows like sorry mom i know you're probably watching this it's so funny because everybody including my mom including my dad literally everybody i know has smoked before everybody has done something before i literally have done nothing so i figured why not make my first experience memorable and share it with you guys so the big sour patch kids are the highest milligram that i got it's 150 milligrams i don't even know how milligrams work i don't even know like how much wheat is what i remember getting weed for a guy that i know a couple years ago and literally i got it wrong and he ended up like losing money i guess because i got the wrong amount and i was like i don't know how this works like i legit have never done drugs so yeah this is 150 milligrams whatever that means thing that i got was the red velvet chips ahoy honestly this i got just because i was like this sounds delicious like i've never tried red velvet chips ahoy and they're soft and i was like oh like it's gonna be good so i got that that's 175 milligrams last thing that i got were hot cheetos and these are 75 milligrams two um again i don't know how much milligram is what i just know that i was like i'm gonna get the things that i would actually eat this ain't going lowest the highest but he said cookies then cheetos then the gummies um and he said you're a virgin my [ __ ] is rockin um and then he said don't eat all of anything and then he said i'd love to come check on you he actually asked me about a boyfriend i spent 60 dollars um i can put the prices of each thing up on the screen like right here um but it wasn't crazy expensive been around wheat my whole life i just have chose not to um so i know what weed smells like wow okay yeah the gummies definitely have the highest amount [Music] okay i'm hoping somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour something happens i don't even know what high feels like so i don't know if i'm even gonna notice but we'll see so i'm doing this much one cookie oh i'm gonna do two cookies so i guess two cookies i mean i definitely i definitely think if these were on the counter i wouldn't notice that there was wheat in it i mean it's definitely like it tastes like a cookie i'm kind of like noticed doing this much of the other cookie all right i'm cozy guys i'm over here thinking i'm like my mom's probably gonna be more mad about me eating on her couch than she is about me doing drugs all right hot cheetos i really just want to taste these i'm really not gonna eat a lot of these i think that much don't feel like that's enough what if i end up like i didn't take enough and then like i don't even notice y'all i don't taste it at all but these are good like i honestly haven't had hot cheetos in a minute because i don't really eat chips like that like when i eventually do want chips i do end up getting hot cheetos but i really don't eat chips like that so these just taste good i don't think maybe because they're hot you taste it a lot less had you not told me not to eat all of these i probably would have eaten the entire bag of these hot cheetos okay [Music] i haven't had hot cheetos in a minute y'all these are good and lastly the big sour patch kids i think i'm gonna do three he said don't eat all of anything but he said i could have a few so i'm thinking three they're like this size you see that they're like this size this tastes good they don't have a wee taste at all honestly i don't feel like any of these really have wheat taste like i know it's in here so i'm looking for it but i legit feel like if you just said it on the counter you would not like pay attention to it guys this is going to be so good just for the simple fact that i don't eat things like this like i really don't eat candy like that i really don't eat chips like that i really like you know my weight gain my weight eating came from food honey i'm like one of those people that be like oh i want a midnight snack but i want some ribs it won't be no like simple snack all right last one yo this one looks like two in one this last sour patch so i did three sour patch about a little palm full of hot cheetos and two cookies so i'm gonna check back with you guys i'm also actually video chat my friend so hopefully it doesn't get again when i'm on my conversation but we're gonna see so wish me luck i'm gonna see you guys in a minute so it has been 30 minutes so right now it is 206 i took the edibles whatever at 1 35 so we're 30 minutes in and i don't feel anything the one thing though that my best friend i actually told my best friend i was doing this video right before nicki if you're watching this hello she just um messaged me on instagram and she was like girl don't take more like less is more so we're 30 minutes in i'm just going to check back in an hour i've literally just been on i was let's say facetime but i'm in i'm team android right now so um yeah on video chat right now so um i've just been checking in but we'll see in 30 more minutes so at 2 35 we'll see if i feel anything um and then again at what's after 2 35 305 we'll check again um but yeah so i'm just going to keep checking in with you guys every 30 minutes and see if i feel higher um i don't know if it's gonna work for me i just feel like when you haven't smoked before maybe like my body's like especially because i'm one of those like whatever i really don't care about being high and feeling this and escaping the world i'm like i love my life i love my job i love everything that's going on with me and my life the disrespect on video chat but whatever so anyway um yeah i just feel like when i'm a person that like doesn't i guess care about it or really believe in it or want it to work i'm like i wonder if it's just not gonna work for me because my body's just i mean i've legit just been watching tv and on video chat so again we'll check back in all right so [Music] i originally told you guys i was going to um check back in at 2 30 5 2 35 all right so it's 4 42 right now and i'm like i feel like i might be high like i really can't tell if i'm it's like for a little bit of a second like everything nothing's funny nothing's funny okay anyway what i was saying is i said i was getting checked back in at 2 35 it's 2 42 and i just can't stop laughing because i was on um i was on video chat and um i was eating this mango and a fly was in the kitchen on the floor and it literally like jumped like a frog and it kind of threw me all off guard but um since that happened it's just been like everything's funny i don't know how to describe it other than like get so lovey it's so weird because like i think i might be high but i can't i keep saying that i'm not high so i can't okay no it's like i can't get anything out like what the heck okay it's weird because like i'm i'm here and i recognize like what's going on but i don't know why everything's like funny okay everything just got really funny and i'm freaked out because i have to legit drive to get my mom so my mom's at um i dropped her off this morning and i have to go get her and i'm like i don't know like i don't know it came on in a matter of like 15 minutes because when i definitely looked at the clock and i was like oh there's eight minutes until i have to tell them if i'm feeling high or not and um then everything got funny and i was like oh shoot like legit that hit me really fast i didn't even know if i was still recording or not okay the feeling of high i don't know like i legit walked upstairs to get my charger and then i couldn't focus and i felt my brain was like not focusing um but yeah the most thing that i noticed the most the thing that i noticed the most was just that my heart i've been able to feel my heart like like my heart um i can feel it like i can feel my heart through my body the main thing that i feel like i just i'm talking a lot more and i feel like my thought process is just like this all over the place i don't know i don't know why that's like a feeling people would want to get because like while i'm feeling this right now i feel like i'm right now i'm on an even mindset i'm understanding i'm recording youtube video and then i need to stop talking because i'm on video chat and this is supposed to be like a short explanation and i just can't stop talking but i recognize that this is what i'm doing right now like i'm i am doing this right now but um i'm just gonna check back in with you like but i just don't know if i like this feeling like i am acknowledging that i'm recording this i'm acknowledging that it's for a reason but my brain is just like going on everything but um yeah so i'm going to check back in in about 30 minutes we'll see i've been recording for five minutes i feel like that's a really long time it's a really long time um so my next check in i'm gonna make it try and try make it short and sweet and yeah talk to y'all in a little bit hey guys right now it is 3 51 and i definitely feel like i have experienced the high i guess i didn't think that it'd feel like this i don't know like genuinely i felt like the entire time all i've felt like is actually i'm gonna look at myself just because it's helping me focus a little bit more looking at something um but i feel like i didn't expect it to feel like this i i just felt like i kept saying things that were so honest and i was like oh like i should start you know being quiet and it just was not i would not stop talking so yeah everything um was cool it just i guess this is just not how i experienced or thought i was gonna be experiencing it it's just really weird i don't i actually don't like it and i don't know why people get high like i would not want this feeling again i don't know i guess i thought like high like when i see people they're like chill you know sit back and share whatever like they feel good or like i guess some people get high and get like hype but i just feel like i feel so outside my body and like uncomfortable and like i just felt like i kept on saying things that i didn't want to say for the past hour which had been eating talking on the phone and then i got off the phone everything was funny a minute ago like i did not i guess that's when i noticed that i was high as like my brain just doesn't feel like it's fully functioning how it should function right now um and then all of a sudden it got really sad like five minutes ago like i don't know it's just like a sad feeling but i don't know if i'm sad because i'm like i really wish i didn't do this like like that might be why like i'm kind of sad about that like i was having a conversation with somebody and not able to understand like what was going on i mean i get it like we were having a conversation but like some of the conversation i just felt like i don't know like i was definitely talking and saying things that were like overly truthful and my mouth was moving but i'm like shut up like stop talking right now um and that's not a good feeling like when you're when you're aware that you're not coherent enough for the conversation you're having i feel like that's i mean that's i don't understand why people would want to feel that maybe just feel outside your head i don't know if like your person who doesn't really think much then maybe getting high will make you think more but i feel like i think a lot and i'm very focused normally so to feel very not focused and scatterbrained and looking at everything that you know pops up um i don't know like that feeling i don't know i guess that's why i've never done anything like this or done anything like drug related it's because i feel like if there's no reason for you to be doing it then don't do it like if you're watching this video even though like i'm recording it to show an experience don't think it's cool or like this is fire like this is not i don't know i guess it was like a funny video idea but i also wish that i didn't even do it like i don't know i just feel really sad i feel like i feel like that sadness is just me like realizing that i just shouldn't have shouldn't have done this um but yeah so it is three three it's 3 56 so um i thought i was going to check in at 3 35 i think last time but um i think i'm going to check back in around 4 35 like 4 30 or 5-ish just see i mean how i'm feeling then ultimately like it's really weird because all i'm thinking is how long is this going to last like i don't know i just don't get why people do this like i mean i have definitely um i guess they say that you should do it with someone for somebody to babysit you i was on video chat i mean no one's in my house right now but um i was on video chat but i just felt like i don't know i don't i don't i don't know i felt like once i got off the phone it was when i noticed um i don't know more aware of things like the way things felt in my body and i don't know i just don't like this i don't like it i feel like looking at myself in the viewfinder is helping me focus but i feel like i don't know my brain is definitely just like why did i do this that's why you don't do drugs kids it's honestly not even the hype that people made it this isn't like a good feeling like being high it's like i like being calm and coherent and you know not feeling outside my body and i guess a lot of people do it to get outside like if they're not happy or they want to feel a boost of probably serotonin and serotonin that's um in your body that like releases you to be happy um i don't know like this doesn't feel like that it just feels like a little bit like i'm outside my body and i'm um not myself and i actually really enjoy being naughty in my my daily life so um i don't know i wondered like if edibles like the high that you get is like different from when you smoke i don't ever plan on smoking like i don't know if you've ever been to the bodies exhibit we have it in atlanta um but you can see what a lung looks like healthy and what it looks like when it's been um smoked through and i just don't want it in my lungs like i smoke before but i'm like i would i even stopped doing that because it made me feel light-headed um but yeah i don't get why somebody would want to be high i ended up taking off my lashes and stuff because it like legit felt like they were 200 pounds like they were irritating on the eye and then i like ate this mango and put water all over my face and then wiped to where the inside of my shirt i'm sure has like brown from my makeup and i was like oh shoot i have makeup on but yeah it's four o'clock i'm gonna check back in around five let's see if i'm still high hopefully this doesn't last too much longer because i don't like the feeling and i want it to be over with but um yeah we're gonna check back in an hour and see how i feel i might take a nap just so i can like maybe sleep it off i'm hoping maybe i can drink it through maybe the food just has to like get out of my body but i don't know guys i don't know but i just want it to wear off already i laid down for about an hour i did not um i didn't go to sleep but i laid down for about an hour i couldn't like my mind was still racing but i feel a lot better just laying down um i can feel it coming down really weird experience i feel like i'm like a little hot and i'm talking with lisp which is i don't know but yeah that was my first time doing any kind of thing it is now time for me to go pick up my mom i just feel tired now um but yeah weird experience don't do drugs kids i feel like now knowing the experience i would never do it again so i thought that my last snippet video i guess was going to be my last video but i'm actually feeling a lot better right now it is the 7 50. so just now at 7 50 i'm finally feeling better and like myself and like my brain is clear i went to go grab my mom and i was honestly like really hungry i mean while i was high on the edibles i ate two mangoes two apples um a baked potato um what else a coke um i feel like i have something else oh and this like um shrimp and broccoli like stir-fry or whatever with some ginger sauce like oh and a bowl of frosted flakes so i don't know like i thought that you only got hungry when you were high on like smoking i didn't know you actually got like high off edibles and still wanted to eat stuff i never knew that was a thing but yeah i ate a lot while i was um highly edible before i got to my mom i did go ahead and stop at taco bell and i did guys i was trying to go ahead and make that like a laxative because i figured if it's an edible it's something that's in your stomach and it needs to get out of your system so tmi got it handled and since that happened i now feel a lot better um when i went to go pick up my mom we've been sharing a car for the past like a week or so um until she gets her car next week but excuse me um i literally when i pulled up to her i hopped in the passenger seat like mom's like why didn't you get out the car to like get in the passenger seat like i just need to get in the passenger seat so pretty much i um let her drive and just kind of like drove away and um go ride over here i just went ahead and went to sleep so i feel a lot better i didn't really go to sleep but it was more like relaxing closing my eyes and like now that it's out of my system i feel like i feel a lot better um i did not like the feeling guys i don't know how people do it like i know people who do edibles all the time people smoke all the time like i don't know if that's the feeling you get but i did not enjoy it i don't like feeling outside of myself i like to be clear-headed um so to feel like i was drugged like that's what i mean it felt like that um it wasn't a good feeling i was like i don't want to experience this again i literally remember um on the way over here all i was thinking was yo i need to like get rid of these like i need to flush them on toilet give it to a friend something like they have to go not flush them down totally but you know get rid of them um likely i'm gonna give them to a friend rather than throw it away because it was sixty dollars but i am just not interested i'm not interested in getting any more trying different flavors like i just did not like the experience um i felt like my brain was really clouded and heavy and it was almost like i'm kind of atd so i feel like every time when i'm thinking my thoughts go everywhere anyway but i can still organize them like i'm used to it enough that it's like i can organize thoughts in my brain but when i was high on the edibles it was almost like i could not control my brain hopping on a trillion different things and i was on video chat and i felt like i was saying things that were like brutally honest and i'm like yo why is this happening right now like it was like my mouth was moving saying things like shut up shut up so yeah i didn't really like that feeling i don't like not feeling in control and i definitely did not feel in control while i was high on the edibles um they tasted good we're going off taste i'd say 10 out of 10 they were all really really good but i'm just really thinking about experience i don't know if it's how you're supposed to feel but i just remember feeling really disoriented and my thoughts were not coming up straight in my brain as well as the fact that um i was just really confused and would not stop saying things i'm just like be quiet and then directly after that i got really sad um and disappointed in myself that i did it how long does high last night like it peaks at two to three hours so i was like i think i'm peeking so i literally was with my eyes closed but i was paying attention to everything like the fan um how it felt up against my skin i felt like i was um breathing extra heavy i don't know i just was not it was not comfortable and i just was not happy but i am glad that i experienced it i'm glad i experienced it alone i don't know if that was good or bad thing but yeah we're never doing that again hopefully you guys enjoyed it and give this video a thumbs up for me and my experience and yeah that's gonna be it for today i just love you bye", "YDVZV7NDI2I": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today

what up y'all step mother [ __ ] Academy how y'all feeling today man [ __ ] today we gonna be doing a little review about this [ __ ] loud packed mince these [ __ ] right here pretty sick before we get into that [ __ ] of course you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] some [ __ ] please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always say it's like [ __ ] meaning and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification any time I post some [ __ ] also go follow me over on Instagram that's cannot underscore meek and also go I hit my website up that's a Kenta Ming calm [ __ ] [ __ ] guys get yourself some terpene 10 11 12 13 14 maybe 15 of them [ __ ] I man so [ __ ] mints mints are a really good way mints are a really good way to uh to get your medication your medication on I'm gonna call it medication because you [ __ ] more likely taking this for recreational purposes but if you are taking it for pain reduction this is really good now I'll keep it 104 for recreation mints for me are not the way to go these [ __ ] are 2 and 1/2 milligrams each so I mean it's cool but if you got a higher tolerance I'd have to eat 20 of these [ __ ] that'd be a minty [ __ ] walkin around yeah demean yourself and for me not from that but excuse me if you're looking for a pain reduction [ __ ] perfect if you have low tolerance [ __ ] perfect if you know that your which will be a little tolerance if you know your your you can only handle 10 50 milligrams and you want to like you know dose yourself out throughout the a little fun perfect now there is a little be mindful at this watching you open these up around and eat them around simply because you can be around somebody and maybe like a man let me get a minute give me your grandma or something you know nummies you got to watch who you can soomi's around you know so usually what I do is if I know I'm going out like in public somewhere around people I'll put this with normal myths so if someone ask I can just grab a normal man and give it to him but you know most of my peoples they they'd be like man let me get one of them infuse myths so you know digging with [ __ ] so Wow pack I don't even know if I say who this is by but this pile out back Wow pack also has wheat yeah so they also they got weed and everything so my lights are brightest [ __ ] I need to put a dimmer on them [ __ ] but yeah I think they got um they got they bait they have a weed I think of so many oh [ __ ] there is something in here I didn't even know it was anything in there honestly I just grabbed this I just grabbed it and put it down I thought it was empty that's like 5 min $20 in your pocket when you're doing laundry [ __ ] so that's dope so let's uh let's open it this is a peppermint one you know I like to kind of go through a little bit of the nutritional facts for y'all only one carbs are that a [ __ ] no sugar yeah you straight it ain't nothing I'm just reading everything sorry all right cool I've honestly had these for a minute and I just never opened I hate opening boxes on camera all right yeah so this is pretty dope I like the actual tin case itself because it has the flowers on there so definitely if you trying to like you know be inconspicuous with this [ __ ] you probably don't want to put this [ __ ] in the regular you know like ten of like Altoids or some [ __ ] because this [ __ ] got marijuana leaves all over there [ __ ] so okay he's a pretty dope so on the mint I don't know if that can be seen let me see yeah there we go so you can see it got California with the marihuana symbol on it and then you turn it over and it just has the loud pack logo so it's not bad pretty big so for some people the the California will be a pro or con is you know you try to hide your [ __ ] you got a bad stamp on your [ __ ] mint there's a little interesting but for real purposes like you know like if you like me like my kid know about cannabis like I did a video talking about it I'll put that [ __ ] up my kid knows about cannabis so this little you know California and marijuana leaf symbol that's a sign to him telling him not to [ __ ] with this you know so it's I think that's just pretty important to do and to have so [ __ ] let's have it you know I like to throw them up and try to catch them oh you know what I did have one of these now that I think about it cuz the first I was like I've never had a loaf at one of my co-workers gave me one of these yeah yeah shout out you know who you are are you saying your bank was shot up he hooked me up one time I was like you got some mints and I was about to leave he was like I got one who's like but you know half [ __ ] milligrams [ __ ] I can drive out the I know we have these shits are dead I gotta really actually better than most real mints and it's thick so I know that it'll last for a while now what I like to do a moment is instead of like taking them showing them up and swallow up I put them in between the gums so then it's kind of being taken through the sub like sublingually so what it getting absorbed into the mucous membrane system so it's almost like taking a tincture so to help them take effects on you quicker so there's some Mets out there that are like 10 mil easy so what I used to do is just take them I put them in my [ __ ] gums looking like a [ __ ] baseball player cooing from [ __ ] dad really just spit a little bit I don't know in my head ended up like it we family you know it's something so anyway yeah man but you hold them in the gums and then let them dissolve in the gums and you'll start to fill it a little bit quicker and it helps that minty flavor we're standing here about the whole lot longer alright so I yeah man [ __ ] that's the end I mean what if I go ski say about from goddamnit but these days are dope so if you didn't know yeah cannabis is also admits that [ __ ] is pretty fly right so watch it that's the end of this video man I'm not this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the love go on love each other be peaceful to each other keep the peace going and make sure y'all go over to my [ __ ] website go to Canada mean calm get yourself some [ __ ] turn pink shits I get about 10 11 12 13 14 maybe hate it in [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] peace another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "ZkiJLLvT4vQ": "welcome to true buds tv we're going to be making some can of sugar today and this recipe is very simple but the tincture itself that we're using takes some time but first and foremost we're going to do our two cups of our pure cane sugar and one cup of our tincture this is a two to one ratio a lot of people call this tincture green dragon as you can see it's got that nice color to it this tincture in particular is 35 milligrams per tablespoon so in the full eight ounces we're looking at about 560 milligrams for the whole batch the t check 2 helped me know this now if we use a stronger batch i did that was 131 milligrams per tablespoon we'd be looking at about 2 100 milligrams for the whole eight ounces so you can see the difference and you can see the importance of the t-check too to know the potency i'll put a link below if you want to check it out learn a little more i'll also put some videos showing how i use it as well but let's go ahead and put the oven on to 200 degrees once it's heated up we'll go ahead and add that in there the sugar and the tincture this is important you want to leave the door ajar 15 minutes or so will come back besides leaving a door jar you want to make sure you have good ventilation a fan blowing because it gives off some fumes and then we'll go stir it also important we want to make sure that we're being very careful especially if you're using a gas stove like myself a gas oven electrics recommended but i like to live dangerously so keep stirring it every 15 minutes so and then after the first 45 minutes i'll stir it about every 10 minutes so you'll see it keeps getting you know a little more grainy every 10 minutes or so come back and do it and the total amount of time that elapsed during this whole video here was about 2 hours and 45 minutes is how long i had it in the oven as you can see it's going to keep getting more grainy and grainy as it goes in longer and longer the total amount of time that elapsed in this video right here that i sped up is about two hours and 45 minutes then i went ahead and just strained it through just break it apart so it's nice and grainy and looks like sugar when it just started just a different darker color i hope you like this video and i'll put links below to all the videos you need to make this and some other videos that you might be interested in like how to make simple syrup which we'll be doing with this can of sugar thanks again for tuning in to true buds tv it's always good to have you here let me know how you like this recipe let me know what you want to

you can use a water pipe joint or vaporizer to name a few it delivers cannabinoids directly to the lungs this makes it a viable way to treat asthma studies show that cannabis does not harm lung tissue but inhaling the combustive byproducts might offer some risks smoking is thus not the best way to treat lung disease it's better to vape or use an inhaler for optimal results both THC and CBD have been proving successful to treat asthma studies show that medical marijuana has a similar effect on the Airways as some traditional asthma medication THC is mostly known for its euphoric response due to its psychoactive properties but THC acts similar to the endocannabinoids we have in our own body to THC is known to effectively dilate Airways in the lungs and inhibit coughing even when a person smokes marijuana it dilates the Airways in comparison cigarettes to exactly the opposite cigarettes constrict the airways when a person has an asthma attack a chemical molecules acetylcholine normally responsible for maintaining muscle tone of the Airways also contributes to the contractions in asper attacks traditional asthma medication blocks the molecule by preventing it to bind to the receptors THC likewise does the same it does not stop the molecule from binding it prevents a set of choline from being released when THC is released through a vaporizer it has almost immediate bronchial dilation effects without the risks of harmful smoke CPD is also known for its anti-inflammatory properties in fact it has very strong anti-inflammatory benefits furthermore CBD helps to let you sleep better and lowers stress level tremendously using CBD daily in oil or tinctures helps the body to reduce inflammatory responses in the body CBD is also very good at reducing bronchial spasms CBD is very safe to use with little to no side effects as cannabis technology is improving at a rapid pace patients with lung problems have more options to choose from there is easy access to cannabinoid inhalers and nebulizers that eliminates the need to smoke cannabis as a treatment for asthma vaporizers and vape pens are also out there obviously more studies will follow but as for now cannabis is viable in treating asthma we'd love to know your thought on the matter let us know in the comments section below and of course if you enjoyed this video make sure to subscribe to our Channel so you too can become a cannabis expert", "OkU8utVaRh8": "[Music] [ __ ] y'all filler they mention today we will be talking about bugging care by design topical pain cream my hands are actually love are hopefully I didn't come up in the camera but anyway before we get into that [ __ ] a question you know I gotta ask you [ __ ] about look like that please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody this year always saying cuz always [ __ ] me me and make sure you hit that so you can get a notification anytime I post some get and take that ass over to Instagram and follow me I cannot underscore me speaking the Instagram I got my concepts going on right now until January 25th you can win yourself one of these awesome t-shirts it's just the way of saying thank you for me being at a thousand subscribers plus so you can see in a video to see the rules on how to get into there and just make sure you follow all that but get that ass over to Instagram and follow me kind of underscored me so anyway not that [ __ ] out the way let's get into this we got this pang cream and it's a it's a care by design pain cream and it's a one to one with it being a one to one that means that it has equal parts as most of you guys know it's a hundred and fifty milligrams of THC and 150 milligrams of CBD alright so like let's say you have a muscle issue and the reason I know this works is because you know two days two days ago I was at the gym right well if I could don't pull ups doing this thing you know me working on my build and uh I'm on the bar this girl walks up on the side of me badass mexican chick right and I live on her own when the bar I'm like look look cuz you know sideways doing bullying looks like [ __ ] she goes to the machine right on the side of me so I was like man let me throw in the cup wedge to five or six I was at the end of my set when she walks up so I'm throwing action five or so so I do my thing yeah I put my legs up do a couple of fancy little shits I come down and look over she ain't even facing me mom is she doing the exes what hurt back to me I felt like yeah I Steve Harvey would he feel a if I got a family feud and somebody give a weird answer he like what the hell yeah I end up straining my back on the last two exercises like reps I shoulda done so I [ __ ] up on that when trying to impress somebody she wouldn't even [ __ ] looking so anyway my back was triggered so what I did was I had this cream so I was like why not go ahead and try because I honestly never really tried pain creams because I'm really ever in pain to keep it real and if it's I am from working out like a sword I just let that [ __ ] be but this one my muscle was hurting like I felt like a pull on my lower back so how it goes I went on a set [ __ ] it let me go on and use it it's a it's a pump okay so looks basically the same as that bottle you got this big-ass bottle at this little last [ __ ] so I don't understand really the purpose of that but I guess maybe because they got to make it the childproof thing with the pop top it's like a big-ass weed bottle if you ask me oh I'm gonna keep my weed in this [ __ ] so oh let me should I tell you the ingredients in this [ __ ] let's see okay so it's a coconut oil base like most topicals are that MCT coconut oil has aloe vera beeswax shea butter cannabis oil of course orange as the [ __ ] is orange orange essential plants [ __ ] either they're Orange Haley family felt was good or is your central essential oils essential oils also peppermint essential oils and then you got some shed no I can't pronounce that and then I also got the soya lecithin and it also has vitamin E inside of it vitamin E ain't bad to put on your skin [ __ ] not something you want to smell smoke or bait no and you don't want to bait that [ __ ] okay just like you could drink some some Hennessy but you don't want to bake that [ __ ] you know so it's the same thing so that's the ingredients s inside in there and then obviously I could say it's 150 milligrams of THC 150 milligrams the CBD so a really cool thing with this and is the smell it's not super strong so you know like if you are to use like some bangaiore and you walk around this don't do that to you and also don't make you smell like weed so anyway so it does have you do smell it a little bit don't get me wrong but it's not a lot like a super super duper strong smell it's a little watery so don't look at it like you're gonna use it for lotion like I should be cuz my shade is ah so we go see it to do where it has a little get into cracks so anyway that's my son so because some people asked somebody asked me about that like oh you like prints that's not about prints that's my son when he was four he wrote his name and we got a tattoo and a prince was named after the Fresh Prince of bel-air so that's that so you guys know the backstory of that but yeah so anyway I used this cream when I went to work because my lower back was all [ __ ] up and I'll keep it 100 this [ __ ] worked like a [ __ ] like I was good to go with my desk I can make my desk stand and sit for half of the day outstanding half the day I said I was good either way I went with my back for that day and I've had that lower back pain before and I just like gangsta it out yeah I mean hey I getting stood out it was like man I'm gonna let the pain beat and I'm gonna stretch and I'm gonna do some foam roll and i'ma let you know the bubble blah this time I was ironing that time for that [ __ ] I'm on my way to work my back is [ __ ] all the [ __ ] up so let me put this [ __ ] on and I put [ __ ] on and honestly work make sure though you still do your stretching all this is is a mask this didn't fix my [ __ ] muscle it just make it stop hurting so I can get through my day I still have to do my stretching I still did some foam rolling on my ass cheek to release the pressure from the muscle from pulling on my goddamn lower back muscles so you still have to do the things that you need to do to take care of yourself but if you're in a bind and you you know need to use this [ __ ] do it now certain things I say y'all gratis and bangers and [ __ ] you can't work out and make that [ __ ] go away you can't help your diet make your diet help it but you can't work out to make that [ __ ] go away this is something that's dope for that you got knee problems this is something that's dope for that now if you got full bypass if I come in and ask for a cream but I'm like what's hurt and they're like well pretty much my whole body you're not gonna lather up in this [ __ ] [ __ ] so this is more so over like paying targeted areas like I'm targeting my elbow not like my whole left side is [ __ ] like that's not what this [ __ ] is for that route you want to go with edible art in tourism but when you're looking at something just like oh you have wrist problems you have joint problems you got knee problems lower back problems things like that this definitely helps even with the shoulder so I had known people to swear by it but I never had their use for it but when I actually how to use for it and it worked I figured I would share that with you guys so the website is cvd org if I'm not mistaken it doesn't say it on the bottle I should read the bottles before I do videos so I don't know what the [ __ ] website is but as CBD org so definitely go check that [ __ ] out or something like it if you if you live you're in pain and know somebody's last pain it doesn't get you high generally I'd said before that actually this was the cream I had put this cream on my wife's back and she said yeah my back was relaxed when I was up high off [ __ ] night and she had to smoke so it was like they say there's no get UI but if you put enough on that [ __ ] like it against you hi MA okay so I say you know just be mindful that but for the average person an average amount of use it won't get you high I just really overboard I put a gang initiate on that [ __ ] so just keep that in mind when you're using it but outside of that I definitely say this is something to [ __ ] with care by design is really stand up company they also have capsules they have babes they're a really really good company they also do a lot of teachers and their big would ratio so I don't really see them with just straight THC I always see their stuff ratio with a balance of TV THC the CBD from one the ones all the way up to 18 the ones so anyway that's the end of this video plays I'm at this [ __ ] make sure y'all check out the video though on how to get the goddamn t-shirt and go to my Instagram and [ __ ] follow me over there and follow the instructions over there as well alright so I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the love going y'all love each other keep the peace going and there y'all be peaceful to each other I'm out this [ __ ] you [ __ ] up [ __ ] I want to hit the sequel we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smokin", "zyrq11rNcL4": "so Perry if I have severe back pain what cannabis products should I consider using well it's interesting each the statistics are 70 to 80 percent of the US population at one point in time is going to have back pain fruit for whatever reason whether it's a compression of your discs nerve roots bone sticking on there so there's lots of different ways to approach this the first one of course is topical because if you want to put something directly on your back either as an ointment or as a patch to be able to put on there that's probably the first thing I would try of course you have to remember with an ointment it's not going to get absorbed deeply into the tissues to be shown in a urine sample with you have to test for THC a patch might be because it's just most none of it gets evaporated all of it gets absorbed into the system again a combination of a THC CBD type of ointment or patch on the back is one way to go another way to go quite interestingly is a product rectal suppository of cannabis by company forea makes a suppository that really is used primarily for women having a pain during their menses however it seems to help some people with back pain because it's in I guess the general area of the spine and it has 60 60 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD the interesting thing about that product I've actually taken it for back pain it actually did help me and my lower back pain is that you don't experience the the psychoactive high even though it is 60 milligrams it's true most people seem to get the effect that it doesn't affect them that way however that being said it has been said that it does show up in a tox screen if someone urine a state THC is going to be shown in there of course that's a lot of THC and obviously the the next way way you might go is actually vaping or smoking a marijuana strain correct correct and that way that would be another way to help relieve pain in general whether it's your back or pain in any other part of your body but you know a back pain is interesting because it'll work to a degree however there is some physical problems with your back that no matter the amount of cannabis you take you actually main something else done like surgery at some point in time if you have an actual impingement on your back from a piece of bone sticking on there so if the pain continues and you start getting terrible numbness etc it's probably best at some point in time to get evaluated by a physician about that obviously and then anecdotally I find it interesting that we have heard from so many people here at home MD who've been in auto accidents where they've had surgeries and they've gone through all of the diagnosis and they still have major back pain or nerve pain and it seems that a lot of the people have said that smoking marijuana on a daily basis has helped them live a healthier life and get off of opioid wait well that's a whole really you know pain getting off your opioids is a whole other issue having to do with cannabis and yes kind of seems to help people decrease their opioid use if they had been taking opioids and take their place of that and help them with their pain for sure mm well that's great thank you so much you're welcome you", "29hyb2rrrgo": "and Marley how do you like your treats did you have any like reservations about giving them CBD at first I was desperate to keep him so I was willing to try anything [Music] hey we're at ro Nels house and Rennell has a dog named Marley and Marley has a couple conditions I get treated with CBD oil which is something a lot of people didn't know you could do with dogs so how did you come to get Marley somebody was had him up for adoption and they said that they had little kids and they couldn't handle him which I thought was crazy until I got him home and I found out why cuz he just wanted to be held and he's under your feet he couldn't be by himself I was like having a baby so it was like it was terrible if he got really upset he would he'd go to the bathroom in the house and it got to the point where was like you can't have that so yeah we were gonna have to find him another home we take him to a groomer and I just happened to ask one of the ladies that takes care of him there if he behaves as badly there as he does at home and she said that we should consider using the cannabis treats because it would help with his anxiety and that the Prozac probably was not helping any longer because he'd been taking it so long oh so he was on frozen crows I Fedora hmm they do what was the difference between the Prozac behavior in the CBD with the Prozac he was calmer but he still was a little more anxious with having people come and go in here so often he had to calm down because he was just barking like crazy and just going on and on so now he just sits and hangs out with everybody but like I said didn't change his personality at all which was nice because I was afraid it was gonna make him just you know with our Jick and lay around and do nothing so he still runs around with the kids and plays with them and does all that so changes to mean and oh yeah exactly that's exactly right CBD saved the day they did I did well I'd heard about studies on the effects of CBD in dogs this is my first time seeing it in practice so we're outside of it Lydon right now it's one of our nails favorite places to come get everything Marley needs so we're gonna go inside learn a little bit more about CBD and pets and see what kind of goods they have to offer hi Trey hi I'm Leah nice all right so you guys have quite a number of products which ones are for dogs all right so we do have a product that is CBD base or hemp based and it is a pet CBD whole plant tincture CBD is known to be non psychoactive or what we say is non euphoric so you're not gonna get that high it can help with ailments such as stress anxiety pets dogs namely also have what's known as an endocannabinoid system humans and pets have this so CBD can help pets as well for my dog I use it once a day in the evening to kind of chill him out not that it takes away his personality or anything it just is a nice he's not so anxious it's really great and your dog likes it oh yeah absolutely while both THC and CBD compounds are found in cannabis plants they behave very differently CBD doesn't have psychoactive properties so it won't make you feel high it's important to remember that CBD products for dogs aren't regulated so you should try to talk to a vet about what brands and quantity to try for your pet CBD also hasn't been thoroughly tested in humans or animals but some early studies have shown that CBD has a lot of potential medical benefits including a calming effect which is a natural alternative to prozac that can help marleah so let's see a shape before using take four drops per 10 pound animal wait twice daily how big is my early about 8 pounds about 8 pounds yeah that's about like three four jobs all right let's see what you think about this mm-hmm what do you think not sure if I you somewhere you eat so I find I'll eat it [Music] but if I put it on something you'll take it with me think let's try it there we go so today we learned about CBD and dogs CBD might be a good alternative for your dog or your cat or other pets as opposed to going through pharmaceuticals so yeah maybe your dog or your cat will like weed as much as you do [Music] you", "faqr7tt-iwQ": "[Music] hey everybody whether you're a patient of ours or not you probably find some of this information helpful what we did was we just compiled a couple of questions that we get you know more often than other questions we get a lot of questions but these are some of the more popular ones and then this relates obviously to if you're a medical marijuana patient or a prospective medical marijuana patient in Florida home so we can only speak for the state that we you know do registrations and final prescriptions and which is which is Florida there you go dr. Jen if you want to read the first question we often have people come in who have a lot of questions and just confusion about the whole process every state does something a little differently so we get a lot of people coming from other states and that was done a certain way and they come here and it's completely different here so but one of the most common questions we get is it's always preceded by I smoked a joint when I was in high school or I smoked once when I was in college is the medical marijuana the same and will it get me high probably the number one question we get and it's not you know you would think easy yes/no question but it's actually not everything's so regulated compared to years ago when you got whatever you got now it's down to the milligram and the percentages and the strength so you can really dial in exactly what works best for you but just an easy yes or no question if you use enough THC yes you will have psychoactive effects yeah and usually so the conditions that we see you know we see people after they've tried CBD from a gas station it it didn't work for them so they need something medical grade the stuff that works is psychoactive period that's the short answer to that if it's gonna help you with ms yeah it's gonna be cycle because the other thing it's competing with you know our host of strong medications right if you want to compete with a host of strong medications including painkillers and everything else you need something psychoactive so that's the short answer for that and in the state of Florida they make us do umbrellas under or like normal or high THC and low THC anything under low THC is consider the CBD product so those are non psychoactive that's the the one answer to this that's know that yeah you can get medical grade CBD with a medical marijuana card and it really just depends on whether or not you know it's gonna work for you we can't tell you if it's gonna work for you because the research is kind of all over the place so it's a trial and error type of system you know you're kind of the patients in control of their own treatment after we registered for the Carter probably the next most common question we get down here in Florida because of all the snow birds and the part-time residents is can I travel with it absolutely not if you're crossing the state line there are two ways actually getting trouble this way one is if you go into airplane where it's federally I guess federal jurisdiction then it's illegal because federally it's still illegal and two if you're in a car you draw across state lines then you have now gone into federal jurisdiction as well so you cannot travel with it even if the next state is okay with it if you're going from Florida to California you have to buy separate products when you're in California so third question is can you grow your own no can i but wait can kids can my buddy grow some and give it to me in like a little baggie but since I have a card for my doctor says I can smoke weed right can I can I can I do that if it is not in the container from a dispensary than it is illegal okay any product that you get has to be in the container received in for it to be legal also there's a real questions that I get and as he was saying earlier when can I grow mine actually not for there's no gray area with that in Florida and all that right now will there be the future maybe but as a right now no laws tend to work really quickly they do as a right now the law is you cannot operate machinery within two hours of using it so just be mindful of all the walls and stuff and grow with it especially if you're one of the patients that you know are brave enough to come out here and get it here in the beginning we're gonna do another video which I'll link up top and that's going to go over the difference between percentages of THC difference between CBD and THC ratios these are all things you're going to see when you go to a dispensary you're gonna see them on the prescription seventy five percent thirty percent one to four nine to one what does this all mean but click the link and I'll explain we did a whole video just to explain that yeah that's for everything else check back with us regularly and we'll keep you updated [Music]", "8D__KieWACI": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis sour skittles

you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace [Music] you", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "1n6gVUehmvc": "so what about bioavailability if we're talking about supplementing the endocannabinoids system with exogenous cannabinoids whether they be synthetics or isolated cannabinoids or in the whole plant form so you know the most common way that people use cannabis is inhalation and the most common way they inhale is actually we lar initially will show our data later but joints are still the most common way or smoking a bong or a pipe so there's not that many people using oral administration so so you're gonna smoke a joint how much THC do you get well it depends right and it doesn't just depend on how much is in the cannabis so this is you know here's the fate of THC they're saying you might lose up to 50% of it in sidestream smoke and another maybe 30% in pyrolytic destruction so there's 80% of it gone right there which doesn't match up with these numbers they're saying the mainstream smoke that you draw in may have 20% of what was in the starting material right well then what about the limitations at in the lung how much can actually get across the alveoli that could depend right how many alveoli do people have how much surfactant do they have so these are highly highly lipophilic compounds so they just slide right over the alveoli into the bloodstream so one report said 80% from smoking but you know if you take 20% of that 80% is do you get 16% I've always sort of speculated even lower maybe 10% so if you take one hit right and if you say sleepy if you have if you have a one gram sample and it's a 10 percent THC you've got 100 grams hundred milligrams right 100 milligrams and so 10% of that you might get 10 milligrams in one hit that sound rational that's an estimate I mean people are often asking this question you know there's one study showing that IV administration of THC only 1% reached the brain so we're now talking how much did it take for a psychoactive effect if 1% of that 10 milligrams reached the brain so it's it's really it's a very potent compound right what about other forms for bioavailability so I've been scouring the literature and it's really hard to find hard numbers but and orally it's it's there's a wide variety but I just went with 4 to 12 percent so obviously less than inhalation right because we've got first pass metabolism we've got the GI barriers to overcome we've got differences in absorption and the GI and we'll talk a little bit more about that or a mucosal it's probably a little bit higher because now we're not talking about having to go across the gut and through the liver transcutaneous I couldn't really find an exact number for how what percent you know might get through and it's going to be hard because transcutaneous or a topical application may really just act locally and not affect people systemically as much and I've had people tell me and I think Jake will probably tell you this later that topical use people aren't having psychoactive effects from it just pain relief so maybe I don't know one of the papers I guess I think it's a or there was even a study but they didn't give a percent I was like really frustrated they said how much they measured in the blood and it was like but what was the starting amount I was trying to calculate a percent and that you know I talked about CBD being the slippery little thing but apparently CBD is a little better it's slipping across the skin than to you see rectally of course would also be good twice that of oral sublingual was reported as relatively fast but you know I couldn't find anything about there there is for the oral mucosal this comes from Sativex data so this is reliable you know and then again like I said IV I think I guess that's those animals you know they only measured one percent of what they injected IV in the brain so I would have thought you know the brain is this huge fat reservoir and there might be a whole lot more in the brain that I was I was actually surprised by that", "_1su4Zt65is": "hey y'all hi here away of goodies and Friday right Friday it's Valentine's Day always so sweet um if you're in love congratulations if you not in love congratulations um today we're gonna make some

will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "z4dgBpnB9hw": "no no no no no no hold on what's up my peoples all i gotta say is the community asked and the people responded and let me

doctor signing out for now guys peace smoke doctor", "lK2pxyo3R8Y": "hi there I'm Mandy Lee the host of try this and try this is an educational show that is all about cannabis and cannabis products every Thursday we share with you how to videos and product reviews and much more to ultimately help you get the most value from our favorite plant and today we have for you for tips on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures so let's get to it let's dive in and let's try this now tinctures are extracted cannabinoids which are mixed into either an alcohol glycerin or coconut oil solution and they're ideal for people who are using cannabis for medicinal reasons or for people who are new to cannabis as well there's a few reasons for this one is that they're administered via a syringe so you're able to easily and accurately dose yourself in really small increments because you can basically count each drop as you administer it also the tinctures come in many non psychoactive options and they also carry little to no smell and involve no vapor or smoke now the most popular and beneficial way of taking them is sublingually so the solution is absorbed in the body through the oral mucus all and to do this you use a dropper and you place the cannabis solution right underneath your tongue you hold it there for about a minute before swallowing and then you will feel the effects typically in about fifteen to thirty minutes and the last you for about three to four hours this way of administering it the cannabinoids and the terpenes they're absorbed through the tissue lining into your bloodstream so this increases the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so if this is the method that you're interested in then here are four tips for you on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures now number one is specific cannabinoid options so when it comes to tinctures many people don't realize that there are many options pass the sativa indica and hybrid options that they're used to tinctures can be made with specific cannabinoids and some with different ratios of one two one three two one or twenty two one of a combination of cannabinoids to meet different patient's needs because each cannabinoid is known for helping to treat different symptoms and ailments and can cause different effects so you can find teachers that are in THC which is psychoactive CBD which is non psychoactive THC and CBD a which is the acid form of THC and CBD before it's exposed to heat and both of these are they're fairly new cannabinoids to be offered and studied their non psycho active but there are astounding results that have been discovered with patients who are using these cannabinoids for an assortment of different reasons number two is using whole plant tinctures from flower so here at green flower we tend to favor whole plant tinctures from flower as opposed to trim now the flowers are just the most cannabinoids and terpenoids aplan whereas the trim it doesn't have as many terpenes and it mostly has the cannabinoid THC in it so these types of tinctures they'll give you the fullest entourage effect from cannabis and provide you with the widest range of terpenes now the cannabinoids and terpenoids resides and with some trim only tinctures you just lose quite a bit of the medicinal value from this lack of a rich terpene profile so when entourage effect is present in many of these flower rich tinctures what happens is you have multiple cannabinoids and chirping that are present and they work together to enhance the medicinal value of each of their individual properties now number three is choosing alcohol extractions so we also tend to favor tinctures that are made from an alcohol extraction process since this process it's just the gentlest on the plant and so it keeps the terpenes more intact because some extraction processes they strip the terpenes from the cannabis and other ones like co2 break apart the bonds between the cannabis and the terpenes and then they reintroduce the terpenes then ultimately what we've seen is that when you keep the terpenes completely intact with the cannabis that's when you'll see the best benefits and the terpenes make the benefits of the cannabinoids even more effective in your system and they carry a bunch of medicinal value themselves as well now Alison Attell from treat well which is a leading cannabis tincture company here in California she said that with alcohol extractions she's seen that with her clients and patients that they're not building up a tolerance to the cannabis so they're able to use less cannabis to achieve the exact results that they need which is a really big plus number four is choose products with testing and proper labels so when you're purchasing tinctures there are a few that you want to make sure to look for and to favor you want to make sure that the bottle itself says how many total milligrams of THC and other cannabinoids are also present in it as well as how many milligrams are in each dropper otherwise you're not going to be able to accurately and safely dose yourself and then we also recommend checking the company's website before purchasing to make sure that the cannabis teacher that you're purchasing has been lab tested for things like molds and pesticides and consistency potency and residual solvent now if you are interested in learning even more about tinctures and all the different ways that you can use them to help enhance your life and to treat different ailments and symptoms that I

great and that I will actually get quite stoned off of them so this is a hundred and fifty milligram edible it has been rated by the SE labs which means that you know it really does have 150 milligrams of THC in there like the packaging a lot very fancy packaging oh so if you haven't tuned in two weeks before you probably wondering why I happen to tell with me well that's because I like to have a little fat with gummy edibles as a good way of ensuring that the THC hits your bloodstream so ask us where if any gummy review I always take a little spoonful and Nutella or spatula for and until a beforehand so that way I can take the edible and your optimal conditions and with gummies you want to be doing this under optimal conditions alright so here we go mmm great every time so I got my fat in my bite let's open up the flourish again really fancy packaging look at that that's so cool well shiny we that we so we gotta open up here and it's in four or pyramid-shaped chunks this is the mango hybrid flavor hybrid being the strange some kind of hybrid we'd strain mango being the flavor oh it smells great smells like mango let's give it a taste almost choked on it well that tastes a lot better than a lot of the other gummi edibles this tastes a lot better than like it appears or infuse creations any of those it has very little weed taste I mean it does have Sun but but totally fun mmm very jelly like a jello like texture kind of hard to chew in fact all right guys well I'm gonna finish these last two cubes here and I will see you in two hours to let you know if this SC or excuse me flourish h1 50 mango hybrid gummy is actually working keep your fingers crossed for me guys because I would really love a potent gummy I will see you in two hours to let you know thanks for watching weeds guys I am back it's been two hours since I had the flourish mango 150 milligram edible and I think I finally found the gummy for me maybe it's too early to tell what just a sample size of one I don't know if anything's different about me but man this gummy it's not perfect I'm not the highest I've ever been at 150 milligrams but I am high I am definitely high which is a lot more than I can say for even 375 milligram gummy add or candy edibles that I've had in the past and certainly higher than that I like how it tasted too I tasted pretty good um I like the packaging and I kind of like the high it's it's it's it's more of like a body sort of high whatever hybrid strain and it's kind of great pretty happy with this I've got another one to review of their 300 milligram errs coming up and I hope it is twice as strong as this one if it is I will be in seventh heaven guys I might have finally found the gummy out there for me whoever recommended the flourish gummies thank you I'm glad I tried this and I am definitely looking forward to giving the 300 milligram a shot as well fingers crossed it's not just an anomaly or a fluke and that these are really the the the real deal in gummy land but I will be sure to review more and let you know for sure guys again I'm excited I'm excited thank you so much for watching this episode here on weeds glad we had a fun

to calculate edible dosage now recently I started a cooking with cannabis show called good eats on my channel where we make different meals infused with cannabis because of this I've been getting a lot of questions on how to calculate edible dosage so let's go ahead and get into this okay so in order to calculate your dosage you will need two bits of information you need to know the THC percentage of your cannabis and also you need to know how many grams of cannabis you'll be using to make your edibles for this tutorial let's pretend like we're going to make 2 cups of butter or four sticks I actually have some gorilla glue right now that's been tested at 17% THC so that's what we're going to use now normally when I make Kenna butter I use a quarter of flour per stick so for this tutorial we'll be using 28 grams or accounts of cannabis to make four sticks of butter like I normally do the first thing that you need to know is that there is a thousand milligrams in one gram of cannabis so the first thing that we need to do is we need to take our 28 grams that we'll be using and turn it into milligrams to do that we're going to take the 28 grams so we're going to multiply it by a thousand which is 28,000 the next thing we need to do is to multiply that by the amount of THC that's in our cannabis in decimal form so that means that our 17 percent THC cannabis is going to turn into 0.17 twenty-eight thousand times point one seven equals four thousand seven hundred and sixty so there's four thousand seven hundred and sixty milligrams of THC and this batch of butter that we're making right now but remember this is actually one of the four sticks of butter because we're doing two cups that means that we need to divide it by four that means that each stick of butter is actually one thousand one hundred and ninety milligrams of THC but let's go further let's say that we're going to make brownies and your brownie recipe calls for half a stick of butter that means there will be five hundred milligrams of THC inside of your brownie mix now if we take our recipe and make 10 brownies with our brownie mix that means each brownie will have fifty nine point five milligrams of THC inside each individual brother so that's it that's how you calculate edible dosage you have to find out how many milligrams of THC is actually in the whole batch and then break it down into how many portions you'll be making so I hope that this video helped you out if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section also let me know if you like this new style of videos that I'm doing I appreciate you watching much love as always peace [Music]", "ro8rNrOkLpQ": "hey what's up everybody just doing a real quick review on these little mini chiba chews from medical

good though they still use a hash oil so very hashy flavor that's good thank you guys for enjoying the video i'm going to do a review on these next well i'll highlight you later", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "xPHfRtfZnyI": "- Hello, my name is Volkar. I have been involved in\nthe cannabis industries since about 2007. There has always been\nabout smoking the stuff and getting high. However there's a whole\ndifferent side to cannabis and that's the medicinal side. I never really believed in it until when my mum started to take CBD oil. She has arthritis-like symptoms. Let's talk to mum herself. Please welcome my mum. Hey mum, thank you for being here with us. We wanted to ask you a few\nquestions about your CBD oil. - Hello, yes, we can do that. - Okay, why are you using it? - Because day in and day\nout I was in terrible pain and couldn't get relief from pain pills. The pain was always there. And of course, that burdened me a lot. - What kind of pain was it? - It's a pain in the joints. The whole body was stiff. My ability to move became worse and worse and I was getting desperate. - And in the past you used\npainkillers I believe? - Yes I used painkillers, one in the morning and one in the evening. And I've been using a\nrheumatism medication. - And then you started using\nCBD oil and what happened then? - I take one drop in the morning\nand it lasts the whole day, and I'm much more flexible. Everything is much easier,\nmuch more pleasant. And in the evening I take two drops, which makes the night\ncalm and I can sleep well. - Okay and we also wanna\nsay that you work in H Care and you work a lot with doctors and pharmaceutical medicines. You know a little bit\nabout this stuff, right? - Yes I think I know my way around. I just sat over everything\nand took the drops. I have now reported to the doctors that I'm taking these drops, and the reaction is zero. I have a feeling that the\ndoctors think that this is great, but they are not willing to prescribe it. So I got this privately. - And does it make you high? Or is it addictive? - No, not at all. This oil just makes my pain\ngo away, and nothing more. I have been taking this one\ndrop for weeks and months now, and I have not had to increase the dose. - Can you show us the\noil that you're using? - I think you can't go\nwrong with one drop anyway. - And were you able to\nstop using the painkillers? - Yes I have stopped\ntaking the painkillers and I'm using much less\nrheumatoid medication. - Okay, thank you very much and I'm gonna put this in our video and I hope this will help other people who have similar symptoms like you. - Yeah, maybe this can\nencourage other people to get in there and take CBD oil too. - Thank you very much. (foreign language) - Now there is a problem with CBD oil because at the moment\nthere is kind of a hype. There are thousands and thousands\nof products on the market, many of them are really bad. For example it happened to\nus that we bought CBD oil, the taste was horrible and\nthere was virtually no effect. The best way to buy CBD oil depends on the country you live in. In the USA, you now have service providers who test CBD products for effectiveness. This website here, they test products for\nCBD content and quality. The advantage is that you\ncan be sure that the value that is given on these bottles are true. I am going to show you two\nproducts that I recommend. This stuff is what I\nknow worked for my mom. So it is safe for arthritis problems. I would also try this stuff here. This is a full spectrum oil, that means it has not only CBD, but it also has these terpenes in there. So if you wanna imagine an\norchestra that plays music. If you wanna have a nice song, you will need many different instruments. I think this is the new way to go. In the future, all oils will\nbe full spectrum like this. There are different concentrations of oil and you wanna start with\na low concentration. You can see here, 125mg, 250, 500, 1000. There is such thing as tolerance, and if you start off\nwith just the highest, most concentrated oil, then you have no room to go upwards. You wanna start with a low dose first. So for example, the 250mg. If at some point you get tolerant to it, you can use it a bit more often and you can also use a higher concentrate. If you live in Europe, things\nare a little bit different. I have experience buying\nCBD oil over there, and I'm going to recommend you the product that we have\nbought and that we know works. It's called Candropharm100, from this website called cbdoilkaufen.de. The link is under this video. So there you go. If you haven't tried CBD oil yet, give it a go, because it may help with\npainful conditions you have. The link for products\nare under this video. Thanks for watching and\nI hope to see you soon.", "NpnbBbdK6V0": "today's subject was with regard to cannabis and the legal status of cannabis in islam now cannabis also known as hemp marijuana bunge known as charus in the indian subcontinent so many names for this plant because of its notorious role where people for many years have been smoking cannabis but why the subject arose was simply because the during the recent times some students of knowledge they deemed cannabis as being halal because they thought that the fatwa changes with time so they thought that the fatwa relating to cannabis has changed because of new scientific research and that the fatwa of the scholars of the past was outdated now what i wanted to discuss today was an overview with regard to the actual fatwa relating to cannabis also known as marijuana what is the classical fatwa firstly cannabis was unknown in the time of assalafusalihon in the time of the pies predecessors people were unfamiliar of cannabis but later on cannabis was introduced into the muslim world we know for instance the even the word assassin is from the word hashish because a group of assassins that resided in syria in the time of sultan salahuddin they were heavy cannabis smokers marijuana smokers and they were referred to as hashishin meaning from the arabic name of hashish as hashish was introduced into the muslim world so they they became known as hashishin and then when the crusaders entered syria they took the name assassin from the word hashashim and hashashim were people who smoked cannabis and the ulama became familiar with regard to cannabis now cannabis grows in heavy loads in india in the indian subcontinent in fact even during some hindu rituals they have a type of a milk drink in which they place hemp and cannabis so the the people taking part in that ritual they drink the lassi and they intoxicate themselves with cannabis in fact the indian type of cannabis which is known as al is a type of cannabis which refers to as a very potent type of cannabis which people smoked so the indian subcontinent was well known for cannabis smoking from hundreds of years ago that even the british during colonial periods many of the british researchers and they they associated mental health disorders with heavy smoking and use of cannabis this is something known historically in fact the records you will find some of the records and the cataloging of people who worked in lahore in the mental health they associated cannabis smoking with mental health but when cannabis was introduced into the muslim world the ulama could we say that the ulama were medieval scholars who were unaware of the effects of cannabis as we are aware today the facts with regard to the progress made in research on cannabis is that firstly cannabis uh has the leaf cannabis the marijuana leaf has over 360 various chemicals and each one of those chemicals must be studied the chemical that has the intoxicating effect is the chemical known as uh thc tetrahydrocannabinol this is the the particular type of chemical that makes people intoxicated so thc oil is the oil or the chemical extracted from the cannabis sleeve which gives people the feeling of intoxication but there are over 360 chemicals contained within the cannabis leaf so what is the legal islamic classical stunts and then how how do we review the classical stunts with the current research on cannabis so from all the books of the four schools from the books of al madahi firstly there are many uh fatawa that you find in the four schools you find verdicts uh in the hanafi school in the hashi of ibn's in the in the shaffer school in the hambali school in the maliki school they have various fatwas on cannabis but today for today's discussion i chose the fatwa as relayed and eloquently mentioned by alimon now he has a famous book as the word this book is on the major sins and the major sins of uh that a person can carry out and be sinful he has in kitab are those this is the chapter and those things which relate to eating so alim by the way for the people who are asking questions there will be a questions and answer session at the end cbd oil will also be tackled i will mention what the actual ruling is with regard to cbd oil and the the thc oil but what i want to do is draw you through the classical fatwa take you through the classical fatwa because one major problem that we have in today's day and age is that people criticize the classical fatawa without actually studying the classical fatah first we need to study the classical tower before critiquing them understanding the classical fatal will help us in understanding the application of the legal status of cannabis today so a fatwa on cannabis and what he states which means the hundred and eightieth major sin the major sin interestingly it states which means eating intoxicants that are clean meaning their illegal status is that they are considered tahir like cannabis so he starts with cannabis but he mentions other things as well like which is opium so he states the word muskera means an intoxicant an intoxicant is what is being debated here as to what is the meaning of intoxicant this is an important thing to understand at this point that intoxicant is what people confuse with only alcohol being an actual intoxicant so he states so the likes of ali was one of those scholars who stated that the the cannabi that cannabis is an intoxicant so he states the difference between the intoxication of alcohol and the intoxication of cannabis he states what they mean by intoxication is that it covers the intellect not with the type of joyous behavior that happens with alcohol meaning when someone drinks alcohol they become joyous but the type of intoxication meant here is only covering the intellect so he states that this joyousness that occurs is that which occurs with the drink meaning drink which intoxicates has a specific has a specific effect while cannabis on the other hand it covers meaning it clouds the intellect now he states further down remember i am only choosing the best parts of the entire fatwa that once it's established that all of these meaning he or he doesn't only mention cannabis he mentions opium and other things also he states if they are muscular intoxicants is that which numbs you down basically drugs the type of drugs that people take that inebriate them they are referred to as much states if it's established that these are that use of this is a career a major like alcohol now further down he will make make a mention of the distinction between alcohol and cannabis there is a distinction uh the distinction is that with regard to the purity of cannabis cannabis is not deemed by the majority of the scholars as an impurity it's haram to consume but it's not imp impure in the sense that if it goes on your clothes or if you touch it your clothes or your body would become impure so further down he states what is the proof for this meaning what is this based upon what uh the what is the legal ruling of cannabis remember cannabis being haram is agreed upon by the four schools so the four sunni schools agree on this they differ on a few details relating to cannabis which i will mention but what he states what is the proof for this he states al-aslufi vadika that the origin and source of prohibiting all of that is nothing what imam ahmadine writes on every intoxicant and two words are used one is musker one is intoxicant and mu fatter is that which slows you down anything which slows you down now and the mistake some people are making with regard to musker they think that musket is only the effects of alcohol meaning alcohol has specific effects so they say if those effects are not found in anything else like cannabis for instance then that cannot be deemed as haram so any intoxicant must be the same as alcohol is this correct the answer is no intoxication is scar is a universal term which has multiple aspects if one of these is found then it would be considered haram so alcohol slows you down alcohol makes your speech slurred drinking alcohol in heavy amounts can make you not being able to distinguish between two things like if someone comes across a donkey and a horse and they are drunk they will not know the distinction between a donkey and horse these are different effects of alcohol if any one of these effects is found in a substance that substance is considered a muscar so it's not essential that all the these components of intoxication are found in a substance even if one is found it's sufficient to make it haram to deem it a musker so for instance say the sharif al-jurjani rahim allah in his book on definitions when he defines iskar which is which is intoxication he says that which causes numbness or that which slows you down or that which makes the speech slurred or that which confuses you to the point that you cannot make the distinction between two things if any one of these things is found in a substance then that substance is deemed as an intoxicant if any one of these things so the exception of medicinal use which i will mention further later the that the reason for considering cannabis haram is the hadith so he then he defines everything which slows you down it slows down the appendages person is unable to move that all of these uh mentioned things too they give intoxication what to do they uh they are considered as that which numb you down and to fatiru they are those things which slow you down so even if one of these aspects is found then it is considered haram so this effect is found in cannabis that anyone who takes cannabis they will slow down or they will have paranoia and there are various other effects of cannabis which i will mention later now after mentioning this he quotes a great maliki scholar from egypt and he was the fa he was the author of a book called al-farooq now the subject of al-farooq in jurisprudence is when a scholar a jurist they tell you the distinction between uh one thing and another when they tell you the distinction between two things this science is known as wrote an entire book where he has a discussion on cannabis he has a discussion on cannabis he differed with some of the scholars and certain details but what did they say regarding the the prohibition of cannabis he states he relates from hakka al-qarafiyu so abu al-abbas ahmad the humbly jurist both of them and even allah was harsh against ibn tamiya so for him to to cite him for this shows that this position was agreed upon even among scholars who differed amongst themselves and other things that they said there is ijma they said there is ijmah on the the horma the prohibition of cannabis they related a consensus and he said meaning states whoever says it is before imams didn't discuss cannabis because cannabis was not found in their time that it appeared in the end of the sixth century that when the kingdom of the tatar they ascended then cannabis appeared in the muslim world so the end of the sixth century beginning of the seventh century that cannabis appeared now according to ibn whoever says it's halal commits disbelief we would say that the there is agreement of the four schools when there is agreement of the four schools on a legal ruling to oppose that is fisk is transgression unless of course someone is a much tahid imam to go against the ijuma is impermissible so after this further down in the fatwa after quoting the the scholars of the schools like for instance he states now the point of contention that some people have that point of contention is they say that when we observe alcohol alcohol is hammer so hammer is prohibited in the in the quran and this is a very important point that i want to alert everyone with regard to this there is a drink called nabeed nabeed is when you have a fruit like dates or anything else and you ferment the the fruit and it reaches a point where it it has the nature of intoxicating this is known as nabib and nabi by agreement is haram it's prohibited but some people they cite al-imam abu hanifa rahman allahu ta'ala saying that if nabiv is taken in small proportions in small amounts then nabeed is permissible so based on this they say therefore other drinks which are other than wine they should be permitted in small amounts so someone is saying a coffee intoxicates you this is incorrect coffee does not have the definition of intoxication that i mentioned the the four uh points i mentioned with regard to the definition of cough of intoxication where that it slows you down or it numbs you or it slurs your speech or you are unable to make the distinction to between two things like a donkey and a horse these these uh traits are not found in coffee so to say coffee is like uh cannabis is incorrect and some people have attempted to say that coffee was declared haram by a group of scholars and then was but the correct answer is that it was declared haram by a minority of people and then this fatwa was countered by the majority of the ulama the majority of the ulama and then later the the overwhelming number of scholars have said coffee is permitted unlike cannabis cannabis has an agreement a consensus of the scholars of the four schools that cannabis when taken for for intoxication is prohibited and as i will mention uh the legal rulings relating to thc and cbd further down but what i wanted to draw your attention to was with regard to beer now someone mentioned to me that in oxford you have people teaching islamic studies in oxford and they confuse the students by telling them things like al-imam that and what they mention is the legal ruling uh that relates to nabeed nabiv as i mentioned is fermented juice so you take the juice of any uh substance like a consumable substance and you ferment it and it turns into an alcoholic drink what is the legal status of nabiv the three imams they all say haram in the hanafi school muhammad shaiban he says haram and the fatwa is given according to the statement of muhammad shaibani and al-imam abu yusuf he states haram now some people quote this the statement of imam hanifah to validate a deviant interpretation they say permitted nabeed in small amounts as long as it does not intoxicate therefore they say in drinks that are intoxicants other than wine can be taken in small amounts the answer is that firstly the fatwa is not given according to that statement in the school as is elaborated upon in other works but the statement of ali should be taken in its true context what is that true context i mentioned elsewhere that alimony was mentioning this in terms of medicinal use with regard to nabeed and people said that i have said this with that reference but there are references for this uh for quick citation purposes i'll draw your attention to what uh is written in the the amazing work of a sheikh nurudeen he that with regard to intoxicants that are made from other than grapes he says that the amount that will intoxicate is haram and a person is punished by the government by the caliphate the muslim who drinks so he states but when a small amount is taken now listen to this point when a small amount is taken it's conditional so for someone to say a small amount is permitted it's conditional with multiple one of the uh conditions is that the person takes this for health reasons to strengthen themselves and not to emulate the transgressors so a person doesn't take it as a drink for uh socializing and going to the pub and these type of things that and other conditions which are not carried out to have the drinkers of this time meaning they do not fulfill these conditions so the condition of imam abu hanifa with a small amount is that with the small amount it's haram also because the conditions are very difficult to fulfill so this is important to clarify with regard to the misinterpretation people give with regard to annabeth so going back to hashish being haram the sin of smoking cannabis for intoxication is the same as alcohol that these the sin a person accumulates by drinking alcohol they will have the same sin by smoking cannabis by taking cannabis by consuming cannabis and inhaling cannabis so at this point there is a a part of the discussion that ibn hajjar maki rahim allah he draws our attention to a group of people who said there is a distinction between alcohol and cannabis they say there is a distinction between alcohol and cannabis that alcohol has certain effects that are not found in cannabis therefore cannabis should be halal he answers this by saying there is meaning not every effect of alcohol is found in cannabis and not every effect of cannabis is found in alcohol but both of the effects that are found in either one fall under the umbrella category of intoxication so kullu muscarin means that every intoxicant is haram the word intoxicant is broad and it's inclusive of every intoxicant even if the intoxicant only has specific effects so he states it becomes clear by that that there is no dispute between the ones who said that cannabis is an intoxicant there was a group of scholars who said cannabis is haram but it's haram because uh it causes tahdir which is to inebriate or to numb people down and they said it causes facade corruption and then there was a group of people who said it's musker it's an intoxicant but even allah says there's no difference between the two there is no difference between the two fatwas so if you check qarafi's al-farooq he has an entire discussion on this but ibn rahimallahu ta'ala states there is no distinction between the two why he states well while so when they say it's corruption they mean a specific type of corruption and when they say when they say that uh cannabis is haram due to a specific corruption that falls under the general meaning of uh intoxication also so when the scholars say cannabis is haram due to corruption it's a specific reason but it falls under the umbrella category of intoxication so he states in so what happened is uh some people said that intoxication is whatever makes the intellect cloudy they said sleep and fainting also makes you go cloudy so therefore uh this uh shouldn't be haram but he explains that a way and he says that uh fainting and you know madness are similar to intoxication fainting and um madness so cannabis has this effect also on the minds of people so further down he states regarding those who say that cannabis should be made halal what is further by the way i will mention the medicinal uses of cannabis after i just elaborate upon the fatwa he states uh regarding those who say that for uh leisure purposes someone can smoke or inhale or consume cannabis what is the legal status of such people now this similar to what even he says anyone who claims that cannabis is not haram and anyone who claims that it does not have an intoxicating effect then such a person should be punished severely that which prevents people from saying such things meaning in the caliphate if that someone states cannabis is halal or it or it doesn't intoxicate the government has the right to punish such a person belka whoever claims that hashisha cannabis is halal is a commit so according to ibn taymiyyah and people of the hambali school whoever claimed cannabis is halal then he commits kuffar but according to the majority they say such a person should be punished further down he has the discussion on what is the legal ruling so we know cannabis for for taking cannabis falls under iskar musker it falls under that definition so what is the legal status of cannabis in terms of cannabis the punishment for cannabis and also the legal status of the purity of cannabis so is cannabis so alcohol we know is najis but cannabis is it naji so tired we know it's haram to smoke haram to consume for leisure and for intoxication what is the legal status as uh in terms of its purity is uh hashish considered pure he states here uh he quotes al-habib that some of them said if it's an intoxication then if it intoxicates then it's nudges some of them said this and ibn tamiya said uh he said and al that he had the corporal punishment is essential for someone who smokes hashisha so there was this statement of some of the jurists they said hashisha is nudist impure and any and also the punishment for taking and consuming hashisha for cannabis is the same as alcohol the punishment the legal punishment the sin is the same by agreement but is the punishment the same mechanics that because it's a solid substance cannabis and it's not a liquid the scholars different there are three statements regarding its purity now in the hambali school alone there are three statements and the other schools have numerous statements but in the hanafi school we would say cannabis if it falls on your clothes it is not najis if you touch it it is not najis in the hanafi school but to smoke cannabis and remember uh the exception uh i will mention with regard to medicinal use i will mention uh further down uh with regard to medicinal use so i have some of your uh questions being noted down and you can continue uh mentioning uh writing your questions uh i will have the admin write down some of those questions for me so they disputed with regard to its purity and impurity and in the hanafi school it's considered pure uh likewise with regard to the had they had punishment uh they disputed the head punishment is the head punishment the corporal punishment uh for uh hashisha cannabis the same as alcohol or not now toward the end of the fatwa for me this was the most interesting part the most interesting part for me was with regard to the harms of cannabis some of the uh scholars have said waffy have said by consuming cannabis there are 120 harms 120 harms of cannabis worldly and spiritual harms worldly and spiritual cannabis gives you vile thoughts now these harms of cannabis that he lists are interestingly in accordance with modern research of some scientists also and researchers people who have written on the harms of cannabis if he mentions uh some of those things for instance it causes forgetfulness maturity likewise he mentions that it gives headaches corruption of thought sudden death it can cause certain death in some people it can cause deficiencies in the intellect meaning you would only have to observe anyone who smoked cannabis habitually or took even cannabis for a small amount of time that they will have deficiencies in their intellect likewise he mentions that the secrets a person has in their hearts they come out with those things after smoking cannabis the it does away with modesty so any modesty a person has cannabis does away with the modesty meaning any a person has likewise kathra tulmira it makes people argumentative cannabis can make people argumentative manners mannerisms uh keeping a marua is keeping uh mannerisms in society it does away with that likewise for aura a person who smokes this in abundance they will uncover their aura meaning their private areas or their private uh secrets likewise the person who smokes it is sitting with iblis they abandon the prayer they fall into muharram prohibited things so they shake meaning it can cause convulsions and shaking in people likewise he mentions it can cause liver problems and blood problems in the blood it can also yellow the teeth and ruin the teeth of a person so he mentioned so many various illnesses that cannabis causes in fact he lists 120 uh harms of cannabis and why cannabis is haram and this is in agreement with the four schools so before going on to questions and answers i want to mention something with regard to cannabis uh itself that just to recap cannabis is as haram as alcohol and new neurology and the study of neurology has not changed the fatwa in any way or form in fact so little is known about cannabis the the main funding for cannabis research is given by israel the occupying state of israel has the most research in cannabis and they also have a very high proportion of cannabis smokers in the middle east much of the cannabis in israel there is cannabis export and import from israel to lebanon and so many areas but they invest in cannabis research cannabis as i mentioned has 360 various chemicals not all those chemicals have been researched correctly but the chemical that causes the intoxicating effect is tetrahydrocannabinol thc now this thc is administered to ill patients for pains to ease their pain so cancer patients they will take thc to ease and facilitate the pain that they are feeling during cancer is this permitted this is permissible for cancer patients it's permitted for someone who has a prescription from a doctor they can take thc oil but a point i wanted to mention the cannabis that people would smoke in the 1960s during the hippie movement in america the thc contained in the cannabis leaf that was smoked by those people was only 2.5 or even less 2.5 percent of the leaf was thc so the the intoxication was less what's happened now is that with new methods of growing the leaf the the chemical of thc can be increased in fact some of the smokers what they do is that they place the cannabis on the roll and they they also place the thc oil so they may have even 25 percent increase of th meaning at 25 percent so with one smoke 25 of it would be thc oil so 25 percent of it would be thc oil and this increases the intoxication what are the health harms of taking such thc there is research that it contributes to schizophrenia and psychosis it contributes to paranoia this is not only known through research it's known through experience of people who have smoked it if you talk to people who have smoked cannabis they will tell you with regard to the paranoia they felt or the schizophrenia likewise bipolar it causes bipolar and psychosis in the smokers if someone genetically is predisposed to mental health problems cannabis is a trigger and it can actually trigger mental health problems anyone who was a habit and there is also a myth among some people that pure cannabis is different to the cannabis which is laced this is false the discussion is regarding pure cannabis so you can imagine the harms of laced cannabis so there is a laced cannabis which people have they place various chemicals on that particular type of cannabis that is by agreement harmful but the pure cannabis some people are advocating that pure cannabis is good and has benefits meaning the benefits override the harm but this is incorrect the harms override the the benefits the small amount of benefits found in the cannabis leaf could be permitted in the medicinal arena but anything else as a recreational drug cannabis is harmful and anyone who has smoked cannabis in the past you will see that when they attempt to memorize things many of them are unable to memorize some people will say carl sagan smoked cannabis or other famous individuals they smoked cannabis again by mentioning a minority of people it does not validate cannabis as a whole and it does not mean everyone who smokes cannabis will have schizophrenia it does not mean everyone who smoked a cannabis will have bipolar or psychosis the the research shows that the psychosis and schizophrenia is found higher in proportion and percentage amongst those people who have smoked cannabis in the past ins in fact it increases six times more if you check research on this you will find that there is more chance of someone who has smoked cannabis uh that the the effect of that cannabis could be schizophrenia or bipolar if you check their family backgrounds they will not have genetical predisposition to mental health problems and some of them they smoke cannabis in excess and sometimes without excess some people they may smoke the cannabis and it triggers a mental health problem so many cases have come to me where young men have been smoking and they have been they have had mental health problems this is such a common problem in our community that young men are smoking young men are smoking cannabis to such a degree that when they go off cannabis they have a service their mind plays tricks on them and the family will think that they have jinn and black magic and then they bring them to the masjid to say that they have gin and black magic when in reality they have had a habit of cannabis smoking and the effects of that have caused mental health problems and this is something being ignored in our community that there is a there is a percentage of young people who are smoking cannabis and some of them take also a new trend where they use canisters small canisters for balloon for these canisters you can order from amazon and what they do is they these canisters are made for uh spray cream creams for cakes and whatnot what these youngsters do is that they use the canisters and they they the gas in the canisters they place in balloons and then they nitro oxide and then what they do is that they inhale the nitro oxide and they have a buzz which they say is similar to cocaine and it lasts one minute now this will have mental health problems uh cause mental health problems in the long run it will affect their memories and in some cases it causes psychosis and violent behavior there was a case in the crown court in birmingham where a young man killed another man while under uh the high of the balloon so this came out in a case in the crown court so likewise with cannabis so what happens is when you go when you walk on these roads you walk on stratford road you walk on the side roads in spark brook spark hill to alam rock i walked to alam rock for numerous years four miles there and four miles back for numerous years five days a week and i would observe in small heat in alam rock in all these areas that there were canisters on the floor and i would wonder why are these metal canisters on the floor so i did some research and i found that these young people are using the gas uh nitro oxide in balloons and inhaling that gas which is haram and they should be told this is haram like alcohol and likewise cannabis is haram like alcohol so thc oil is permitted when a doctor gives the prescription for a cancer patient to relieve them of pain or any other ill person if they have a prescription from a doctor cbd the cbd oil on the other hand is permitted generally why because with the cbd they remove the thc so the tetrahydro cannabinol is removed and cbd brings out the other beneficial aspects of the cannabis leaf therefore the cbd oil is permitted but the thc generally is haram only permitted in medicinal cases when a prescription is given by a doctor there are a few other questions i use active gel which is filled with hemp it is like vicks and gel mixed together for pains around body mainly mainly is it allowed the answer is yes this is permitted so active gel which has hemp and you use that to rub on yourself is permitted this is halal likewise someone asks thc is haram it intoxicates but can the cbd be used medicinally the answer is yes that would be halal someone asks does it cure or stabilize cancer from a scientific perspective as far as i know thc suits the pain for cancer patients it does not cure cancer do not follow these urban myths regarding benefits of cannabis there is a strong pro-cannabis lobby that campaigns you've had numerous you've had george soros and hugh hefner and notorious individuals funding the lobby pro-cannabis america so do not trust the propaganda that they peddle uh on social media and other outlets can edible weed be eaten for a certain symptoms again for medicinal purposes you would have to have the prescription of a doctor because it's not considered nudges in the three schools it's not considered najis consuming the carniv cannabis in its medicinal form would be permitted for medicinal uses i wanted to mention something with regard to dmt so uh with regard to cannabis and the hemp and marijuana a few more things before i move on to dmt that there is a culture now in muslim communities where young men are hiring renting flats and various buildings in order to grow marijuana they grow marijuana and then pedal the marijuana in a society they are not only having the sin of peddling marijuana but also of those who smoke the marijuana and then all the crimes that happen as a result of that marijuana smoking it's like there is a ladder that people are climbing they start with cigarettes and hukka and then they move on to from cigarettes and hookah to cannabis as some people say uh with regard to pan is pan haram the answer is pan is not like cannabis ban does not the definition of intoxication i made very clear it slows down the body it makes someone languid it slows them down or if it makes people unable to make a distinction between things or if it slurs the speech or if it makes someone collapse and faint these are the definitions of musker and cannabis does fall under this definition but then what happens is they move on to cannabis and then from cannabis if you check research you'll find that people who have had mental health problems in the past uh mental health problems that were triggered by cannabis when they stopped smoking cannabis they some their sanity was restored but when they go back to cannabis insanity is triggered meaning the effects of the cannabis is such that the bipolar or the psychosis or schizophrenia is triggered again by them smoking the cannabis some of them have uh also they go cold turkey in ramadan so if they fast during the month of ramadan they do not have tobacco they do not have alcohol they do not have cannabis when they go through cold turkey they will have violent outbursts sometimes during the iftar when they open the fast they will have some violent outbursts because they cannot handle the hunger and the the lack of tobacco the lack of nicotine in the blood the lack of the thc the or the lack of alcohol in the blood so they will have violent outbursts so the it seems that the rung on the ladder is that they start with cigarettes then they move on to cannabis then some of them have the nitro oxide from the the small canisters and they sit on the the sides of the roads in cars and they fill the balloons and they they inhale the balloon now in the 80s and the 90s people glue sniffing was common they would buy glue powerful glue place the glue in bags and then inhale the glue gas sniffing was also common where they would sniff gas for highs all of these are haram as they ruin the intellect and cannabis is on par with them then from cannabis they move may move on to more heavier drugs like crack cocaine brown other types of drugs and unfortunately when they when they go to that stage we see that many people muslims and non-muslims within the uk are homeless they become homeless their lives are destroyed and then so many muslims take advantage of these homeless people today after fajr prayer on my way home i met a local man dressed in clothes to warm himself and he was a muslim but not a born muslim someone who adopted islam someone who took on islam and he mentioned to me that when he accepted islam his family ostracized him beat him up violently he was from leeds and they left him for dead he was found by muslims in 2018 and they placed him in some home in a room and there are some government schemes where the government gives money to the the landlords for keeping these tenants but but also they give money for the tenant but what happened is that the landlords muslim organizations he mentioned the organization to me muslim organizations that claim to house the homeless they took his money they did not give him money and he would still beg on the streets and the landlord would drive past him the landlord would drive past him while he is begging on the roads eventually after seven months he did not receive a single penny from the scheme that he sued the organization and now he was currently in another house a tenant in another house and the landlord receives government money for maintaining these people as tenants but yet the landlord was still charging extra rent and because the man is unable to pay extra rent he was also his house he was get he was given a card to keep the electric and gas going so he needed to charge the card so he was begging for money to top up the card and this man he had a kidney removed he had illnesses various illnesses and this was a man who may have had a drug problem even though he claimed he was not he did not have a drug problem so when these people they become heavy drug users and become homeless we as a muslim community have failed in with rega in a few regards number one is the amount of drug dealers in our community muslims born as muslims who deal drugs to to to the community muslims are non-muslims they deal out to everyone they are from our community secondly when those drug users are on the streets some of our muslim landlords are extorting them taking benefit from them when the government gives certain handouts to landlords taking the government schemes but yet at the same time charging those tenants also charging them that they have to then go back onto the roads to beg so we have failed in in that regard that the situation is so bad that some people sometime ask me is it permissible for us to report local drug dealers the answer is yes it is halal for you to report local drug dealers who are muslim who claim to be muslim you are still allowed to report them to the police in fact you should report them to the police many years ago when i said do not pray the funeral prayer of drug dealers do not pray their funeral prayers some people went against me and they said you must have mercy on everyone even drug dealers yes you have mercy in giving them thou inviting them to allah but the fatwa is harsh with regard to those who die without repenting the fatwa is harsh on those drug dealers who destroyed the lives of so many people and and have arrogance and refuse to repent to allah that you do not pray their funeral prayers and then someone said in order to counter this they said you many years ago attended the funeral prayer of a drug dealer meaning what happens is i make a statement so people attempt to find contradictions because of their own association i said in response to the person who brought this objection i said in reality the people do not know the backdrop when this particular drug dealer died the local community invited me to speak after his funeral in order to condemn drug dealing in order to condemn violence not in order to praise the man who had died and to praise his actions that is the context of my attendance of the funeral when i spoke against the actions of drug dealing and against gang violence this was over a decade ago so some of them they spoke against me saying uh he's being harsh to drug dealers but then after many years they caught up and agreed they said yes he is correct for saying this so this drug problem uh unfortunately uh is common in our not only in our community in many communities but as muslims as muslims drug dealers someone states deserve mercy yes they deserve mercy to make them do tawba repentance and their cases with allah but the legal status is that when when they when they destroy the lives of so many people the fatwa regarding them is harsh that when they destroy the lives of those people who are homeless on the roads who are addicted to the drugs and continue continuously beg money in order to buy drugs which are harmful so moving on to dmt dmt uh many years ago i read a work on dmt now the work itself let's go into the claim of dmt firstly dmt they say dmt is produced in the mind when a person goes to sleep and some of them refer to it as the spirit molecule they say it's a spirit molecule because when you dream that dream like state takes you to the world of the soul and this is caused by the mind producing the dmt now the pineal gland it is said that the pineal gland is what secretes the dmt in small amounts the pineal gland is is contained within the middle of the brain interestingly enough even and others have said that when the child the fetus is in the womb the spirit enters the womb from the top of this of the head interestingly enough and uh he states regarding he states uh regarding death that when death occurs the last point from which the soul is taken is from the top of the head so the pineal gland the author claimed this is one of the early works on dmt you'll find this work online meaning it's available to purchase i forgot the name but dmt the spirit molecule now the research is criticized by many people but he claims that at the time of death the amount of dmt stored in the mind increases at the time of death so this dmt uh they refer to as a spirit molecule and that a person when they dream uh they the the the spirit enters this the unseen and therefore this is caused by dmt so what this scientist did is he injected uh dmt into some of the uh people who were were taking part in this experiment and they had experiences where they met beings they said the beings looked like aliens so he has this whole research paper i read the entire paper many years ago and therefore people say that they are entering the world of the unseen the unseen realm and when they enter the unseen realm this is this is caused by dmt so what would be the legal status of dmt uh likewise the pineal gland the role of the pineal gland was mentioned by some medieval philosophers like descartes descartes mentioned the pineal gland and the role of the pineal gland research on this is still scanty meaning if you check proper research on the pineal gland you will find that research on the pineal gland is actually still scanty people still do not know the entire role of the pineal gland so what is the legal status of dmt what what is the legal ruling of dmt firstly there is no proof scientific proof that when a person takes the dmt that they are actually and by the way there are also south american methods of taking a drink form there are particular names for this drink if you do your research you will find the names of those particular drinks that they have high content of dmt so when they drink they hallucinate and see so many different things what is the legal status of those drinks as well as the dmt which is given the answer is in islam this would be impermissible because it would fall under halluci hallucinative drugs drugs which give you hallucination there is no scientific or religious proof to say that when people consume dmt they are entering the world of the rape if someone wants spirituality spirituality is not attained through taking intoxications like dmt or cannabis spirituality is attained through spirituality is attained through tahajjud pre-dawn prayer spirituality is attained through maintaining the sharia of allah and increasing the so the answer regarding dmt is that there is no proof to say that it is a spirit molecule in fact the scientists reject this reset if you do if you do your own reading you will find that they question this research uh that is written in dmt the spirit molecule and the role of the pineal gland is still unknown so these are some of the uh things that i wanted to cover with regard to cannabis before finishing i'll recommend a book which is written about marijuana and mental illness and violence this book tell your children this is a good book to read tell your children the book is by alex berenson a journalist from america he has a lot of opposition from the anti the pro-cannabis the pro-cannabis lobby in america so they oppose him but the book is a good book to read and then tell your children the truth about marijuana mental illness and violence and there is much more to be said with regard to mental illness and violence uh he mentions many statistics for instance that you will find interesting in this book statistics as to how research developed with regard to cannabis ask allah to benefit us from what has been said stay away from cannabis as a recreational drug stay away from thc as a recreational drug only use thc or cbd if you're a thc sorry if your doctor has recommended cbd is permitted but thc is haram unless your doctor has recommended it for you small amounts of this will make someone's head spin the small amounts of thc inshallah we ask to safeguard our minds to keep our intellects intact do not listen to those who say cannabis is halal they have only ruined their own minds and brains and they will ruin your minds and brains also cannabis is haram as a recreational drug do not take it as a recreational drug and take your kids away from it if you know people who are dealing in cannabis report them to the police it is totally haram uh dealing in any of these illegal narcotics is is haram prohibited it destroys society it fragments society it breaks down society it causes crime it increases crime it causes prostitution and pimping and so many other vices that are occurring in our communities we ask allah to enable us to act upon what has been said was", "GoWuCQe_Dhw": "[Music] plant's looking good everything's flowering but i'm loving it now i'm so excited got my autoflower

"KzUueRahygs": "what's up everybody welcome to my channel today we're gonna be talking a bit about cannabinoid ratios and what they mean but before that we got to get elevated so let's go ahead and build up this half gram aces high from grass roots super stinky frosty beautiful looking bud nicely trimmed so I'm gonna grind that up hold it up nice got a nice pungent odor to it nice and frosty not too much Keith comes after me but but it's all stuff to the leaf flower ten steamed broccoli mmm it's got this really great diesel skunky earthy taste but both parents being diesel they should have called it super DS order double diesel instead of Aces High a super pungent great taste little diesel little earthy skunky hopefully you guys are joining me if so let me know what you're talking about okay so 22 one CBD if you had a strain that has let's say 20% CBD that means it would have 1% THC if you had 50 50 % CBD you would have 2.5 percent THC okay so that's just sort unning you a ratio of what it is from one to the other usually it's a CBD ratio but sometimes there are some strains that have more of a THC to CBD so you have to look at the label and you're not allowed in Illinois's you're not allowed to grab the product before you purchase it but you can always ask them to let you look at the label and they'll be able to put it on the counter or just hold it for you while you look at the label and you can see the actual percentages on there and compare them but this is just telling you the ratio so if it was a ten to one and you had let's say 30 percent CBD this would have three percent THC and that goes for edibles as well anything or everything THC CBD again if it was reversed and it was a more of a seat THC stronger strain that it would be the other way around instead of it being 30 percent CBD would be 32 percent THC and then three percent CBD okay so if you had 50% CBD you would have five and th see now 4 to 1 4 to 1 ratio if you had 10 let's do 20% CBD you'd have 5% th see again if it's a THC to CBD ratio instead of a CBD to th e ratio you just flip that around so this instead of it being 20% CBD would be 20% THC 5% CBD if you have 40% CBD you would have 10 percent THC now one to one is just an equal amount 50% if you had it's a stream of 50 percent C with D it would have 50 percent th see if you had 15 percent CBD we'd have 15 percent th see so again if it was reversed if it was a high C ah THC higher then it would be it'd be the same for this one but in these here would you just flip it around setup CBD here but we th see and then CBD here now you see on something like this you see it one gram or a thousand milliliters a thousand milligrams but it if you look here it only has CBD 729 milligrams in THC sixty-nine milligrams for a total of eight hundred and twenty eight milligrams cannabinoids not 1000 milligrams so that's the second part of this that'll be in a second video so don't forget subscribe so you don't miss out on that part of the big so if you have a twenty to one or similar CBD to THC and it's a high CBD with very little THC if you have a say 10 to one or somewhere around there 10 to 1 CBD to THC that's again still high CBD with low THC if you have closer to a 4 to 1 CBD to THC that's still again high CBD and but you're getting closer to a medium THC level if you have a 2 to 1 or a 1 to 1 that's more balanced obviously 1 to 1 is a equal ratio 2 to 1 CBD to THC is a twice as much CBD as it is THC but still more balanced normally with the high CBD to low THC strain you don't get as much of the effect from the THC just due to the fact that it's low THC and there's also studies out that say that CBD combats the psychoactive effects of THC they have a lot of strains out that are produced or crossbred just so that they can reach this 20 to 1 or 10 to 1 ratio CBD to THC but in oils like our a soul or edibles you can control that yourself by putting in more of one CBD strain and less of one THC strain or vice versa less of a CBD strain more of a THC depending on what type of cannabinoids you want to consume now just because you have a one-to-one ratio doesn't mean the numbers are gonna exactly match up you may have one to one CBD the THC and they'll have 10% CBD but that doesn't mean it's gonna have 10 percent THC could have a little bit lesser little bit more maybe 8 percent maybe 11% seem you know all for one ten to one it's not an exact amount so if you have four to one and you have 20% CBD that doesn't mean that you're gonna have five percent THC you may have four percent you may have six percent or if you had 22% CBD that doesn't mean you're gonna have five percent THC again it could be a little bit more little bit less well that's about it for this part of the bed you guys there's a second part hopefully you guys learned a little bit with me here don't forget like subscribe and comment if you want hope you're having a great day smoking off some good broccoli happy token", "Go3jQdaLQXA": "keys everybody I'm your friend marijuana max for years I've been teaching things about growing oil and different things water here's another one well we are what max makes sad well marijuana max makes ginger - such a big freakin deal okay here's what happened why I am made sad which brunet give him a quick go down on what do you think of the sad oh it's very nice it soothes it suits better than anything I've ever had it suits how many other different marijuana sizes and he tried about three about three different kinds yeah this was the best okay um I think it's more than three but let's go with this that wasn't me man and the reason I had to make sad this because I had some oil and it was four years old and I loved his smoke on it was very viscous and it started getting to the point finally where I was wanting to make some food out of it but instead of grabbing me Everclear to meet in strata I accidentally grabbed the ISO and so I had to make an ISO product base and then I used coconut oil to mix it in with real simple penises want you mix in a lotion or this or that thank you basic and simple coconut with a coconut cream oil coconut oil that's organic extra virgin coat a big old [ __ ] tub it's not too expensive okay let me take the oil you mixed it with ISL which makes it into a liquidy base and you mix it with the coconut oil all kind of mix it good you use a blender I you have to use my hand and just round it up the toes next up and then by that time I was viscous I poured it into here and then put it for sure now the same thing goes with making it easier simply these tensors that they're putting in food they're taking really crappy low grade stuff you can take a gram you know oil mix it with Everclear say ten to one and shake it up really good and you have yourself one hell of a texture use five dollars or five grams 0.2 0.5 holy [ __ ] twenties five point five which is one-half of a drop or four that on your in your drink on your food or something give you a nice buzz use more than that you hang it high you know you [ __ ] can drop before the law you know whatever you need but I'm just saying one dropper flow is going to be sufficient which brings us to make an oil today and it's lots of pretty oil help the cake to do or yeah I have one big piece or you see how I'm using the parchment paper I am getting it all up thank you sure you know one get as much as I can I'm just such a Jew I might be or so cheap but just trying to be frugal not be wasteful of all the oil on there and so I can see you're being crazy so if I got more than that it's also helpful to tape it all up to when you're grabbing it and you don't get it all over your fingers this parchment paper and you can do what you want with it but now it has to sit out and I put it in a jar but this is kind of a lot so the laughing good job anyways folks I say that you should vote to legalize marijuana getting involved in voting to legalize marijuana make sure you shave I don't shave coming here I'm gonna do a video anyhow what can I say well I can tell you more but that's about it for today vt LM", "T1tj62nRWf4": "waters up everybody and welcome back to another product review for today so check it out okay guys for this product review video I'm going to be trying some edibles and I know this is crazy because we don't really review edibles much on this channel now really quick before we get into this let me kind of explain why I don't really do a whole lot of edibles and it's not because I don't like edibles I love edibles okay the reason that you guys don't see a whole lot of edibles on this channel is mainly for the fact that here in the state of Oregon edibles is limited to 50 milligrams for recreational so anybody 21 and up you are limited here in the state of Oregon to only 50 milligrams now you can buy multiple you can buy multiple but that can get rather expensive okay that can get rather expensive especially when some of these edibles are like 15 20 25 bucks okay so 50 milligrams that's weak sauce I agree with you I know what anybody's gonna say in the comments section on this video they're gonna be like 50 milligrams that's [ __ ] that's weak sauce blah blah blah blah blah blah don't take it out on me please that is just what the state limits us and I can't really help that okay medical gets a hundred milligrams so if you're a medical marijuana patient you got your medical card you can get access to a hundred milligrams but that's still not much better okay because a few years ago before 2015 you could get like thousand milligram if not more you know like I had a 16 a hundred milligram edible lollipop once and it was phenomenal okay so before that before the legalization happened we used to be able to get all different kinds of stuff and they were very well priced so without further ado let's get into this edible review alright so for this review I have here this awesome rice krispie treats all right they are bite-size as you guys can see I rice krispie treats now I'm multiple because they're 50 milligrams each I have three here they were about six dollars for wreck or a recreational a little bit cheaper for medical of course so I bought three of them that's about a hundred and fifty milligrams total I still know that that's not a whole lot okay I know there's tons of us out there that'd be like like $500,000 but but I mean like he's not bad right not bad I could have just got one and been like hey guys here's my 50 milligrams it's gonna be great all right no but I got all three so I can at least feel something another reason why you don't see me do a lot of edible refuses because 50 milligrams 100 milligrams for me stuff like that it's not I'm not gonna feel it okay I have a high extremely high tolerance okay so I need those like four or five six hundred milligram edibles in order to really really feel it that's um I believe there was a person who wants to comment in my last edible video I did a long time ago and they said something like oh he got so high he forgot to come back and tell us how it was which is not true because the truth is is I kind of felt it a tiny bit a little bit so you know what I mean like for somebody who has a low tolerance for somebody who doesn't smoke a lot or doesn't take a lot of edibles stuff like that 50 milligrams is gonna is going to be right where you need okay 50 milligrams is gonna do the job if you're like a beginner or if you're somebody who has extremely low tolerance 50 milligrams is all you need but for us like me who dab all day long and smoke and all that kind of [ __ ] I have a high tolerance I have to at least get three of these even to feel like the slightest bit of a buzz okay so here we go we're gonna go ahead and get into these now these are the can of Krispies cannabis treats bite size 50 milligrams they take it says it takes about 60 minutes for activation that kind of ranges depending on the person depending on your body size stuff like that that could range that could be 30 minutes all the way up to an hour and a half of edibles to kick in anywhere in between there right I love that these are bite-size because I'm not one of those people that like to eat a whole [ __ ] [ __ ] ton of sweets just to get especially a small little milligram as 50 milligrams okay so I like that their bike size I really do if they would have not been bite size if it would have been like a big-ass chunk for only 50 milligrams I would have complained I would already instantly be downing this this review but the fact that their bite size is even better oh you can chase the canvas not much it's not like a strong taste but you can faintly taste it you can faintly taste it mmm all right let's get the rest these [Music] [Music] oh all right so I've eaten all three all right it's gonna take a little bit to kind of feel them if if I feel it because again it's only 150 milligrams which I should feel something right like you should feel something even if you do have a high tolerance should feel a little bit of something you know what I mean yeah that's just my opinion in my thoughts these were good they tasted great they're Bitesize I love it the fact that they're only six dollars to me they could be a little less than that that's the only kind of complaint that I have here with this product is the fact that six dollars for bite size little edible fifty milligrams it's alright it's alright it's a little push in it but it's alright it's still affordable okay Joe only because I remember back in the day you used to be able to get fifty milligrams for five dollars or less okay you know you know 100 milligrams ten bucks or less you know and so on so forth you know but not bad a taste great tastes like a good rice krispies it's got a little bit of an aftertaste to it you could definitely kind of taste the lead on the aftertaste like right now I can still kind of taste it a little bit like I could tell that it wasn't all just rice krispies hi if I was somebody who never had cannabis before I'd be like did you use something different in this recipe kind of tastes a little odd you know little little tinge maybe yeah you know that would be my reaction to because like I said the aftertaste you can taste a little bit however it's not a super strong pungent weed taste it's not one of those edibles that you'll eat and go oh you know what I mean it faintly tasted it's very mild okay overall it's a good edible it's definitely something I'll give a thumbs up for I will if it affects me if if I can feel a good high off of it if I can feel any kind of a high off of it really I will come back and do kind of like a follow-up for this if not then just know that I pretty much just did this review for the taste and you know the overall just checking it out you know what I mean it's not so much of the high alright because I like I said like I explained early in the video I need a little bit more than that for me personally and again this is just for me personally okay others it might not need that much and then other people might need a lot more so it depends on you depends on your tolerance and it depends on you know where you're at with your cannabis usage all right so much love guys I hope this video is somewhat entertaining and informational if you guys like this channel if you guys like this video if you like me hey remember to give it a big thumbs up smash that like button support this channel and please guys please please please consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and much love guys I hope you guys all have a very blessed very positive day or night wherever you're viewing this video from and until next time alright so it's been about an hour and 45 minutes and I'm feeling a little Spacey feeling it very mildly it's kind of a little relaxing it's a little creeping up if you will but I thought hey hey what's up the stakes a little bit all right shall we shall we up the milligrams now really quick let me just apologize for this being kind of an extra long video I'm sorry about that I will try my best to fast-forward through the parts of me eating so we'll kind of shorten the length now but anyway I got three more here now these are the cocoa ones okay so they have the regular ones these are the cocoa ones Cocoa Krispies and I got another three so it's another 150 for a grand total of 300 milligrams which some people might be like I am that's nothing that's that's weak sauce ba ba ba ba ba which yeah you know it is but whatever what we're gonna do it hmm so alright first one up here we go now again the same company this is the same company these are just the cocoa ones 50 milligrams each bite-sized edibles all right and you got to make sure that you get like all of them I'm sure all the little chunks and pieces don't let anything little pieces go [Music] you [Music] all right so there it is 300 milligrams I'm gonna come back in another hour hour and a half or so and I'll let you guys know how the effects are which should be a lot greater shouldn't be like super high it's not gonna be like uh like a Drunken level of high you know where I must like oh I'm so uh you know it's not gonna be like that however it should be you know I should be able to feel it pretty good should get a good you know nice feel from it so we will be back with you guys here at about an hour yeah about an hour hour and a half and we will see how this works all right so it's been about another hour and a half and feeling all right feeling all right a little a little more Spacey a lot more relaxed to feel nice and relaxed I could definitely fall asleep right now I could tell you that right now edibles are great for that in my opinion if you ever need something to help you fall asleep just load up on some edibles don't don't take too much okay don't take too much know your limits okay know what works best for you but I do love edibles I do love hi milligram edibles I should say and they're all all right there all right it sucks see if it takes so many just to get you know the milligrams that I took or more like that's crazy that you have to eat so much like if you're somebody who's just taking edibles you're not even smoking you're not even dabbing you're not even doing any of that other stuff and you're just taking edibles like this you're probably gonna be diabetic after the first like eight to 12 months okay I'm just saying just saying with how many you have to buy to get the correct milligrams that you need that's crazy okay anyway I hope you guys found this video entertaining much love please smash that like button show that support and hey if you'd like to see more content just like this thing consider subscribing to my channel right here at the Andrew lamb the one and only and I hope you guys all have a great rest of your day or night wherever you're viewing this from god bless and positive vibes everybody I'm out here [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh dang braid them [ __ ] go hey are we salad clouds around", "RybfqE03gmI": "Sometimes our digestive system can stand in\nour way. Now, what I mean by that is, when you take\nsome kind of oral supplement or an oral compound, you have a level of degradation that occurs\nsimply because your digestive system breaks things down. Now, does that mean that it's bad? No, absolutely not. Does it mean that oral compounds don't work? Absolutely not. That is not what I'm saying, but what I am\ntrying to allude to is the fact that if you have a specific area where you're trying to\nget some relief, let's say in the way of maybe some stiffness or anything like that, well,\nCBD can work in a transdermal topical form, and because it ends up skipping that oral\ndegradation and that gut biome degradation, you might have a better chance of relief at\nthat given area. You see, a lot of the pain in our body can\nbe indirectly or directly triggered by what is called inflammation. Now, one of the unique properties of CBD is\nthat it helps promote the healthy modulation of inflammation within the body. So, what that means is that it works upon\ninflammatory cytokines, things that would normally trigger inflammation, and a lot of\ntimes you'll have these inflammatory cytokines or have inflammation at a localized source. So, in essence, if you use some kind of topical,\nit makes it so you could potentially directly affect that inflammation at that very spot. You see, one of the major roles of CBD is\nthat it slows the cytokine production of immune cells. So, when you take it orally, you're working\nat a systemic level, but when you take it topically, you're working at the very topical\nlevel, although you do have some effect that still trickles down to the system overall. Now, additionally, CBD is unique because it\nactivates what is called the TRPV receptor. Okay. This TRPV1 receptor is also known as a vanilloid\nreceptor, and it controls a cell signaling protein, if you will. So, it controls this mechanism from the top\ndown, as far as inflammation is concerned, which is pretty neat. So, when you're looking, again, at the modulation\nof inflammation within the body, this could be a really cool way to target some of your\njoint pain, maybe some of your stiffness, things like that. Now, let's jump over really quick to a study. Okay, this interesting study was done on rats. Now, I know what you're thinking. Because it's done on rats, it's not applicable\nto humans. Well, no, it still is applicable. We could still take the common knowledge and\nthe common denominator from this study and apply it over to humans. So, this study took a look at rats that had\narthritis. So, they induced arthritis in their specific\nareas of their body, in their joints. Okay? Then they applied four days of 6.2 milligrams\nof CBD topical. Okay? It was really interesting what they found\nout, okay. They found that it significantly reduced the\njoint inflammation. So, what they found is that the joints, on\naverage, went from 72 millimeters all the way down to 65.6, in just a four-day span. Now, millimeters, we're talking small little\nrat joints here. So, that's a lot. So what they're finding is that the inflammation\nthat comes in from arthritis could be modulated by the CBD in this particular case. So, we translate that over to how it could\nwork for someone's given ailment as a human. You can see that there's a lot of potential\nbenefits. Pretty wild stuff. Now, the cool thing is, is that you don't\njust have CBD coming into the equation when you look at Octagon Biolabs. Okay, there's beeswax in the mix, okay, and\nbeeswax draws moisture into the skin, which is really interesting. So, it makes it so not only the skin is healthier,\nbut it makes it so that you're going to be able to hold in the compound a little bit\nbetter, as well. Additionally, MCT oil, which is going to make\nit so that there's a little bit more of a moisturizing effect, but also lavender oil,\nso there's a calming effect, and lastly, eucalyptus oil, which has a unique property when it comes\ndown to being antibacterial, but also being calming and potentially anti-inflammatory\nas well. So, when it comes down to utilizing CBD for\na specific thing within the body, a topical CBD might just be the solution for you. So, there are a lot of ways that CBD can affect\ndifferent things within the body from an anti-inflammatory standpoint, acting upon endocannabinoid receptors\nlike CB1 and CB2. But when it comes down to brass tacks, being\nable to directly impact where your pain points are, or directly impact where you're having\nsome bothersome issues, that might just be the quickest line from point A to point B.\nSo, as always, make sure you're keeping it locked in here with Octagon Biolabs. I'll see you soon.", "Ovhzu_HMJ1w": "everyone my name is dame santoro i'm a physician assistant to work with dr marco gresti and i'm going to be reading chapter 24 of his book tales from the couch so chapter 24 let's have a marijuana talk weed pot grass dope mary jane reefer ganja ash herb chronic there are dozens of names for marijuana for our purposes i'll call it pop of all the drugs that i have prescribed in 30 years of practice the drug i probably know the most about is marijuana why because so many people are on it they smoke it in blunts pipes bangers and bongs they make smoothies and drink it they take and they bake brownies and eat it it is everywhere so we are going to have a marijuana talk it is a political issue it is a cultural issue and it has survived being demonized in the media more so than any other drug and now it's the opposite marijuana is now the cure for everything right in florida i have the requisite medical marijuana license which allows me to write prescriptions for marijuana uh for specific diagnoses cancer epilepsy glaucoma human immunodeficiency virus post-traumatic stress disorder crohn's disease parkinson's disease multiple sclerosis and chronic pain at this point in late 2018 many states have legalized medical marijuana and some have legalized recreational marijuana as well do i think that there's a role for marijuana in the medical community yes i do would i rather prescribe marijuana to someone than give them a strong opiate like fentanyl oxycodone hydrocodone demerol morphone or methadone of course i absolutely would why no one's dying by overdose of marijuana there can be psychological changes and dependency but there are no dangerous physical side effects of marijuana pretty much no matter how much you smoke once you stop the worst issue i've heard of is difficulty sleeping for about 10 days after stopping you might feel a little restless you may be slightly irritable for those 10 days but that's pretty much it it's over to my knowledge i don't think there has ever been a report of overdose of marijuana contrast that with the current opiate epidemic where more than 115 americans are dying of opiate overdose each day the marijuana is much much safer it is useful in treating several medical issues and side effects in cancer patient it stops nausea and increases appetite it eases agitation calms rage in cases of post traumatic stress and it's a good pain reliever in cases of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis most of the people i prescribe it to are in their 70s or 80s with south florida's early population most of the people going into dispensaries are doing so on walkers and in wheelchairs there are definitive medicinal benefits with medical marijuana but there are some issues associated with it as well sometimes i call it the nothing drug here's why if you give marijuana to a young developing mind someone who is let's say age 14 that person's life is um course is altered um i go through this because i treat mostly young people i always tell them from the day you start smoking marijuana nothing happens your motivation drops off you think a lot of good thoughts about what you can do or what you'd like to do but you do nothing so nothing gets done that alters your life course dreams are great but the key is to act on them what would have happened if neil armstrong was a pot smoker since he was 14. i can tell you that he probably wouldn't have made that one step for man or giant leap for mankind another thing about smoking pot that comes straight from my patients who do when you use it you just want to keep using it because it makes feel good and there are qualities to marijuana that make people prone to isolation where they don't communicate with people as much think about it when uh when was the last time you went to a wild noisy raging party with people smoking pot no other drugs butt pot you may hear some woo-hoos but they'll be coming from the direction of the couch in my experience people who smoke pot waste a lot of time doing so it's the kind of drug that can be used constantly for hours and days on end because there's no concern of overdose there's a lot of time wasted no pun intended on thoughts not thought through and things left incomplete when i warn patients about isolation i often hear back that they do spend time with people that in fact they get high with people i tell them that they may think they're getting high with their buddies but that most of the time they're just getting high and playing video games or listening to music there's no real interaction in this way it's a very solitary pursuit a mental masturbation marathon another issue that uh pot is uh another issue with pot is that once you start it it's such a safe drug that it's never going to come to the attention of anyone that you may be in trouble this is because you will never be a problem you really don't fight with anyone you rarely drive fast and even more rarely cause accidents if you make it off the couch at all you tend to drive more slowly because you actually move more slowly you rarely excel at anything except maybe well smoking pot you definitely leave sports uh you don't want exercise and you spend more time indoors playing video games listening to music or just surfing the web that's why i call it nothing drug nothing really happens you don't really form relationships with girlfriends or boyfriends you don't really get involved in sports you don't do poorly in school but you don't do really well either you don't become very ambitious and you don't really follow through with things nothing happens when you ask a heavy pot smoking 17 year old what they've been up to they say nothing when you ask what they did in high school that week they say nothing when you ask them what they did over the weekend they say nothing when you ask them what happens at the football game they say nothing when you ask them what they do when they get high they say nothing now you get the picture bot is mostly about being alone being high and being out of touch you cause no problems as a matter of fact the last thing you want is conflict it would harsh the mellow so you avoid confrontation like the plague i had one patient named richard but everyone called him rip he was married 47 year old with two kids in college out of state he worked for monroe county in the keys as a maintenance supervisor every night he would come home pull into his garage and settle into his man cave uh conveniently located in his garage one day when he was when he just happened upon his bedroom he saw a note from his wife there it just said i am leaving you that's it he was shocked he immediately called her after a few rings she finally picked up with a curt what he said to her janice i just got your note what's going on if i you just got my note said yeah on what's going on she said rip i left three days ago screw you and with that she hung up rip had become so detached and that he didn't even notice that she left him three days ago i have another patient named ernest who is 68 years old he's on disability for chronic pain as i knew i would be writing this i asked him to come in today because he's been smoking pop for so many years and i wanted his perspective so this morning we got to talking i asked him ernest how long have you been smoking marijuana he said 50 years i've been smoking weed for 50 years i asked him uh well what has it done for you if anything he said i don't know if it's age or weed but i don't have the best memory anymore i have some trouble concentrating that's probably from the weed but then he surprised me he said that after 50 years he had decided to try quitting and that it had been 11 days since he touched it i was amazed and i congratulated him and asked him why he'd quit he said well the wife's been after me for years and i'm noticing that i'm not getting much done on my honey-do list and i just had enough and he continued you know i wasted my whole life i was a no show for my entire life when he looked out the window i saw it to leave his eye as he said i got a wife i raised two kids and as you know i've got this disability for damn near 30 years he said i got to thinking i don't know that i'm really disabled i think i just smoked so much weed that disabled me i couldn't get anything done i was a four to five joint a day guy i just spent my time burning in my garage maybe nobody dies from weed but i think it took my life fair to say that i lost my life to weed i have so many patients in my practice that smoke pot it seems like everything everyone does it's not a problem for any of them well it may not pose a physical threat as far as overdose goes i do see some issues when people use a lot of pod i have a patient named colt he's a 17 year old senior in high school when i confront him about smoking by tells me it's not a problem i always get good grades i replied even if you are getting a's and b's how much time do you spend getting high you study and you think school and friends is all all there is to life on weekends you go to the park and sit on the swing set and spend all weekend getting high what kind of life is that but colt wasn't bugging he maintained that it wasn't an issue so then he goes away to college over break he comes to me in a panic he told me that he failed out of college because when he got there his parents weren't around so he could get high all the time so of course he did and he wound up doing nothing blowing off classes and not studying when i asked what he thought of pot now he said he thought that maybe it was time to quit it smartest thing i ever heard colts say i've seen people who smoke pot for years and then stop and only after about two months off of it they developed the insight to realize that it was impairing them when you are smoking pot you lose that insight to see that it's like a vice on the brain that is nearly impossible to do anything of self initiative if a teacher or boss has learned that do this that can work but what's loss is the ability to initiate activities without being told without direction but also blunts again no pun intended the desire to have fun the desire to interact it numbs the emotions the feel good from pot replaces the feel good from life for chronic users it takes six to eight weeks to get it out of your system it can be detected for that long which is why so many people wind up getting tested positive for it even when they are told they are going to get tested um it is one of the most difficult drugs that i have um that i have in the practice i yearn test people who are getting controlled prescriptions in the practice and i would say roughly 30 to 40 of people smoke pot in the practice and nobody thinks it's a problem i try to educate people uh you don't think it's a problem because you cannot conceptualize that it's a problem until you are off of it for at least two months when you use you lack initiative drive and creativity your ability to determine time and how fast it's going is impaired your cognitive ability is impaired your judgment is impaired as to what's good for you and what's not and i'm not just talking about basic things like what shirt to wear i'm talking about major life decisions like would it be better to for me to go to law school or would it be better for me to do uh to go work as a bartender pot and big decisions just don't go well together they don't play nicely what the what else does marijuana do some people it causes depression for others it helps depression i have had some people that get anxiety from it and some people get less anxiety i've had some people who get a little paranoid from it and some people who don't there are more and more studies going on using marijuana the findings are a mixed bag excuse me good and bad some studies say that marijuana stunts brain development weakens the immune system and slows reaction time i read one study that found that it can decrease tumor growth which i found fascinating and of course if you're smoking pot you're breathing in particulates and smoke which can cause bronchitis and partic uh in lung cancer the hardest thing i have found is to convince people that marijuana has an effect on personality i really find that it does it makes people irritable when you ask them to do anything they have a general lack of interest they're emotionally stunted in terms of a fun standpoint their fun bone is fractured i think as society evolves marijuana can will continue to be more accepted but in general in population from 12 to 60 i don't think it's good for them because they get this a motivational syndrome their life course can be altered and they are prone to the personality changes described here i think maybe it's okay later in life when you were retired in severe pain if you have some chronic medical conditions that would call for its use but this definitely carries risk as a recreational drug if it's used quite frequently it can truly undermine someone's success in life in terms of learning in terms of career and in terms of relationship i'm sure that in the not too distant future marijuana will be legal for recreational use everywhere its acceptance rate is on the rise i've had many police officers tell me that now they have a fair amount of discretion when it comes to arresting people who are riding dirty with pot in their purse or car whereas 10 years ago they'd have gone straight to jail now they may just get a ticket if it's only a small amount found it's just confiscated and destroyed what a difference a decade makes i look forward to more studies on the medical medicinal side of marijuana i would i will continue to educate my patients on marijuana's use and abuse and i'm pleased that i can prescribe medical marijuana i really have seen it's been", "wosfPC7BrgI": "I've got a fancy plate so you know what that means it's time for a new mini episode of wheats the marijuana review show where we review edibles and help you make sense of your dispensary showing you which animals are worth your hard-earned dollars today we're looking at a new brand TK over edibles there are 200 milligram Bharani they proclaim it to be an award winner but don't tell us what award day one say award-winning best edible right there on the package no ingredients and no nutrition information very small brownie square tiny little thing very basic packaging so TKOs and they call it that because they sing it's going to knock me out but TV sends for technical so that is a very boring looking square ass browning smells like weed has a pretty high we'd smell or a pretty potent D weed smell I'm not optimistic to tell you the truth this nothing about the screams this is gonna be a good one it smells bad looks funky it's kind of hard but I'm willing to the doubt and it was affordable this was seven dollars at my dispensary for a what they say is a 200 milligram edibles so we shall see but let's give a taste no wait okay not good not good aroma yuck it's no koruba salted caramel or brownie but in this case guys looks we're not to see them it looks it tastes as bad as it looked there's a lot like weed there's a pretty great flavor very dry kind of stale taste in people it's not very big so yeah okay pepin back up here I have got to polish this off which is something I'm not looking forward to once I polish this bad boy off that's customary with our weeks many reviews I will come back to you guys in two hours and let you know how we're feeling and let's cross our fingers that work feeling pretty good because otherwise man I go in through some nasty food for no reason okay well with that I will see you guys in two hours and wish me luck I hope hope his ropes see you then hi guys I am back it has been 2 hours since I had the TK hoe edibles award-winner brownie and I gotta say it has been a pleasant surprise pleasant surprise it tasted pretty awful admittedly and while not quite a TKO it still packs a pretty good punch for a 200 milligram edible I'm pretty high right now I was not expecting this so maybe the awful taste was due to its onion advertised potency potent delicious every time is their catchphrase I can tell you at least one of those is true and at least one of those is false the third one I don't know so with that being said if you see a TKO edibles brownie in the dispensary near you it's affordable this cost me seven bucks and as long as you are not particular about taste as long as you are okay with the foul tasting edible give it a shot it's a potent edible for a fair price but if you're really really conscious about a flavor that's gonna be a hard pass so that's it for this review of weeks we will check you guys out on the next episode and thank you so much for watching", "ddreTjwG41k": "[Music] hello this is carrie hall america's healthcare advocate we're having an ongoing discussion today with dr kelly logan about the uses of medical marijuana so what we're trying to do here is educate the audience you heard doctors say in a previous video this is not about recreational use or getting high this is about treating chronic illness and chronic disease so we're going to talk about two issues here we're going to talk about arthritis and they're going to talk about digestive issues like ulcerative colitis crohn's and irritable bowel so doctor let's start with the arthritis issue and we talk about mixing cbd and thc can you define what that is and how that works absolutely so one of the things i really like is when you get into the medicinal side you can do different combinations of cbd and thc and they have different properties when you're talking about something more inflammatory like ulcerative colitis then we want to calm down the spasms we want to calm down the inflammation so there might be more cbd in there but then there's also some thc in there for the pain you know and so that is where it really gets kind of technical and fun for for us that are looking at really killing two birds with one stone right so when you're taking multiple medications for ulcerative colitis right you have an acute flare or you always have something going on right there might be a day where you have a flare going on and you do something that's more anti-inflammatory and you do something that's more pain controlling and so it's it is this nice combination between um this plant right that in the right ratios and that's what's really great when you get a good dispensary and you get really good people that understand the plant you can get okay we might need more anti-inflammatory here and a little bit less pain control but we might need more pain control and less depending on the situation depending on the situation depending on the diagnosis depending on the patient if you if you contrast this with taking prednisone which is a typical prescription steroid that's prescribed for ulcerative colitis crohn's irritable bowel this is a big difference and it does not have the debilitating side effects steroids are very harmful very harmful long term and so in something like ulcerative colitis when you do have to do a burst and taper of steroid right you do that long term then we're getting into other side effects of that yeah osteoporosis all of these different things you know and you have to really be careful about how you do that when you're doing plant-based medicine it's really more natural right so we're not dealing with those side effects we're dealing with that's the way the plant works the plant works as an anti-inflammatory and if you increase the anti-inflammatory portions and decrease the psychedelic or high portions of it you can get a really great mix there you have it ladies and gentlemen that's dr kelly logan she certainly knows what she's talking about thank you for listening here on america's healthcare advocate [Music] you", "eufPBD-K5yY": "so real quick just wanted to go over the street value versus dispensary value of some of these edibles here these edibles they are selling for about forty five dollars in the dispensary over by the Cape forty five dollars for 100 milligrams street value you can get them for about ten to fifteen dollars sometimes up to twenty definitely less than forty I've seen these go for as much as twenty as low as ten hundred milligrams there's a lot of them to a pack this one only has one left but there's a lot of these to the pack usually about fifteen not that strong the watermelon blasts over here the sour watermelons they're about 100 milligrams as well same thing ten to 12 ten to twenty bucks sometimes maybe a little more there's only about ten of these in a pack same thing missing a little bit when we bought ten of these in a pack and yeah street value of ten to twenty five ten to twenty what elbow but these are much want I don't know that are stronger two of these will have you feeling alright one if you're drinking if you don't do this stuff often I'll have you feeling good and then the CBD CBD can take you now from the THC high you can also help reduce anxiety and these things here I got from the amazing porn store down the street twenty five dollars for this pack he they're 100 milligrams it was five frogs in here 20 bucks twenty for whatever after-tax 22 I don't know 20 bucks 100 milligrams twenty bucks is cheapest ten bucks for one hundred milligrams as well you can pick these up almost anywhere Amazon that Bethany on your gas station pretty much anyway same price or similar pricing fifteen to twenty five so all around not a bad product what if you're going to dispensary for this expect the payable forty-five dollars", "Lc-unovivRU": "well I I think when you look at what are the pieces that will make me as healthy as I can be so to me adding CBD is really a beneficial piece I mean vitamins and minerals we all sort of know yes we do that a lot has to do with what we eat and when we eat and are we getting good probiotics I mean there's a lot of pieces to this but I think CBD because it potentially prevents so many problems that adding that in a very small amount you don't need a lot you know four or five six milligrams a day can be enough as a preventative to really help so you can get topical products with this creams lotions there's shampoos conditioners there's all kinds of applications that since you absorb it transdermally you're going to get small amounts through that and we don't really get much of that in our normal diet so when you look at okay it's you know it's neuroprotective it's anti-inflammatory it modulates your immune system it protects your gut it protects your heart muscles it increases cell energy it helps you recover after exercise so for athletes it can be a big deal because it can increase your performance and your body's capability

noting that hemp oil and hemp seed oil are sometimes advertised as the same thing but they have differences hemp seed oil differs from hemp oil in that it is manufactured from the seeds of the hemp

nothing to do with that I'm here to sell you some cars so thank you for coming and we'll talk about the Kia Sorento No so let's talk a little bit about about the role of cannabinoids so the title it was marijuana and we're trying to move away from the use of marijuana which was actually coined by the American government many years ago when doing their sort of initiation of this Prohibition period this extensive period of prohibition that we've had and so really the active ingredients in cannabis are cannabinoids so we're going to talk a little bit about cannabinoids and I'm gonna trying to explain to you the the role of this plant in in medicine as a medicine it is a medicinal tool and I'll touch a little bit upon the recreational aspects of things as well as we go along because I think that comes to mind with with the new rules that are coming up and changing in the near future so let's see if I can it works so we'll start out by asking the question what is pain because that's what we're talking about we're talking about the role of cannabinoids in pain management so pain is a physical suffering or discomfort caused by illness or injury it can be physical in nature it can be mental and often it's a combination of the two and usually it initiates with you know some offending aspect either a broken bone a pinched nerve something like that that message is then transmitted up to the brain through the peripheral nervous system first through the spinal cord afterwards up to the brain it's processed in the brain that's kind of the mental aspect of things so it's processed up in the brain and then there are subsequent messages that go back down to the painful area to try and limit the amount of pain and to activate inflammatory responses and healing process and other things that take place so that's kind of the the basics of what how pain works and really we can kind of divide pain up a little bit more so that we're all kind of start at the same foundation of what we're talking about so pain can be divided up into an acute pain process which some comes on really quickly lasts for usually a relatively short period of time it can be chronic it can be lasting forever it can come on slowly often it's indolent might be sort of a two or three out of ten or it could be higher but it's chronic it lasts for long periods of time and then we have components of the breakthrough pain and breakthrough pain basically are where you might have a chronic level with exacerbation it's a periods of really acute drops in between the chronic and that's sort of breakthrough pain the pain can be as a cause of either a muscle or a bone or something more Hardware origin from joints and muscles or it can be more visceral the GI tract for example attend and and visceral pain tends to be more squeezing and uncomfortable in that fashion and then it can be neuropathic as well and that's kind of what we're gonna talk a little bit more about today which is the neuropathic pain then your Pathak pain really is a result of usually excuse me some form of damage or pressure to nerves often will have some sharp or shooting type pain burning type discomfort it's often associated with inflammation and that's important to keep in mind the inflammation often makes the pain worse in this scenario alright it often tends to be chronic it and then it has subsequent sequelae of the pain being present such as fatigue or weakness and it tends to be one that's more it's harder to treat you know the the advils and the tylenols of the world don't tend to cut it for this kind of pain often what is the effect of pain so I don't think I've to tell everybody anyone this because I think you all have at one point another had some level of pain or discomfort you understand that it can be it can be quite frustrating it can cause anxiety and anger fear depression it can lead to poor concentration and memory that can have sleep deprivation and fatigue so pain is not just the just a symptom of pain but it has a huge rundown effect a sequela again from that so what are the painful episodes in myeloma it's often as so first of all pain is the most common symptom in myeloma affecting up to 80% of patients at some point in another the sensation which causes discomfort or distress and it's often a signal that the body is dealing with an injury or illness the brain gathers this information as I showed you the pictorial the earlier on it gathers this information it processes it and then it sends out signals and usually traditionally we think pain was caused because of a means of the body trying to protect itself right so it's a warning system to the body to not you know exert anymore I said you know pressure or downside to that area that's that's hurting so it's meant to be a protecting mechanism in there the common symptoms and complications of myeloma pain have a significant impact of course on the quality of life as we have discussed briefly and so controlling this pain controls can have a lot of impact on a lot of other aspects of your life including the sleep the anger the depression etc that goes with it all right so the pain that we get most often in myeloma is often associated with bony related pain it can be due to thinning out of the bone or osteopenia and it can be resulting from lytic lesions that are caused that may cause dull achy pain on an ongoing basis this is of course prominent in my little bit off and also president many other cancers I deal a lot with prostate cancer in my business and I see a lot of prostate cancer metastatic disease to the bone and bony related pain as a result of that so and it can be quite and very debilitating for for our patients you can end up with bony fractures and can these can be compression fractures in the spinal cord for example or they can be outright fractures of long bones femurs and and the arms and things like that so when you get to bony destruction you end up getting various different to quality of that itself so you can get high levels of calcium spilling into the blood and the calcium itself can go through and start to cause grief in the gastrointestinal tract so you can get abdominal pain vomiting nausea etc as a result of the hypercalcemia that takes place you can get peripheral neuropathies because of some of the drugs that we use to treat the cancers and then there are of course paraneoplastic syndromes or or there's proteins that are released from myeloma and in other conditions as well other cancers as well that can get deposited on nerves and irritate the nerves themselves and that's a kind of a neuropathic pain that that involves from that so traditionally when we treat pain inside say myeloma you might be treating the primary cause which is the cancer itself and then you might be also using painkillers and there are various different pain medications that we as physicians have in our material to utilize for for patients and these include things such as an anti-inflammatories that can involve things like Tylenol they can be things such as antidepressants such as a me trip to lean and and there could be neuro blue called neuro modulating agents such as gabapentin and carbamazepine and sometimes you use steroids to try and help with the pain as well and of course opioids are often used as well tylenol 3 with codeine or fentanyl which sort of has a nasty kind of tone to it in the recent because of what's been happening out there so these are great if they work but they don't often work and the problem also is that we can get Anne Shiell side-effects from treating with traditional pain medications so narcotics for example can result in constipation and I've seen patients who have had such severe constipation and abdominal pain that it can be very debilitating there housebound and they have a real difficult time managing it simply because of the constipation of course there is the the narcotics have effect on your on your central nervous system and they can make you you know dopey and difficult to drive and it's tired and sleepy so there are a lot of side effects some of the medications we use and and narcotics aren't the only ones right so the neuromodulators can do similar things and and even they try cyclic antidepressants can do the same sort of thing so they all have side effects that we have to monitor for as well and if you can find a balance between the positive effect of the medication versus the the downside the negative effect or the side effect then of course you have you have a winner right you have a pain medication that's working for you without a lot of side effects but often as I said that is not the case and then and you have to escalate it to try different drugs and different treatments and we also try various non drug treatments which are fantastic the exercise diet heat etc having having gone through that you do need to escalate things sometimes and the Canadian Pain Society has a treatment algorithm which in the last iteration has included cannabinoids so this is kind of a real breakthrough a real move forward I think in terms of our society and how we think about the use of cannabis in the treatment algorithms for pain so as you can see in this publication recently you start out with all the traditional ones and absolutely as a physician that's exactly what I want to do I want to try my patients on the traditional treatment first see if it works along with all the ancillary treatments is that we talked about with diet exercise etc you then escalate it if that doesn't work you might go to something that's a little more have more side effects possibly more risk but may have a benefit as well such as tramadol and opioids and when that fails this is when we start to think about cannabinoids and I'm going to discuss with you in a minute here what the rule what the evidence do to support that is and then of course there are a bunch of other fourth line medications that can also occur they can also be used sorry I'm just gonna keep an eye on my time here it can also be used for treatment when cannabinoids and other traditional medications still work as well and these are listed over here as well so plant therapy for pain management has a long-standing history you know them because you've used them alright so for example the willow bark gives us aspirin I would hazard to say that just about 99% of you have taken aspirin at some point in your life and that resulted in us learning about how that works in our body so when aspirin when willow bark derived aspirin and aspirin we went and asked what how does it work in the human body we discovered the assistant called the prostaglandins same thing with opium so the over the the poppy seed the opium poppy seed gave us morphine morphine is a drug again that you know in the narcotic family and we've got a bunch of synthetics that have come along since then but that was that's a pain medication that you are all familiar with or at least are aware of and that in fact resulted in us learning about the endorphins in our limb body and their can and the in kefflin system as well so we learned about that as well well cannabis is no different so cannabis itself you know which comes from the cannabis plant we have now started to identify the active ingredients I should say now it's known for many years but we're starting to learn more about them now but they're what the active ingredients are in this plant just like aspirin just like morphine alright so THC and CBD are two active components that are inside the cannabis plant that that we utilize for pain management we utilize it for a lot of other things too but we're going to talk about pain this has resulted in us actually learning about how that works and that's through the endocannabinoid system so the endocannabinoid system is extremely well studied really well known and teased apart down to the molecular and cellular level we have a really good understanding of this system and how it works we're now discovering how we can manipulate this system so that we can get better pain management and other benefits the cannabis has alright so as I said plants have a long-standing history and pain management goes back over three thousand years you know Egyptians have there's there's evidence where they were Gyptian relics dating back to the 16th century BC appear to have ascribed medicinal benefits to cannabis so when you look at it internationally there is some strong evidence of long-standing use of this plant and I won't go into why we have really kind of created this taboo around cannabis but it really there is a specific lineage of how this came about through through the American government we can discuss that one-to-one at some point it's a it's an interesting story so does cannabis have does does cannabis have any evidence for success in use and the answer is yes it does alright so I'm gonna give you the pro in the con so there is multiple randomized control trials which are in medicine we consider you know sort of the PSLV the source of treat of studies that are done and their multiples trials done in various different disease entities such as HIV or multiple sclerosis or chronic neuropathic pain and these randomized clinical trials have on the hall shown a benefit for the use of cannabis and these are just some of them listed up here there are there are there are many of my colleagues that would say well there's no evidence to support the use of cannabis and they will quote a number of articles showing that there's no benefits so I'm gonna try and explain to you why there exists some controversy in medicine and how we're getting about that controversy now but there is evidence and there is evidence to support the use of this of this plan what's interesting though is when it comes to plant therapy unlike traditional pharmacological therapies which have a single agent that we can often derive from a plant figure out what it is and then chemically synthesize it we often forget that in plants there are multiple active ingredients and so I'm gonna encourage you to start thinking a little bit open your mind up and think a little bit wider here then a single entity a single molecule and think about plant therapy the entire plant and I'll explain to you why I think that's an important component but for one thing for example the chemistry and composition of cannabis is such that there are over 70 different phytochemicals either plant derived cannabinoids that we know have similar cannabinoids that have similar sort of makeup - endocannabinoids that are in our own systems so they mimic chemicals that are already in our body so these are plant derived chemicals that mimic what we have in our body okay and there's actually almost 500 distinct different compounds in these plants and we're only starting to now understand and learn about them more and more but again the key ones that we understand really well are CBD and THC alright those are the two active ingredients that we understand better the thing to keep in mind is that some of the controversy that comes around the use of the whole plant is that the plant will change what it's growing how much THC it has the kind of CBD it has based on the climate it's grown in and the soil is growing grown in how long it's growing for etc so there are some properties which are that haven't been sort of standardized by nature and give us different and therefore they give us a different outcome in the plant and it's not a dramatic difference but it might be a slight difference enough to make one person taking it for one study respond really well and another person taking it for the same study but taking a slightly different plant derivative not respond as well so those slight differences can occur and they might be just the different type of plant types so we're understanding that now better in medicine and in science and so what we're doing is we're standardizing how we grow the plants and we're we're breaking down the plants chemically so we understand what's in them and that's what we're using for studies now so that we're actually making it more uniform making our product more uniform so that we can see what the true outcomes are in a more uniform manner when we when we enter into scientific experiments so so here's the real cool part about this whole plant right so I talked to you about THC I talked to you about CBD but there's a whole host of other components that we have now found that are very active in various aspects of disease so these are for example terpenes terpenes are what give cannabis the smell so THC and CBD don't have any odor you that's not what you smell so when you smell weed when you smell cannabis right what you're smelling is the terpenes and these terpenes by the way exist in a lot of other flowers okay so when you go in okay I'm I don't cook but if you go and haze various different herbs I don't cook well but if you go use the various various different herbs they all have different smells those smells actually the terpenes that you're either you're actually smelling so the terpenes exist in a lot of food groups that we consume daily now all right and they also exist in the cannabis plant it's also what gives the cannabis plant the smell all right some of these have actually been teased out and have been shown to have effects on on various different disease entities so for example there are anti-inflammatory actions there are anti malarial actions there are antibacterial act actions there analgesics or pain control actions there anxiety makes you calm Z down there they are various different they're sedatives etc etc so there's various different attributes that some of the these terpenes have and these exist in the whole plant so this is why I'm encouraging you to start thinking about hope therapy because imagine now you have THC and CBD which actually have very strong activity for pain control which I'll show you in a minute but you also have all these additional components in the whole plan but give you these other activities that help you with the pain and management or for that matter of fact it might be to help you with the sleep because you're having too much pain anxiety etc right so there are other components that help out in the whole plant in order to activate a lot of these components we need to heat the plant top and we need to heat it to a certain temperature to get the active ingredient out because the way they exist in the plant is as a is a carboxylated acid so not the way you think of hydrochloric acid but it's just a stable stable form at sitting in the plant and when you heat that it releases that the active component so this is why for example you know for generations people of for example smoked cannabis as opposed to you know just consuming so this is where juicing for example has some controversy around it because in juicing you don't actually heat it up you're actually using the unactivated format but there are some benefits that have been shown there as well anyway the reason I bring this up is is because I will talk to you a little bit about smoking and vaping and stuff just so you kind of have a sense of where where this medicine is going let me just switch gears for a second here and talk a little bit about the endocannabinoid system so that you can have an understanding of why it works so the endocannabinoid system as i said is really well studied we understand it well there are receptors there are at least two receptors that we're we have studied well called CB cb1 and cb2 receptors they're found throughout the body but the but the highest density is of cb1 receptors is found in the brain and in various parts of the brain but the most important thing I think to take away is that what's really interesting is that there are almost zero CB receptors and almost zero endocannabinoid receptors in the brainstem the brainstem is the part that controls our heart rates it's the part that controls our breathing so when you hear about a fentanyl death in the media the reason that fentanyl kills or carb fentanyl or other morphine or other things the reason that they kill is because the in kefflin system the the these so fentanyl etc have receptors in the brain stem so there are lots of receptors in the brain stem so when fentanyl hits the blood and then gets into the brain it goes to the brain stem it causes respiratory depression and the person then dies usually of a cardiac arrest because there isn't enough oxygen to go to the heart to allow the heart to pump and they die they have a cardiac arrest this is what causes death from morphine fentanyl etc okay cannabis does not have receptors in the brain stem you'd probably have to consume 30 or 40 truckloads full of cannabis to try and load up the brain enough and you'd probably not be able to do that right and even then chances are that you would just throw up and maybe feel sleepy and go to sleep so there are actually no recorded deaths from the use of cannabis itself in terms of respiratory depression I should say you know specifically the way we have seen with the fentanyl crises so that's the first probably myth that I would like to dispel because I think one of the evils of this plant that has been that has been sold is the fact that it can cause that it's you know a drug similar to fentanyl etc but it's not it doesn't have that same sort of ill effect all right so it's something to think about we also as I said have a really clear understanding about how the systems work fairly good I shouldn't say it's perfect right there's lots and lots of studies going on but we have some good understanding about how it works and so if you recall that hope Hathway from when payne got to the brain and then back in the brain you now have receptors for cannabis for cannabinoids and these receptors actually the the way cannabis works the way THC and CBD work is by blocking the signals from one nerve to the next so when the message comes up to the brain then one nerve cell now communicates with the next nerve cell and tells it this is a painful episode happening do something about it what cannabis does is it blocks that signaling between the two it down regulates it down plays it so you don't have as much activity going on so the interpretation of that pain or pain itself starts to minute diminish right so this is how we feel this is one of the mechanisms of how cannabinoids work it works in the brain to slow down that that transmission of information so that you don't feel the pain so you get pain relief alright the other way that it works is in the peripheral system so we there are there are cb2 receptors remember I told you the cb1 and cb2 receptors there are cb2 receptors that are all over the body and the main area that they sit on is in our immune system where inflammation occurs so when you now take cannabinoids into the system one they go up to the brain and stop that that flow of bad information or information of pain and two it goes to the inflammatory system and it down regulates the inflammatory system and inflammation we know releases a bunch of chemicals that cause you to sense pain to feel pain and makes the pain worse especially neuropathic pain so by doing this in a two-fold manner what you've done is you've decreased the the central nervous systems interpretation of the pain you've also decreased inflammation in the peripheral nervous system so overall you're diminishing the amount of pain but also think about this there are significant other advantages here why because we know for example that some of the receptors in the brain work on anxiety areas so it's an angle it ik it makes it calms you down so it's nothing like being in pain gets you all wrapped up and anxious but but a cannabinoid can go in there and work on that system as well to create less anxiety what about sleep because when you're in pain you certainly aren't able to sleep partly because of the pain but probably because you're thinking about your pain and thinking about everything else too as a result of that well we know that cannabis or cannabinoids also work on some sedation and they work on similar pathways as known entities such as our sleeping medications that benzodiazepines right so see racks and a bunch of other sleeping pills that we that we as physicians prescribe our patients to help sleep it works on the same sort of a system so it helps with a sleep component too so all of a sudden you have a plant-based product that has multiple components that have multiple activities and this is why some of some of the the naysayers you might say in medicine and science say well this is like snake oil it works on everything how can it work on everything well the reason it isn't really working on everything but it's working on the root controller right it's kind of working on your CPU your main your main information in your computer so rather than working on a whole bunch of different lower-level instructional things it's working at the brain center of it all so it controls a bunch of other processes as a result of that so that's the way to start to think about the WYD has multiple effects in multiple different disease processes it's not because it's snake oil it's because it really works at a higher level before all the other disseminated pieces of information get down into the body okay like any medication like any plant it has side effects this is not a benign drug right we have to treat it with respect so even though I'm telling you it's a very safe plant derived medication and it is there are side effects and we must be cognizant of these just like any other medication you take from tylenol to advil to morphine to anything else right these are some of the side effects that we see commonly when we use it and these are primarily due to THC less so due to CBD CBD doesn't tend to have as many side effects but you can see things such as you know drowsiness and fatigue nausea and a whole host of side effects that occur luckily these side effects are not are generally not life-threatening these are not life-threatening side effects that you see but they do have side effects so anyone that says it's a completely clean drug and won't have any side effects they're lying right so you it does have side effects to be aware of the other argument that's used by a lot of my colleagues is well cannabis is a gateway drug no it'll get you addicted and and you'll start taking I don't know cocaine other things right so there are multiple levels of arguments that that that you can use against this but one of the interesting things is that there are some great amount number of research articles that are in published now showing what the dependency so we'll put gateway drug into sort of the dependency category but there's a bunch of other arguments you can make about it not being a gateway drug including a bunch of really good research out of the Mayo Clinic but the butBut the dependency part is really interesting because this is really interesting publication here as you can see you know in terms of dependency you can see where it fits in the schedule of things right so you have things such as codeine and and morphine etc the opioids which are higher than than cannabis alcohol significantly higher cocaine obviously and then even nicotine cigarette smoke very very addictive so if you really put it in the in the larger scheme of things you can see how the dependency of cannabis and especially when it's used in medicine and there is a big difference there especially when it's used in medicine is almost you know it's very low it's not non-existent but it's very low right and so when you look at the overall harms it certainly falls on the lower lower rung of that of that ladder of problem automatic drugs that we have in medicine let me just diverge for a second and talk a little bit about the about use of recreational versus medicinal so I'm gonna get through a couple of controversial thoughts that I want you to think about okay so I know when I've had a hard day in the or and you know and I need to go home and relax a bit I'll pour myself a scotch and that helps me relax that's alcohol so when Joe down the street goes home and lights up his joint or vaporizes because he's had a hard day at work he's also using the same sort of a chemical as he to chill out probably true the you know the important point that I think to make is that we have stigmatized cannabis in some pretty nasty picture right at times and and I'm not saying it's not without cause I mean there's obvious obviously that's two sides to every coin and I'm not saying that we should bury our head in the sand and say no this is a perfect perfect drug it's not at all but if we if we utilize this drug in a smart way we can we can take Joe and we can learn from Joe because maybe I shouldn't be drinking alcohol which is a class 1 carcinogen rated by the World Health Organization alcohol you know versus cannabis which is not a carcinogen right so maybe I've got something to learn from Joe and something I can think about right so just a controversial thought to see it in your brain the other thing that I want you to think about also is medicinal versus recreational use so in medicine and I'll and I'll be one of my last slides we'll be going over this but in medicine we used about 1/10 to 120th the amount of cannabinoids in medicine than a recreational user we use so a recreational user will try their their goal a recreational users goal is to get maybe high right in medicine our end goal is not to get high we consider that a side effect the the end goal is to actually treat the symptom treat the pain right so I'm losing my mic you guys can hear me ok so so we have different end goals and different amounts of the cannabis or cannabinoids we're using so when we when a recreational user smokes let's say they vaporize some cannabis they're gonna get about 10 to 20 times more of THC than we would ever use in medicine so for most my patients and by the way the average age of my cannabis cannabinoid patient is I did I just looked at the numbers last week is 71 so that's the average age of people that I'm treating with cannabis right so it's not the 30 year old coming in to want to get high right it's it's a genuine pain related and or muscle spasms sleep anxiety etc so that's the average age of patients we treat but the important thing is that the amount of THC or CBD I'm giving them is about 120th what a recreational user uses ok routes of administration so if you think about let's just think about fentanyl or morphine when you're in the hospital and you're in pain I just I don't know I I took out a kidney stone from you and you're in a lot of pain I might be inclined to give you IV morphine will give you some some morphine through the IV and within a couple of minutes you're gonna feel better ok but but when you go home you know I can't you can't go home on your IV and you can't keep feeding you IV morphine so maybe if I'm a traditional physician I'm gonna give you you know fentanyl patch or morphine or oral sulfate or some other form of oral or transdermal means of giving you the pain management or a pill right so there are different forms or activities that we give people already so cannabis or cannabinoids are no different there are different ways that we can introduce it to a patient for either acute use we're in a lot of pain or chronic use where you're where you need a low level of activity throughout the throughout the day so smoking or vaporization and I'm gonna tell you why I think smoking is horrible but let's say vaporization has a very quick onset within five minutes you have pain pain activity going on but it has a relatively shorter duration to 2 to 4 hours in your system and then it wears off all right so it's got an advantage in that if you're having an acute crises lots of pain you're getting in the medication right away oral on the other hand is something that takes longer to absorb Oh step back sorry am i leaning too much okay I'm sorry oh that's way better I can hear myself now so oral oral treatment works differently in that it takes longer to absorb it's got to go through the GI tract it's got to get absorbed into the bloodstream it's got a pass to the liver and then it gets to your system and so it takes longer to get into your system but it lasts longer six to eight hours right so it gives you that nice longevity and then there's other formats right so whether it's sprays in the mouth or transdermal patches or creams etc those are not as consistent in terms of their absorption profiles right and that's true for any medication not just cannabis all right so smoking smoking heats the cannabis up to anywhere between six and nine hundred degrees Celsius it gives off carbon carbon monoxide during their during the smoking process and it potentially may give off cancer-causing agents that are in in this plant that are being burned off now having said that we don't have any studies and it might just be because we haven't studied it adequately but we don't have any studies showing that cannabis causes lung cancer like we do for nicotine okay but maybe it'll come in the future so I don't have the answer to that so I think the safer way to go about this to say you know smoking cannabis will have the same sort of effect that nicotine might all right so it gives off cancer-causing agents the other problem is that when you smoke cannabis you lose about 30% of your cannabinoids so 30% of your cannabinoids don't come out don't actually get absorbed into your system so if you're paying I don't know four or five dollars you know per gram or whatever it is you're losing 30% of your medication right on the other hand vaporization has a much you can control it better you can heat up your cannabis or cannabinoids to a certain temperature and you get very little of the toxins coming off and you absorb a much higher amount of that medication all right so when we start to introduce our patients and usually it's two oils that's how we start most of our patients so but let's say that they're having acute crises and they're willing to try vaporization then that's the right direction we go for quick-quick absorption versus smoking which we discourage all right so driving in cannabis I just thought throw this in because I think this is an important thing to think about as well like any other medication cannabinoids are also a medicine also need to be treated with respect you can have it it's you may have some level of sedation when you take cannabinoids especially if you're taking THC for inflammation and pain it might make you sleepy when you're driving and stuff so bottom line is if you feel impaired don't drive don't operate heavy equipment don't do what you you know wouldn't normally do if you let's say if you were really tired you've been up for 48 hours and you're really tired well you wouldn't drive hopefully right or you went out with a bunch of friends and you had a bottle of wine you would drive so treat cannabis in no different way in that way be safe about it right if you know that you're that it's affecting you making you sedated then don't then just don't drive right so some of the things that did I touched upon let me just kind of give you a quick overview that I'm going to give you some some interesting take-home points here so we talked about cannabinoids and how their whole plant therapy is very beneficial because they're there they're a bunch of other terpenes and other things within the whole plant that have benefits have multiple benefits we talked about the fact that when we when we understand cannabis we understand the endocannabinoid system when we understand the endocannabinoid system we have a new system in which we understand how the pain nerves are being modulated how Sleeps been modulated how anxieties being modulated we talked a little bit about what pain was and the kind of pain that cancer can cause and the bony pain which is often inflammatory in nature or fractures and therefore cannabis having both essentially acting ability to surpass pain but also peripherally acting on the inflammation way of suppressing pain it's a it's a it's a great drug to be able to use a medication to to use for pain control and then we talked a little bit about the safety aspects of cannabis as well as I mentioned to you I highly discourage smoking I think there's multiple reasons including the fact that you don't get your medicine properly and that there is potential for cancer which you don't have evidence for but it there is potential that the fact that THC that the THC content that we use to treat pain is about one tenth or one twentieth or less than the recreational user in our practice when we prescribe cannabis we start low very low and we titrate up to get your pain management if you start to get side effects you're getting too drowsy you're getting high you're feeling couch locked or any of these side effects these are side effects of the medicine we say okay that's dial it back we have to try either a different approach or a different combination with CBD and THC because CBD does not by the way cause all those side effects so all the side effects were talking about are THC driven right so that is the sedation etc so we then change the ratio of CBD to THC and we get something that fits correctly for the patient we talked a little bit about yeah so so basically the effects of the high we talked a little bit about the recreational user versus the medical user we talked about the safety aspects and the fact that the that the brain stem does not have receptors for the cannabinoids and so it's very safe we talked about the driving issues as well so just I want to just end quickly with how the process works sorry I hope that projects okay but basically the way that that medical cannabis is being administered at this time before legalization and I and I can I can't see why that would change after legalization is currently the patient would go to their family doctor have a discussion with their family doctor about about the potential for one to try cannabis there are a bunch of resources that we are happy to provide the family doctor who may say I know nothing about it I don't think it's a good idea we are happy to educate our colleagues as well to help them understand where cannabis fits in all this once you've had that conversation either your family physician would then go ahead with the process of getting you're registered with Health Canada if they're comfortable doing that if not they would refer you to someone who does that so for example we run a clinic that does that so we would get a referral from the family doctor then one of our physicians would then see the patient do the evaluation make sure that there's they're appropriate for this one of our counselors would sit down and talk to you about what cannabis is how to use it where to get it all that kind of stuff so one important thing here is that dispensaries so there are lots and lots of dispensaries out there I'm sure there are some fantastic dispensaries some extremely knowledgeable individuals in these dispensaries but at this time dispensaries are not the legal Avenue to obtain cannabis so until we until the laws change the only place that you can legally get cannabis is through a licensed producer and a licensed producer does not have a storefront that is Health Canada's ruling so the licensed producers when they get the the information from the doctor to them they will register you you will order on their website and they will ship to you directly to your door the cannabis the cannabinoids okay the oils and the plants so at this point in time that is the only legal Avenue to get it all right I think there's I'll take that in a second and I think there's like as I said I think there's there's lots of dispensaries that are very helpful and probably have very good products but we can only speak to the legal route right now and that's the only legal route right now you had a question about that I think yeah so so growing your own is absolutely possible yes so I can I'll I'll take that into the question answer I'll just I'll just end quickly by saying that once that information is gathered we we then fax a letter into the licensed producer and you're registered with Health Canada to be able to purchase the cannabis off the websites and they get shipped right to your door the actual container that you receive it in that is your your evidence of licence as long as you leave it in the container that is how you show that you have a medical license or medical letter to use cannabis for medical reasons okay so I'm gonna end with that for now this is basically what I was just saying right now and this is just our contact information but we're not the only game in town I'm not here to promote us particularly I'm just saying that there that you family doctors can do this there are lots of physicians who are comfortable than doing cannabis work and and you can choose any any condition that can help you with that but we're helping we're happy to help through that process as well so I'm gonna end my talk there but I'm gonna take that question right off the bat and before I take other questions is that okay do I have time to take some questions okay perfect so yes you can grow for yourself again you still need it to be registered through Health Canada so what you do is you go to the physician the physician would write the letter now instead of me faxing it to the licensed producer so that you can buy from them you would then get a hard copy of that letter saying I'm authorizing you to grow or I'm giving you the letter to grow you will then take that letter with the application that's available online and you send that to Health Canada and then something happens in that black box and you get back a little sort of certificate saying that you are allowed to grow that and so that is the current yes you can do that of course that medicine is only for you and it's not to be subdued and sold and passed on to your friends or anything like that right so that's the whole idea of self growing and and so yes that is still available come legalization as I understand it you'll be able to have up to five plants I think it is per host two plants okay I thought is five plants anyways is this any way Health Canada or they will they will define exactly what that will look like you know with with legalization as well yeah sorry I didn't hear that okay so so yeah so so yeah absolutely as long as you repeat the question sorry so so the question was is there an advantage to to putting it in tea so this gets back to juicing so juicing and teas so tea is difficult because teas you have to really heat up you'd almost have to boil the cannabis it to create the tea because you need to heat it up to that level in order to activate the cannabinoids and then you can consume it in a liquid form at cannabis and cannabinoids are not water-soluble generally they are oil soluble so tea might be more difficult to actually get your medication into your body effectively right and it's gonna be erratic one day you'll have lots another you might not have enough so I think it's not a safe manner same with juicing like juicing basically works on using THC a so that's the acidic form and your and your and your extracting that but again we don't have clear evidence of where th CA and CB da fits in the pain management but more so we don't know how much and how much of it you absorb because it's liquid or acidic format versus an oil format yes yes you'll have the same sort of okay so sorry so I'll just repeat that quickly the two questions were how do you know the dosage when you're growing your own and the second one was there's other formats such as suppositories that maybe you can take and and whether that changes the side-effects I'll take the second question first and that is when you do a suppository yes that is a great way to absorb it it's just another mucosal surface just like your mouth but the side effects will be the same so if you're absorbing the medicine the medicine is what's causing the side effects you'll still get the side effects whether it's done it should be the same because it's whether you're absorbing it through the mouth or through the rectum it should give you the same effect but there are some local pelvic absorption that takes place in a different format so there might be some subtle differences I think it's individual to individual for sure but so there is some benefit to it you know right and then in terms of the dosage so that's where you need to go see you know like a cannabis clinician who can start you out in a very low dose and usually for growing we we anticipate where you might get to based on your history and what you've told us and everything and we'll say we think you're gonna get to this and so we'll we'll make sure that you've got enough of a plant count tips to get that and then we back it down and say don't take that much right off the bat start low and work your way up the ladder to get to the dose you want to get to okay I'll be around I'll be around afterwards and so I think we're running short on time and I'm happy to take questions as well and answer any questions you might thank you very much good for you", "7Yp8jcpOrz4": "hi friends I just wanted to make a video because I've had lots of questions about CBD and what it is and what I'm doing with it and I'm super excited about it so I thought I would make you a little video give you a little more background on me and what our company is and a couple products that we have that I use every day that are amazing so a little background on me I've been a massage therapist for about 13 years worked for a few chiropractors I worked in a couple high-end spas i worked at wellness center here in Fort Collins I've treated a lot of pain I've treated people that have been in car accidents I've worked with people that have spinal issues that have hormone issues that are just seeking a kind of relaxation or general kind of support for their body to feel better um I've done a lot of bodywork given thousands of massages worked with athletes pregnant women everybody so with that being said my clients kept telling me about these hemp CBD oils so I was curious and I did a little research so CBD is the non psychoactive component in cannabis it does not get you high however CBD has been medically researched and research shows that it's great for pain it's great for inflammation it's antibacterial they're just really you know I just can't say enough about it and from my own use so I use the salve every day I love it so this is our EBR salve it smells really good it's got a little sweet orange and lavender so it's just kind of light and fresh and relaxing so with that being said this is all organic raw ingredients no GMO our oil comes from hemp we're building a few greenhouses in Spokane Washington and I know that some of you have asked me about if it's tested if it's really organic and I can't say enough about the quality the purity the strength of our oils we're actually tested by a company the best company for this kind of thing in the u.s. called trace analytics out of Washington so if anyone needs more information about that please reach out to me a lot of why I chose this product and and why I researched this company was because I wanted to find someone or a company that really wanted to help people um with with this hemp CBD so that being said our products are legal in all 50 states they're very cool so the salve amazing for muscle stuff for for headaches for migraines for anxiety for just kind of general brain support it's great for supporting the nervous system so the sap is a really good way to just try something if you're not interested in ingesting the oils we also have pictures should I take every day I think they're awesome and they're actually they taste pretty good I don't know some of you have had tinctures or not but some of them are very bitter this one is not just kind of a sweet oil super yummy oh yeah so that's good for anxiety it's good
