with all your 510 thread mod batteries now I actually received a lot of emails and some comments from you guys that said hey you've done a unboxings and detailed you know talk abouts on all of your adapters except for the ozone and I thought we made one but we didn't so here it is we're gonna go jump right into the ozone and for the first time on today's today's episode we are going to bring in a guest who is going to then show you guys exactly how it works because we've actually our customer service team has received a lot of calls on how to optimize the usage to order so it show you exactly how easy it is to use this tank and really some of the most effective uses for the tank so you're gonna get your ozone box and then you're also gonna have a mod battery now the ozone tank they say are my mod batteries compatible with the ozone or what do I need to look for it's really simple you need to make sure first of all that your mod battery is a 5-10 thread most mod batteries on the market I would say about 97% of them do use a 510 thread that will work with the ozone so you need to pick a mod that is power adjustable or at least power adjustable within a range so you can set the wattage either up or down for example this is one of our honey stick batteries or defender series most mods are five clicks on five clicks off so you can plus or minus and adjust your power level which is important because the ozone tank has a couple of features where if you run a certain wattage it has a very light vaporization and you are in another water and it gets into more of a combustion style a vaping experience so and we will jump right into that as well so you get your tank now let's go over the kick contents here you're gonna have your ozone tank you're gonna have two of these spare silicone mouthpieces these are really good if you if you're let's say taking this out and sharing or if you want to keep your stainless steel mouthpiece clean you know these come in to come very handy see you have your mouthpieces you have a really cool honey stick band which actually has two uses which I will tell you guys about you have a extra spare mouthpiece filter which goes in between your mouthpiece and your tank which I will show you shortly you have some wicks for a technique called wicking which we will do in a separate video about Pro tips two extra replacement gaskets which are the gaskets that go in between your glass and your bottom base for the coil so how do you use the tank first of all you're gonna take it you screw it in to your 510 thread mod battery make sure it's a nice hand tight you don't need to over tighten it then you're gonna lightly wiggle the glass off the very first time you get your tank it might be a little bit tight to know if you have the base screwed in and you gently wiggle side to side it'll come off just fine now once your gaskets wear down from use the two black gaskets that I showed you you will just simply take those two rubber gaskets off with a pair of tweezers simply slide those over and gaskets will be good as new a lot of people have asked us questions to our customer services do I have to find grind up my dried herbs or do I just put them in in the nug form how do I fill up the tank and how much fills this tank up so here's the best way to do it you do not have to find grind the herbs up but just pick them apart so that they're not all clumped together in very small pieces and you want to fill up the bowl to where it's about 3/4 full and you do not want to pack the bowl tightly you want to have a loose height so that air can still flow and circulate around the bowl and when you draw on the inside of the bowl that you don't have it so tightly knit that the smoke doesn't the vapor doesn't come up so once you have it nice and packed up gently wiggle your glass back on and now going over to your plastic mouthpiece there's two ways that you can use your plastic mouthpiece you can either drop it right in to connect as an attachment to your existing mouthpiece or you can just completely pull your mouthpiece out and drop in the little plastic one that's in case if you're sharing if you don't like the metal mouthpiece for some reason you can do that now as you can see in there that's where your little replacement metal Gorillaz we gave you an additional grille just in case if you break or damaged that one but there should be really nothing wrong with that little metal grille and in the event that does get clogged you can simply use a unfolded staple or the tip of a needle to just simply poke out any particles that might be stuck in there and make sure that you're getting good airflow or you can just take off the glass and just soak in an isopropyl alcohol for about half an hour all the little particles should dislodge make sure it's nice and dry and then you can clean it so once you have it all set up you would turn on your mod battery and then we would talk about the desired wattage settings so this tank has an operating range of 15 watts to 28 watts so that means if you're going over 28 watts you run the risk of burning out your coil now we do sell replacement coils which is basically this bottom bowl assembly which is the electrical end of the unit so if you do burn it out you can buy replace and ones on WWV pani stay calm so at 15 watts which you have is a very light vaporization when you operate the unit you would set it up to the desired wattage so let's say it is 20 watts and again like I said don't take it above 28 watts so we said 220 watts now people say do I just push the button and start inhaling on it no this is a ceramic bowl unit so with ceramic bowl units the heat up is not instantaneous so what I tell people to do is to push and hold the button down for five seconds and most mods as you see have a little timer there so once that timer gets to five seconds that's when you start inhaling continue holding the button for the remainder of the timer and start your inhale only after the five seconds and continue inhaling and then let go once you're done inhaling now do keep in mind that most mod batteries have a 10 to 14 second timeout function on them so that means there in order to continue going you have to release the button even if it's for a millisecond and then push back down to continue the heating cycle it's a safety feature that we put into our mods and most other vape manufacturers do put into theirs so you don't have to worry much about it now if you want to see more vapor that comes out that is a little bit closer to the combustion side or dial up the intensity this mod battery of ours goes up to 25 watts now other mod batteries can go higher than that and again like I said 28 is your cap but if you run it up to 28 you're gonna get a more rapid heat up you're gonna get a little bit more of combustion so you're actually gonna see and visualize the smoke and not just taste the the kind of clear transparent vapor it's gonna be more dense and intense and but it is gonna go through the herbs faster some people say do I have to move around the herbs well this unit heats from the bottom and because it has a ceramic bowl it does project the heat from the outside so it tends to burn will burn pretty evenly but what people should do is once they've taken a few heating cycles on it is they should look to see how the herbs are discoloring and either kind of moved them around you know just stir them up a little bit or if they've been completely discolored then you simply empty it out and you can refill from there now good way to keep your bowl clean just use those little surgeon swabs or isopropyl wipes and just very gently clean around the edges and the bottom piece or use a q-tip dipped in isopropyl alcohol so this little unit is definitely a real good budget way if you have a mod battery already or you're looking to get into drier vaping but those concealed and closed off one-piece units aren't for you so for this and several other cool items jump on to WWE Pawnee stay calm but if you want to stick around for us to show the demo of how to how this unit really is in action with one of our brand ambassadors who works here at honey stick then stay tuned because I'm bringing her in right now so for you guys that stuck around for our demo this is Tosh a KA honey girl you're gonna see a lot more of her popping up on the channel keeping you guys up to date on events and happenings here at honey stick and for all you in the biz guys you're definitely gonna catch her at a lot of the trade shows we're gonna be doing to help promote our products in the biz so introduce yourself Tosh thank you for watching and I'm Tosh and I get to be dance assistant today so we are going to show you what's up all right well a lot of our users that were watching a lot of our honey stick subscribers they're interested today in our ozone tank is that a tank that you've you've tried out before out of our product line which one's your favorite honey stick product just while we're well while we're at it so people get to know a little bit more about you my favorite well right now the minimax is I don't go anywhere with so minimax whoa whoa whoa okay okay keeping it concealed that's one of our latest models actually posting so much about it I feel like people are probably tired of seeing it but it's just perfect for like my lifestyle people are never tired of seeing honey stick and we're gonna show them a little bit more right now so okay so have you seen these batteries we actually just put them up on the website today these were part of our little skunk works program here we like to you know we keep a close lid on at just the product development team but right now we're actually releasing this today and you're gonna use one of these for your demos so so pick a design that you like that you think is appealing the blue camo one of my favorites too so grab that and grab one of those ozone tanks that we have over there for you so you're just gonna simply screw the tank into the end piece right there if it's a 5-10 thread like a lot of our other products exactly so now what I would like you to do is just hold the battery and then gently wiggle the the top piece off to detach it from the base the little glass piece so you can work on filling the tank there you go perfect so just set that down and then what are you be vaping on today I am I have here my lights and this is CBD heard THC free no I got a check that's gotta be th see if Korea for a publicly traded company and channel all right all right you're good all right and it's work hours here guys we're not trying to you know it is Friday but I we're not trying to have that much fun here honey so we've still got a job to do all right so now what I'm gonna want you to do is just take enough of the little herbal lights out and you don't need to grind them up or anything like that just loosely pick them apart and basically you're gonna want to have enough to fill this up about 2/3 at 3/4 of the way he's my boss I have no choice she has no choice she's signed a waiver yep and what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to push them down gently but not pack it up too tight all right I think that's perfect just push it down gently there you go all right then you're gonna put the top back on push the button 5 times to turn it on turn on the battery like most of our mod batteries and Sarah you guys see it blink go through the welcome screen now what we're gonna do is let's set it up to the max this battery as I explained in one of our other videos is 25 watts so take that plus sign and keep pushing it until you get up to 25 you have to 2525 alright so the procedure that I like to tell people to do when they're utilizing this product is because it's a ceramic it does take a little bit longer heat up so heat up is not instantaneous but what you do lose in heat up time you will make up for in flavor so this is a cold tank so on the very first cycle you might not get as good of a draw but it's a 2 or 3 cycle tank so you're gonna push and hold the button toss for 5 seconds but don't inhale on it then once you see the timer go to 5 then you inhale for the remainder of the 5 seconds right and then exhale and then repeat exactly because most mod batteries they only stay on for 10 to 14 seconds this one has a 10 second timeout it's a safety feature so you just get pushed and holding when you see it get to 5 continue pushing holding but only start inhaling when the timer gets to 5 or 6 so push and hold then once it gets to 5 or 6 then you start inhaling and then the second one should be better because now the bottom of the bowl so what you want to do is once the Bulls heat it up a little bit you followed up immediately and it should be better we're gonna talk about her reviewing the taste of whatever she's doing on a social media channel probably you get you getting any flavor off of that I could feel yes so the heat up time is a little bit more rapid you see she's not waiting the full five seconds not this specifically I'm joining her vaporizer but I have before and you do get a look at a sty realize that so you're actually able to taste the difference it's not just the is it is it burnt at all is it harsh I mean what are you know you know be honest with our subscribers here we have to know all right so that is basically a demo so now what she would do after this is she would take the unit apart you know check the herb see how if there discolored at all and you know reuse and repeat accordingly but as you can see this is a really simple good way to get into dryer vaping buying the ozone for your mod attachment is not a expensive upgrade but it can be flavorful as tache just said and it's definitely very easy to use no that's kind of a display model but maybe next video maybe of some of our honey stick youtubers petition for that then we'll give her a bonus unit to take home and play a full weekend but I hope you guys liked our little demo and I hope you guys enjoyed it here with honey girl and we will be back have a good week and like Dan says stay lifted", "-aUo5RQsuAE": "this episode of your mom's house is brought to you by satva luxury mattress the only online mattress company that provides

fun it is the fun the most fun part of the show so intro wars have been going on for a moment and there's a there's a lot to get into about that but so one of the things that happened was you know obviously had an ear firing with blue bands last week but no no we you know we worked we talked and you know he apologized but so one of the things I wanted to do what he came in he goes I got a real nice treat for you as you can see if you're watching right now I'm actually on the boards for the first time in the new studio so I'm running the videos and I think off the productive cuff easily the worst experience of my week was that moment I'm still getting over the cold our child you're gonna call leave the room so I hate conference and now I became the copper isn't that the irony yeah that is good it's always how it happens so he goes I got a real treat for you and I'm like great what is it well the guys decided because they really wanted to make me happy and they knew how much I wanted to change the intro that they would each take a stab at creating an intro for the show right and Nadav gave his pitch for the intro last time yeah I don't remember what that was well it was the one where it was like oh oh oh yeah that was a disaster yeah that was Tim Allen and George HW Bush no new taxes it was insane anyways he and I fought about that but then we we came back and he goes I got three new intros and each of you guys took a stab at it so first up is an intro this is yours okay yeah this is something that you know it's in a better direction you're right Christina sorry I mean controlling you know love the irony though right the irony of having a sneeze rule the disdain she has for sneezers I know and I'm controlling my coughs watch I'm controlling the cough okay okay so sorry I want to hear I'm excited you all right let's hear have not heard this here we go intro okay I'm not a racist went down going down a mountain I love it pretty good that's impressive that's all the great tik toks that I've been give it this isn't no no you guys this isn't the sick talk show well it kind of is in a grand philosophical like yeah I know yes you're saying the show isn't only about my curations but it is about in the broader scheme of things that tick-tock I get there I get it's a fine submission yeah it's the recent drops and well no it's one lane it's it's if if this whole show is just the tick touched kind of stuff this is I mean you're gonna [ __ ] do this all show yeah if you're if you're gonna go down the tech touch lane of these people and like that's all we did then that would make sense but it doesn't I mean that makes sense for the segment right you know but I like it I like what he did I mean can you give him a little credit I just said it may be seen

eccentric yeah and you you have to tell new people like this is what the yeah we like this and you reassure them I would need to be reassured about him because my first thought goes to savage violent psychopath no because no the first thing that I think when I meet somebody like this is I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop like even that freeze frame we're looking at right now no I don't know if it's right now as he closes a freezer door that you're never gonna get out of more no no I'm serious and so I just need to know from someone that knows him like no no he's actually a sweet guy and

Ridgway come to mind all these really well your friends well your pen pals do you write to them yeah okay I see they're saying so you need somebody to vouch for him as what you're saying well yeah but

big cigar also a great message yeah I love big time what is like he's like don't forget to dry odd and don't forget if you fall down you gotta pick yourself back up I think it ease make America old-school again os for life hang sticky look at the jewelry I ain't doing Instagram and Twitter big time Tommy and here's my thought of it here we go great things happen when you distance yourself from negative people remember that get rid of the negative people around you because they will always bring you down that's true that's true that's very true yeah I thought he was gonna say great things happen to those who wait me to you all your eggs happen to those who wait take it easy if you got nothing nice to say don't say nothing at all what do you think he gets his wisdom from did you just get a bag of fortune cookies it might be open somebody's like but that's the thing about if reading a fortune even when it's something like cliche you're like yeah you know it's a good message right yeah it's like The Four Agreements everybody knows yeah yeah yeah I read the book before like getting him to Don Miguel Ruiz not a percent he's just the Italian north-eastern Don Miguel Ruiz it's very simple that's the old-school way we make America that cigars regard enormous is it pleasurable to have a cigar that big even it's just it's really a subjective it's it's personal preference

tick tock queen and it's a whole new web whole life fine yes he did one I remember that he was like it's okay come here give me a hug correct and I know he talks like that give me a hug right now he talks like Yoshi so but but that is not what I meant oh yeah but there's littles they're gonna call themselves littles too but anyway that this is disturbing and he makes a lot of way of serving ones wildly uncomfortable so let's move on there's a little so this is she's playing a baby right so there are adults who like to play baby okay and she sucks on a Pasi and there's a lot of tick tock video is devoted to I wouldn't like don't hate on me keep the ball moving sure yeah I'm just I'm fascinating I can't you're not as fast I'm trying to shape my behavior the feeling that I shake it off shake it off what do you think about that what that's not nothing about that was good or made any sense yeah well she often likes to leave videos about her dating life so it's nice to be updated on how

the air condition that's it that's all you sure you even stopped prematurely no is that's the end of the thing so this is a gentleman that likes to dress up as the Joker and he makes these videos but he and his dog he seems like a really chill dude I like the way he is really like a hot day outside yes [ __ ] dumb dog yeah hurry up well what's interesting is that he does wear full Joker makeup before I think he's wearing like a sweater or a coat or something fingerless gloves dogs like it's [ __ ] hot out me Tom what's this a pure sign of insanity sure sign fingerless gloves gloves yeah

wash down those bristles yeah yeah man I'm so stoked these are such good with an easy one it's a witch's spell so what you're gonna do is you're going to sit somewhere that person resides quite frequently and then you're gonna want to go back to wherever you cast your spell you're gonna want to lick a black handle and then put your intention with in that black candle through energy and you're gonna let that candle burn all the way out and then okay well you're gonna do you're gonna spit on and around you're gonna lick a black candle doesn't mean you're gonna write your spell oh isn't this kind of like just show demonstrate to anybody out there just how unstable so many people are like you live in a world of that's full of people like this eatin tooth [ __ ] hair brushes being like you need to spit on a chair and lick a black candle and like it's just I know thank me bangerang writing your journal it's just well that's kind of why I'm so obsessed with tick tock it's because you get to see what's really going on what are you doing you know I think this is what's really happening in the world do you have a portal into madness what you have that's what you a tear in the fabric of reality this is terror no this is but this woman honestly thinks that if you want to put a hex on somebody you spit on their cubicle no I heard like a candle and then I mean it's insanity but she's a hundred percent sincere okay she's there's a lot of witches on on tick-tock a lot of witchcraft move forward okay I'm gonna go ahead and do you like it this is for job why is this for this one's for town why because it hits so many of your notes that I think you like in a tick-tock like well is the framing is excellent there's a lot of steel he's making no sense which is my

that's just such a bad thing you know I don't care i when he puts on some luck he puts it you see you slather it on you don't rub it in so then there's all these white streaks and then in your ear there's all white caked for like the days because you don't shower it off you yeah that's there's dad yeah there he is but here's the thing I've had such you know like there's certain things where you're like basically never again you know I mean there I am but here's the thing man I am so traumatized and upset by the some of the sunburns that I've experienced that I think about it now every time I'm about to leave the house and it's summer you know I mean like I think about those sunburns the brutal ones where I'm like no way even when we go like swimming and I know it's gonna be I don't know 30 minutes or something I have doubts among like an hour absolutely lather myself in it by the way I know some of my cool fans are like I want to be able to look like you Tom you can because that's where I got yeah I got the white one it's cool cool bar sells them this is unreal and the dad even the model looks dorky as [ __ ] but he looks like a [ __ ] triathlete he looks so and he's like a handsome older gent yeah and he looks like [ __ ] there and they know we're doesn't have if he doesn't have skin cancer tell you that yeah looks really good wait till you come here and you see all the guys wearing that they're gonna all be like yes they will and any will make it cool why now he'll make it cool you know it matches this in my shoes it's just dope I'm speaking of stuff that they like cool stuff that you wear so I had this epiphany along the lines of like towel drying myself off yeah where I was gonna I was like hanging around the house and I wanted to wear something special right I was like I'm gonna put on something nice but Tommy sees me looking nice and then I was like I don't want to wear that item of clothing because it's not a special occasion right now yes and then I was like dude I've been doing this my whole life where I'm like I don't know I've got to save that we're both guilty yeah I got to save that shirt for like a special event or I got to save it and then time goes by and then I forget that I even have it or winter comes and now I can't wear it it's more in line with that like we were just talking about like you know not giving a [ __ ] it's it's in that same wheelhouse yeah of like you buy the shirt or the shoes and you're like these are awesome but they're so awesome right like there's gonna be a an event that I wear these for right and then actually no yeah then a day goes by a week a month yeah two months and you're like I said one thing and you reach for it you're like but I'm just going to like the store and then I'm gonna go pick up this thing and then I'm gonna be back here so you don't wear it for that and then six months go by and you're like I still haven't worn my special shirt yeah and then you realize you know what you've got a [ __ ] throw it on man just don't and wear it to trade or trade that you all do that or whatever you're doing it's not special life is special every day is special there you go do you have the gift of tomorrow all the time hey you guys don't remember if you don't if you don't get it done today remember there's always next week you can do it there's always the gift there's always the gift that's the most relaxed but I'm like why do I save stuff that's so dumb you should enjoy I am half so guilty I mean I I feel I was looking in that closet today and I was like this [ __ ] has tags on it I bought it a year ago I could feel so stupid because I'm saving it I'm saving that special shoes yeah those are cool shoes I can't wear them out yeah what the [ __ ] is wrong I had to bring that up in my therapy really I think I will I think it's all tied into the onto the towel drying thing and the not putting ice in my smoothie what if your what if your therapist you say then she goes can I tell you something for real and you're like yeah and she goes I think you're just tick-tock you're like use me she has pretty much so that's sometimes really yeah like sometimes the only way she can get through to me it's a joke and she'll be like do you really think that bah bah boppa bah like she kind of will shame me a little kind of learned your language a hundred percent like she knows when I'm being sorry if I'm too harsh and sarcastic she'll be that way back to me I would love if a therapist was like what are you [ __ ] idiot sorry never asked me as stupid as you I do worry that I'm boring the [ __ ] out of her boring them yeah out of ten after ten years of therapy there's no way she's intrigued every time I'm in there no but I mean she probably cares about you she cares a lot about that's something you can't earn in a week no dude but I know I'm bored [ __ ] out speaking of caring what's this Willow Smith thing in here Oh which one says oh [ __ ] I love this happened on read table talk let's do it tension is to create more to set this up okay okay so I'm obsessed with read table talk which is a Facebook watch show that Jada pinkett-smith her daughter willow and her mom gammy do and they sit around a red table and they bring up like taboo issues or just hard to discuss topics and they sit around and hash it out okay it's the [ __ ] greatest thing ever I'm a huge fan I love it it's so much fun and so willow came out recently about three weeks ago she came out as polyamorous that's like me yeah paulien bye Wow Holly and I thought this is about this she comes out as Polly and bye if your intention is to create more love more understanding more community more compassion in your life then I'm all for it but if your intention is to just have sex all the time and it would never with whoever you want that just doesn't sit well with me that's not aligned with my purpose okay she's explaining to gammy what kind of data why she believes that like polyamory is better than tradition so I really couldn't seem so in a quadrupole I mean anything had happened but personally male and female that's all I need well there it is so she's saying that she likes both male and female and and she's like I will do a three-way relationship right quadruple and and willows head I don't know if I mean Jana's head kind of snaps and she's like what and then you know me Willa whatever makes you happy is really young know what willows younger I'd say she's like nineteen eighteen yeah but how [ __ ] you gotta figure it out she's gotta figure out how embarrassing is it to be Jake she's 18 yeah when they I mean that's an older 18 though because she's been in the spotlight yeah no she's not like your average 18 year old for sure but could you imagine Tommy one of our kids like you're on the show with them and then Ellis or Julian is like guess what um polyamorous and I'm bi and you know that they're just 18 yeah yeah and you're it's it's gotta be so embarrassing you know data and gammy to be like uh-huh I would mock our kid to his face oh are you cool and that cuz willows like and I think traditional marriage is outdated and taro and I'm like you don't even know there's also like anything and they went through some [ __ ] with like you know you're not supposed to be that famous no and exposed to some of these things that young they've gone through such a ridiculous trajectory yeah in life then I I feel like you have to forgive every stupid thing they say a thousand percent but that's why I'm not like I'm not gonna get into [ __ ] on her or whatever she feels she is but as a parent like I'm just watching Jada's face and you have to be like yeah I'm supportive of your love your absolute lack of knowledge of how the world works right it's gotta be in barrels back down was this a it's true Jaden confirms a relationship with Tyler is that you really wait what what's that saying yes is that a joke you shaking your head I [Music] don't know but doesn't their high get over with Jada pinkett-smith mother looks like she looks like Dunning thirty-eight family looks amazing but I'm just trying to think of what gammy and her head she's probably like shut the [ __ ] up cause she's not talking well oh it's like trying to tell gammy that it was international non-binary because camis reactions basically mirror everybody who's watching like she's the only one that has a normal reaction what willows yeah of course and Jane is trying to be supportive and everyone is like Gammy's but look what somebody talking about it's the look of somebody that loves you when you say some stupid [ __ ] yeah yeah and what somebody loves me like yeah no that's interesting mm-hmm nope oh it's terrible this whole episode is about polyamory and and quest through poles and do pools and all that [ __ ] was amazing and there's at black underscore poly underscore real nice group there look at Gani Gammy's like please she looks better than both of them I think Gammy's probably mmmm can we cut the cameras the [ __ ] are you talk you're what what what are you doing what please stop talking speaking of black people and crazy [ __ ] any it turns out that your your Dookie chute is on its own schedule you we've been learning about this been learning about this for a while and just so that the the audience knows how often in an average week are you sitting on a toilet and making a regular brown bowel movement did you say in one week okay yeah let's go with one week possibly zero it depends on the week and this is every week this is every week buddy brah I like you a lot and I don't want anything bad to happen to you I mean can can I put you in touch with somebody it's supposed to be it you know Nana norm once a day yeah you should have doing everything went so how often are you going no idea like they asked me in here about a week ago when's the last time I remember and I did I don't know wait what about now remember last time you [ __ ] right now I mean I had food poisoning like a guy for okay so that was it yeah and then in the lat what about yesterday no and the day before no and does it hurt no you never have discomfort never I I did when I was a kid but then I kind of got used to that discomfort no no my body got used to it and then it didn't take me through an average day eating like let's say let's say you got up today did you have breakfast today yeah yeah what did you know you had I had which is great I love the street waffle McFlurry yeah and the chicken mozzarella sandwich from Canada it's my favorite item but what did you eat I had two two and then anything else and that didn't make you brown I mean I'm sorry I just a lot well for me for me oh but I think that you would make you brown let's go ahead do you have anything else coffee had a hashbrown no orange juice no water okay and then orange juice that's the last time you ate yeah you have you bet you are drinking water you know that's all you do drink water like pretty regularly what about coffee do you ever drink coffee have you tried drinking coffee first thing when you wake up in the morning maybe that makes you poop what about Kashi this it's too possible like two things to maybe like just to start shifting things what about at least once a day you choose whichever you prefer more you do either like a mixed fruit bowl so you get some fruits in the system or if you prefer veggies we do like some either salad or saute you know greens like one of the two to kind of jumpstart the system we're gonna saying we do that here now I'm asking if you would be open to either of those ideas yeah yeah which do you prefer the fruit or the veggies fruits are good you like fruit wait so wait what did you eat yesterday did we go through his food diary would you ever breakfast yesterday okay but this morning you went to McDonald's and you too and what do you mean did you order lunch with us are you eating three meals a day usually if not but if not then I'll eat those three meals in one sitting okay wait wait take me to one of those mm-hmm so like let's say what was it dinner will take me to one of those take me to one of those three meals in it like what do you do you sit down and you eat I'll eat at a full pizza full large pizza and some breadsticks if you haven't eaten earlier in the day if I didn't eat within the past four or five hours I could eat I could probably eat a pizza and a half I you like five burgers at a time the other crazy Matar what weight do you vomit after or you keep the food in and you don't go like I got a [ __ ] how about this how about exercise do you exercise at all never no see I bet that would kickstart the jams real real fast for you like I'm gonna [ __ ] soon because I ran this morning yeah but I think that's the fundamental problem from what it sounds like now not to interrupt but I agree your exercise is a good idea he's binge eating so he's going a long time and then he's packing the food in all his calories in one meal I mean no wonder your systems sometimes sometimes he does this he's in so you're telling me that otherwise you eat three meals a day yeah but he also eats a lot of garbage no he doesn't no no one's saying he has a winning diet he's definitely not garbage right but yeah but I'm trying it's like the exercise would help people people go and they and they you know they hear somebody say something like this they try to do a dramatic shift and people don't want to do a dramatic shift so the easiest thing to do that I think to make you poop more because you should you say you're drinking water is like just try let's try like a you know an easy thing like go to the grocery store on the way home you pick up the fruits you like and Metamucil maybe some madam use that's definitely a good idea I met him useful but then like some blueberries some strawberries whatever you chop that up put in a bowl put saran wrap over it put in the fridge and your day you start with some fruits you know and then if you can manage either in the beginning or the end of the day even like if you don't like working out but like even going for like a 20-minute walk just to get your body moving I mean and maybe you'll start making caca more you know I'll do it I mean I want yeah any of you when you finally do go Brown what's it like yes it cuz it hurt are you pushing so it doesn't hurt it's normal but it's forever quit eatin it's a lot of play called flush at least six times you're just you're shittin ropes but it's a normal round because it's not act up and he's not constipated because I was like if you're making like pellets like now you're backed up for days the moisture the water gets sucked out of your poop so you usually get constipated you're not [ __ ] rocks you're not [ __ ] rocks it's logs yeah but it's like six feet worth because you've been backed up for like I didn't literally there is a huge mass of [ __ ] we're gonna get so many emails I know from doctors and stuff people are just gonna be like Tom you're wrong and then yeah they're just gonna be like tell them this so just do you let me ask you do you ever [ __ ] do you ever have the urge to go in a given day and then you ignore the urge maybe are you too busy like I know you're switching the show right now so for instance maybe maybe you have to feel a tug and then you ignore is that is that possible now I might but if I do it'll be a one-time thing and I'll say yeah I could do that you know in in five or seven days yeah I got to tell you this does not have a happy ending so we we know I'm serious man I you we've got it you got to try something okay what's what's crazy is I didn't even know that it was weird until I said it here cuz no one I mean I would hear seriously yeah because I would hear people talk about oh you should three times a day or whatever but I also hear people say you should exercise every day and I know so many yeah yeah yeah right but I thought that that was just a thing you should you you should not be [ __ ] once every seven days that's definitely that's real probably very I mean unless some doctor writes in and says hey as long as he does [ __ ] and it's a lot he's not gonna say that because it's not good to carry that I think toxic waste inside of your body for so long right and if you did like even like an awesome big like one thing if you could try try like a big mixed green salad you get these greens and you can fill it with everything you like you know you can chop up mushrooms pepper but everything any veggie you could take and you fill up with that and that doesn't make you [ __ ] I mean to me that's you know I'm I'm twice a day minimum oh this one is disaster yeah I mean what about in the DA I'm often learned a lot yeah he's just constantly twice if you drink coffee and [ __ ] yeah I mean I drink like three or four cups of coffee before lunch yeah it's a lot what about cockroach he shits every day right yeah that's probably the one thing now do you want to know something else disturbing about any mmm he doesn't use condoms that's just a real dude I don't I don't I would always always wait any instruction but Annie's not in a monogamous relationship he's out there thrown around doing it yeah you should brah that's good that's the way to do it are you I mean here's the thing I don't like it you gotta have one for like though whiners you know that are like yeah but like but I don't Valen I wouldn't volunteer it like you know like oh I gotta write about but what about having children that I mean look forget STDs what about you know getting someone pregnant pull out game strong right game mad strong but but uh it'll sound bad but before I even touch a girl guaranteed we're gonna have a talk about abortion we're gonna really it always comes to you know we think about kids you know what I never got to do did you ever did you ever have the STD talk it's something I never ever I was always like a she's probably clean but like what do you do you ever have the talk like do you have anything every time how does it go tell me how it goes every time it starts with this I always say oh yeah you want to a fun fact I've never want to con them in my life and they're always really so if you feel if you're vibing with someone it leads to that conversation at some point always what about one night hussies same thing I don't I don't do where you you know meet her at a club and straight to her place don't even talk to me you funky dog [ __ ] stop it how long so well how long but but so how long do you get to know somebody before you the what's what's getting to know somebody I mean it could be one night but it's still a conversation before he's not just like what's up let's go well we should play this for dr. Drew because he talks about how this generation does not work condoms and I'm sure you'd have some wise words for you stronger and better than any generation well our dads definitely don't wear a rubbers know that is considered the greatest generation yeah guys were [ __ ] savages yes my dad I told I saw this story on stage before my dad one time it was just a random I was like oh I know what it was it was that was talking about you know you think of like something in modern times you know like I wonder when this first came out like when when was it introduced to society and I go did condoms become popular when you were in high school or college thinking that that's when it had to come out and he goes I don't know I've never worn a condom and I was like what does I know about his history of dating and I go you just pulled out on everyone he goes off never pulled out and I'm like I go so you just [ __ ] dumped loads into women for decades and he was like I don't talk like that but ya know my dad dumps clips - of course your dad of course I'm sure I've sisters in Colombia Philippines Thailand yeah I know I'm waiting for it every time that 23andme email comes in like you have new relatives I'm like for sure and by the way for sure my dad like you know pretty hardcore Catholic if if any of any of those girlfriends had gotten pregnant he'd been like I'm we're married that's your mom yep but it just so happened this is like every girl he dated for a couple years and like you just you just always busted nuts and there's like mmhmm yeah any I will say though let's say you're drinking and you're partying and the pullout game absolutely.i hey man we've done the pullout game too and so far hey knock on wood but I mean you might be partying it might be a little dark you know what I mean like what if you weren't taking a [ __ ] in a week off your game and you know what I mean like it's not a hundred percent and it's not foolproof and you're not with the same [ __ ] every time I don't know I'm just concerned about you and what about you know all the other things herpes warts all that stuff sometimes women have it they don't even know when they're giving it to you are you trying oh you well I mean genital warts sometimes can incubate for seven years before it shows up she could have contracted something before I mean how do you know she got tested right away could it be a while and she's had other partners so I feel like big-time Tommy would be really mad at you right now I'm just saying what you are not keeping it \u00f4s right now I can't if I cannot in good faith tell any of the baby let me tell you that goes if a girl looks clean she probably not she's a ho oh my gosh Potter doesn't wear condoms either of course no he doesn't bus Clips so I'm not too worried about that no in terms of getting somebody pregnant but you got you you animals can get all kinds of diseases what I'm really excited about is there any further development with the girl that said she's going to meet Josh have you guys communicated is that a thing but I mean have you communicated okay so we've got to pick a city was she excited did she convey any excitement at winning Wow all right now Nicole Byer was aired at this time it hasn't aired no well she has some thoughts on it you'll see it in a future episode yeah yeah I don't want to spoil it but okay well we got a pic a city man we got to pick a city soon for uh Jackie that's her name Jack you from Canada all right well I hope you keep you know eating well and I hope you can poop one day I don't know we're gonna get so many people writing in doctors telling us what's going on with any so let's just let those two we'll follow up with him because I do feel like if he did add some like you said fruits and vegetables in the diet and exercise yeah maybe even some caffeine it might help push things out yeah you know that somebody saw footage of Burt in a parking lot no I'm seeing this Oh but he just dropped his beer damn was such a bummer bird drops his beer [ __ ] they all break and then he gets really pissed yeah [ __ ] I'd be the same way yeah Lisa starts drinking there be like crack the can what is it a can he busted the whole can yeah he's pretty unstable I'm starting to drink like whatever he could sell salvaged sound work as I [ __ ] hey man he ever gotten groceries and he dropped that [ __ ] in the driveway and that's like oh man I'm broken [ __ ] bottles of wine when we were poor eggs eggs oh I broke a thing a kimchi and it was like hard to find kimchi and they finally [ __ ] had at the store and then it broke my god damn it that's [ __ ] they're all busted up and he's drinking whatever is in there yeah I would too oh [ __ ] that guy spent his last few dollars on that beer you know it well Drake him up buddy you save a man [ __ ] really drink if if you saw that guy you're walking by would you go buy a minute 100,000% you wouldn't I'd be like bro here's 20 yeah go get you another yeah yeah it's the humane or you know be like you go like I'll hook you up then you walk in and you come back out with Gatorade thank you it's a thirst quencher yeah really you gotta stay high [ __ ] hot out he's like [ __ ] you right be great yeah that's like giving homeless people your leftovers somebody said that to me the other day why was Ali we're here and I'm we were done eating and I just had a bunch of leftovers like she would give these to homeless people I'm like I kind of don't want your leftovers like they want money you know one time in Hollywood I walked away from this restaurant with a salad like a big full salad and there was a homeless guy sitting on the curb and I walked up to him I go hey man do you are you hungry and he's like yeah and I go check this out and I opened the lid and I put my fork in there and I flipped out all the olives because I hate all okay you can eat that Wow and then I took my salad home but I gave him all the oh I hate olives you hate the black olive somebody hates I hate all olives that was the most beautiful story yeah I never heard Tom you're welcome how long do we owe I like the green ones you don't like the green ones I hate olives what's funny to me is somehow Greenway my palate can tolerate olive oil you know like that but chewing up I mean I gag I nearly bought is it the saltiness no there's just a flavor in black olives that are discussed just back ones though green ones too even the good ones the garlic stuffed ones from trade there's Joe Ennio even those have you tried the garlic stuff I've tried olives on in all colors I don't like them I [ __ ] hate olives once your [ __ ] cry about it I am crying about it right now I gave him to a homeless guy can I tell you one thought before we go yeah so we were with our friend Brendan dinner the other night yep and he brought up such an interesting point you know when somebody says something and you haven't thought about it your whole life but didn't they articulate the thought yes perfect yeah we were talking about going to the bathroom and farting while peeing mm-hmm and he said he said you know you can't stop a fart when you're peeing because it uses the same muscle and like my [ __ ] brain exploded at the dinner table and I I never have you ever thought of it that way before yeah no I've thought about it yeah that's a good one for you to share with dr. drew - I think it's like when you pee and then you brown and then there's more pee after you Brown and you're like how does that even happen yeah but then this is why so many people machine gun front as they pee yeah I mean you can clinch the fart from coming out but then you stop peeing right so you it's like you have to choose between horses you can open the pee valve again you can stop the fart right and go and then pee and yeah I mean there's so many farts in a men's room at the urinals right wait a lot of times there's got a man that's like that what snuck out but can we please this is a question for dr. drew dr. drew is it in fact the same muscle that when you urine that that is there where do you think I could tell you he's not realiz back he's gonna be really happy to be back here is it the same muscle that controls the farts that controls a pee I don't think it is so it's in the same region which makes it difficult because your anus is different than your urethra you're the muscles around there but it's along the same line I gotta go it's a circadian rhythm I understand anyway Thank You Brendan for that insightful whizzed the very talented guy okay this was a lot of fun I'm gonna go pee and machine-gunned fart what are you gonna do I'm gonna do the same thank you guys for listening and for watching here is did some [ __ ] to my oj by Chris D hope you enjoy it thanks we'll see you next week [Music] hi mommy thanks jeans thank you for watching this episode of your mom's house and if you had a great time watch more videos here-here-here and don't forget to subscribe here here here so that you will know when a your mom's house video comes out immediately thanks gene", "8sg07wrWSvQ": "one of them is mr. clean I didn't know until this morning he was a genie I thought he was a pirate that's terrible isn't it Morgan it's all right he's a cleaning genie that's what he is this is mr. Clean Magic Erasers and this is a set that you will not find at retail although you may be able to find the different components at your local grocery stores you will not find this value if sold separately you're looking at about 26 dollars we're at $19.98 and I'm going to tell you this is what you stock up on and have underneath the kitchen sink when you've got those messes you've got those everyday spills and you want to keep your house clean it's very seldom that I get to introduce you really almost to a scientist she knows the science of clean this is our very special guest Morgan welcome how are you thank you doing great dance your first time here huh this is my first time and they put you with me that's not fair it's not nice I'm happy to be well let's show them everything they get because we're gonna start off with the mr. clean bath erasers and you get four of those and they are specially formulated for the messes that happen in the bathroom the bathroom alone exactly that's soap scum that builds up that greasy soap scum every time you bathe in your bath but that is really really hard to clean you then also give us four of the kitchen specific right magic erasers yeah so we think more about the greasy messes that come from cooking different meals in your kitchen huh and then you give us eight of the extra durable magic erasers and then they even give us a pair of their latex gloves so you're getting everything you need at $19.98 and let's show them how it works microfiber is popular back in my mom's day was cotton cloth they don't have the scrubbing power that a magic eraser would have they don't sometimes you need a little extra muscle to get through those really tough messes they're lightweight super lightweight they're lightweight they are I'm glad you brought up how lightweight they are because it's so easy to take this little eraser go around your entire home and clean all of the different surfaces and they're activated with water always water alone that's all you need just either rinse it under a faucet or dunk it into a water bowl what do we have here we have a greasy soap scum so this is this is really a pain to clean a lot of times it requires you to sometimes get into the tub sprays and wipes and things like that can't get through the surface like this and it also makes a big mess as you're cleaning so if you're cleaning the last thing you want to do is make more of a mess make sense and there's no residue whatsoever that's squeaky clean of squeaky clean absolutely it means all the way to are able to see what this looks like underneath the microscope every one of these little melamine fibers looks almost like a spatula for like a little scoop right right so that's what's actually happening is that it's working like windshield wipers do okay so it's kind of getting what's on the surface off but not taking away the surface itself one of the demonstrations that you did for me in guest class was permanent marker and it's permanent marker and we can scrub and scrub and scrub the old-fashioned way right you'll do a little contest I would love to do household cleaners I won't mention it by name but people know what it is yeah and I'll spray that on there and liberal amount and I will scrub as hard as I can all right I get tired easily I got a little bit of mine yep I couldn't get all of it right the permanent marker doesn't have to be permanent it can be a temporary art installation when your your child yeah scribbles on the countertop instead so the whole idea here is to to reach for the Magic Erasers first that's right yeah it's a much it's much lighter and easier to carry around from room to room then that whole cleaning caddy of all of the different prime by the way they last a long time you'd be surprised at just how long one Magic Eraser roll will go you're getting you're getting four of the kitchen for the bathroom eight of the every room cleaners and and I think people are gonna get used to using these instead of regular cloth that's right and speaking of every room we talked about the bathroom a little bit but I want to talk about the kitchen because there's a kitchen messes can really get burnt on we've got some tomato sauce here and you think about when it splatters over as you're cooking pasta on the stovetop or something it really can burn on there as the pasta continues cooking and so the Magic Eraser is great to power through that that burnt on pasta mess and all the way down to the clean surface this is this is the science of cleaning your home faster more your new background you're a chemist right I am a chemist so you know the scientific elements of what make things clean better yep and that's something that we've got available to us today that that maybe my mom's generation did not have and it does the job and it does it well that's amazing let's keep cleaning okay let's keep clean that way we can use the same one over and over and over you can yeah you

The Silvia, the Z, the GTR. But what about the legendary model that really started it all? The 'poor man's BMW' blew everyone away with it's unique, lightweight\nstyle, monocoque design and unibody construction. Here's everything you need to know to get up to speed on the Datsun 510. (computer game music) In 1914, Kaihinsha Motor Car Works introduced it's first car, the DAT. But the country wasn't quite ready for a passenger car manufacturer and the company struggled\nfor about a decade and almost went out of\nbusiness in the mid '20s. I struggled for most of the '90s to get my boy band off the ground. To all the former members of Boy Talk, hit me up, I think it's\ntime for a reunion tour. To stay afloat, they\nmerged with Jitsuyo Motors and became DAT Automobile\nManufacturing Co. In 1930, DAT Auto got a big\nboost from the government, who declared that cars\nwith engines below 500cc's could be driven without a license. DAT developed a car just\nunder that amount of cc's and called it a Datsun, or Son of DAT. If you're a Son of DAT, make sure you hit that subscribe button. Back to the story. Four years later a new\ncompany had formed, Nissan. And they wanted to take over struggling-- - [Woman On Phone] Please\nremain on the line, we value your call. - And they wanted to take\nover Kaishinsha's business. Now it fell to Nissan to\nstart cranking out Datsuns. It was well on it's way\nto car making success when a little thing called\nWorld War II happened. You ever heard of it? Nissan's passenger car productions stalled and it refocused it's energies on building trucks for the imperial army. After the war, Nissan's\npassenger car production ramped up again, and in\n1947 they joined forces with British car maker, Austin. Hi, Austin. Their first collab came in 1958 with the Datsun L210 Bluebird which did nothing for American car buyers. It was a little bit too\nsmall and too British. In comparison, it's main competitor, the Volkswagen Beatle, was a lighter car with the same horsepower,\ngive or take a pony. Given the option, I would take a pony. And then I'd eat it. (horse neighing) And speaking of ponies, the Datsun L210 Bluebird\nactually drove like one. It had bad brakes, it's ride was bumpy and it shook like crazy,\njust like Michael J. Fox. Sure, it wasn't all bad. It got great gas mileage,\nbut this was the 50s. Gas was, like, 23 cents a gallon and nobody really worried\nabout fuel economy. Nissan's designers went\nback to the drawing board and in 1959 dropped the\nDatsun Bluebird P310. The P310 was larger,\nwith a roomier interior, updated styling and\nindependent front suspension, which was a monumental\ninnovation at the time. In 1960, 20,000 units\nwere shipped to the US. The Bluebird performed a little better. But the car was still deemed\ntoo English for American taste. Like blood pudding. Then, President of\nNissan, Yutaka Katayama, wanted to change all that. Mr K had faith in his\ncompany and it's products and believed beyond a shadow of a doubt that his company could build a car that US buyers didn't just\nsettle for, but really wanted. Mr K was Nissan's outspoken wildcard, which earned him a bad\nrep among company execs. Your boy can relate, mon cheri. (singing) So, they sent him to Los Angeles in 1960 because they wanted him to\nget the hell out of Tokyo. It turned out to be the perfect timing because Nissan's agreement with Austin expired that same year,\ngiving Mr K If You're Nasty a clean slate with which\nto do his damn thing. Nissan's next release\nwas the 410 Bluebird, and while it was an\nimprovement on the 310, Nissan still wasn't there yet\nas far as Mr K was concerned. Some say Mr K was too much of a rebel but he was a rebel with a cause. He was Japanese James Dean. Facing an uphill battle convincing Nissan that American car owners\nwere a different breed and wouldn't respond to the gentile way models were named in Japan. Bluebird and Fair Lady\nwouldn't cut it anymore. After a lot of pushing and prodding he saw to it that Nissan would only use numerical code names for the US market. He also insisted on a design change for the next line of Datsuns, the 510. Nissan designer, Turoro Uchina, Ichino, Turo Ichino. Let's go back. Turo Uchino was tasked with creating a car that looked less Italian or\nBritish than it's predecessors and had it's own unique flavor. Jessica. He drew up a design that was efficient, clean and kind of American looking. The only carry over from the 410 was it's side crease or supersonic line. (whooshing) While Nissan execs agreed on\nthe name and design changes, they put their foot down\non the cars engine size. Although rival Toyota was\noffering a 1.9 liter engine in it's largest American model, Datsun's capped out at 1.4 liters. Mr K did have one ally in his corner, company exec Kaichi Matsumura, who also thought the\nengines should be bigger. And with the help of newly\nacquired automaker, Prince, which you might remember\nfrom our GTR episode, they approved the creation\nof a 1.6 liter engine. Hey, two tenths of a liter\nmore is better than nothing. And the Datsun 510 made\nit's US debut in 1967. Just like my dad. This was a car Katayama\nwas passionate about and he believed in it so much that he required all employees, from the executives to the\nguys working in the cafeteria, to take the new car for a spin just to prove his point. Uh, can anybody guess what happened? Yes. - They hated it?\n- Wrong! - They freakin' loved it!\n- Wrong again. - The 1.6 liter four cylinder engine produced a claimed 96\nhorsepower and 99.8 torques. And it went from 0 to 60 in 13 seconds, reaching a top speed of about a hondo. Americans bought about 45,000\n510s in it's first year, and by the end of it's run in 1973, Nissan sold an incredible\n400,000 510s worldwide. The world finally saw what Mr K had envisioned from the get go. It was an instant classic from the day it rolled\noff the assembly line and the choice for those\nwanting a bit of a sports car in their daily drive.

serve coffee maker but it's got this cute little um coffee mug that goes with it it's got the swing out this is where you brew the coffee or tea but it's got this permanent filter that's where we're going to put the coffee and that's where it goes and then we just swing that back and then the water goes right back here this lifts up that's where the water goes it's got a water reservoir back here that's where the water goes and the key feature is it does have a little indicator light that comes on and it's auto off so once you press this button it starts to brew and it turns itself off after it's done and there's no heating element here or nothing so i put one heaping tablespoon of coffee grounds in here like i said this is the removable filter i don't think you're gonna be able to buy paper filters for it you're gonna have to use this filter that comes with it so we're going to put that in there we're going to close it so i would use the mug that it came with to fill it up with water that way you don't overfill it i have overfilled this before so you're just going to dump the water in okay close that make sure the mug's in there all the way and then we're just going to press this button yeah you gotta plug it in first got kind of a short cord so now we're gonna press this button just kind of spring loads back out but that indicator light should be on yeah it's on so it's really dim but it's on like i said this button you press it in but it kind of pops back out so it doesn't like stay in that position so i'm going to time this so it's it's making a little percolator sound it's it's doing a pretty good job of brewing that does get a little warm there's some steam coming out the holes in so we're right about the four minute mark and the light turned off i heard something like a relay click so it's gonna it's pretty much turned the coffee pot off it might still be dripping a little bit yep okay so after about five minutes it's done i did make a little mess by not waiting long enough okay so let's check the temperature not bad for the little coffee makers i normally see around 165 168 not bad let's see how it tastes boy i gotta say that's that's not too bad of a cup of coffee i was not expecting it to be that good let's see how the filter coffee grounds did okay so they stayed in the filter that's good looks like they did a pretty good job getting saturated this is this is a pretty nice little coffee maker doesn't take up much space so let's go over clean up you slide this open again so this this comes up you lift up on the bottom and then it comes out then you can take this whole filter tray but you're going to take this over to the trash can take out the coffee grounds and then just clean this up with some soap and water and that looks i can just wipe down my mess that i made there but this is a pretty neat coffee maker so when you put it back together uh put the top in first and lift up and then the bottom hinge will go in and it closes so all in all i was very impressed with this little coffee maker i know it's kind of an older one but it actually did a really good job i hope you liked this video if you could please like and subscribe and thank you for watching", "dsv5LuR9hRI": "now one of the most popular style of filters particularly for these all-in-one off-the-shelf type aquariums is the top filters now the advantage of the top filters is they're super neat and super easy to clean so when they come they come with either little carbon cartridges or little bags of carbon and usually filter material like noodles and there are three types of filter materials there are mechanical media's which actually trap the garbage then there's biological media which grows bacteria and breaks the waste from the fish down and then there's chemical media such as carbon which sucks in toxins until it's full so the basic idea is the water just gets sucked up through the strainer it goes into the pump from the pump it gets shot up and gets shot through this top area here and in this top area you'll have mechanical chemical and biological filter media now these systems are very easily upgraded and the way that you can upgrade the system is instead of using filter wall you can use poly filter and the poly filter will actually clean the particles instead of trapped them so therefore it won't Bank up and potentially leak down the back of the aquarium if the water can't escape back down into the aquarium as its supposed to so the poly filter is really really an insurance policy as far as the functionality of your aquarium is concerned the other thing is the poly filter is going to cool to remove all of your organic waste out of solution and it will not let it go like carbon carbon actually sucks in the waste until it's urgent then I'll actually start to release the waste back out again whereas the poly filled will change color to tell you when it's full and it will not release the waste back into the water and you can upgrade these little noodles by putting in a media such as marine pure which has potentially got twenty times the surface area of the noodles so all in all these filters are very handy they're very easy to clean they're very easy to set up and they're very easy to modify but as with all filters they do work with not finding bacteria so they do suck oxygen out of the water so I'd still consider all filters to be for filtering and I would rather add an air stone or an extra power head that's a jet\u00e9 ting the surface to make sure we've got more oxygen in the water from the fish", "8x8whbsbsGM": "hey guys today i'm gonna open up this mr clean magic eraser sheets it's a thin eraser that cleans everywhere it clean drains stoves faucets height chairs fridges and

"rbmXNeyE12Y": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin but if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading manuals I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece there two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "meNnp7Rv6fU": "hi I'm Dan CEO of honey stick one of our frequently asked questions to our websites is the different tanks that we offer for mods what they're for and what waters we run them at so today I'm gonna give you a quick run-through of the four different models that we offer and what they're used for and what's the perfect wattage for these tanks now all of our mod tanks are 510 thread which means they're gonna be compatible with most mod batteries on the market for those of you who are not familiar with mod batteries the mod battery is any battery that has a 5-10 thread where you can adjust the power that puts an output of at least 20 watts so let's get started first we have our Stinger ceramic tank this tank is predominantly used for concentrates wax dabs any type of shatter or crumble now when you get this tank this is made out of ceramic so be gentle with it just wiggle the top off and you can expose the ceramic bowl which is a donut style heater you just take the dab put it into the into the unit wiggle the top back on and don't run this unit over 12 watts if you run it over 12 watts you run the risk of burning it out or shortening the life of it when this unit does go out we do not sell separate heaters for this you will have to buy a new top next on a list is our honey stick sub ohm tank this is a really special tank at a finished second place in the high time SoCal cannabis cup for best vape cartridge and this is a really special cartridge and what it is primarily used for is it's used for oils ok now people always ask us now what if my oils thick what if it's more runny what if it's more distillates what if it's more of a sauce the general rule of thumb for this tank is if you can inject it out of a syringe even if you have to use a little bit heating it will work in this tank this tank has a ceramic heater it has adjustable air control at the very top of the tank and also it has very wide hole opening so even the thicker oils will get burnt in there however if you are using thick oils when you fire it for the first time the tank does come with primer and we do suggest using it so anything that comes out of a syringe will be good texture for this tank this tank will fill about a milliliter and change by that 1.2 mil ok from bottom and you don't want to top it off the sub ohm tank has an operating watt range of 9 watts all the way up to 40 watts what I generally suggest to people is depending on the texture of the tank is you should start off at 9 watts take a couple head slowly slowly increase the wattage up until you find where you have the right combination of intensity and flavor and then stick with it don't start too high and make sure that you're not dry firing your tank so there's no oil on the heater because then you'll just taste the ceramic heater and it will linger so make sure that the oil is soaked into the coil or that your tank is properly primed but you can run out of 40 watts and we do sell replacement heaters for this tank on our website they come in five packs and when's at the right time to replace our heater it's one you screw it on to your mod and you get a no atomizer or atomizer short reading then it's time to replace your heater next up is our hybrid tank our hybrid tank is a tank that we designed so that it can be used for wax dab concentrates crumbles things of that nature it has a glass body steel upper and lower okay this tank the what operating range for it is I would say between nine and 28 watts I wouldn't run it above 28 watts or again you run the risk of shortening the life of your tank or burning out your coil this tank does come with replaceable coils now when you get this tank it makes a seal so a lot of times the glass will be very tight with the body and because it's glass it is prone to breaking so when you get your tank you gently want to hold the base and gently wiggle the glass off to dislodge it now this piece right here unscrews to allow you to have access to the bowl you will see you have your ceramic rods in there where you can place your concentrates and by removing this also makes the tank easier to clean again this is a 5-10 thread and will work with most mods and then you just wiggle it right back and once you've got it open for the first time this will become easier the tank actually comes with some replacement gaskets as well as an additional heater for you in case if you need to rebuild your tank we also sell rebuild kits on our website which will come with new coils new gaskets and also a new glass in the event that you do break it last is our ozone our ozone is our ceramic dry herb tank it's also 510 thread this is mainly meant for dry herb and also can be used for like crystal concentrates which are becoming increasingly popular now it has an operating range of 15 to 28 watts okay the instructions within the tank will tell you what the ideal watt range is for this tank but 27 to 28 watts is almost combustion level but it is best used for dryer now with this tank once you do fill it up you know it is ceramic so when you push and hold the button it's not gonna be instantaneous it's gonna take a couple seconds to heat up but you're gonna get amazing draws and amazing flavor out of this tank and again since it is a glass tank when you first get it secure the base and gently wiggle it out we do sell replacement heaters on our website which you can replace over time if they do burn out or you don't get a reading on it for these tanks and many other cool products please visit us at vape on East accom comment post any questions about this video there are other videos to us and we'll get back

take notes today's video is sponsored by long mater calm home of the oil is not leaking pure taste vaporizer so check these items they sent to me in the mail they sent me a bunch of stuff they wanted me to try out and today's video is gonna be about the mote R so this is the demote are right here quartz clueless wax atomizer pretty dope long model calm now this is a to attach it to your already existing like fake batteries you attach it to that and it's for smoking concentrates oils or wax you distillate stuff like that you see like get a better focus you guys can read a no not focusing all right so we got long mouthpiece glass tip that's what comes in there is that the atomizer base which I already have attached to their trunk battery this is their trunk battery they said long motto calm there's a pretty dope little battery this is a 13 Miller ant battery and I think the wattage is somewhere around like 30 to 45 watts is what they recommend for you to use this attachment on now you can see with it all completed together it's a pretty dope little look that's a very snug fit so you know this airflow on that is really nice and really tight let me get you a nice focus on that and this is the impressive part about it is this let me take this top off again she's very nice snug fit so you'll have no leaking and smoke or vapors anything like that so check this out the heating element on this is pretty wicked you hit the button look at that it immediately starts down melting processing I've been using this all week like I got this in the mail I would say that last weekend and this has been my daily every every day I've been abusing this thing so it's really works really well I wanted to put it through all of the tests and turns before I actually went ahead and did a video on it so I've had some friends come over as had other people try it and everybody's been pretty impressed with how it works so let me go ahead and let me just read off some other stats for you all right so the mote our wax atomizer zero point four Oh H M quartz coil s atomizer tank long glass mouthpiece that's what it's called pure taste non burnt leak proof Big Smoke has a 5-10 thread for you guys who are interested in what it screws into 510 thread replaceable course chamber easy cleaning like I said before they recommend somewhere between 30 to 45 watts and compatible battery is 1,300 milliamps is what you're going to be looking for to power this atomizer and this is as features powered by Glo core a revolutionary heat source using an electrical trace placed inside and sio2 cup allowing for an all pure quartz surface to vaporize material cleanly anywhere at any time maintenance of the tank is easy as wiping off the breeze from the smooth surface of the crystal compatible with standard 510 threading the mote our tank can be used on your favorite mod motor energized the crystals summon the fire that's pretty wicked at the end but yeah inside its it's a you know you don't see the coil so there's nothing to harm or break when cleaning it and that has been a big issue for me with a lot of those other like atomizers that are out on a market like they're very sensitive if you go to clean them you knock things out of place and and destroy stuff but this is a complete quarts cup and inside everything is protected so you don't have to worry about damaging anything in there when wiping stuff off which for me that's a huge huge huge plus because yes I have damaged atomizers in the past trying to clean them not knowing that they were gonna be so delicate I've had them just completely like shatter fall apart and just trying to wake you tip cleaning but um let's go ahead and get this thing loaded up so you can see it how it works so to load it up we got ourselves a nice little crumble our friends over at a kind of feel photography hooked us up with some of this so we're gonna load up our glass our quartz with a nice little chunk because I want to see you guys to see that how it works so I'm gonna put that nice ball in there and we're gonna use it without the lid first so you guys can see its complete function so come on now I don't understand okay let's get it to reset one more time with you there he goes alright now I'm gonna hit this button pay attention to what's happening here okay there look at that they look at that perfect heating temperature bubbles right off yeah look at it it smells amazing it's just cooking it's just cooking in their lip and that's what you want your oil to do let's go ahead and put this back on and then it has an automatic heating Metin mold on it where you hit two by three times a repetition and it turns blue automatically starts heating up for you as you can see we're gonna start heating up immediately the taste is on point doesn't burn nothing off she maintains his liquid yeah that's all flavor alters that's all you got cause it's not burning nothing off it's just purely vaping it at the perfect temperature did I do it one more time one two three gotta turn blue then they cook up a little bit you know see that thing bubble we're gonna start bubbling immediately has a car cap up top too I mean it works beautiful needless to say I'm already [ __ ] up [ __ ] that was for real oh man [ __ ] you know and it that oil right there see I still watering it's only gonna solidify and stay there for you wait for you now that one thing I can say is it's built so you can smoke it like this now there really shouldn't be no reason for you to tilt it but if you tilted this thing and [ __ ] it's gonna pour out automatically all over to the side and [ __ ] your bowl up so definitely keep your mind and do not tilt it while the oil is hot because it would definitely make a mess I don't think anything has a potential of leaking out due to the the tightness of these rings that they have here like it's really nice to Snug on there's a snug fit but um I think as far as everything else I'm really really pleased with its build I like the way it looks it's nice its compact and it doesn't overdo the job you know it's just a nice clean smooth smoke it's kind of like what you're looking for when it comes down to these oils you know you don't really want to be choking yourself out every time you hit some of this stuff it's potent and strong you know so you want a nice clean smooth hit and maintain the turps without burning off all the good stuff so let's go ahead and give ourselves one more preheat matter of fact I'm not gonna yeah that's - the preheat yeah boom bulu and then we're just gonna dog that thing out let it burn up let it let it smoke up see it start cooking we're gonna cook Oh it's cooking in there that's just so pretty to watch it happen really little vapor building up that's it folks that's the mote are the mote are by long mater company check them out online www on mater calm the link will be in the description also all the details to this device would be in

"yhGs4-DFoUA": "set up your airbrush studio with a spray gunner welcome back hobby maniacs I'm Rob bear from spiky bits calm and today we're gonna check out the new name spray booth from spray gunner they sent this over to us to check out and we did a video on a similar one that might be the name brand version of this hint hint about four or five years ago and well let's just say it it hasn't aged well I have destroyed it but that was on purpose but I'll show that to you and we'll take a look at this bad boy right here which is also portable so spray gunner comm is your source for all sorts of airbrushing supplies anything you need from an airbrush to a compressor two hoses two fittings cleaning solutions and of course very own spray booth as well always check out the final sale page sometimes they have some really discounted stuff that's when I do these videos I always pop in and check them out ahead of time but if you know exactly what you're looking for you can just search it here or you can kind of browse through their menu over here on the right now today we're going to take a look at this bad boy which I just showed you which breaks down and opens up into all sorts of different things it comes with a whole lot of extra accessories from a rotating station to a this little setup here so you can actually blow the exhaust out of your window and there's a couple different solutions of how to actually if you can't reach the window or you're kind of landlocked inside of a particular room so you also still protect yourself but filter it through the spray booth itself and I'll talk about that probably at the end of this video as well so $99 plus shipping to your door now remember to all the name name no-name brand stuff from spray gunner that's all backed by them so if you have any issues with it even if it isn't a no-name brand even you know you buy a branded airbrush from them you have an issue with it hit them all they'll take care of it for you if you have to send it back they have to do maintenance you can send it to them instead of manufacturer so always how confidence in the stuff you're buying I've had nothing very very good interactions with them and any of my customer service queries so I can't say enough good things about the folks over there and remember they test all this stuff in the house too before they ship it out to you on the no-name side so here's kind of a look behind the scenes here at the studio generally you don't see this far back but I just wanted to show you kind of the similarities between the products I'm about to show you in the product that is existing this is the actual branded spray booth from spray gunner this one I think they also sell as well but I wouldn't recommend it to be quite honest I have broken off on purpose the whole hinge work that you know filters the air into the actual filter and when the fans going and stuff which is right there I broke that because I didn't like the design of it it was very hard to use and very hard to set up and and it was flimsy and it I accidentally cracked one of them myself so I didn't like the design of the old one first off right off the bat now this particular it looks like the casing and everything is the same I'm not sure about the power supply or any of the buttons or any of the functionality of it but just keep this in mind I've had this for about five years and it's it's weathered pretty much the storm for the most part and I've got a little bit of you know particulate built up on the underneath but on the outside it's it's held strong and it's stayed stayed true the whole 5 years I've had it besides the stuff that I purposely broke off so I could actually record content here at the studio so here's how easy it is to set up your own airbrush studio at home you want to pick an area where you think you'll have plenty of ventilation and playing plenty of room to use your airbrush we're gonna hook up the actual hose to this window out here for airbrushing so I got it going on into the patio obviously check with your significant other or your parents before you do something silly like this because you don't want to ruin all the nice things out there but that being said there's some really cool features about this particular unit that I already noticed so first off it is going to have a retractable area for the power plug so you can't see it right here but as soon as we flip this out you're gonna see that it has a really nice robust fan on the back of course your on/off switch up high or fan in light and that fan as well right here and retractable cord button as well for the cord now there's some goodies inside but it also comes with this hose that you're gonna hook up it went together pretty easily you want to go over top of it because of the ridging it should be a problem but I mean obviously flow going through this could potentially come out of these cracks but the ridges and everything should prevent that for the most part and then it's gonna hook into the back here which will show you pretty easily because of the clasp so it's super simple to set it up you just flip down the front it's that easy like the old look the old version was super terrible this one just flips right up and there's these little locking nodes right here they're gonna lock in so those are your breakable parts to be very careful with those but they seem pretty large and resilient so I'm not gonna worry about it and then your instruction manual and your little turntable here which actually has some suction cups on the back which I thought was pretty neat so it will stay very well attached to the bottom here now this is translucent so you can see through it for the most part will not see through it but it's gonna give you additional life and then look right there you've got the light that we're gonna hook up now that this is down you can see that the power plug is now visible you can pull this out and actually hook this up and get this thing going so we're gonna do that now that we've got plugged in we can sample the lights and the suction power of this bad boy right here so first off we're gonna flip this and that's gonna activate the fan pretty robust is definitely wow it is definitely pulling through some serious it's way better than my other one other one it's rated back like that and then we'll turn it on with the light and I don't think this light is definitely designed to give you only the light to paint by this is gonna be a supplement to kind of negate the effects of not being able to get any light in here so you're still gonna need your normal lights wherever they may be and they should come through this because it's translucent so you don't have to worry about any of that but it seems pretty solid so far as far as usability and ease of use now one of the things you can do if you want to attach the hose and you want to put it in your window right here I'll show you how to do that in a second but you don't necessarily have to I've been using mine with a filter on the back for a number of years so all we did was we just attached through the magic of duct tape two filters on the back of ours which you can see right here just pulled it down from my paint dense so it has been I'm leaving out and through them and using that for about three or four years now so if you don't have the option although you should in most cases put the hose out the window so your exhaust is not staying inside your room but it's super easy to hook up when you're ready to do it just find an applicable window and pinch that down in it you can go wow if you find that your haven't spray come back in the window it might be a good idea to regardless depending on your weather if it's too cold or too hot just stuff some towels in here to make a hundred percent seal between the window and whatnot and then we're gonna hook this up it's in the back right here attached something is super easy just use the clasps right here you pinch these and then kind of undo some of the fold right here until you get it over the axe the exit port and then all you do is just what a popped off because I didn't let go but all you do is just release the pressure on that and it will pinch it into place was obviously there but that being said that way the spray or the fumes the exhaust is going into this and not out the seam right here so it's very easy to do you just well you just have to undo some of this at the end and finally if you're in a pinch for a new filter right here depending on what you're doing you can just pull this out and believe it or not get you a pitcher and fill this up with some purple power or simple green simply dunk this in it and allow it to sit overnight and then pour it all out and it will completely clean your filter off it's very easy to do I've done it multiple times with the same filter here but eventually you are going to want to replace it because as you might notice over the years this one has shrunk quite a bit it started out blue just like this and well let's just say I'm probably due for a new one but in a pinch that will definitely work so that's it for this one make sure to head on over to spray gunner comm and pick up this really sweet spray booth 9999 currently I don't know if that's the price when you watch the video but regardless

up the audio from my microphone i think we got better audio right now can anybody in my microphone yep yep better better audio let me let me give me a minute i'm going to share this on facebook all right so let's just believe we're doing this for the first time the new datsun 510 momo in black i got this on ebay check it out on spine [Applause] so if you don't know this is how they close the hot wheels they use a machine and they squish they squeeze this and create the mushroom pose but i was gonna do a wheel swap right but leave it like this on spun but i notice this gap you see that it doesn't want to close see how how much it has to bend so of course i got curious and i wanted to see why i wanted to see why it was doing that i can read your uh comments so if you want to ask any questions you can go ahead yuri them all says better so i guess the audio is better i got curious i have this other one here which i've made a i did a wheel swap a while back close it up with a 256 button head screw so right off the bat i don't see any big difference in the casting but i didn't notice different numbers on the windshield right and then i noticed this part right here look how thick that is let me move this light a little bit more over here die-cast sheriff how you doing he says hey folks check this out so it's thicker plus they didn't shave off these two tabs from the mold all right so my first the first thing i tried was using the new windshield put it in the old datsun with the correct interiors here and boom they don't close see the gap you can see a little better on this one because the casting is red a big gap see how much you gotta force it so next experiment windshield from the red datsun we're gonna put it on the new one tears from the new one look at that we still have a gap it doesn't want to close now you really got to force it so the windshield is a problem but there's also something different here see if you can spot it out the new one has these little squares in the front and in the back it doesn't seem like a lot but that's preventing the interiors here to go further down see what i mean it just needs that little bit more to go down for example okay this is the good the good windshield okay so we have the the seats from the new one and the base from the red that's in 510. so we change the windshield and the base look close is perfect i actually like this combination better black base red interiors so my question is jesus sal says hi from mexico how you doing mexico city my question is if you own one do you have the same issue or is it just mine i hope i can find this on the pegs when they come out to be able to uh compare i was planning on doing a wheel saw but being that uh i have to modify the windshield plus the base i just i'd rather leave it like this it's a good example of a triple triple uh error on spine the windshield and the base so if any of you guys have one can you please check leave me a comment in the future after this live video is over and i'll be reading it let me close this one back up and there you go is it a new mold or instead of a steak i'll be reading the comments remember to subscribe and

good in the camera here but to me it looks streaky I can see it there you can see it first I got it right there in the middle it's streaky so I'm gonna say not great on the glass but let's see how it does on the grinding counter I'd like for you to see the spray I think hope you can hear it how it continuously sprays when you hold the pump so I just toes down the whole counter I keep this little quarter piece of a sponge in here so the boys can clean up their toothpaste and the mornings if they have a mess so this usually sits right there and so they can use that to clean up so I'm going to go ahead and just use this you i can'twe that it's making my whatsit here something that looks really nice this says that it can be used on finished wood granite even stainless steel I've used this

name is Joey we're here at this kind of a pen today we're talking about the heiress cute Danu cue [Music] so guys like I said earlier in the intro the air is set cute fantastic little device it is multiple use it does come with a little cartridge that's meant for wax only really with very unique core actually we're gonna go dive deep into it and you could definitely use any other cartridge for it so gonna pull out the blue one right here because I do like blue and eat me but just notice is you got this little glass jar that has a little like rubber stopper on top of it that's where you gonna put your little extract in so you could keep it on you for travel use and then we got the little device right here so if you notice it resembles a lot like the mr. cub basically we said there's a Mystica but what they did with it's a little bit different they gave you this little cartridge which like I told you earlier before it has a little vertical ceramic quartz coil that's right ceramic and quartz all in one to one has like a little sponge it is it looks like a vertical coil like you'd notice and other like regular vapes the best thing about this is when it heats up all your concentrate actually flows into the vertical coil soaks up the ceramic porous like the pores of the ceramic itself and you get it like a very beautiful nice dense vapor out of it a lot of the bigger companies are using these type of technology like on these coils right now so it's definitely amazing to see Eric put that in the palm of your hands so guys just like the mystical it's little brother or twin brother five clicks to turn onto the vise of one two three four five you see it light up now every time you hold down a button it's gonna show you the color that's the voltage set onto it right now so you know this right now is showing red that means it is hidden at 4.2 volts you click it three times you can cycle between three different settings with their own voltage like so one two three and now that's green Green is actually hitting around three point 4 volts and then 1 2 3 blue Blues are gonna be hitting around 3.7 volts and like I saw showed you earlier the red is a 4.2 volts us be chargeable variable voltage magnetic connection comes to these little magnet rings which you know we all know and love and all you have to do is screw that on to this little cartridge and pop it right in or to your own regular oil cartridge as well like I said it multiple use it's a very cute device so guys like I told you earlier it is multiple use device you can use the car tech comes supplied with or you use your own oil cork pops right in magnetically very small and discreet fits and palm your hand and the same concept you just you know press on the button and that's it and uses paper on it and I didn't want to mention this as well something about this in domestica and this whole company when they make device is very simple and it's very straightforward they kind of just look what the customers asking for they read the comments sessions on like YouTube and a lot of forums and they make the device specifically for what they're meant for I know it work they're great and they're very nice and you know price decently definitely recommended so guys that was the era's tech cute it does have a little twelve millimeter clearance so it does seem definitely fits all cartridge and you know this one's actually pretty phat itself comes with a little jar for your extract the coil on these little cards are amazing for your wax concentrate and multiple use that's good

to the carfax report all right here's taking a quick look at the carfax we are carfax advantage dealer and I for this 2009 rd act technology I can see there's no accident other damage reported that is a carfax 1-owner vehicle suggesting adding nine hundred and sixty dollars to the retail kelly blue book because in service history in the car and no problems or issues California car no total loss structural airbag odometer accidents it's all guaranteed no problems reported and it looks like a local Bay Area car here local to santa clara san jose area and it's going to get service history looks

clean carfax no issues or anything on it also qualifies for the carfax buyback guarantee and you might be saying hey looks like a great car but um you know how much is going to cost me so i actually wrote that out here a couple examples it looks great but how much will this cost me so for this 2009 acura RDX with technology package kelly blue book suggested retail value i just pulled up this morning its twenty four thousand eight hundred ninety two dollars and if you were to add the 960 carfax add-on for the maintenance and bring it to a market value 25 852 and we got it priced at twenty thousand nine ninety nine plus B we're part of a wholesaler group and we you know believe more in volume then trying to make a huge profit on each car we sell a lot of cars and I'm still under market value so we got it priced at 29 99 plus fees fees are going to be your tax and license and ever done a couple payment examples here financing examples and that's going to vary based on your credit and down payment things like that but um you know these are mid-range so it could be a little higher or lower but with 1500 down short-term 36-month 584 a month 48 month for 49 or you can do standard terms 60 month financing at about 360 797 a month and you can also go 72 months it's possible in this car I always recommend going shorter term whenever possible because it'll keep you in a better equity position you'll pay less interest but I you could probably go 72 months on this at about 314 a month and these payments include interest to tax and everything's been factored into the payment such a couple examples there to give a kind of idea of what you know 2999 might look like Smart's financing is concerned and yeah clean carfax happy to go over that with you in more detail when you

dual coil inside ceramic heating element no exposed coil baking style pure taste I can agree with that the baking style pure taste situation it's real like I taste 100% oil no no no burning or anything like that you know how some other tanks you will get that burning taste to it I don't I don't get that here and it says three seconds to 428 degrees Fahrenheit right now I'm running my dog

there is buildin it's smoking super nice but I really like the slow it but it's intense like it's building up in there nice cloud [Music] it's so good the paper says dual quartz rod outside works between 20 to 35 watts so 12 seconds for 396 Celsius 24 seconds for 527 Celsius 36 seconds for 566 Celsius 48 seconds for 583 self due to the temperatures been tested under 28 watts [Music] wow that's strong and that's why it gets right to the point real fast but immediately vaping off that oil gets a nice soft you see that smoke starts building up when you go for it nothing but teeth in the box and see if there's anything else in the box the same thing 3.7 volts [Music] yeah I was trying to set it there I pretty much had it right there when I was that 3.5 so move it up a little bit to 27

that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel

size Matt knows what he's doing out there in Humboldt County this atomizer has been a few years in the making and the hard work shows over this well thought well crafted vaporizer that will finally give you a great addition to your box mod that you can vape herbs without buy an additional expensive units the overall value of the unit and the fact you can rebuild it making an all-around very attractive offer very nice retail packaging and with it you get the atomizer a mixing tool I would call it a dad tool but I wouldn't dab in this a brush some extra screws a mini Phillips and instruction booklet unfortunately the light of Ja doesn't come with it you have to find that on your own of course this won't work on its own you need a box that accepts 510 threads preferably one with temperature modes that'll work with different elements the more batteries the better too if you want to use it all day and don't mind the look of my box in this video it's been around since the tribe came out of Egypt I've been using the atomizer in power mode at around 30 watts just to note most mods have a fire limit at 10 seconds which is not enough to really get it going the booklet says the second or third hit will be the best I found this to hold true but the first hit is the flavor hit the time that makes you shift your tongue to capture the taste again flavor it I have noticed a fine grime and a firm pack give me the best results when using Tim mode set the TCR to 300 with 33 watts at 370 degrees for a starting point and adjust to your preference stirring is optional but it does bake evenly the best way to clean is to brush it out after every session if the deep cleaning is needed all parts can be submerged in ISIL or just put some ice on a q-tip and swab it out if the atomizer shorts out disassembled by removing the three base screws then remove the screws from the post and take the leads out and replace the oven reassemble in reverse and make sure you don't overly tighten the screws this can crack your ceramic trust me I know from firsthand experience if your atomizer does read a short make sure all screws are tightened before you replace the oven [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this thing costs around $40 and performs like vaporizers triple its price it should be a good fit if you want to on demand bait that won't cook your herbs in between hits you have a ton of ISA gear already and want to take the plunge into vaporizing dry herbs you're a person who values variables and won an experience as unique as yourself you want something that will draw no extra attention by using it in public or your car maybe you just want something you can fix yourself for cheap and don't like sending your vaporizers around the world when and if they break the flavor is also great once you get the settings dialed in this vaporizer might not suit your needs if you don't have a box mod or if you're someone who doesn't like to tinker the screws get loose from time to time you want a vaporizer with preset variables and don't want to have to figure it out or you just want something for micro doses or your clumsiest [ __ ] the atomizer is nowhere near as sturdy as the box you're impatient and can't wait into the second or third heat cycle to get good clouds or maybe you have a fear of douchey dudes with beards and handlebar mustaches that inquire about your juice flavor they are out there lurking the v2 dry herb atomizer might sound like a very robotic name but the hits this atomizer gives you taste nothing but organic and blissful if you have a box mod already an atomizer with the MSRP of under $40 as a hell of a deal even if you want other vaporizers it's a great emergency vape that'll make sure you never have to

instructions that are printed on the back the package includes an uzi 320 mAh battery is dabber tool with a very cool silicone tip it can be used for all your dabbing needs and the ooze charger USB chargers must be used with wall plugs that are designed for USB ports gaming devices computers and other electronics are not covered under warranty it also comes with two additional quartz wax tanks as you can see on the bottom of the slim twist Pro there is a voltage gauge this will allow you to change your voltage from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight volts we recommend that you start at three point three and then work your way up to turn the battery on click the button five times within two seconds that will flash green that means that it is on and ready to use to fill the quartz wax tank unscrew the mid section and then use your dapper tool to add concentrate directly on the coils once you have added your material screw the top piece back on all you have to do next is click the button and enjoy your session the slim twist Pro has a 15 second whole time if you have found yourself wanting to use a cartridge it is extremely simple to interchange it with the coarse wax take this battery works with any 510 thread simply take your battery and screw off the quartz wax tank we recommend you inspect the thread of the battery and the cartridge thread before screwing it up

and today we'll be talking about our hybrid tank which is our adapter attachment for wax and dabs that works with any 510 thread mod batteries now we're just gonna take the take the the kit apart right here just open up the box and you're gonna see what the contents the kid are you have a dab tool but you don't throw this dab tool away because honestly there's one of the best dab tools that I've gotten my hands on it is made out of a stainless steel it can be torched it has a really good curve it's really precise and high quality so pay special attention to that when you have it it comes with extra gaskets rubber gaskets for the tank and use a dab tool to easily get a hold of them what that'll do is when your gaskets wear out as you remove the glass and as it gets hot you will want to put new gaskets on there to keep the glass on tight and keep a good seal so you're gonna want to replace those and you also have a extra heater in case if you burn this one out and eventually the heaters do burn out and have to be replaced so you have one extra one to play with let's jump right into the tank it's a unique tank but it is also delicate it does have a full glass body and when this tank first comes over tune those gaskets are tight it's sometimes hard to separate the body in order to fill it so well we suggest to people is you really got to be gentle expecially on your first one as you secure the base firmly with your hand or you know your fingernail in there and then you really kind of gotta just wiggle and massage it off give it a little twist and then it pops right off and you know the way that you fill this tank is you unscrew the heater cap and this is also your entryway to cleaning now this tank has a dual quartz rod feeder power plant and it also has a ceramic bowl surrounding the tank area this these are really thick rods and this tank can run up to high power I would say run it below 28 watts but if you run it of 27 28 Watts it will take that sustainably and it won't burn out the heaters which will be a very intense and a rapid heat up time so what you would do what I recommend to people is either place your concentrates using your dab tool you know be very gentle around the rod so you don't want to tamper with the power plant you can get a place that concentrates directly directly onto the rods or you can place them gently around the bowls because this ceramic still gets so hot that it will vape things a lot of people say what is the hybrid tank used for as a use for liquids it's mainly used for wax dabs crumble any type of sauce or or any type of solid concentrates you know people always say that it's a shatter tank and things like that so it'll work with any of those textures we don't recommend putting any liquids in there because then not there won't burn it or taste good but it's because you'll constantly have to be filling it I would check out our sub ohm tank for liquids so once you've placed it in there you just take your top on screw it back on to the heater assembly you would screw this onto your mod battery then gently wiggle and make sure that the glass goes all the way down and once you see that the glass is connected with the base you'll know that you're secure then you screw it on and it's happy vaping from there so for this tank and several other cool products check out our website vape honey

just ask fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger I never washed my we box so how are you supposed to keep your denim smelling dandy experts suggest eliminating odor by spritzing jeans with white vinegar vodka then hanging them out to dry the smell of alcohol and vinegar will fade away as the jeans dry they also recommend freezing your jeans once a month to kill off the smell caused by bacteria the process can be seen here in this demo video from the gap turn open saw Dale and I freeze them overnight or for two days it's a genius idea to keep you looking flies oh my I did not know they were adding that

bit about the supplies needed for the drafting process some of the tips and tricks I wanted to point out to you that I posted this document on our d2l site um so this is it's actually broken out in two places here but under the section called resources this is the whole book so this is a book about our traditional representation drawing by hand and that is this document here and so some of the basic tips and tricks some of the stuff I talked about how best to hold the pencil we're talking about language today but some of the other concepts in architectural drafting or kind of outlined really clearly in this in this book so I would recommend again he talked about like lead weights and stuff I would recommend you kind of flip through this and take a look at the production section he talks a little bit about how to use triangles how to divide distance etc etc that's a really useful section of this book but what we're going to focus on today is what are kind of orthographic projections and so an orthographic projection is a drawing called a pair line drawing and basically what that means is if you imagine looking at this little diagram that this is our drawing page and our drawing page is like a 2d planar environment and so if we take an object a 3-dimensional object such as in this case of a little kind of representation of a house and projected onto that plane be a series of lines that are all parallel to each other and then we get what's called an orthographic projection basically it's just the type of drawing that and that for example you can you can measure you can dimension that that is to scale so plans sections elevations axonometric drawings are all considered orthographic projections now there is also this thing called an oblique projection we're not gonna talk about that that's a slightly different thing sort of in between the two I'm sorry in between oblique and axonometric and then there's a something called that perspective projection which is where you have kind of a vanishing point or a series of vanishing points and we'll get into that more later but basically I'm going to show you kind of how to construct an elevation section style drawings of your of your models in the style of an orthographic projection which is to say you know precise well represented line drawing that has exact dimensions and and graphic conventions so again here we see this is the front of the house this is the top of it this is the side of it right so this is kind of how we generally construct orthographic projections we imagine that we live in a world where there are no vanishing points and we just kind of take the edges of something and draw them exactly two dimension so I'm gonna skip through some of this other stuff we'll come back to this what is what what specific types of axonometric hard so and so forth [Music] and I wanted to get to a little bit later on it talks a little bit about lightweights this version of the word here she does talk about digital representation as well you might find useful Oh okay okay so multi-view drawings here we go so in this section you kind of described some of the techniques that you would use to kind of construct without construct because because generally what you do is you kind of take measurements you draw certain types of lines first - for example establish the overall dimensions of something and then you can add detail you add here you add a graphic conventions and he describes how to deal with more traditional styles of architecture we're going to do it with Ken over simple different model objects but for instance he describes you know how to kind of apply and line weights to create a spatial depth in an orthographic projection um so anyway so that's kind of stuff we're going to talk about today and if you're interested you can refer to to this book and it's a good idea to refer to this book and just kind of get yourself on up to speed in terms of what these types of drawings are if you don't know okay but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you how to draw an orthographic orthographic projection this little model so this is kind of a I made the model I was using before a little bit bigger and and I'm gonna show you how to kind of represent this guy in orthographic projection so and I'm also an attorney so basically as I said before what you want to do and again this will help if you have a kind of a grid or a kind of unit base unit system that defines like the size of the shapes in your ribbon but for example as we discussed before my ribbon is like three inches each element is branches wide and the curvature of my of all my cones and cylinders is also based on the same dimension so I'm kind of operating relative to a square grid right so either way I turn this I'm looking at three inches there I'm looking at three inches there and I'm looking at three inches there and this is a little bit different because it's a larger scale but I'm still looking at a three inch wide strip relative to uh you know a radius it's twice as big so a six inch radius um okay so basically what I can do in order to draw an orthographic drawing is is use those measurements and begin to construct so generally speaking as I talked with to you in the other tutorial what you want to do is use your lighter lighter line weight to begin to construct a drawing oftentimes so I'm just going to draw on graph paper because I don't have that so that I don't have to like actually perform it but what you'll want to do is kind of measure out on your page the right dimensions in order to begin to draw before neat shapes and stuff if we start by trying to draw this projection so basically looking at it from the top down um again I'm gonna measure it so I'm also drawing mine the scale you guys will draw yours at full scale so it'll be easy to measure branches in your model will equal three inches on the page I'm gonna do one inch equals three inches so for example right here that's about an inch and I'm gonna describe initial cylinder that's a kind of inch and a half radius in my model a half inch radius here that's the initial cylinder and then what I would do is I would say okay the next segment of my model is a three inch long straight section and so I would draw that out on my page right there and again I'm drawing kind of harder so that you can really see the lines I've already drawn that here so that you so that I know but I don't myself but um I'm drawing with a little bit harder line wait so you guys can see it better but what you want to do is draw really really lightly at first and kind of construct that struck the shapes before you go ahead and add line weights so I would still be drawing really lightly for doing this anyway again like for example this is my first cone so you would use that ellipse drawing technique that we talked about in there first or you know I would take my compass and I would draw you know all the way out to the X line X dimension over relative to the width of the strips of three inches if I have a three inch white strip I would take my line and draw her into that radius and then I would draw a tighter radius based on the intersection of those two lines and that's all described in in the manual drafting tutorial but again I would draw the hole so even though when we look at this thing you know we don't see that part of this cone that's behind this cone right but right now I'm just kind of mapping out where all the lines go so I actually would I would just draw that line so that I know where everything needs to line up and likewise I would draw again in this dimension because I know this edge is six inches I'm going to draw a straight six inch wide I got that right okay he's made it right there and then I would use the same technique so I'm drawing based on this radius and putting my compass on that radius and I'm drawing my line out I'm taking the center point between those two lines including the ellipse okay and that I could do the same thing so I would measure up three inches there the cylinder because we know example that that the diameter is 3 inches radius is inch and a half so I can just draw this line basically I'm looking at that edge right there and my plan and I'm going to draw that in inch and a half away from this edge drawing out three inches and then another inch and a half and that's the end of that strip as it rotates away from our view or point of view okay now what I could do next is I could actually line wait that drawing now what I would recommend you do is is not line right the drawing I would recommend you do is use that drawing to begin to construct the rest of your orthographic projections and what I mean by that is you know like in the chain book it describes how you can use what are called construction lines to take measurements from one drawing and bring them to the next drawing for example what we're doing what we just did was we drew this drawing and this projection so looking straight from the top but what if we wanted to draw it in this projection looking straight on from the side well a lot of those distances are exactly the same even though we're looking at another projection so what we can do is we can take construction lines from this initial projection and we can draw them down on our page and we can use them to construct our next projection I don't need to see that line because that's not a line that shows up on my surface in other words it should be considered as part of the whole ribbon I'm gonna take the extents I'm gonna draw the extent of my first and you can go ahead and just draw them I usually just draw them past where they need to go this went down [Music] okay and again I'm drawing with my lightest line in other words my hardest lead and I'm drawing very very lightly because once we go back through and and add line weights to this drawing that stuff those lines are all going to kind of fade into the background so they'll still be there but they won't catch your eye in other words we'll still understand the shape in the right way but we won't necessarily see those lines as much so anyway so now that I've taken some of the dimensions off of that drawing and brought them down [Music] I can begin to draw the other projection of my shape so I know this is the end of that that cylinder again because I'm looking at it from the side and because it's an orthographic projection it just looks like a right angle you and then here what I drew before is a right angle I'm now looking at it from the side looking at that right there so I can see side of that cylinder and because I'm looking an orthographic you just looks like a half circle and then I'm going to draw the ellipse so again the orthographic projection of a cone is an ellipse and I take the radius from the other end again I don't actually see it here because it's hid behind the other they're the firma drawing and here as well I see the side of my cone I would see that again that's an ellipse so do the same thing in a smaller scale we are using four radius and connect you okay okay so now we've constructed two orthographic projections of this shape one from the top and one from the side so what I could do now is you know and again I would finish drawing all your orthographic projections and finish laying out all your lines before you start to line wait because that's when you're gonna get when you're gonna start spreading the most and a mess around by moving by your tools around on the paper and putting your hand down the paper etc so what I'm gonna do is kind of describe how you might lineweight something like this and just to go back to our drawing here for a moment outside to our book for a moment and reference chain again so he kind of describes this process especially with a plan drawing or an elevation drawing the way you line way to drawing is the lines that are closest to where you're looking in other words that are closest to you from where we're looking are the heaviest lines and then the lines that are farthest from you or from your perspective are the lightest lines and the reason that we draw that way is to create spatial depth so the heavier align graphically more it kind of pops off the page and the lighter align graphically the more at kind of recedes and so in order to make this appear as though the wall we're cutting through here for example is closer to us and maybe some of the furniture is further away or line on the floor is further away we use a kind of hierarchy of lines thicknesses of lines that's what's called line reading but for example here he's starting to add these kind of line weights and see the walls are the thickest thing because in a plan you're cutting through the walls so they are necessarily the closest thing to your view and then everything else is kind of a set of steps behind that and then oftentimes you'll see pushing that we're not going to draw that way quite yet because we're just representing kind of in paper models but anyway so so what we're gonna do is we're gonna enter our drawings in the same way we're gonna use heavier lines for the edges that are closer to our view and lighter lines for the edges that are further from our view and so I I really only have two other hardnesses of lead I haven't kind of medium and then I have a really soft one and so what I would do and I generally I generally try and use both at the same time so in other words I'll go through and retrace all the lines that are visible in my drawing and and give them a line weight at all at the same time now you may not have more than one led holder so it might not be practical to do that but if you can use it so anyway so again if we're looking at this projection obviously this top edge is the thing closest to us um and so I'm going to start to trace those lines and again because this edge right here looking at the top of this piece of material rather than we're even though that line is actually right on top of this seam where we see these two ribbons joined at a corner we're going to use a heavier line way to represent the top edge because that's what we're looking here so get through race you I'm not doing this the way that you guys would not doing this the way that you guys would if you had drafting boards again you would always want to trace every line just once and make the movements as continuous as possible course that's a lot easier to do when you have mr. there it's a lot easier to do when you have looking to rest your pencil of games like a triangle or comes this okay and so actually as we see that line start to fade I'm sorry as we see the edge of that line we should also see the kind of thickness of that line fade we're not going to be too crazy about that right now but anyway so that those lines will be the heaviest ones and then we'll take our other line so our medium-weight pencil and we'll trace out the rest of the lines again because I was pressing harder before you see a whole lot of difference you should start to see kind of some thickness the obviously had a little thickness even okay and then the other thing that I kind of discussed a little bit in the in the last tutorial is one thing you can do to really make these kind of three-dimensional shapes more clear when you're drawing them in orthographic is emphasize the thickness of the material now I know that may sound counterintuitive because we're drawing to scale here and because this is a very thin material you almost wouldn't even see it right especially because you're driving at full scale the thickness of your lines is going to be about the same as the thickness of the material however what you can do is basically cheat a little bit and add more thickness to the paper than what you would actually then what you actually have in your model and just to kind of demonstrate what this looks like and I know I showed it before as well draw like an offset line around the areas where we're looking at an edge of the paper that's going to help me understand exactly that where there's an edge and where there's a face another line here becomes what we see is the edge start to disappear into a single line so about halfway through that comes going to become a single line like that and the same is true for up above and again you would do this by [Music] removing your really race lately or just in your compass race lately okay and so I don't know if you can see I really cleaned it or not it's kind of not that clean because I'm drawing by hand but anyway so we have a kind of double line and again that'll show us where we have we're looking at the thickness of the material rather than at the but the face of the material okay and so maybe I'll go ahead and do this one as well you and and then once you're kind of done drawings I will show you how to you strike two cut throwing that's been cut through you okay so something like that and then go over the rest of the stuff with the lighter line weight it's a little bit further from our eye [Music] so you should start to kind of see some sense of the volume of the space of the of the model by drawing it in that way the other thing I want to show you is is how to draw a plan so even though we're looking at this from the top what we're doing is we're looking at looking at it in basically like an aerial aerial view aerial projection and the difference between basically it's the difference between like a roof plan and a floor plan so a roof plan again we're looking at like the top of a house or the top of something essentially what we've drawn here is a roof plan we've drawn from above we're looking from above where the model is I'm looking down at it now a floor plan typically in a section we're looking at an object by cutting through the middle of it so imagine we were to take our model equipment out and we were to cut along a virtual plane that goes right through the middle of this geometry and then draw it that's basically what a plan or a section is so we're kind of cutting through it virtually and then we're drawing what you would see had we actually made those cuts hopefully that makes sense and so what we can do in order to draw that is we can take dimensions from from other types of drawings like these ones we've already drawn and and we can pull them down and draw our power plan so what I'm going to do now is draw just one more projection really quick and then we'll come back and we'll do that plan drawing but a positive person okay so that's roughly what we would see if we went from this projection looking at the object from the top this projection which you can barely see looking at it from kind of the end so we're taking this and tumbling it in our page to look at that projection of the of the model and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw my virtual plan cut I'm through that through that drawing and so using my white pencil again and you can do the same on this drawing because as we're looking at side and front but we're basically looking at the same two sides anyway you can draw a ritual plan cuts for our object and kind of figure out where exactly things different things are going to show up so now what I'm going to do it again is I'm gonna tumble my view so I'm gonna go from looking at my object like that to looking at it like that that's what I would yeah I want to look at it like that but I'm also gonna look at it cut through I'm gonna I'm gonna basically open me when I cut through halfway through the middle of this guy that's that cone there I'm gonna cut right through the middle of that by that cylinder and I'm gonna cut through the middle of this big cone not through the middle actually about three-quarters up right through that guy um okay and so what I can do is by tracing out where this virtual plane cut is I can figure out exactly where my cut is going to stop and start so for example that line intersects the side of my cone right here and that means that that what we're going to see when we cut through it and the line that ends at that point and likewise I'm going to pull these lines down even though they're just aligned all those lines down as well we kind of plan out that's stuff for sure yeah so let's begin perhaps by drawing the edge that defines our smaller cone but be right there our account is going to look again you would draw it kind of using the elliptical technique like that we're actually cutting through the smaller come I'm not so concerned with what it'll look like yeah let's walk on we go six inches and then right down here is where we would be cutting through halfway up in our cylinder that spot right there is where we're cutting right through the middle of our cylinder just like that and then that's about it there and we could actually draw out or the bottom of this count is two and really really light line but if you use a dashed line if you wanted to to represent that it's behind something that we're looking we could say that right there that's the point where we're also gonna see that's where our cone starts getting drawn again it's been cut away that's where it ends getting drawn that's the part we can still see and then this line is the point where we're going to stop seeing the cone now technically return is kind of a tricky thing to visualize and so [Music] know what you can do is you can like you can google it and look up and the Google images of what that looks like and what I actually did and what I recommend you guys do for every anything you can't figure out I'm just just make a quick model of it so for example I took this extra cone that I had modeled and I drew a line on it and so I basically I held it up to my cutting mat so I could see and looked kind of as as straight up and down as I could so I could see where the line need was started stuff I pull that right into the camera you can see what I'm talking about and then I drew very very carefully while looking straight down I drew a line crossed the M across the face of the cone so imagine we're cutting through with a flat plane Britta's cone that's what the line would look like in one projection and then if I turn it the other way I can get a sense of what the line would look like and the other projection I don't see that so when we cut through a cone we get this kind of a sharper curved line that then it purrs out into a much straighter line and at that point where the cut line intersects the edge of the cone but yet we also get a point we don't get like a tangent between those two lines so what we would see as we're cutting through oh well this first thing strongly started this calm you that's kind of what the code would look like and that's actually exactly where we cut through it again I'm just making this up but you guys will use your elliptical run techniques to make that curve properly so okay and then looking at this that's where our plan good is going to start and that's where it's gonna end we wouldn't actually be seeing that part of the cone in other words it looks empty okay so we see that it's kind of tangent to the existing edge of the cone and then it makes a straight point at the other end of the cone and that's kind of what that line will look like and then we would also see the edge of our if down below here then one second okay you so you would actually see this link us as well and I'm not all to go that far you again that would be our ticket line that's a plane cut you the lens will help you be a lot cleaner than mine okay this is a little darker okay that's roughly what we would see if we cut through this thing from that direction and that just shows you how to relate one projection to another one especially when you're drawing a section or an or a plan cut through plans okay so the next thing I wanna talk about is how to construct something called an axonometric and if I go back to my chain reference here all the way up oh well isolated and we're on Celeste page 31 three four right there and so here is what you're gonna describes what what different types of axonometric drawings are and an axonometric drawing is is also a form of parallel projection that has attendant has for shortening but in order to draw pet the rig in the draw we're not going to use for shortening so there's a couple different types that basically just they all mean they're they're like different angles so like a trimetric diametric isometric is like a 30 you know 15 degree or something the isometric is kind of the basic one which is like sixty degrees on both sides that's record I would oblique okay and I've moved somewhere else in the book he talks about to or so what like what an isometric really is but anyway so I'll just walk you through it so basically what that means is and I have a piece of graph paper here that's at that's at the kind of isometric angle already so I like we discussed in the manual drafting tutorial [Music] basically that line so for referencing like a maid you know I'm that angle right there should be 30 degrees and worried there should also be 30 degrees and then that a or ninety degrees 360 degrees outside you can also think of it this way if we draw one line that way one that way one that way you should get 120 degrees on each side looking at the corner of a box for example okay and so this is where we draw kind of again in parallel projection so we're drawing to scale um in asymmetric anyway something in a kind of three-dimensional view so for example were to draw a cube like that we would see please see one corner of the cube coming towards us and a couple of the edges that defined the kind of silhouette of the cube now the way the deadlines waiting works in an axonometric is a little bit different because what we're focused more on is not things that are closest to us but the things that are understanding what elements are separate from what other elements are if it makes sense but anyway to demonstrate let's imagine that we're drawing the house you you okay we draw a house like that again you can kind of see that that's the pitched roof at either end it's kind of an l-shaped thing and in order to line with this drawing the first and the heaviest line right that we're going to use is actually what's called a profile lines and so fortunate I drew this a little too close to my view but anyway so the profile line basically means one way that's been described is anywhere where the drawing touches the air in other words where the edge of my of something is is kind of surrounded by something by nothing so the edge of this drawing or the edge of our view of the house right now is that line right there that makes sense the line that basically defines the kind of overall outline so all these lines that are on the outer edge would be the thickest lines okay now you can see that the kind of outline of the overall shape is a lot heavier than the drawing itself then we could add some detail to the lines that to find the edges within for example these ones here and so the rule to follow with Exxon dimetric drawings is wherever you see a line that is that it's coming towards you in other words because this is like a con VEX corner of the house this line is coming towards this is kind of pointing towards us that becomes a heavier line so convex lines become heavier on cave Lions recede those two are concave you okay and so we have a kind of hierarchy there between the overall profile line and Rex lines and the concubines that's three layers and then you can have a whole lot of other layers if there were other details to the drawing like you know surface treatments or doors and windows etc so basically that's how you at a line wait an axonometric drawing now I'm going to go ahead and go through the exercise of drawing this guy in axonometric which I already kind of did the other day see what would you see if you do it like that I draw like that basically and this one I'll draw them bit bigger than last time but kind of the way you draw in accent oh my trick is you've constructed in a similar way to into a plane or a section you use the dimensions so for example if we start let's start kind of at this corner here and we know that that is inches how many is basically four grid lines like I was before even though this is slightly larger graph paper and also again the way that you construct a circle in XR metric so let's say for drying the miserable top edge of our cylinder like so we would take the start and end point of the first half of the cylinder and we would draw a perpendicular line to the grid line and then boom the intersection of those two lines is is the center point of that circle we would set the point of our compass there and we would draw a line connecting this edge in that point and likewise for the for the other side of the circle we would also draw a line perpendicular to the grid line through the start and end of that jerk my pencil been anyway and then we would use that as a center point for the edge of that line and so that's how you would construct the edges of a circle I'm in the correct projection using in axonometric I'm starting to isometric specifically okay and I'm going to draw the rest of this guy's you you okay this guy comes down [Music] there and again what you want to do in these types of drawing this is you want to draw silhouette line so down below we would also see the edge of that cylinder again we would construct that out of two marks again and I would use my triangle to find the kind of silhouette line along this edge is where intersects with the other side of the cylinder and so I kind of cone there that's the start of our cone that would be the end of our cone and to draw those in axonometric we can just draw a big circle basically if we look at that's the center between those two that's the center where we place our compass we draw a big circle and it's not actually perfect but that's close enough it makes for like that and then below it also dry the edge of our cylinder again [Music] and we would also draw from that point to that point at the in the middle see how far is that so we're going to that point trying to draw this art you okay that would be the bigger account you and there is a thing in Chang's book where he talks about you know trying to draw by looking at where you're going rather than looking at your hand that's certainly true for those kinds of operations anyway oops there we see we see the kind of outline of the overall shape and then I would mine made it so again even though this is not a line that even really exists in my physical model all right that's we're looking at the edge of a cylinder there it looks like a line right because the angle of our drawing that would become a heavier limit as it's a profiler at a silhouette name is true of these big arcs you and then like we did before we would I can't emphasize these lines between with the darker and carry it if you wanted to you could do that mind thickness here it kind of just messed up now would kind of make it look a little more three-dimensional okay and so that's about it that's how you would construct an axonometric drawing of these types of shapes and and I think I'm going to wrap up there so the perspective drawing will be covered in another tutorial and some of the diagramming techniques will be covered in class and we'll go

my man Rayman always brings up cutting the inverted notch in the feed tube let's start with that this mod has the new contacts and the new connector I should say the new connector obviously it has the new contacts I'm with the new connector I would just rip that hose off there but let's assume that you maybe don't have a new connector you have an older model or whatever and it doesn't have this new you could identify the new um 510 connector by the fact that it's stainless steel it's hard to explain but one way to identify this your hose is connected beneath the Delrin it just rips off well let's assume for this video purpose that whether you had a new or old connector how do you an cut that to inverted V that you hear Rain Man tell all the new REO knots let's show you got a little black background working here let's see if I can um even zoom in a little for you because some you will want to see the whole Dale and its entirety now I learned this method from my man on filthy beast I was cutting it with scissors you can do it with scissors but I'm gonna recommend you against it because you cut much more better of an inverted V with them in exactly now I've got my rail exactly I don't have my wife's little golden Ginsu deal I've got a rail exactly she's gonna make you a little cut like that straight through turn this hose no rocket science here and there you will see the legendary inverted B then you just put your bottle back on and you are good to go all right guys super X here again I might have an older Rio Grande here but only use for this purpose of teaching and demonstrating contact maintenance how to clean the contacts I have one that basically showed setting up a brand new mod let's assume you have an older mob that may or may not have the new 510 connection installed may or may not have the cool thing about with the new 510 connection I saw Rob Jie was one of the guys many people are gonna ask this question I'll show you later that that host you just rip it right off there okay I'm gonna have to show you a rips right off so let's get into what we were talking about now I just wash this mod out I washed it in the sink with very hot water when I did that obviously I took I have this off here I pulled it off the bottle in the hose so I just put it back on so we want to we want to kind of talk about cleaning this positive contact and why you want to maintain that what's important two things are important one don't take your only mod apart and and go about doing this stuff because you can get frustrated I'm an impatient person begin with but when you get frustrated you tend to rush and you tend to not do things right and you tend to mess them up always have something to bait I don't care if your other mod isn't a REO it will should be soon if it isn't yet but I always have something to be like want anything else you're doing in life and you do anything vape related have something the baby so you sit and chill when you need for this is alcohol I have this in a little dropper bottle and then we're gonna get under spring I use a combination of things I use no locks no locks under the spring and I used EOCs at gold on the gold portions and the positive pin and the tops of my batteries are also going to go through the batteries I think that's an important thing so let's get all this stuff out of the way let's start by this positive contact how we're going to clean it to make sure I can get some good light in there for you guys so we could see this what I use is an eraser first okay just give me an eraser you I mean I build usually it's somewhere between point five and point seven this isn't a racer it just looks kind weird and I'll just get this thing and rub it onto that contact a little bit to just just rub it I'm pushing down on it and I'm rubbing it okay just a little bit you know you're not meaning to go crazy with this thing okay do never ever ever file these gold contacts if you have an older mod they kind of a video on how to do those contacts but that's it I rubbed it okay there's that contact next step q-tip alcohol let me get a paper towel to drip this on over here it's gonna get a q-tip I'm gonna get this alcohol might drip it over here onto the tip of this q-tip get it nice and wet and I'm going to just wipe this contact with it okay it's no big deal again you're just wiping it you're gonna keep it clean you want you want to keep your mods clean guys girls chicks dudes hombres women keep them clean keep that contact nice and clean if you clean it often you will find that and then we're gonna clean batteries and everything next I have a battery we're gonna go through that so there you go that contact is now nice and clean while you have your good alcohol and your q-tip you could swab around your spring but I want to go one step further we're gonna go into now this is this might apply for people whether you have a brand new mod or an older mod you want under that spring to be clean you want the screw to be clean so let's do this but take this bottle off here new hose is a little bit when you gotta pull it which is cool but putting it back on you just wet it and it goes back on that's a hot swappable hose and the new one there's no need to do any tools the new connector so let's go ahead and do this spring while we're at it um Philips head screw you want a driver that has some good grip on it I'm just gonna put it in here turn this so this is a black wrinkled mod and there's your screwed don't lose your screw you will be bumming and there's your spring okay now look there's some crud underneath them on look at that most of that crud is nil elack's so it's it's time to clean it so you can see that I've taken on a black wrinkle now again I'm probably an over-the-top freak but I like to get maximum conductivity out of my mom so I sanded off the finish under the spring I did it with a fine grit you don't want to groove the heck out of that because that's gonna defeat the purpose but because it will probably have a little more grooving it's not a flat perfectly flat surface that's why I use Nowell axe here I do not use no axe on the rest of my contacts we're gonna put that all the no apps on the spring and everything when I get done we're gonna wipe this out here real good get all that old gunk II know acts out of there that's the reason I hate no exit some nasty greasy stuff but I do believe it has its purpose underneath the spring I think that's what no ax belongs now I'm gonna get some alcohol here I'm working kind of around a camera so I gotta kind of do things a little differently put a little alcohol down in there and just wipe it out real good that's it you know that's that surface should be really clean now and I sanded that off I did not get completely crazy you'll see that there's some paint there but the main area of contact around the spring has been sanded again is that it was that necessary I don't know but I know I wanted it to contact bare aluminum and it does okay so that's that now what we're gonna do is the spring just has a little no ax on it here is the no ax now what I've done is I've sort of engineered me a little system of holding a little this was one of those drop or things that come so I cut that part off of it that um that you squeeze and I used this part to apply no locks so I'm gonna get at me a little Nowak's now this has never I don't think I've ever done this on camera so this could be a messy procedure if messes bother you you might want to turn off the camera now that's again why I hate this stuff but I'm really just busting your chops it's not that messy but I'm just putting a little bit of this stuff here you know and that's it that should help I was putting that in the wrong place that should help um stick that spring back in there to the putting in this spring is always something that I just it's not a hard task I just dread doing it because I quite frankly suck at it much easier to put in your spring when your bottle is not in all I do is I put it in there line up the holes with the networks it makes it a little more difficult to line them up and I saw it I see the hole there it is a nice press down on the spring get this put it here back in there I've heard talk of putting no locks in the threads I think with my screw grabs it should and I have a feeling that I'm not getting this this time because I just wow that is on that is not like me to get that on the first time so now you're gonna make sure your spring is nice and straight I get to be a little stickler about that this time I'm gonna make sure it's done a lot quicker than it has been in my previous videos because I know nobody has time to waste watching this crap you just want to get your ma going so just hold it down real good get your finger behind it there and look at me wrestling with this thing like it's I'm just gonna challenge you stick a tripod and a camera between you and what you're doing and see if you're the sumo you think you are - there you go spring you want to be nice and tight not so tight that you go crazy but nice and tight you know that should do it okay so these this is your negative connection you want it to be you have good contact and now with no locks it so what that means is at this point I need to check the hands get any no acts off the hands that stuff is just greasy it's good there for me I like it under the spring that's the only place in my mod so a lot of people like to running on their arm positive contact too that's great it's cold to me it attracts stuff it's like a it's better than running nothing I'm gonna tell you that right now you'll need something on there but it attracts dirt dust and grime and all that good stuff which is why you're gonna see me going in here with alcohol and and cleaning out around that spring as much as I can so I can make sure that I'm not really attracting any go to my mod all I wanted it was underneath there okay now while I'm in here at this q-tip I want to clean the top of this spring because right here is where we're gonna put a little deoxy go from the diauxic family of products I'll just use gold I never let my mods get to a point where they need to be cleaned beyond what you've just seen and while we're doing all this this mod is in perfect running order over here Mama's gonna grab me a quick Oh how come they always put this stuff on when I'm trying to do videos this is a live version just kills okay so now we got that done all this other to drivers and stuff can get out of the way these q-tips done now we got our dioxide gold pen it comes in a pan I shake it up I'm going to put a little bit on the positive contact you just top just pulls off okay we're gonna take the positive contacts see it down there and we're just gonna put a little on now let me show you something buddy ox it go it's not this stuff as did cuz it's not like you this you just need a little bit and that's it if you can hardly see you don't even see it going on there you'll see it better on a battery and then just rub a little on the top contact of your spring there okay that's it killer alright now the mod is good this mod is good now when I brought down here with me I know I'm a little cheater because I wanted to show you I'm putting the hose back on here but I got a bottle that already has some juice in it I'm not gonna need to put that hose on you could put it on just like that you just pull it down a little this hose is wet with BG this and Nick bass that's typically what I'll be vaping that's the only thing I do they been you need to stick it on here now why am i showing you this because once I get this battery done well put it on there and we're gonna observe that you probably will not see any arcing so that's that a bottle now you could just do a couple things you could either do that or you can open this and drop it I know I'm gonna have some serious juice finger here but we're gonna take care of that because I got stuff to take care of juice finger and then I'm gonna take care of where I get to anything else here I don't want juice inside of my mobs around my mods the only place I wanted is in that bottle in the feed tube and then that atomizer okay so now we're good alright we're good look look look at how the ball is near a empty tube folks okay so we want to do at this point is get a battery here's how we clean our batteries what I do is I mark my batteries I've noticed over the years if you try and put like a one two or three or something on the sides they won't stay i marked the top with a sharpie this would indicate that this is battery number six of these 1600s okay you mark them so we want to clean that battery contacts want to contacts nice and clean and I don't want to clean my hands too there so what we're gonna do first is get our eraser remember our eraser and we're just gonna erase this contact we're gonna just take it and run it over the top a little bit here and there see that now if you'll notice my batteries I never let them get our can I always run the only batteries you'll ever see me run in a Rio mod is an aw button top my favorite batteries are 1600s and 2200 s any other battery may or may not work well in your rio i can't tell you but i know most people have problems with um flattop batteries a couple of reasons why one it causes your switch to throw further which means your risk you just bend in that contact more what's the overall lifespan of it is going to be reduced because of that possibly I don't know but AWI Mr button tops some of these have been around longer than others they all work good now I'm gonna get my alcohol back out they use this paper towel here just a nice clean paper towel put a little alcohol on it there I'm just gonna wipe gently wipe off the surfaces get all the old dioxide off and any eraser dust there your battery contacts points of contact are now clean this one has a little dealio right there doesn't look like anything major it's not a pits it's just it is what it is it's not like I'm looking at I don't see any black marks on it just a little bill it shouldn't impact anything okay so now what we want to do is put a little D octave gold on the contacts of this battery gin the ox it gold says to let it dry it was really cool the oxic gold says let it dry I don't want to draw anymore my batteries no watch here you may be able to see the application of it now people are probably maybe anyone that's new to vaping and or new to Rios might be going wow you got to go through all that trouble with one of those things I've got news for you so you can see it on there any mechanical mod any batteries requirement it's just that do people do it or not that's their collar if you don't do it it's not gonna fire good a regulated mod may not require this kind of maintenance but any mechanical mod well whether it's a tube or not a Rio offers one the pleasure of being able to see if it arts or not in there and you can see in there you can't see in most other types of mods and I could probably tell you that my mod is not gonna not gonna be doing any argument now probably because there's no loan on it but it's not gonna arc anyway what I happen to have is a nice beautiful Odin here to throw on here but before I do that I want to go over adjusting the contact for anybody that is also just got a mod with new adjustable contacts you're going to want to do everything I just did to this mod you're also going to need to setup your arm your 510 your adjustable 510 for your atomizers air holes ok here's how I go about doing it the first thing I do remember this is reverse threaded we're tightening this hold on let's just take a quick vape while synyster gates gets after it there they've been this bad boy right here okay first thing you wanna do and you get your mob this is an adjustable contact I don't know what size this is it came with the mod this little thing here just slips right out of this tool I just put it in this tool so since it's reverse threaded to tighten it you go the opposite of any other so it's tight now see it's tight if you wanted to adjust it to fit your atomizer on what I do is I turn it out a full turn okay get your atomizer now I'm gonna I'm gonna take the top off this you don't want to do this with the top on your atomizer because you'll never get it tight enough and that's probably why people wonder Wow my-my-my atomizer is moving and the losing connection if you got to get it tight so you can't do that with the top on can't do it so what you're gonna do is I know this is a dual coil so I'm gonna want these two air holes where I want them so I'm gonna tighten it down okay to where see where it lines up okay wait don't forget me I don't want my air holes in the front and back on a dual coil setup that was a single coil there it might be fun it's a dual so how do we adjust it let's get the tool out nope the reverse threaded connector does not require a tool it is going to require that I wipe it though because I don't like touching it put all that juice on it even though I'm gonna silver car cut so how do we adjust it what we do is now we just we see look where the air holes are what it tight it's tight now we want our air holes on the sides okay so you just loosen it out and just keep going like this and ultimately this puppy will get where you want it because it's turn as you're going out with it you're moving that screw in a little bit okay so look it's coming around screws the holes are coming around I'm gonna turn Jared down I don't find him to be this close I'm shadows and I'll find his band to be that's cool where's three minutes tomorrow me remember if that is Jared Leto or whatever his name is I think he's in bullet for my valentine my bad okay so we got our air holes where we want him now don't we sign on each side right so we're good so what we did now now we want to do is give this a good tightening down this is where you guys are failing and you're wondering why your things moving you cannot do that with the top of your atomizer on you're gonna spin the air hole okay see that all right now let's look I mean arcing barking I know it's a little bit bright in here but you're not seeing any arcing but this we have properly prepared contacts we have properly the right battery for the mod there you go this is a point five point six own build so we're good right I think we got everything we wanted to do now you've set up your REO from start to beginning you've clean your contacts to clean your batteries and we're are off to the races what I'll do is just because you are you and I am me I will vape this mod for you give a little squall cage here it's Potter bottle being nearly empty you've got to UM squonk it a little bit and guy yep a dip contact to blame everything's good to go we're rockin and rollin - killer mods

The power wand is typically used on medium to light-soiled carpet. And\nour 360 is used on medium to high-soiled carpet. Let me demonstrate for you. Now I put some\nliquid down, now I'm going back over it with a dry pass, sucking up the liquid. Ok. Now\nwe're going to go over it with the Rotovac 360. You'll notice with the 360, we're going\nto have 1700 revolutions per minute and we're going to be spraying 200 degree water, just\nlike we were over there. You can see the carpet, it's being agitated. What a difference it\nis. The worse the carpet, the slower we go. We want to make sure we get it all extracted\nout of there, all that dirt. What a difference. Look at that. You just don't get enough agitation\nwith the power wand to get this heavy soil. So here's the difference: we have the 360,\nwe have the wand on heavily-soiled carpet. Which would you rather have clean your carpet?\nThank you for watching, we hope you give us a call so we can take care of your dirty carpet.", "L_B4nhXPP48": "hey guys alright so now we're going to be doing a review on the tank I've had this thing for a while ever use it a few times it's not to you bad the airflow could be a little bit better on it we're gonna start with that but for what it is and the wattage it's supposed to run on dna200 probably not the best bet but we have a McVeigh per sub herb struction book on the radio a little bit and then we'll go over bring you up closer you can see it and we'll go from that point all right features gloss dry herb tank bait mud tank for use with sub own batteries ceramic plated for herb and concentrates no exposed coils baking watts 19 to 20 mod M R or parentheses mister battery close parentheses new ceramic heating technology three second heat up time no plastic stainless steel replaceable screen mesh avoid using temp control Maas baking style low resistance coil inside for the baking plate looks like a vapor tank which it does look like a vapor tank so that's basically pretty much all the who those and whatnot so it's for non-regulated advice don't run this thing and or it can work on a regulated device I just also makes it non-regulated which doesn't make any sense but don't put on a temperature control device it recommends like a 40 watt box basically it is a $37 and 95 cent tank not including shipping so here's our box a glass top cap make vapors babe hard my friends some classic bubble driver tank becomes another thing open a little instruction book now it's for dryer blacks tobacco or oils you got your drip tip your atomizer or nozzle fix threads just trim it preheat your Pyrex glass and your base it's a great Euler subtag what she looks like that comes out is just like a lot of strong top cap so be careful with it bacon dish now if you look a hold there oh they're old they're whole there so it's got a lot more holes for air flow than the cloud poor tank did which is nice actually surprisingly the 510 pin sticks out quite a bit too I mean quite a bit develop the wabash devil this thing was about 20 watts for dry herbs make it taste right I run this thing high anyway it's still combust it's not supposed to combust but I run it so high that it does combust just because that's where I like it comes with some spare screens see these spare screens this is cotton wait for the wax in the oil these things are kind of funky I like little plastic drip tips guess that way if you're small people you don't want to share your drip tip with it also comes with this old date band says makes our make vapes we chose 0.68 a little show up them all on the camera hey top cap on it looks just like a regular rebuildable tank alright let's back out of this and see how vixx I guess so we got ourselves some we're just want to say this system to that go don't fill this thing halfway to 2/3 so you would like it something sort of like that put your drop top cap on start it down to Tony the flavor is pretty good at 20 you don't really get any cloud out of it though this is all bad now be careful though how you hold it because all the time using straight Keef it's not bad not bad I'm gonna say I like it way more than the cloud poor way more the airflow is much much better the flavor off its much better plus you can use pretty much any model you want for it it runs on a higher wattage a little bit of combustion or two too bad no way to get a cloud he had altered though you you gotta make it combust if not it's not quite the same but making it so doesn't boast you might be taking longer heads but it's not gonna turn black I'll start up every now and then and that is a person using the other delivery method of the glass pipe plus pipe works way the [ __ ] better this will work though for like if you're driving and you don't want to look suspicious normally there's more like if we're gonna sit down we're gonna relax simply smoke because there's more than just one of us so it's just me this works perfect but that don't hold enough for more than one person but it's not bad if you don't turn it up to like its max setting last you a minute that's pretty much beat what out we'll see what we got I said I run it so combust this this is a little dried out too so I probably don't help that's what's left it's kinda black but again we did start with pretty much straight the bottom my grinder floor we finally cleaned it out after about a year so this is a year of different things getting broken up if I got to a point where I was to fall wasn't doing it your job anymore so yeah it's dried out but it still works pretty decent like I said if you're a group smoker is not what you're looking for if you're on the go or like if you smoke while you're on break at work you can leave this back to your car nobody would think anything of it because it looks like a regular tank screen clogs up a little bit oh no I don't think it's worth thirty seven dollars personally like the video I saw of it the first time I saw this one I believe it was on indoor smokers not indoor smoke there's his indoor or review or whatever the hell it is and it looked pretty decent I have no clue how they're getting the clouds out of this thing that they were getting so that part I don't quite get I think a lot of these reviewers just like doctor they're clouds a little bit like if you ever sit back and you watch ripped rippers or reviews sometimes those clouds look pretty fake if you really watch it and you watch how he's doing it they look fake maybe that's how these were putting out such big vows because it does not put out that big of a cloud but it does work well and if you're on it where it's supposed to and it doesn't make it so it turns everything black it's not bad flavor you don't really call if and you're not getting any of the material or anything in the air lungs it's just straight vape off the top of it so six or seven it's way better than cloud poor tank like if I had to go if I had to have one of these you know there's an option between this in the cloud poor tank I would go for this I think this would probably better be drilled out the air holes a little big a little more flow through er but for on the go it's not bad and if you smoke by yourself it's on that and now the techs they do solve for these this is probably one of the better ones I've seen out of them yeah thank you guys for watching please like subscribe and comment I'll put a link to MIG vapors where you can pick one of these up or you don't have to even did a review on it so thank you guys for watching I'll put my info down below to you from my Facebook and my Instagram stay tuned", "ZcpKIwjP3Sg": "hello it's Craig Craig from nature's helper dotnet day you I'm just going to do a review in some quick tutorials on the new 510 ego electronic cigarette now this one's manually operated with a button on it you press up when you smoke this one's designed for heavy smokers and generally lasts all day it has a 650 milliamp battery it actually has a spare one as well and a sparrow atomizer and 10 refillable cartridges it comes in a double decker box that's the box it comes in comes in different colors this is a bronze kit bronze color kit there's a two batteries to 650 million batteries you get about 1300 pops out of each battery and there yet to atomizers and that thing down the bottom there is just a cover for the cover of you between your atomizer and cartridge there these are your five cartridges on the top which you get another 5 on the bottom and you just pull the top layer off lift it up with a pin and there's more goods under there there's five cartridges a wall charger and a u.s. USB USB plug there that can be USB charger you can actually plug the USB charger into the wall plug to charge your e-cigarette or you can go you can plug your USB plug into your computer or even your car radio on a lot of car radios that's what your USB plug looks like that's off my own kid the wall charger is a European European ugh but it also comes comes with these free free wall adapters that fit Australian plugs the to refill refill your e-cigarette all you do is pull your car in straight out this is a new cartridge this one so I won't refill it but I'll show you what you do you'll see inside the cartridge is material in it it's um actually Dacron on on pretty sure you just put about three to four drops of this e-liquid in and tap it down the bottom of it give it a bit of a spin and a shake so it's all worked around and then you just push it back on your cigarette back on to your atomizer to get there to change the atomizer all you do is unscrew that little thing and you can either pull your cartridge off the atomizer [ __ ] that's got it now I'm unscrew your atomizer that way left anti-clockwise to unscrew and that bit is your battery and that little bit is your atomizer that screws into it now to charge a battery all you do is you get your USB adapter USB charger screw it clockwise into the charger till it's reasonably firm then you plug the USB end into your computer or your wall charger or clock rate car radio and when you plug it in the blue light on the on the battery will flicker on and off to show oh that it's contacting and there's a little red and green light here on the charger that will flick a green and red it first for the first half a minute when it starts charging you the light will go red and when it's fully charged the light or go green it takes about two to three hours to charge a battery but the battery will generally last about eight eight to ten hours of constant use variable yes I daresay but they lost a lot but 10 times longer than you normally cigarette the batteries on these and the cartridges last 400 puffs and they're good sized puffs to the e-liquid I also sell that I sell this is the non-negative liquid I sell that for the eighteen dollars a bottle for 30 ml bottle that comes in a poor flavors rum cherry menthol and tobacco flavor also got other kits it i sell as well so stay tuned and see me next video thanks for watching the video", "NkLZnv-n8Gg": "[Music] hey guys what's up welcome back to another episode of contingency X today we are going to show you how to install a Tiffany sugar into the remington 700 my name is travis and i'm here with a good friend of mine Tyra Hughes of Max or Academy Tyler is a retired Marine sniper and it has Mack he's the proprietor founder of max organ Academy who we do all of our long-range precision training with he's my instructor my coach and you know we had this 700 out there and he said that the trigger definitely need a little bit of work he recommended the Timoney trigger system to us and so I went out and picked one of those bad boys up and he's going to show us how to install it today tired this is your expertise now what did what do we do this is the chimney we're gonna install yep so we have the tin here this is a stock Remington trigger it's their newer model believe this is a 40 X what I don't like about it is that it's set at a four four and a half pounds of truthful and you know I could see students using this trigger and their whole wrist their hand is tightening up you know and it does affect accuracy you know if they can't control that so you got this chimney trigger here I did you know show Travis that there's a flat trigger that you can purchase and this is set from Timmy and a pound and a half so it should make you know you or Britt trigger full a lot nicer cleaner smoother it's adjustable so you can adjust creep over travel and weight so so by installing this it's gonna actually help us with our performance and our accuracy because it's a shorter or lighter trigger pull we're not going to be pushing or pulling left or right and it's going to make that you know that surprise break so they call whatever a lot more crisp absolutely perfect so what we've done here is is we already took apart the the action from the stock and remove the bolt from here these are all simple things that you guys should know how to do but what we really want to show you is how to remove the stock trigger assembly how easy it is to install the new trim need trigger setup yeah so again I'll leave this to you this is your this is your arena sir well we're uh you know we're using the most basic tools that we can find nothing special we have a mallet all right hammer any type will do and a punch so we can pop the pins out and it's really a simple operation Travis if you just need right I'm gonna give this to you all right so I'm the dummy that gets to hold it no no you're gonna hammer to you I'm gonna hold it right ah okay so our first step is we have two pins and the one closer to the action and then the one towards the rear of the action we're gonna release the pin on the back part of the action first yeah that one gets hammered away from us okay so we're gonna try this is the first time we're taking the trigger system apart so it might be a little bit yes he starts to hammer the pin in it's important to not let to not hammer the pin out and then pull your punch out we want to maintain that punch in there so it acts as the pin and then we can slowly release the back part of the trigger cuz it is under spring tension all right I'm glad he told me that otherwise I would have just instinctively pulled the whole common stuff flies everywhere and a whole different show yeah oh pretty fast alright so we'll pull this pin out right and you'll see here's our pin and then we have our safety bar spring right there you know if this is your first time taking it out make sure that you remember the direction then it goes back in or you'll spend a good you know hour looking at this video trying to figure out how you put that spring in so I'm gonna lay it down in the same condition that I'm gonna reinstall it okay alright so now we've got that we'll push down and we'll remove our pin now you could hear the spring right yeah you definitely had an audible click okay that was the Sira okay so now Naseer and it falls down in the bottom and we have a spring okay good good next part can you guys see how this this here fell here perfect okay now we're gonna do the back pin so at the back pin does it go towards me then yep okay now I'm gonna do the same thing where I'm gonna leave the punch inserted or do I want to pull the punch out this it's no longer in our spring tension so the only thing we need to do is remove our bolt catch bar okay same thing I'm gonna lay it down said I remember the direction that goes back in you can see our trigger so it's completely loose already yeah so now we're just totally removing the the last pin just to pull it off exactly now this pin comes towards me comes toward you okay let's get this bad boy lined up a little bit better alignment here there we go okay so I just like to punch in again just pull the pin yeah you see this ear drop completely out so this is your sear right here right yep put that there trigger done all right so this is your stock Remington trigger you can see it right there the safety your curved trigger completely stock from Remington this actual trigger actually was recalled by Remington I did check the serial number on my rifle and I was contemplating sending it back to have the trigger worked on but instead of doing that you know under Tyler's advisement I just I'm just gonna go ahead and put a whole new Tim knee into it all right so here's our trigger all right now we do need to keep the bolt retention bar and the bolt retention spring spring okay so my just gonna basically do this in reverse order I'm just gonna slide this in here I need to put any kind of Lube or grease or anything on this right now nope no this is no grease what happens is if guys put lube and grease on their trigger thinking that it's gonna make it operate more smoothly right it attracts dust and then you get dirt in there and one of the biggest problems with Remington actions like this that have the bolt release bar underneath right is that you get dirt in there and it starts to stick and if this button gets stuck in the down position well that means that your bolt will slide right out will slide right out so you'll be shooting and slap yourself right in the face and that could be pretty funny funny for everybody around you but you yeah yep alright so we'll take our short pin and the beveled side faces us and then we just tap it in all right so let's show let's show them this real quick so they understand there we go okay so if you get it closed up we'll still do a diagram with this as well but one side of this pin is beveled so it's a lot a lot more tapered off than the opposite side and we want to put the beveled side towards us just the way that we uninstall the old trigger we want to reinstall the same way okay perfect so I'll hold that there just to kind of lined it up here we just find that sweet spot go ahead Travis start okay so he is a just a simple start to time squeeze the knowledge tap it in a little needs a little larger punch just slide it in there okay I'm hitting this like a lady last thing I want to do is slip hitch you lay it down there you're an action if you probably sleep a little bit better put that there that's probably a better view for you guys anyways right so again we're using the most simple tools that you can by all these expensive armorer tools now no you see the bevel here right yes the bevel is to make sure that you have a smooth radius on this side it's flat okay because of our safety bar now do I want to push this out further since it's not flush here or is that okay you can push it farther to ensure that you got good contact but just ensure that it's not sticking into the into the groove here into the channel there okay yeah good pretty solid all right so when installing the bevel bar right now that this should this be polisher this doesn't matter either no I see there's where spots on it you can wipe it off so that we start with a clean a clean piece okay please peace but with your bolts top bar here this is the part that stops the bolt so it needs to go down okay you can see that groove there Travis yeah I can see that that is where our string hooks on to you okay all right so we'll slide this in there like so damn simple yeah yeah easy okay now what we're gonna do is this is where we get that see here this is a hard yeah this part looks pretty tricky so this spring needs to be pushed in here right okay so there's like that so if I can show you this empty space that's where we're gonna put the circular part of the spring now this part right here this curved piece that kind of jets out to the right at a forty-five it's actually gonna hook on to the action itself and it can give you that spring tension so we drop it in here like so okay just like that all right right and now I'm gonna hold it down while you get the pins started so I'm gonna push the pin through correct the other side again the larger pin also has a bevel on it if you guys can catch that I'll show you in the diagram so we're gonna put the bevel facing outwards no right isn't it opposite no mr. bevel is good to go in this time yeah both bevels face us both bevels pieces okay so yeah what I asked okay so I'm gonna strike this by hand there we go there we go now we gotta pull it out so that there's no protrusion in this trigger channel here right and now we're started alright now before we get too in-depth here let's make sure it works and it does okay yeah so we're testing this right now to make sure that the bolt release functions properly correct and we're gonna be able to improve it yeah how do we put it off together you know you're gonna save yourself time and headache if it doesn't function then you got to knock that pin back out gotcha so it does work see it's it is a little sticky and you know if you're doing this install by yourself at home take brush and just brush that channel out so that it does function smoothly but don't use any type of oil that's gonna attract dirt okay so yeah yeah that's very important because I'm not a gunsmith and you know I do everything on my own I would have naturally thought okay it's a little bit sticky let's add a little bit of Lube to it doesn't it up and make it a smoother mm-hmm but you're seeing it's the exact opposite because otherwise what we'll end up doing is just building up more debris more gunk in there making it harder to work exactly okay awesome alright so we'll do the same thing excuse me you guys and the part that you want to try and avoid here is as we roll the action back even though it's sitting on this right now there's a contact point between the safety lever and the table great alright and we could end up bending bending the safety yep which is no bueno so we can roll it this way but it shouldn't be very hard to just just tapped in top it a little bit almost on my side so looking good is that okay or does it need to be more flesh than that sometimes you can get away with it but depending on if you have a precision rifle that's been bedded right you know depending on how it was vetted by your gun semester by you it might not fit now okay so we want to make this as flush as possible yeah all right let's get a couple more whacks and see if I can do this here yeah yeah there we go okay so now it's install all right right and there's tools that you can they sell tools where the actual leg right in there and you'll have holes for where the pins go I mean but this is your basic down-and-dirty what do I have in my garage or in my truck that I can do this insult with and you see we we used a punch a hammer punch and I mean technically we didn't even have to have two punches but it was nice to have full sizes definitely need the smaller one to remove it this is at three thirty-seconds punch and then we use the larger punch here which is the 1/8 punch just to reinstall it yeah so the last part is you know we obviously want to make sure that everything functions the way that it should all right our ball our bolt release is working so let's put the bolt back in now of course you can do this locks in the gun you can put the gun back together tighten the action screws down right but if there's a problem there's a ticket all part of got to take it all apart all right so pull back on the bolt let's make sure the bolt catch works there we go all right now it locks slide it forward and push the handle down so [ __ ] the rifle all right now we have fire and safe so Travis go ahead and pull the trigger while it's on safe does it fire negative no all right and we still have our firing pin in the rear here it's still in the cocked position so now put it on fire and damn that was light yeah one half pounds right yeah so lift the bolt now push it back down okay we can see that we still had a firing pin in the [ __ ] position if this piece right here this back piece you can see when you pull the trigger it slides forward when you slide the bolt forward and then down and this piece slides forward that would be a slam fire if I had a round inside right so that's what we're looking to avoid and make sure that our trigger functions and it happens with triggers that are really liked God's right but this being attending its set from the factory I trust it I use it and that's why I recommended it to you all right so we tried it twice it fires again safety works and I'm happy I'm happy all right now let's say for instance we were happy with the install but we wanted to make it lighter or heavier or any of the adjustments do we have to do that while the rifle is taken apart or can it be done while everything is put together you can't do the trigger adjustments while the rifle is in the chassis okay it has to be in this configuration because you can see you have the screws here okay so let's show the audience here these two screws these two screws right here okay all right these screws we have creep over travel adjustments all right and then we also have weight you can see this one is marked all right it's glued in place right so that you know it came from the factory at that setting a lot of guys will adjust their triggers and then Loctite them down so they stay where they're at right all right so three positions to adjust but you pay for you know what you get no absolutely but for us I mean we're not competition shooting right now this is our training rifle this is already tenfold better than a stock trigger so it's best just to leave it in the configuration that it came in that's why we bought it at the one in half pound trigger pull absolutely you know if we wanted three pounds we could have ordered three pounds but if you do end up buying a trigger where you need to adjust it maybe you bought it use or something like that you know the best place to go is you know look online look at what these screws do what what over-travel means what creep means you know and then obviously the weight and then make those adjustments based upon your specific needs yep and then make sure you're always testing the trigger pull on a dry rifle to make sure that we're not getting those those slam fire you know miss out mishaps right okay exactly yeah we definitely don't want any malfunctions when working with any any kind of firearm service safety is always first awesome so from here we're ready to drop it right back into the chassis right or is there anyone else that we need to do at this point no we're done now is there anything that we should clean or do while it's out now you're pretty good I mean it's your rifle if you want to knock some dust off of there but it's pretty clean up so you're wearing it now before we started we try to take good care of our stuff Britney's Britney's pretty particular about it so yeah you know just the last piece that pin the first pin that travis installed again we want to make sure that that pin is pushed far enough in so that our bolt release bar doesn't keep getting hung up on it it doesn't get caught in right awesome well let's put it back into the chassis make sure that you know everything works properly this is uh this is Brittany's chassis this is the J Allen they're the jaeyi 700 rifle chassis - she loves I love and this is one of the improvements that Tyler you know the Timmy Turner had recommended for us to do to her rifle so that's yeah let's set her back down and see what we can do all right so all we'll do is we'll drop it in make sure we got a good fit and when you're putting the action back in the stock it's important that you notice whether or not you have anything preventing the action from sitting in its original position okay you know like I talked about you know does this pin need to be all the way in you know does it matter if there's anything protruding it's gonna depend on your stock how it was bedded and the way that is formed so if we slide this down and we see like oh we got this gap that wasn't there before we need to go back what's different what did we do exactly but it looks like we're sitting in there pretty nice and snug so let's right over all right and we have these two action screws here from the factory you know on our marine corps sniper rifles store-bought rifles these are tightened down to 55 inch pounds okay a lot of people over time you'll start to see your stock you know start to crush a little bit you might need more so just for our peace of mind we're gonna do 60 inch pounds for ours okay all right and all it is is two screws here or one screw here and one screw there and we'll just tighten them both down evenly and tight and with this guy here now there's not a particular order you know that I go by in terms of which one do you tighten down first right all I try to do is make sure that the action is sitting in the stock evenly you know it's flush it's not leaning one direction or the other so I'm not you know cross threading right the action so it's evenly distributed but I want to make sure that I you know tighten them both down hand tight so that the actions in there and then we can tighten them down using a torque wrench perfect so we've tightened down both of our screws hand tighten right right the last step is we take our allen key three sixteenths for your specific screw some some rifles use a Torx right and this guy or a torque wrench right so loosen this up and we'll get it set to sixty inch pounds all right now you need to be able to math Travis to use a torque wrench you see how it says that's what I use here oh yes and then a ten yes so 50 plus 10 is 60 60 so we are 460 inch pounds on here all right and then we would just use your torque wrench with a bit all right and all we would do is one at a time it doesn't matter you can torque this one or you can torque that one so we would torque this guy here it's a 60 inch path that we do it slow and methodical so that one we're not over twerking it whereas the wrench is still going to apply torque even after it clicks you have to be able to pay attention to that click alright so we torque here and then we torque this guy what we're gonna do is we're gonna come back to this one and make sure that we're still getting a click when we start to apply the pressure so it's kind of like a tire you want to start on opposite corners and apply a pressure even as evenly as possible exactly but as you apply more pressure here you could be sitting or making more pressure on the side right so go back and double-check your work exactly all right once we have it written dinner once we have it to sixty inch pounds you know if you keep a data book or anything like that which you should keep an accurate log of you know how many rounds the rifle has when you install the trigger how many rounds that the rifle has you know you know just keeping accurate log and also you know what did you tighten it down to you know maybe two years from now and you have to take it apart again to do something else maybe at that point you're gonna go to sixty two inch pounds yeah I mean it's always just like a vehicle it's always good out of a service record of what you're doing to your rifle absolutely perfect awesome thank you now we need to go shoot net absolutely actually you have a couple of classes coming up yeah you know you run a class about once a month right once a month and every other month you know we'll do a basic course an introductory course the long-range precision or we'll do an advanced course you know I'm kind of even things out you've been to my course yeah I mean Brittany and I took your course recently and it was it was awesome we were able to shoot out you know Brittany hit twelve hundred yards on her first shot with this rifle she was shooting a six five cream or a little bit different style rifle but she was hitting a thousand yards with her 308 which this rifle and I mean we just we had a blast but there was a whole lot more math than I ever anticipated yeah shooting long range and once you meet that math figure that you know it's simple right it is once you understand the math and it feels like you know what I'm doing is easy now absolutely it's just getting past that now that we have our new Timoney trigger installed we have a one and a half pound trigger pulled out yeah why don't you give it a try before we get out of here just to see how that baby feels all right it's off state awesome obviously shooting in a safe line we have nothing in here no magazine so you guys know it's safe out there that's awesome nice and crisp nice and very nice and crisp yeah I mean it's it's scary how light that is in comparison to the sock so that's that's awesome I can definitely see how it's going to help improve accuracy and confidence absolutely you know while you're doing that I'm sitting here analyzing you like what have you put in this finger at I was about to yell at him on TV but very nice that is awesome I really appreciate your time and help and getting our art sugar installed as we continue to move forward and build I mean we're talking about building a complete custom rifle and we'll have to do that on video for able to but as we continue to work on more and more of these projects together Tyler's definitely gonna be back here to help us with all of our long-range precision rifles and accuracy and the whole nine yards and stay tuned because we're going to be doing some video of his classes at the MOA Academy here in California and showing you some of what he does behind the scenes so that you guys can get idea of what it is to take one of his classes you can check Tyler and his Academy out at max augment calm always check us out at contingency XCOM he's on Facebook he's on Instagram all the time as we are the links are gonna be down below make sure you subscribe like share and show us all the love until next time be safe have a great time we'll see you then Thanks [Music]", "oaqhcQ1kG_U": "hi it's Craig here tonight I want to talk about kerosene heaters I asked myself a question a few years ago when there was a power failure in southern Ontario and in parts of New York and I forget where else but it was a really huge power failure happened in 2003 and we had no power for about some of us would probably about 24 hours we had no electricity now luckily it was in the middle of summer and you know our big complaint was you know our food might spoil and maybe we don't have our air-conditioning going so we were all really hot but this time of year I know a lot of us are really dealing with a hard winter this year a lot of snow and very very cold temperatures it was minus 27 Celsius here yesterday and I felt very comfortable knowing that if something was to happen to my furnace overnight or if there was a power failure for any kind of reason that I had this thing stored away ready to go filled with kerosene and I had no worries as far as heat goes it's my opinion that you should always be prepared for any kind of an emergency we have smoke detectors in our homes we have house insurance we have car insurance we have insurance all over the place but what do you have in place in case something goes wrong with the electricity your gas your furnace in this time of year you really can't afford not to have a source of heat it's freezing outside the car doors were frozen yesterday I had to pry them open so kerosene heaters are fantastic sources of heat they're very very efficient well kerosene is a clear fluid okay it smells kind of like paint thinner it's very safe actually and it's very very stable in other words this kerosene will last for years and years now I know there are people that will tell you the you should change your kerosene every year in your heater but I've heard other people say that they've had the same kerosene in their heater for 10 years and have never changed it and it still lights up now one guy on YouTube he had one of these things sit in the basement for 10 years and had kerosene in it and he never touched it ten years later he brought it out and he fired it up and it went right away no problems no worries if you store it properly now this is the container the kerosene came in there are different regulations and things in different countries where how you should store this but then Canada this is how it comes and kerosene it's k1k kerosene that's the grade that's what you need to be using for these heaters it's also called paraffin in some countries as well ok if stored properly out of the sunlight in a dark place they recommend ventilation although I didn't use ventilation when I stored this I can't smell anything coming out of the container gasoline on the other hand is highly flammable and it's not stable it will go off after a few months even and it may not work so the first thought I had was well maybe I'll buy a generator and that way if we lose power I can power a 1500 watt baseboard heater well the generator has to be outside for one thing to operate because it puts out carbon monoxide and the gasoline that powers a generator won't sit around for very long so that was out of the question for me that's why I chose the kerosene solution for heat you know you always think what will never happen but in 2003 it happened and luckily it wasn't wintertime so anything can happen and you know the Sun is actually going through a lot of activity right now increasing solar activity that could affect our power grid that could affect our infrastructure in the next few years you really need to have some emergency measures in place now this is not a very hard thing to operate I'm just going to show you the different parts as you can see it's kind of surrounded in the cage this is a very common type of kerosene heater there's different manufacturers that produce the same design okay it has a handle so you can move it around if you need to although it's fairly heavy this is your I guess your gas cap if you want this is where you put your your kerosene and it's chained on so you can't lose it and usually they come with this one came with like a little siphoning just get that back on there a little siphoning pump that you put into the kerosene you put into here and you just squeeze a bulb and it pumps kerosene into the tank here so there's no problem about spilling anything this knob here adjusts your wick now inside the kerosene heater there is a a wick and it's a cylindrical wick the wick is shaped like a cylinder it's made of a cloth material and it dips down into the into the gas chamber of the unit and it soaks up the kerosene until the kerosene completely soaks into the wick and then when you light the heater the kerosene evaporates and that's what causes the flame and this is how you adjust the height of your wick this is the emergency shutoff this is how you turn the unit off this is the fuel indicator showing you how much fuel you've got left and this is your igniting switch you can ignite these you can ignite them with a match but this one actually has a little battery pack at the back you put two C batteries in there and this will actually light electronically if the batteries happen to wear out then you can light it manually with a match inside of here you can see that there's a little spring that you can lift up the burner so the first thing you want to do is read all your instructions put it all together properly make sure it's all secured and properly assembled and then you fill it up with your kerosene and then you light it and lighting it is extremely simple just open your little hatch here so you see what's going on and you're gonna turn up your wick all the way up to the top as far as it'll go then you're going to press your igniter the igniting paddle is going to lift the burner up so that you're going to be able to see this thing when it's lit you're gonna be able to see when it's lit and you can let go of the pedal so here we go I'm gonna give it a light there's the igniter and there it goes as soon as it's now lit up you can close down the lid move it back and forth a few times to make sure it's seated properly and close it up okay now the first thing that's gonna happen I'm gonna grab my camera here so I can show you this you see it's not quite fully lit yet okay the flame is still coming up approaching the top of that that little dish there okay now for the first 10 minutes you need to keep an eye on this thing because the flame is going to change height it's going to get higher and higher and higher you don't want it to burn too low and you don't want it to burn too high if it burns too low you're going to create a black soot and if it burns too high you're gonna create possibly carbon monoxide harmful gases and it's going to smell again you need to keep a carbon monoxide detector in your home just in case and it's important that you adjust the wick accordingly so as the flame gets bigger you're going to want to adjust the knob to adjust the height of the wick it's recommended that the flame be about a half an inch above the top of the burner now right now it's getting a little bit more than that so I'm going to turn down my wick adjustment until the flame gets to be about a half an inch there's parts that are higher than others in general you just want to average it out and burn it so that on average it's about a half an inch flame and that's about what I've got there okay so that's what the flame pretty much should look like and the instructions will will show you exactly how to keep it at that height during the course of the next 10 minutes it's going to get higher and higher and that means I'm going to have to use my whip control to adjust it lower and lower until it reaches a stable a stable height as the unit heats up it's gonna burn hotter and the flames gonna change but that eventually will stable out and then you can leave it burn and it will heat your whole house last week when I brought this out to test it I bring it out every year and test it make sure it still all works and clean it out and things I turned off my home heating system my furnace and I lit this thing up in the kitchen and it took the temperature from 72 Fahrenheit to 80 Fahrenheit in just half an hour the whole main floor of the house the only thing about them is that you can't really adjust the temperature like you can't turn it up or turn it down you have to burn it at the appropriate height to get the most efficiency out of I'm just gonna check here my flames getting a little high I'm just gonna turn it down a bit that's perfect and that's exactly what it should look like okay so if it gets too warm in the house or in the room that you're burning this in then you just turn it off okay and then later on you can turn it back on again when you shut them down they do produce a little bit of a kerosene odor but not too badly well they're burning they burn very very cleanly very cleanly there's absolutely no odor at all coming off this thing other than the fact that my shirts getting hot and I can smells like I'm ironing so yeah it's real toasty warm here beside this thing in fact I'm gonna have to move away from it cuz it's quite hot you burn your face if you keep your face there the heat coming off the top of this thing is enough to boil a pot of water you could easily heat up a can of beans on here boil water for tea make broth cook I'm sure you could fry eggs on this thing if you put a pot on top of there easily cook on top of it so if you did lose power you could do more than just stay warm you could actually you know cook yourself a simple meal as well so it's a fantastic device like I said there are different manufacturers this is the most popular model under different manufacturers names a lot of people use this in their cottages or their RVs or their you know their when they go camping or in the home when you run out of power or something that happens and you don't have any heat this is a perfect thing to have around so it's keeping me nice and warm right now okay I just want to show you how I've got my flame set here okay so it's settled out now and I really don't have to pool with this very much anymore but I just want to show you I think that's probably a little bit too low what when it's like that you need to have it half an inch so a boat like that you certainly don't want it like this that's way too high and you're going to create fumes and carbon monoxide and all that kind of thing so keep it down and well that's how it should look just like that now it's been about 10 minutes and you can see that my flame has reached a nice comfortable level I've been sort of tweaking it every once in a while turning it down as it goes and now it's reached a point where it's no longer requiring adjustment it's gonna burn like this for hours and you just need to check it every once in while you don't want to leave this thing unattended of course but you just want to look in every once in a while just to make sure that it's burning the way it should and if it's not give it a little adjustment now this will burn I'm told according to the instructions will burn for about ten hours on one full tank of kerosene this bottle contains enough kerosene to fill it about one and a half times so let's bottle of kerosene is going to give you about 15 hours of constant burning time I highly recommend you guys look into this you if you live in a cool or a cold climate or it gets really really cold certain times a year and there's a risk of you losing power or something happening to your household heating system it really is comforting to know that you've got something in the home stored away somewhere that you can easily get out light it up and you've got an alternative source of heat it goes true with food water first aid candles flashlights batteries a battery-powered radio all these kinds of things you should always have put away somewhere in case something happens and you need them and I think this is one of the most important things I wasn't food that you should have to make sure that you don't die of freezing to death so I guess the last thing I want to show you how to do is turn the thing off and that's really easy you just want to grab on to your wick adjustment like this and sort of hold on to it and at the same time you want to push down on your release valve and just slowly let it turn it's spring-loaded slowly let it turn all the way down and it will extinguish itself it's actually still burning just a little bit in there but it will extinguish itself within a couple of minutes there will be some odor when it when it goes out because you're you're getting the vapor from the kerosene but it's not that bad and it's certainly not going to harm anybody so that's it for kerosene heaters there's different types there's big ones and small ones and and different types but this particular type is popular and in case you are wondering how to light this thing and maintain the wick and the flame hopefully this video gave you some information if you have any questions pop comment down there and I'll do my best to answer any questions you have thanks for watching hope this was help see you guys soon take care [Music]", "3SvSbruPamo": "I want to share a book with you about my second grade teacher read to me a long time ago when I was in second grade how many of you have ever heard of the Jolly postman this is one of my favorite stories of all time and I am so excited to share it with you so before we read it though I want to know what's a postman where does it pose men do very good what else does he do besides Nathan leaves mail to people so what's mail then boys and girls where's mail Mikayla something that other people will not give to you yes something that people want to give to you and then how does it how does mail work how does it work Darius yeah so you send mail to other people or you receive it right okay all right so what are some things that you guys have gotten into mail have any of you guys gotten things in the mail Lucianne um every time past my birthday July 4th um on July 5th um this this small um they keep on sending me a letter that says they have a gift that for me every sign and every time when I get the gift bag the same thing is inside it but it's up its up there's different colors of that okay very good to you that's something from the mall used to you very good how many of you have parents that are addicted to Amazon Amazon mrs. Lambert is very addicted to Amazon all right boys and girls so I wanted to show you something that I get in the mail I've gotten a catalog Oh from Ikea and you'll notice boys and girls that on the mail that you get you have an address what's an address what's my dress why do we need an address on mail yes we D yeah so you know where to put the mail and then I've also gotten you can also get bills in the mail that's when people say you need to pay this money so this is from the school that I'm going to to become a teacher so this is my bill from the University and as you can see my name is on there okay or you can get an advertisement what's an advertisement yeah so it's something that you can buy buy very good so this one we got in the mail at home and it's for Grocery Outlet so if you want to get some kinds of groceries this is what you can get okay all right so all right and then I wanted to ask you boys and girls what is jolly me what does that mean it's jolly happy very good um are there any other words that we can use for jolly besides hoppy know what cheerful very good who can who else can you think of who's jolly when you hear the word jolly who do you think of I have one person coming to my mind when I hear the word jolly Roman Santa very good I thought of Santa - all right so what I want you to do boys and girls and I know that not everyone will be able to see but I want you to look at the cover of this book okay where do you think the postman is going to be giving mail where do you think he's going to be giving to her whom do you think he's going to be giving bail - rusty frosty okay Nathan where do you think he's gonna be getting mail to a spider in a cat oh maybe you see a spider in a cat on there let's let me start reading let's find out okay so

can put the address and the postage stamp right on the paper and you can just stick it in the mail and the post we'll deliver it for you all right so let's continue skip to page so the giant read the postcard with baby on his knee and the postman wet his whistle with a thimble full of teeth see how much smaller he is and the Giant and the giant baby once more on his bicycle the postman rode to a beautiful palace so we've been told where a nightingale sang and a sign said sold with the letter for Cinderella there's a surprise so boys and girls I want you to look up the symbol up again we have the person who they're sending it to and one other thing that a letter always has an envelope a stamp so you have to purchase a stamp you have to pay for a stamp in order to get it sent in the mail

again and again oops alright so I want you to take a look at the picture at the top and I'll try and get everyone to see it who do you think he's going to next the big bad wolf later on the postman feeling hot came upon a grandma in a shady spot but grandma what big teeth you got besides this is a letter for Oh dear mr. wolf we are writing to you on behalf of our client miss Red Riding Hood concerning her grandma miss hood tells us that you are presently occupying her grandma's cottage and wearing her grandma's clothes without this lady's permission understand that if this harassment

firmly resolved to sue for damages your offer of shares in a turnip or apple picking business is declined and all this huffing and puffing will get you nowhere you're sincerely Harold meaning from

like a police officer but so lawyer Tereus yes so they're in a court of law they help they help settle things that maybe someone does that was against the law so what did the big bad wolf do what it

thing that he did that the lawyers are talking about what other bad things did he do yesin so not just the pig so who was the other character that can say bad things to Avelina yeah he did and he did it without permission so he is in big trouble with the law and the lawyers are telling him that all right so grandma read the letter and pour the tea which the not-so-jolly postman drank nervously what does nervously mean boys and girls which is nervously tamari now you're kind of shaking what feeling do you have if you're nervous you're scared yeah are you I would be afraid with it wolf eat you yeah I might be scared of that all right now the Jolly postman nearly done so is the story came to a house where a party had begun on the step was a bear with a bun but the letter was for didn't

bicycle so they say a jolly postman came one day from over the hills and far away and went home in the evening 49 Oh what why didn't he drink tea at the witch's house at Elena yeah what color was it everyone [Music]", "Iu_RwFwgIJ0": "hey guys Dustin here from my freedom smokes calm do a quick video today on probably one of the most popular products that we sell here at my freedom smokes that is the ego with ce4 650 mah blister pack starter kit and it's easy to see why this is so popular basically you know it's a blister pack so it's in a retail package we have actually have a lot of wholesale customers that buy this from us and resell it in their stores so it's because it's got a really nice packaging to it it does come with one 650 ml battery you have a CF or clearomizer and a USB charger so it has everything that you need to get rolling in terms of vaping right away and it's relatively cheap we sell it at 14.95 for the booster pack starter kit at my freedom smokes calm you can find it in the electronic cigarette starter kits category there and that makes it a really great deal because these batteries alone I mean these these are actually variable voltage batteries but a similar 650 mah battery just by itself is normally you know 1595 just that piece so then you're you're basically buying a battery getting the clearomizer and a charger for free whenever you get this little kit so and it works really really well it is not a name-brand it is kind of a store brand that we sale it's not Joyetech it's not smoke tech it's not vision anything like that it's just a generic brand but we've gotten absolutely outstanding reviews about it it works really well the batteries are holding up for extended periods of time the Chargers are doing great the c4s are even doing great so really good starter kit I'm going to kind of go through some of the features of it here real quick kind of show you how to use it how to fill it up and what you need to know to get rolling so if you take a look here just took it out of the package it is just your standard 650 mah battery but the clearomizer on it and unscrew the clearomizer own screws right off the end there and you see right now it's off 1 2 3 4 5 out of 6 times and that's the 5 click function to turn it on so now you see it's on and is actually lighting up red might look a little orange on the camera there but it's actually lighting up red which is the highest voltage setting like I said this is a variable voltage battery to cycle through the voltage settings really simple 1 2 3 and it goes to the next setting green is actually the lowest setting so it goes from red which is the highest down to green and now you start from the lowest setting I think is 3.2 volts then 1 to 3 changes to blue that's the mid setting middle setting that's 3 point 6 volts and then 1 2 3 and we're back at red which is I think it's 3.8 folds you have to check the the product description on that one let's take it back down to green since we're just getting started with it here and then here's the charger you know just a simple basic short wire charger plug it into any USB outlet or get an adapter you get a wall adapter with a USB outlet on it if you want to plug it into the wall to charge it it just simply screws right on the end here it's not plugged in right now but normally that would blink or light up this will turn its normally green it'll turn red when you put the battery on it whenever it turns green again then that means it's fully charged and you can take it off but it's that's the charger fairly simple fairly easy to use now the the clearomizer this bench that we got actually came with flat tips a lot of people out there prefer the flat tip some prefer the round this batch came with flat tips we do sell round onde tips for the c4 clearomizers if you prefer a round tip you do have to purchase that separately from if you get one from this batch now a lot of times whenever we get new batches they may come in with round tips our flat tip we don't usually specify because we have a ton of customers that like each one so either way they they send it to us we're okay with it and we do have the replacements for those so just your general c4 clearomizer here you can see the the gauge on the side there goes up to one point six milliliters it's got a long wick in it actually several long wicks that's like four of them in there the hang down and just soak up that juice and bring it up to the heating coil right there in the center go ahead and take this mouthpiece off just unscrews from the top just like so so you can set the mouthpiece down and then if you take a look inside it's a nice open I've been setting with the tube right there in the center whenever you fill this up you want to try to keep the juice from getting in that tube that tube is actually the airflow pathway so any juice that gets into that center tube is actually just going to run straight through out the bottom or if you're unlucky enough if you will suck it straight into your mouth which if you've done that before you know it tastes horrible so just be careful whenever you're filling it up not to get any juice in that tube the best way to do it have seduced right here I'm going to fill this one up best way to do it fill up with some ry4 juice here just kind of lean it to the side here and then just drip the the liquid in and it will cascade right down the side of that chamber and fill it up try to go too fast here and some in there keep going and you really want to fill it up right to where those wicks come out of that center post if you go much above that and I went a little above it if you go too far above that it'll actually cause it to flood the clearomizer a little bit so you want to want to stick with filling it up right to where those wicks come out of that center post it'll be okay for this lunch of them just just testing it out here and then just screw the mouthpiece back on and that's it you're done it's full it's ready to use so now let's screw it back on the battery and we're ready to give it a vape all right let's let's try it out here after you see that I mean it got got a good bit of vapor out of it let's turn it up to this middle setting and give it another try Wow yeah that put out a ton of vapor uh yeah and then scope this high setting it might be a little too high but let's try it anyway whoo yeah that's that's a ton of vapor yes I mean you can see this is a really an outstanding performer for the money I mean it can't be beat and you're talking if you were to buy all of these pieces separately you're looking at you know 15 bucks for for the battery alone plus another four dollars for the clearomizer and about four and a half dollars for the for the charger so you're saving a lot of money by by getting this separately you're saving about eight and a half bucks there so or about getting this all in this blister pack starter kit so then an outstanding deal and it's just we call it the blister pack starter kit I think the actual product name is ego with ce4 650 mah blister pack starter kit it's it I believe it's the last product in the electronic cigarette starter kits section of our site so go there check it out this WWF freedom smokes calm and hope you guys have a great day", "VjAJAjHtBR4": "it's Elgin and getting ready for a for a video shoot for a blog but I wanted to reach out real quick just a couple quick minutes and give you three tips three keys to get in your property sold if you're thinking about selling your home right now now these are kind of seemed like three easy possibly silly maybe even stupid tips and after you're going to go wow but if you really think about it when you put your house on the market these are three things that are going to help now the first one is to price the property correctly and I know you say wow well of course you're going to price it correctly no listen trust me I've been doing this 29 years when i say price it correctly the first thing that most people think is all you want me to give my house away no I do not want you to give your house away but what I want you to do is I want you to price it to Rachel Getting buyer not either just looky-loos or not just have your house on the market because you have to remember a lot of people shop online now there's a lot of competition out there and all of the market is a fantastic market people don't want to waste their time they're not want to waste your time you know we're in a microwave society so give you an example let's suppose that your home is probably worth five hundred thousand dollars according to comms should you price it at 5 10 and be prepared to negotiate well in most cases that's not a smart strategy in my opinion in my opinion what you want to do is you want to price the property at a discount then when I say a discount I don't mean 450 but if you're 500 and it's a great deal and there are more buyers and sellers what happens if you price their property of 489 yes you're going to create a multiple frenzy for yourself and realistically there's a good chance if your properties to properly shape you may get that 510 or you'll get a very good price for it and be able to dictate the terms dictate the type of loan finance and you'll accept dictate when you get to move out proper dictate what our reports and things like that you as a seller will provide when you do a termite is it as is you can have some options at that particular point so that's one number to clean the house yeah I mean clean the house I don't mean just put up the dishes I mean let's face it you're trying to sell the product right and your marketing with some other homes why not have either a professional cleaning or yourself go in and man do a really deep cleaning deep plenty min and clean the blinds clean the window seals mopping the floors vacuumed please make sure the bathrooms are clean the toilets the shower the Grouch that kind of stuff the appliances in the kitchen you don't want grease dripping down you'd be surprised some stuff that you see and people are asking for maximum dollar you want your property from a standpoint of cleanliness not everybody knows that it's lived in and you're not going to be that all the time but you know you want people to walk in and have a nice fresh clean smell and mr. clean type smell to it you want to be able to walk in and not focus on that kind of stuff you want them to be able to focus on whether or not they can see themselves their family living in your property last one I'm going to talk about real quick today is accessibility now what do I mean by that I mean look if you want to sell your home you want to sell your home that means people have to be able to see it give an example see this stuff all the time you'll see stuff where it'll say property is available between 10am and 1 p.m. monday wednesday and thursday 5pm to 6 15 p.m. the rest of the week no weekend showing that we need 24 hours to 48 hour notice in advance like what really I look at it be realistic if you know your other realtors are showing property to their clients who's doing that who's going to go out of their way to do that you become last on the list your home shown because the buyers don't like any other homes the buyers as well in most cases they want to see everything else and then if there's just nothing else they won they have to they'll come and look at your property do you really want to sell like that I want you to flip the script when you're selling your home look at your home as if you were going to purchase it again or look at your home compared to something else in life you may want to buy something else that you do make sure that you market your home that way all right a couple of really quick tips I told her they were simple some of them silly maybe a little after to it but important and remember no matter what you're going through in life things change and it truly is it's a great life have a fantastic day thanks for listening", "S2aDjRWUr5I": "hi guys today I'm going to be reviewing different atomizers for vaporizer pens these are all 510 threaded atomizers that we sell on the vape sooo calm on this side over here these four are for dry flowers or herbs and these five over here are for wax oils or extracts all so I'll start off with the atomizers for flowers this is the atomizer for the XIII vaporizer pen and you can actually use this one for wax or oils the coil in there right now is the dry flower coil but you can change the coil out for a different coil that will also burn wax this is the Z for atomizer which is like the Big Brother to the Z three differences you can see it has it's way bigger has a way bigger heating chamber and the same with this one this one comes with a wax and dry flower atomizer and with the Z 4 and the Z 3 atomizers you can push the mouth tip down so that you can get a fresh clean hit it will mix it up also helps when you're vaping dry flowers to push them out the bottom you can so you want to like use a tool or anything which is really nice also help save the life of the atomizer here is our eco skillet atomizer for dry herbs is a large pancake style heating coil also has a like the pinched in mouth tip so it helps not to get any like Asscher like leftover vape stuff in your mouth which is also really nice here's another atomizer this one is for dry flowers also has a large pancaked heating coil has a really large ceramic heating chamber in it so you can fill it up with like half a gram of dry flowers and the spring helps push it down on to the onto the coil I just want to make sure you don't load too much in at a time the rubber mouth tip right here you could take it out for cleaning and whatnot also has this little ceramic filter so you don't get anything in your mouth when you're vaping this is our g5 atomizer now on this side are the atomizers for wax and oils we'll start off with the space vape this one comes with a dual coil inside when most of the utmost vaporizers only have you can see they only have one coil so if you want the largest possible vaporizer hits this is our prior best wax atomizer for for vaping it proves his giant clouds of vapor and it comes with an extra replacement coil too right here are two different types of glass globe analyzers so you can see this one is all metal it's just a little nicer having a metal mouth tip no plastic or anything on it the coil is also metal this one is really the same thing it just has a ceramic oil and instead of the metal mouth tip it has a plastic one but you know the mouth tips they never experience any heat so it's a big deal they both have Pyrex glass tubes right there so you never have to worry about the melting or getting too hot or anything pirates glasses the healthiest for you and that's what like measuring cups and glass pipes and all that kind of stuff is made out of it's food grade glass and it's very heat resistant here the next one is also for wax and oil this is the VAP C wax skillet this one has the metal tip as well as a logo on it and just screw it on the battery to use the mouth tip comes off easy cleaning and here is another very similar atomizer this is the Eco back skillet the only difference really is that it does not have the metal mouth tip tool and it's a little shorter it's the same type of coil for burning wax oils extracts and all all these advisors they come in different colors pretty much any color you can imagine they'll come in and most atomizers will either burn either wax or herbs like this this is only going to burn herbs the vape suit g5 atomizer like the globe pens they're only going to burn wax and there there are a few atomizers like the z4 and the z3 that you can replace the coils with and burn wax or oil so it's nice to have one of these if you like to vape dry flowers and wax as

questions for the best atomizers on the net in definitely by far the healthiest we don't use any cheap metals plastics we don't use any sketchy materials in our pens like some competitors we only sell

of atomizers for flowers and wax please remember to subscribe like and stay tuned for our next video take care", "gKaiYbZLryg": "hello this Geo and this is an old Coleman heater it's actually 3000 to 5000 BTU Coleman heater it has an adjustable load too high setting which makes it the 3000 to 5000 and it's in pretty good season I'll show you how to light this up today so fortunately the instructions are here right on the side and it's pretty easy just apply a fuel around the rim a couple of times across you put it on the start setting here on high and you light it and let it heat up for about 15 to 25 minutes and then it should be working by then initially there will be a flame that comes from the top basically here let me open it for you and then just have a heat shield up on top which you can take off and this is kind of light and helot so this is you're going to put the Coleman fuel around the rim a couple of times across light it it will flame up for a while and then it'll kind of died down and then all the fuel in the tank will start heating up as a result of this this initial lighting and it'll kind of vaporize all the Coleman fuel in there and if Coleman fuel will kind of come to this wick part and just burn nice and hot without a flame so that's that's how it's done so let's go ahead and light her up okay so I already added the Coleman fuel here and I will just carefully put it around the rim like instructions I'm not doing so carefully but just like that couple time yeah that's probably okay so I did that and I'll go ahead and lighter be careful with that initial light and will flame up and so just slowly burn down for a few minutes and then again 15 to 25 minutes it should be already this is why you don't do it inside because you'll burn down your house or if you're in a tent don't don't light these things in a tent so we'll wait a few minutes and come back so the flame is already going down a bit we'll wait a little bit more and see how toasty you can get the fire is completely down it's starting to heat up we'll give it a few more minutes we'll go ahead and put the detective ship back on and let's just sit here for a few minutes okay so after a few more minutes I've stuck in a little meat thermometer here I'm not sure if you could tell that's already about 140 150 degrees Fahrenheit and so it's heating up nicely I could it's getting really hot to touch here and so it works pretty well and when when you're done you either want to just let it burn out its fuel or you could also take the sheet shield here and just snuff it up and wait for the whole thing to cool down now again one warning about these catalytic burners you do not want to burn these in the house not only will the flame during the initial light up cause cause a fire but the carbon monoxide emitted from these could potentially kill you in in in a confined space so please do not do this inside the house so that's that's all for now see you next time bye bye but I didn't want to leave without first showing you the glow you can see the glow already started this has been 25 minutes or so it's already starting to get dark but it does get quite hot it's getting nice and warm there you have it", "EwTZ2xpQwpA": "Chocolate Rain Some stay dry and others feel the pain.

Deborah aura apart apparently is ya betch mag next oh yeah so we got magnets here that's what separates it will see what they're all about let's open it up got a nice little slide off technology here it's the Ora wonderful okay so inside the box of the Ora we have the instruction manual first it's small looks pretty straightforward though not too much you know little breakdown of everything talks about the 5 click safety feature that a lot of them have and another point about the different atomizers that come with it it has varying levels of temperature so here's the UN itself so you can see how it comes packaged them there it comes with three separate atomizers we have the crystal quartz atomizer we have the over here the donut ceramic style atomizer and then what came attached to my aura is the dual ceramic rod chamber all connected by magnets for a pen vaporizer this design for wax no one's really reinventing the wheel at this point they're all kind of the same in this frame you know like the idea being that it has dual coils kind of standard these days or the ceramic style doughnuts as the candy pens calls it which is we've seen before for a lot of these atomizer so that's not really the unique part what's changed is the fact that with this vaporizer you don't have to deal with thready there's the battery here's the cartridge right on there here's where you're going to place your wax it's really easy for someone just simply put them right back on no more twisting nonsense it just connects very securely as far as I know and I to load it up pop it off right there since we already know how most of these pen babes work just put some wax and then see how it hits so for this one I'm gonna actually use the crystal quartz attachment I'm a big fan of what you get out of crystal quartz it's a dual one I was doing right there it's a dual style one so you get larger clouds that way I'm so used to threading on don't have to it just connects like that and inside the box here you actually get some some accessories and one eye keychain the loading tool that I'll use here and it actually comes with a wax container right inside the box which is nice because you can store your concentrates and for your viewing pleasure I actually loaded the wax right in here so I'm going to take a little bit put it into the crystal dual crystal quartz chamber and see what sort of a performance regatta this when it comes to loading your wax onto the coil you don't want to mess around with getting caught on the wire or anything like that so you're going to want to try and scrape it off up to the top or load it in a manner that doesn't get you down on that coil you damaged that thing it just just ain't going to work right you're going to just go ahead close up the container I'm gonna put it right back in the box for now because I like to put things in the box and then you can put everything away and go ahead and take the top connector and by magnets mr. white they're going to connect could hold down the button I've already unlocked it so it's going to hold down with the hottest temperature there are three temperatures that you can vary through by clicking the button three times by doing that you can switch through temperatures are inside the manual look it up and find them there all right i'ma hold dance you can get to get with the pendant uses wax or any vaporizer that use concentrates instead of herb you're probably going to get a solid hit pretty much every time yeah thought it out no question so it hits really well we're just something I already expected I have a candy pens galaxy at home sure we all do at this point and I know that it works really well because they're the exact same sort of atomizers so I'm confident in the performance you're going to get from it if we're going to talk about the cons what I don't like about it one of the things that is it doing a dome is the magnets it's awesome but I don't know how solid are they going to be over time putting your pocket top apart wax everywhere that's not fun to clean here done laundry wax and pockets not fun so that's something I'm on the fence about we'll see over time if it works well I like the fact that you give multiple atomizers it's really nice seeing them all before thus far but it's cool they have a lot the source or gets you like six atomizers in one set so if you really want a variety I'm there too I like that it's kind of ahead of the game thus far no other wax pen has used magnets it's all the threading so that's cool it's unique and I like that it's a dr. David product I've found that thus far everything I've used from has been really solid the ghost works well the light this haven't had my hands on a boost yep I don't know we're going to probably do a

edwin [Music] what ed wouldn't talk to me anyway i know it's you from the future [Music] what was that i didn't hear you help i'm trying to help you edu how can i help you talk to me how can i help you edwin i'm trying to pull you i got to pull you [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] no edwin please come back talk to me edward what i need to do i'm trying to get it what i'm trying hey edward i'm trying i'm trying to pull you in edwin edwin they're gonna think of a [ __ ] cracker if i'm doing this in the middle of the street pull a little bit more this way [Music] i'm trying to win [Music] like a [ __ ] crackhead edwin i'm gonna pull you into this alleyway edwin edwin what the [ __ ] is that noise what did i miss edwin edwin i hear it edwin hold on what pull me through keep going [Music] please i'm going further i'm going beyond edwin yeah what the [ __ ] [Laughter] [Music] oh how i literally hear it was that it over there that's a buffalo edwin edward where is he watch this [Music] [Music] further beyond [ __ ] how do i make can do it edwin i'm not strong enough edwin edwin what do i need to do edwin talk to me how do i kneel what do i need to do how do i ascend to my disciples talk to your disciples of the time lord who were your disciples of the time lord the buddha disciples of the time lord when i talk to them what do i ask for edward hmm who's the disciples of the time alert [Music] should i call buddha you hung up disciples of the time lord the nerds talk to the disciples of the time lord that has to be the nerds who the [ __ ] is the time lord i don't i don't know this who's the time lord is it edwin the time lord i'm i'm assuming edwin is the time lord well who are his disciples it has to be buddha because buddha told me all that [ __ ] earlier [Music] link hey what's up my friend listen what did you say exactly that you did with edwin the other day i saved the world okay is he the time lord yes are you a disciple ah i mean i guess so maybe do you know with the disciples of the time lord can i just say i just had to pull him in from the dimensions and he told me to talk to the disciples of the time lord ah [ __ ] i don't know if that's me then he had like a car that like hovered oh [ __ ] oh the delorean yeah he just hit me oh my god is that another glory from another timeline [ __ ] it's bigger than what i thought it was one of the disciples of the time lord i don't know what the [ __ ] why does you want to speak do you just speak to them let me give you a reason i mean i don't know i thought aren't you a disciple then if you helped him save the time lord the timeline i guess or some [ __ ] i mean i guess so but what would he want you to ask me maybe i wouldn't i don't know he told me to talk to them i mean maybe we don't [ __ ] hey what about your nerds what do they do are they just like losers oh not really i mean some of them know about the time or they help me on my mission but did he give you a hint or anything or did he just say speak to disciples you just speak to the disciples then maybe it's me yeah but we talk about what the [ __ ] do we talk about well we saved the world from ending because some organization that was called talent or some [ __ ] fought with leslie lingberg and kevin woopaloo in the future it was a corporation versus the freedom of people where are you oh my goodness all right i'll meet you there all right what the [ __ ] is going on here this is some [ __ ] legend of zelda [ __ ] [ __ ] disciples of the time lord yeah yeah hey uh romney can i meet you in like 20 minutes i have to meet up with the hour real quick and talk to him about uh some long [Music] let's see what the nerds are doing hello sorry i died [ __ ] i'm so sorry are you guys losers oh you have a gun sir the guy just stabbed someone watch out shoot him yeah i don't have any [ __ ] ammo he's got a mask and he's bald he's got a mask where he's bald hey are you a loser you hopping popping nerd smells like god of war cosplay i've been oh yeah it is that's me hopping hey are any of your other loser friends around hey your voice box is a little [ __ ] up by the way where's the rest of you d can you losers me now yeah but i guess a little bit is anybody else inside i don't know i just woke up let me go check right oh that's why i thought i keep [ __ ] [ __ ] see what's gonna happen bro my god bro

upstairs what's up alan oh yeah uh one second uh mr edwin i'll i'll tell you about the painting in one second go ahead and admire it for a second edwin yeah i'm the new owner here if if this guy has like weird eyebrows and frizzy hair it is it is it is i'll be right there i'll be right there okay i need a witness dre i need you over here real quick ems work on her come over here i'll be at the hospital office here [ __ ] what is going on here allen's a [ __ ] legend [Music] eh [ __ ] bunny huh i'm sure yeah well we'll we'll get you the four onyx as your own today it would be five of 25 baby girl how you doing quite fantastic considering i would have five onyxes by the end of today oh hey excuse me oh he said five by the end of today um hmm right right right exporter agreement tears yeah of course right the agreement correct correct can i just um give me one second can i talk to alan here in private real quick edward yeah yeah yeah well let's talk about in the meantime you could have a present curate to tell me about this painting let's see of course of course lexie likes to get the [ __ ] over talking about this painting talk about the painting okay alan that sounds like a lot of expensive [ __ ] dude i have been on the hunt for an onyx gym for the past month i don't even have one allen and i've been looking for one he wants four he was five you promised him five by the end of the [ __ ] day you he said he was promised by you 20 and he wants 25 percent now [ __ ] did you promised him 20. he came to you asking that they're about to expect he said that i was promised why today and then like it's like i'm cleaning 25 percent i'm like oh [ __ ] i don't even have one i've been looking for one for like a month now what do we do uh onyx what the hell how the [ __ ] does onyx look like i have been hunting literally for a month alan i haven't found one oh god maybe i've looked everywhere i've tried everything i have a cursed gem i don't know maybe it might be an onyx who knows yeah what is that like how does it look like it's it doesn't look like anything [ __ ] i'll go grab it i'll be right back yeah yeah tell him tell him i'll be right i back hey edwin i'll be right back going to go see the the vault real quick this uh our our um our bank everybody can accompany you yeah yeah yeah yeah sure yeah yeah come see them right right yeah not sure rightful place yeah are they going to marry right right of course of course of course yeah come on come right inside can you come right with me edwin yeah yeah yeah yeah oh i had one baby oh [ __ ] oh adam and i missed that i missed those hands what are you saying remy how's dandy doing good oh yeah baby edwin how's dandy doing adam when he's doing good i've lost my brother what do you mean what i don't know where he is dandy somebody tried to steal my delivery in the other day i got it back there really i did um yes yes yes right let's go outside let's go for a ride guys go for a ride let's let's go for a ride oh it could do with some water i don't want peasant what are they little dude would you like little does he know we're the ones behind it this guy a [ __ ] gem master there's an objection i want words been running down a waterfall for ten thousand years ooh okay i can take you to one all right let's let's go edwin picked me to ride this you're right you're right you're right yeah yeah absolutely you're right um alan do we have anything else that we can uh give him right in yeah yeah i'll uh i'll bring my get my car from here go go get your car all right i'll bring it back sir hop in i'll take you to the spot to this car no god what you're the gem god i am and we leave you soon and we love you soon [Music] you look so [ __ ] beautiful edwin oh yes i know i am right i am at your perfection right right right oh and when you look [ __ ] divine [Applause] what the [ __ ] is [Music] yeah robby romy where's this guy what do you mean okay if you have sure wait for you oh [ __ ] let me park this [ __ ] [ __ ] that [ __ ] allen jesus alex okay who is he don't tell me please there's a lot that i need to talk to you about okay he came here like he was like expecting something asap and i'm like oh like showed up in our door let go [ __ ] hold on okay let me get the right music here his name is edwin levioson he's one of them he's one of the leaders of the gem guild gym guild yes oh okay okay him and his brother dandy they've came to my gallery and they gave me the power to appraise gems oh my god they gave you the skills yes now they're training me to become a gem master like them and be a part of their guild okay but now but now uh edwin he's there's another edwin that's stuck in the future that told me to talk to the disciples of the time lord this is some crazy type of time lord listen this is some big [ __ ] this is big [ __ ] [ __ ] okay all right here's the thing i can't tell anybody about this okay all right where is he this is some big [ __ ] allen hey it sounds like some big [ __ ] considering he wants five onyxes that we have today you think he can help us find him well he said we gotta go to a waterfall that's been running for for a hundred years i think i know which one he's talking about there's one in roots in yeah that's the one oh oh edwin you want me to take you to the waterfall anyways you show me right i'll put in the gps so mr edwin it's uh it's really nice to meet you it is not nice to meet you who the [ __ ] is oh i'm sure i'm sure that after today we'll we'll be well acquainted oh i would be the judge of each yeah absolutely you waste my time we will not waste your time we think your time is precious and it matters edwin go to that gps location that is a waterfall that has been running for hundreds of years they are they call it the waterfall of youth oh yes you feel oh yeah to kill baby peasants for me which peasants and to make an odd piece from it are we moving right now uh no did you not see that car hitters no yeah yeah that kanji the black angel i'm i think i'm getting scuffed out oh [ __ ] no we're just simple we're just he's just thinking about stuff are we on milton road right now yeah we are are we next to the left to drop on to our left yeah we're we're oh no we're not oh edwin your powers are too strong we need another timeline we're time traveling oh [ __ ] pause champ it's the timeline edwin anyway i think we survived [ __ ]", "AYFWH2TkZrQ": "mr jackson for m1v1 should they do milliliters or liters um since milliliters um will cancel out it doesn't matter okay do you hear that and then what's their m2v2 because we already have we already know that the molar you know the volume of the stock solution you're adding and you know the volume it should be at the end so there's v1 and v2 and you know the molarity of the solution because you made the solution yeah so there's m1 okay cool do you guys hear that i feel like we need to get making jokes about this but ass and ray's new song on here huh get me hyped um mr jackson you're welcome do i rinse these with the solution like my dirty solution and then i also rinse this with my dirties or you can or you can if you just clean these you can dry them out okay then you're good you don't have to rinse them with the solution [Music] the solution goes up right and we're going to do at least five milliliters so we want to put five milliliters in there at least and then when you press this button right here it comes out and that's the way we pipe that all right and then i'm gonna set that to zero right uh just like you did yesterday yep but the cool thing is is you're not messing with wavelengths so you're gonna be able to once you make these do these real fast okay yeah but i don't mess with this right oh you do you still need a blank just like you did yesterday you have to have it zero water yep okay all righty all right i'm gonna put okay volume tube number one these are not labeled so i'm just going to start guys remember this for me i'm gonna start from the left so the left the very left one is one um [Music] and droppers never get held upside down yes i know it feels natural for us to do that but are you guys figuring out the math for me yeah do you even like the math like like the calculations of co you know three two in each stock solution the m1v1 equals v2v yeah but i have a quick question so or like for the people in the zoom like so for v2 are you doing five millimeters for the whole thing or are you doing just what the h2o says i thought the like the because the five milliliters is like how much of like your stock and so i thought that would be v1 yeah sorry i i said it wrong i'm not really sure what v2 is supposed to be honestly because that's just like what i need to figure out then like i can figure out uh m2 v2 is so v1 i think is the concentration so like for test tube one would be five yeah test tube two would be four and then v2 i think is five in general because that's the amount wait but v but could v2 possibly be five because it says volume after water was added which would be like q1 is has zero volume or water yeah that's right i think you just like add the two yeah i see what you're talking about i'm not uh i'm not following that's okay so v2 will always be five yes right this person v2 will always be five right yes because that's the amount that we want five liters five milliliters yes okay okay so test tube one's done now i'm gonna do four milliliters of our stock solution and then one milliliter um okay so just to clarify v1 chain according to which test tube we're doing yes okay [Music] three quarters of the way full yeah three-quarters of the way full not all the way to the top three-quarters of the way yesterday she had it so it was like eventually wait does it can our blank look like this going to be a different shape than our other ones no oh well real quick make sure we're on the same page you don't use chest tubes in the machine you only use cuvettes in the machine the test tubes are just to hold it so if you don't have to get to that again did you go all the way i feel like i have a sword yes but that's always be vertical so that the point is down okay it's not like you have it like under your arm there you go how do i like you can just set it down i didn't know if i could set it down the thing you can't do is have them upside down okay here's our blankets okay i'm cleaning this one so i can put our distilled water in it for our solutions lily yeah we can't hear you probably louder if it goes to 10 that's one milliliter right because mine's like backwards yeah there should always be some at the bottom so if you go all the way up here that's 10 milliliters so that would be nine eight seven six five four right but this is one right because it's at the ten mark that's one milliliter yep i think is there nine lines one two three four five six seven eight nine ten no that's how much will stay in there at the end i think oh there's ten lines oh my god wait so i tried to fill it up till nine well yeah we're adding them together so five plus zero is five four plus one is five right what okay solution two is done wait you just did test tube two or test tube one test two okay and then like you put how much in the water you go like this down and that makes it go in and then if you need to release it you do this you push it down sorry go ahead really let me mark okay so like you do like you how much like water did you use like just one milliliter right yes okay that's three milliliters so now i'm doing test tube three and i'm doing three milliliters of our stock solution and i'm gonna do one milliliter of distilled water or i mean two middle milliliters of distilled water and then don't we write down like the absorbance kind of like what we do with the wavelength there's that like something that's what i do after i'm doing that after now i'm just making my solutions okay cool it's filling it all the way up to here that's the thing there's gonna be like yes so now i'm going to do oh [Music] so right now i'm doing so i just filled up three milliliters of distilled water in two milliliters of our stock position okay now i'm doing stock salute or tube number five oops all right six and when you're doing m2 all that stuff i think we're finding m2 we already have um or we're finding it we're finding one of the m's i honestly can't remember we're finding the second molarity well what is what would the first molarity be for like oh it's just um wait i don't know what the first molarity would be it would be 0.2.2 also olivia i'll send you the m2s in the chat so that you can write it down okay i have not you just send me like a picture after class because i'm not gonna have time to write it down probably can you send me a photo because i'm confused how to find it yeah i can send yeah i can send you guys the photo i'll ask him what is molarity again jackson yeah our m1 would be this and then what are we under five milliliters or however many milliliters of our stock station i use what that's the molarity of the stock solution right okay so b1 is how much milliliters i put in the stock solution so v1 for let's say test tube three would be three milliliters because and then so we're only talking about not the water only the stock solution right huh yeah you want to stock but i have a question so olivia you started with um one milliliter of stock right i mean stock no i started with five milliliters stock and zero milliliters okay so sorry i had them confused where did we get 0.2 that's in the other lab the lab we did last week oh okay oh the molarity of the oh okay the solution i'm using [Music] our solutions have been made where is okay so yeah just put a little bit of um absolutely if you can dry it that would be best okay and we're just doing the same kind of thing we did yesterday we're still finding the i'm absorbance doing the same procedure do we need to make a graph for each of these dilutions have you guys figured out the concentration of each of these using a solution formula what's that yeah molarity is the concentration and then uh once you have those concentrations that's going to be your concentration of the other x of your graph so for an absorbent it will be your y number okay so once you guys find all the concentrations which is the m2 write it all down because then once i find the absorbance we're going to make a graph of that i'm listening and then you need to figure out the concentration for solution that's two two three four and five yes i'm not ready [Music] okay this is number one we have to get the anomaly what's that okay this is stock solution okay for stock solution one the absorbance is one point zero four five it doesn't matter how much miss jackson i have a question every time i take my stock solution out of this every time i take this um it should always be 100 when you put it in there yep yeah but do i need to get it you need to make sure it is okay right make sure it's a 0 and 100 and then you you take it it shouldn't really change but it looks like it did for you okay tube number two fingerprints okay for stock solution 2 or for tube number 2 it's 0.870 that's the absorbance and maya will you just send me all this after i'm not writing any of this because i'm just trying to get it okay okay okay for tube number three it's point six three zero okay okay okay now we're on to tube number four get out all right is okay solution four point four three zero okay last one the unknowns are right here just pour into the beaker and then pour into your cuvette whenever you're ready okay so the second one is 0.788 okay okay last one 2.16 all right 0.216 or 2.16 0.216 sorry okay thank you [Music] all right that's it jesus now we create a graph of that okay let me clean up and then we can do that on the same one yeah i think so but i'm kind of confused about like four and six like what is i don't i'm not i'm not sure about the unknown solutions like are we supposed to be doing that today or no oh i don't know i mean mr jackson so when i'm done with these i do the unknown yep you got three unknowns right there i do the same thing again what it's easy isn't it okay we can just do this wow you use all three you do each one okay just kidding now i do it to three more solutions should i drive my comment before just like before right oh my god guys a big stressor just enough to fill the cuvette three quarters of the way easy get his stuff oh first is there a place to write like where the unknowns and stuff yeah there is and then i also think that when we find um i think you have to find m2 or something like that or never mind wait no just kidding sorry right so i got the first nevermind here [Music] [Music] all okay for solution the unknown solution number one it is 0.151 that's .151. i hate drying them oh my god okay that's okay so the fourth one is um also like the wavelength switched to 5 11 instead of 510 so we can write that down for like our percent error or something because it switched a while ago and i wasn't gonna change it because it's one off i don't think it's that big of a deal okay solution number two of unknown the absorbance is point zero seven nine [Music] you bring it over here is one point okay guys number three we're almost done last one [Music] okay solution unknown number three is the absorbance is point four two zero try this i guess we're also supposed to get the molarity of the solution but i don't think you'd do that with work he said it should just find it on the graph yeah so we have to plug the absorbance on the graph and then um you should find the m2 okay all right the period is going to end pretty soon but if we have all the stuff on the graph and you guys did all the solutions thank you for that um okay i mean that's all the hand gap is right i can get rid of my solutions right oh my god what about the solution i originally made that too cool [Music] so we should only have the absorbance right not the yes what was the second one oh i don't know i didn't write anything down maya do you know um 0.079 the solute with the absorbance of the uh test tube one was 0.151 and then test 2 was .079 oh 0 7 9 and then the last one was point zero four two or point four two zero yeah point four two zero that's so weird we like we just like look on the x-axis to find m2 for the unknown right yeah okay you guys have all the unknowns done peter yeah [Music] over here with the rest it shouldn't be what do you mean beyond the graph but they don't have it right now yeah yeah you have to extract the grass you got it yep all right that's the bow um if any of you guys need help you can like i don't know you can email mr jackson or something but i think that should be good so we do the rest on our own yes okay all right bye you", "Ow1-WcxQ3jo": "foreign foreign foreign okay

welcome back to my channel if you're new here go ahead and click that subscribe button like this video because i'm amazing and make sure to comment and say hey i'm new here or something like that i don't know let me know that you're new so if you read the title you know that i will be talking about must-have foods at thanksgiving this is like african-american style southern style um yay so some i'm gonna go and like order from like meat sides desserts drinks all right lesbian it's kind of like late it's not really that late i don't know why i'm getting old it's 8 53 and i think it's like okay um so let's get started [Music] the first let me stop doing this because i'm not going to do this the whole video but the first meet that is a must-have i kind of hate love this like i feel like let me put my hair back so it's not in my face so i feel like you have to have this meat but then you also shouldn't have this meat at your um thanksgiving because a lot of people don't make it right and then it's nasty and then you're forced to eat it because it's there you know and that is but then it's also a tradition so anyways turkey turkey is a meat that i hate love i hate it because it's usually dry and like people don't know how to make it right but then also it wouldn't be thanksgiving without the classic turkey so what my solution would be to have this out here thanksgiving is to have the turkey on the table and like put a sign around it that says don't eat it because it should just be decoration honestly you know and that's my opinion i guess oh should i make a video on popular opinion thanksgiving edition look forward to that by the way if you guys have noticed um i'm gonna make this really quick because it's not part of the video but if you guys have noticed i've been posting like consistently like every single day um and like it's a lot of work for me and i have to come up with ideas so if you have ideas for me to do comment down below because i already have like a big list of ideas but maybe they don't work out for me or maybe i have to skip them so if you have an idea for me um then you know comment and i will see if it fits my brand and idea what i like to do and then i'll do it if it doesn't if i and if it doesn't then i'll just like it and show your appreciation anyways so yeah turkey and then the second meat that i think you should have and by the way you can just have one of these meats and then call it a day you just need like one meat out of these three and then secondly is um ham i love love love love ham because i've had good ham like i haven't had a bad ham i love when you decorate the ham too like you have you know pineapple maybe on it or like lemon and honey and like all this like decorative like things to make the ham look even more beautiful than it already tastes so i love love love ham because it's moist it's nice it has like a sweet savory and i love a sweet savory combination um i just love ham comment below if you love ham too and then also the next meat that i think you should have at your thanksgiving is chicken i think chicken fried chicken by the way i wouldn't do baked chicken at least so if you're having a southern thanksgiving because baked chicken doesn't really give you that like heftiness of like a thanksgiving meal like after you eat a thanksgiving meal you need to feel like heavy like you need to feel like you need to take a nap in to just make it you know count and like it's still like it's a replacement of the turkey so you need it to still have that like wow factor and i think fried chicken will give you that wow factor and now we're gonna go on to the side okay so as a side my favorite is mac and cheese my personal favorite mac and cheese is the baked mac and cheese now if you can do that southern south amazing and if you can and you're more of a like creamy person you don't like it really that stiff then my next suggestion for a mac and cheese would be the crock pot mac and cheese because it gives you like that's my second favorite mac and cheese because it's like super creamy like thick still you know like amazing and like you know and then another side to make it you know southern slash african-american um collard greens or i just call them greens you have to have them like you have to have them if you don't want to have greens another suggestion you could have instead is the um cabbage and cabbage is still good you know make sure you have sugar or hot sauce or both with it because that's how i like my greens and if you guys like that too then that is fire honestly that combination amazing another side is cornbread now i don't think my family usually has cornbread because we just have so many other carbs going on we don't really need cornbread but if you're missing a carb or you like really love cornbread for some reason go ahead get the cornbread out and like use that another thing that actually might be my favorite at thanksgiving is stuffing now the stuffing this is where the turkey comes in handy because the turkey goes into the stuffing and it's like so good my grandma i haven't had any other stuffing besides like my my parents like my grandparents and stuff so in my mom's side of the family so i really haven't had bad stuffing stuffing is amazing and stuffing with cranberry sauce makes it a hundred percent a thousand percent out of ten great so that is a must you need to have the right stuff i know some people do other kind of stuffings but no this is the right way i love the stuffing you can't have it any other way at least i like the other stuffing is good but it's not great you know it's it's not the stuffing so i that's one thing that i always get at thanksgiving the stuffing the mac and cheese and the greens now if they don't have greens i'll get the cabbage and then also another thing that is a hit in my household is the devil eggs now the devil's eggs the cold side instead of the warm side oh and another thing that i actually wasn't gonna add in this video besides the deviled eggs if you want to be more traditional you can have the potato salad and you got to make sure it is cold a lot of people they leave it out and it gets warm and then all froze make sure your potato salad is cold and um another thing is um for the size besides the double eggs and potato salad i always love like a good dessert so let's talk about dessert because i can't think about any more side oh another side i would count this as a side in a dessert but i mostly count as a side because there's so many other desserts you can choose from that shouldn't be like the main dessert which is yams and i call them yams i don't know what you call them but they look like this and they are amazing like they're sweet and they have like a little thing you can like chew on they're not really like crunchy but they like you know bite down a little mush and it's amazing like it's a nice sweetness to your savory plate and it can go well with anything like you can go like you mash it in a little bit with your mac and cheese you can have with your greens you can have it with your stuffing along with the cranberry sauce and i think it's amazing another thing um now we're going to move on to desserts so some desserts that i find you have to have or something similar i know i'm gonna say this right now because it just popped into my head a lot of people like banana pudding i hate it or banana like i like banana bread but not banana pudding and it's if you do have it at yours please i don't want to be invited to that um i just can't i can't i can't what you could do if you have like a small a smaller gathering or not that like many people basically or i don't know you just want to do some strawberry shortcake i would recommend that because strawberry shortcake it's like my ultimate favorite dessert is very quick and easy and you can buy like the little cakes that's like individual and just like have it all like set ready and like maybe you can have it like in a fun way and like have it diy so you can have little cakes and then like strawberry um with the like strawberry syrup in a bowl and then some whipped cream that that people can spray on them themselves so that could be like culvert friendly too because like your individual stuff and you're not really like taking from the same pie and like you know you never know so i think that's a good idea another dessert is either pumpkin or sweet potato pie i know there's a lot of debates on no you have to have sweet potato pie or no you have to have pumpkin pie and honestly at this point is pie like they look very similar i know some people debate about that but honestly they look similar if whichever ones on the table i'm eating they kind of taste similar to me too so don't really care and then another pie is a i call it a french silk pie or just a silk pie um it's just like chocolate and whipped cream and chocolate basically to me a little egg and it's amazing um and i love it and then another um another dessert is apple pie and apple pie and either if you have an apple pie or a peach cobbler pie oh my god peach pop i said peach poblet a peach cobbler pie with ice cream i'm gonna literally just eat that the whole night not really because my stomach will probably be full by the time i eat the peach cobbler pie but it's amazing um so you automatically have to have that or the apple pie so i guess it's the same thing kinda with the like pumpkin and sweet potato pie it's like one or the other and now let's go on to drinks so drinks um you always have to have like for the kids the pops sodas whatever you want to call it and the like juices because you know when people eat a lot of food they need a large drink so i think you know anytime i like maybe you can start a group chat and ask your family like what kind of pop you drink what kind of you know juices you like if you don't drink pop or juices what kind of like water do you buy you know and then after you ask that i of course like buy it in like bulk because people drink and eat like crazy on thanksgiving because it's literally a smorgasbord they know that they can eat as much as they want and drink as much as they want so and some people they like literally start a diet the week before just so that they can eat a lot so um yeah you need to buy like in a large amount so that people can drink as much as they need to and then for the adults have the alcohol on deck and even for people that you might not think oh they don't drink alcohol they probably will thanksgiving because it's just a family event and some people need a little alcohol to lighten the mood and make them a little loose around people they can't stand or they know that they can't be in the same room with throughout the rest of the year so have the drinks flowing no matter what and honestly that's pretty much it like if you have those basic things at thanksgiving your babe your thanksgiving will be a hit i mean like how can it not people are eating they're enjoying themselves and they're with their family with that being said i think i gave myself the idea to make like a thanksgiving unpopular opinions i know i've been in my room and the setup is a little weird the bed looks crooked but i promise you it is not i think it's my phone actually or something um yeah and the setup is kind of weird like i don't like how it's set up i need to get my little stand again but yeah i'll see you guys next time i hope you enjoyed this video and i'll see you tomorrow [Music] bye [Music] you", "dwmNWEFWLs8": "a busy day i'm sure this is one o'clock so we'll call the facilities committee meeting uh for wednesday march 17th to order let me let us in the word of prayer please at the end of the fire we thank you for this day and we thank for the opportunity we have to serve the citizens of glenn county uh god we just ask that you give us guidance let us have understanding of what our community needs and to be good stewards of the funds that are entrusted to us guide us as we talk about the system today and help us to understand what our staff tells us and help us just to move forward with the system thank you for the opportunity we have we bring all the glory to you in jesus name we pray amen amen there's no public comment period move to the approval section item one is the minutes from the february 17 2021 facilities committee meeting now having a chairman i moved to accept the minutes for item number one this meeting of february 17th 2021. second to motion motion second all in favor motion cares three nothing next item is the minutes from the february 17 2021 special call facilities committee meeting and i also will move to approve the minutes as submitted for the special call meeting for february 17 and i will second that motion motion second all in favor motion cares three to nothing move to item three easements and infrastructure dedications mr kline all right commissioners this is a pretty standard easement infrastructure dedication item here's two items both on st simon's island item one is on longview which is a private broadway locations uh kings marsh condo or uh town homes i think it is behind the post office on st simon's island there so it's private right away there is a we have a customer that came in purchased a meter and there is no water or sewer extensions on longview and so what we did is we reached out to all the people on their side of the road three different entities and we obtained easements from those three entities to be able to extend water and sewer to their neighbor so everybody worked together on the road there and turned out favorably for us and so we're presenting that easement for acceptance to the board today we'll immediately gain one new water customer so the other two are already on the water system the the one that's closest to the public right-of-way in longview where it transitions from public right-of-way to the private uh access easement actually what it is they are currently on our water they can reach it our water extends right to there to the transition are they on the water though they are and then on water only correct and so uh our hopes are to also get these people there on septic right now uh but the neighbor the end of the street desires to get onto our sewer system and so this will open up availability for them so we have to stand a chance of picking up six seven eight uh plus the people within uh possibly nine different new customers are we putting the water line in yes sir what's the cost of putting the wood line in uh in-house i think our cost is pretty cheap for two inch pipe it's a water it's gonna be a two inch water extension so total cost we can i may feed it out real quick but uh 20 bucks a foot probably for the install cost from the pipe but we're doing this just to pick up one customer right one uh immediate customer who has come in and paid then we have interest from the other residents of express interest especially the ones that have provided easements to us so for sewer and water we already have one of them on water and how far are they going to be from the nearest hydrant we're actually going to relocate a hydra to the end of where the private access easement begins so a little bit within the 500 feet we have an eight inch main that extends right now right there where the it transitions to the private right away the it says the water and sewer systems are expected to be constructed so are they going to all three become more sewer customers too not immediately but they will be brought on as they need to be yes sir there are some houses that are something a lot back there that are interested in connecting and then we've got the you know the septic tanks it is pretty wet back there too so um they will if the kind of connection would be a gravity sewer these would be i don't think we can extend gravity i don't think we have the depth to extend gravity it'll be low pressure is it likely to be lower pressure and the existing sewer or the customer that wants sewer is fine with the low pressure system i question why we're extending water to somebody and it's so close to sewer we're not requiring them to hook to the sewer too and it's a new house now the new house will be on both okay the new one is 510 longwood it's the one at the end of the road 507. 507. but yeah the one at the lot at the very end they just demoed that house and they're starting yeah basically with the foundation so that will be a new home down there yeah okay so 507 is going to be a new one 507 507 and 510 will both be tying on yeah very soon um just mr new houses to be tying on the there are some existing houses that do want to get on the water system as well they're not interested in the sewer system because their tanks are currently working but when their tank fails they'll have to get on the sewer system as well this will put us within reach within the 500 foot so when their septic system does go beyond its useful life they will be required actually to tie on our system so is that what does our policy say on this you have a policy we have well if somebody was it is within 500 feet of water and sewer public water and sewer mains they are required to connect to those sewer mains new construction we're required to connect occasionally people were asked for variances if they have an existing well and safety tank on the site from a previous structure that is still functional or if they have a very large lot and the front corner is 500 feet away but their house is going to be 1500 foot back in the parcel we consider those variance requests the ordinance does give us the authority to require people to tie on by simply sending them a letter and tell them they have six months to tie onto the system but we have hundreds of people that are currently in violation of that if not thousands so we have not forced that issue down to the water system you mean and sewer it says on both of them they if they're not currently on and there's a public line there by ordinance they're required to tie onto the system we have not for new construction we're enforcing that but not for existing structures well this is new construction they will be on the system if we run this line because somehow as you said on it would come eventually would come eventually yes sir the new the customers are interested in water because they're having some well issues the sewer as long as their tanks working they're not interested in getting on the low pressure sewer system now the low pressure system do they pay for the pump and everything yes yes sir we will maintain the uh public section of the force main but the grinder systems themselves will be maintained by the homeowners is the force manual go all the way to the end where it ties into the last house for the for this particular project not not as part of this first initial custom that we're getting on the water system this is simply just a tile of the water so right now we're just extending in-house the two-inch watermelon i thought i thought we were tying this person onto sewer also though no sir not at this time it's a water and sewer easement we were able to obtain that from the property owners both the water and sewer easement but at this time it's only a water extension okay my apologies on that well just a follow-up question for clarity um at such time 507 that's the closest to our gravity system that they want to connect will they be connecting via gravity or would they have a grinder pump they would have a grinder pump theoretically there'd be a two inch force main that runs parallel to the two-inch water main that they tie onto okay because if not they would have an excessively long lateral out in the public right away understood okay and then let's say 509 goes next um would do we run the line down the right-of-way that low-pressure system and along the frontage of 509 at such time that they put in a grinder pump and i think they're that's going to be a new house i presume okay there's a there's an existing structure down there it looks like the i don't i can't tell they're renovating or if they're there's an existing structure down there at 509. is this the drawing on the second sheet todd are we supposed to be looking at i can't see uh they're the only so there was a free we previously uh created plaque as the exhibit for when we were attaining the easements for folks so this is the only one that's in the that's related to longview as far as the drawing i've got gis pulled up so maybe help us look a little bit uh we can get a better view of what this is let me turn on the uh this is not captain's cove this is a 500 block long view this is a long 500 long view yes sir how long how long has these but we don't even show how long the easement is you don't mention anything about what we're doing here right so each individual there's three individual easements [Music] and three individual easements correct three different property owners we're gonna run three different lines no sir one single line so we had to get trying to think maybe it's easier for me to point who owns the street okay so this is public right away post office is down here public roadway comes in here stops from this point on its private property all the way to the back all the ovens there's a private access easement it's not even private right away it's private access ease chaired by you know equally by both property owners either side going how far far up there so if we're going from 503 all the way to 509 at the end we'll get easements across everybody's property uh total distance one little piece across there's now yeah 300 a little less than 400 feet okay so how did that person get back to the house back to the house up at the top yeah that's the one we're serving right we're serving 507 507 has come into play 509's above it yes right the 507 can get there on the easement that's been provided i guess the access easement correct so is that an accident season 509 too yes sir this is actually paved right here it's a it's a little paved road and it kind of meanders back and forth amongst the the access easements and showing the ga and where are we going to put the 500 fire hunter we're going to set the fire hunter right here in the public right-of-way right now it's at the other end how far is the 509 from that hydra about 300 feet 3 400 feet right from the corner of their property yeah about well from where we're going to locate it uh yeah what's the street parallel in that i think that's red river view river north what size line is that uh it looks like river views it's it's like a six inch six inch and six inch trans light on river view let me just clean this up a little bit there we go there's real view on sewer they are well they have a force main they're on primarily grinders on river view we just replaced most of the water mains in riverview with the galvanized project okay there's no gravity sewer on river view unfortunately i'm concerned about just a two inch extension on a private street about two inch extensions the other two the two houses in front they're on our system so right now 503 yeah is on so we've got a two inch line of that point correct correct and actually where's that two inch line that's this this two inch line we're gonna connect to that and extend it correct yes this kind of cleans up a little bit of stuff too because when was that two inch line put in oh that was great yeah so i was about to say i i don't know when this was installed but it was installed without enhancement at some point it was probably when this i'm not sure if when this person wanted do we have a meter on that second house up there there's a meter on 503 um i think that's the only meter we got but it's oh it's out there a lot it's not back where we're connected to two inch correct it's out there a lot service connections and turn that guy on but we don't even have an easement for where that water line is right now we don't we we currently do not until the board actually yes [Laughter] so that'll give us an easement over this piece of little finger property actually this finger property is owned by 509 so it's the same owner there father three it's kind of an l-shaped piece of property right here probably three gave us that 25 and what we did we squared it off with the existing 25 feet this way is 509 a developer is building those houses uh no sir they're not is he on those lots did he own those lots wait which lots 507 and 505. separate property owners separate property owners separately yes 509 is just like an older place it's a block building of some sort and i wonder if i don't know i'm familiar with it because i know someone else owns property there across the street but 509 they've done a lot of clearing and clean up a brush it looks like they're getting ready to do something maybe convert that old build into a garage or something and build a primary residence and then 508 i think's a little brick house right across from 509 and 510 are now the same owner oh okay there yeah you can tell they're doing a little bit down there so that's that's what i know about the property in the area from there too so it ultimately that two inch line will serve uh 08 and 10 because that same owner it'll be two separate parcels to two separate residences and then whenever 09 builds a primary resonance again an 07 is a little single story low pitch roof looks like a cottage that they've been working on for a while and it's actually quite attractive in my view and they have paid for their and they're the ones the new the newest customer their well has is having issues and they're ready to they have come and paid for a meter and they're ready to connect okay so if if it's a new structure then they have to connect to both the water and the sewer unless they are given a variance yes we give them a variance right and anyone that's remodeling can stay where they they are or they have the option if if they pull in a permit they're required to tie them that triggers the okay the necessity for that okay six inch longer time two is a dead end line too right it's not looped around nothing correct so this is a it's an eight inch down here this is this is the two here i'm pulling back up we have an eight inch that comes in dead ends right here and how far down does it go all the way back do we know what kind of flow we can get at that hydrant red top less than a thousand so awesome stuff here this higher we're going to relocate to here so it's kind of splits the difference i'm going to give these people fire protection now distribution that's what they asked they could do is relocate the hydrants it made sense did we model it to see what the flow is going to be and what that hydra we have the capability to do that now certainly i mean i just don't i'm concerned about putting in a two inch line that long just serving it's going to be how long is the total length 400 400 feet 400 feet you think it's not adequate for the services well it's for the for the service it's fine but for fire protection i'm not sure yes certainly but they'd be within the 500 feet mark if we move this iron here to here into the right away into the public right away the folks at the end will be within 500 feet and then when you're extending the hydrant from where it is now it's going to be on an eight on a six inch or an eight inch eight inch line okay but did did i hear that some of that line was already replaced it was galvanized it was required no no in riverview in the next street over it was the governor yeah neighborhood norm all that two inch in riverview was just replaced we just put new brand new poly tubing in in there as part of the galvanized project is all of that section galvanized lined the mains in river view are transite but the services and the two inch i get two inch mains that run back on the streets were all galvanized did we replace all of them we hadn't replaced the trans light but we've replaced all the galvanized just two inch it was two inches and we put two inch back all right and we have reports that water pressure is drastically increased in the area um sure from galvanized that's for sure how long has the galvanized been in there okay yeah on its useful life thank you that's a good description so the second easements or second part of this agenda item is you know then captain's cove a subdivision put in between north and south harrington actually access is off of north harrington that is the location and these are just easements it's two easements um to be dedicated to us for uh ownership and maintenance of the collection system within there they're donating the infrastructure as well correct or just thank you and this is our little pressure sewer system too right correct correct and that's the only way they can be served is is it already installed is this installed it is installed yes you might want to make a motion i will uh for item three i'll make the motion that uh we accept the easements and the infrastructure dedications as listed as 500 block of longview including the three easements and also for captain's cove easement and infrastructure we're going to forward it to the full commission for approval yes thank you and acceptance i'll second the motion motion second all in favor promotion cares next item is a 2021 capital project plan draft mr burris yes sir so a little bit of uh flexibility today with this okay let's pull it up here all right there we go we supposed to be looking at the new one or the owen we're going to go over both of them give you a lot of options today i have a third option that's not printed on here either so all right well what was uh sent out to y'all last week this is the draft capital projects plan for the 2021 but 2021 year starting with the fiscal year the reason it's draft is because we typically approve this concurrent with the annual budget and since we do not have an approved budget for next year yet these have not been approved so we talked about most of these at the retreat that we had back in january these projects are in a variety of areas the budget which will be presented at the finance committee meeting currently has about seven million dollars in the r r fund for next year so down there at your bottom right you'll see the r r funded projects for next year would be just shy of 7 million those projects would be to convert the canal road water production facility the fire well to a water production facility that is right there by the intersection of glencoe and canal and harry driggers we have been in communications with glenn county for their proposed intersection project there and this is being taken into account with their design we would convert that to from a firewall to a production well exactly like we did with ridgewood that is an upper floridan well and we also have a great deal of demand currently ongoing do you need this email do you need an email open anymore do you need your email open you anymore users okay good so um we have a lot of demand at canal crossing at this point in fact when we made the connection at canal crossing we started getting a lot of water pushing back across the interstate the ridgewood whale has helped with that and got the uh those myosin wells that golden eyes one and two have cut back drastically but doing this will help that out even further so it's a 1.85 million dollar project it would require outside engineering if you recall the price tag on ridgewood was just shy of 1.5 so the other 350 000 would be for engineering services for the project the engineer who designed the last the ridgewood well is no longer doing design engineering so we'll have to go out for someone else so it won't be a as quick of a process however we believe that that could be a very successful project for us north mainland water loops if if you're familiar with the exit 38 area you'll notice every time we have a major water break at exit 38 we cut the entire exit off of water because it's not looped very well it is single fed all the way from old jessup to the spur and up almost to perry lane road so if we have to shut a valve down pretty much everything between the spur and old jessup gets shut down the easiest way to loop that would be to come down haltala but that is a bit of a spaghetti junction with utilities out there right now and you could theoretically jack and bore the railroad but that's about a 600 foot bore jack and boar costs right there so that's about 350 000 to bore that so the options we're looking at here um kate road yeah excuse me kate road to old jessup and i will since you've got you did me a favor and pulled up gis here tell us where that line's gonna be uh that's where i'm moving i don't have any nice stuff too no sir i did not produce maps for all these because i was planning just to pull up gis can you provide a map that goes in the packet tomorrow this is going to be in the packet tomorrow right yes sir this is just for discussion today okay it would theoretically be in your packet for approval at the april meeting all right where am i at oh okay so we're up here um so what currently happens let's zoom in here on our exit one of the sections we're looking at for looping this as you can see we have a line that comes across the interstate up here to our right and comes down through millennium park right there at the i-95 toyota but it is not looped to the other side of the spur so one of the loops we'll be looking at doing would be getting gdot permitting to bore under the spur and loop those in there because if you look down here what currently happens you see this long blue line that keeps following here and then it dead ends right there at the railroad so if we have to show that if there's a valve breaking anywhere back here the closest place we can shut that off is back here so we shut off everybody in between there that feeds off of that line so ridgewood has helped that somewhat but we still have problems the other area we're looking at is back behind the tractor supply which i will get there shortly where am i at road names that's 99 went too far there's some red names here that's ridgewood perry lane okay yes so essentially we would also bring a line down this this is this is a on new jessup is a 16 inch line that's that's what comes out old jessica oh jessica oh jessica's 16 12 inch on perry lane so we would be bringing a 12 inch line down bailey and a long gold dress up to loop the system on that in as well so it's looped on both sides so for if there's a break in the middle we can feed from either direction so you have to shut the valve off the water is going to go we can go in different directions that's correct yeah so those are the two we are looking at it doing with this money just to give you an idea but that will give a great deal of water redundancy for the exit 38 area is there any concern about right away space on that section of old jessup where we would look as we refer to it behind the tractor supply area it crosses a significant uh ditch over there there's bread yeah so there's some constraints and design well there'll be some boring likely with that project and then the other thing is do we know of anything that's in the county's forecast three to five years out that they would be doing some right away improvements i'm not aware we did just receive a list from dave alston from glenn county i'm not aware of this matter of fact i think they had done some work on this section a few years back even so okay i i support the approach i think it's a good approach i just i'm just thinking about old joseph it's kind of a narrow right-of-way and so just take that into account yes sir how do we come up with the 1.25 million that was all estimated off of projects we've had recently been based off the amount of footage we got to put in the ground and the bore under the spur and then also likely the bore under the creek or ditch whichever is the more appropriate term and what size lines are these be a 12 inch although it's 12. as far as i know yes there's a 12 for millennium or eight for millennium uh it's i think it's eight over there eight a millennium and a twelve donald joseph how did we size that it's really to connect existing existing pipe sizes tying them together the the existing that we're connecting to it kind of dictates the size so eight on either side we're going to connect with the baits with the now on the old gesso the 16 16 down yeah then it's a short run of 12. right you know uh won't make much of a difference or an impact to go from 16 for that whole connection there 12 to the 16. the branch out our existing chief alone debt service at full draw is 1.21 million between the seven and a half million dollar loan currently for the meters and the 15 million dollar loan for the academy creek rehab and cured in place project so we said when we got that loan we would pay for it out of r and r so there's the allotment for that home station 4002 i'll draw your attention to 4002 and down further and one those are the oldest pump stations in the city of brunswick uh built there let's go back to the meters is that for all of the meters that's for half that's for the seven and a half million which will do the first two years of the meters okay so it's for all of the 15 million and then the seven and a half okay uh so 4001 4002 we're both listed in the master plan as needing entire electrical system replacements that was discussed at the last facilities committee meeting we also have needs at 4002 to increase the flow capacity there based off of some development that's coming in that area however so while we're in there there's some pumps that were relocated to that station a couple years ago but that station basically needs a complete overhaul and then 4001 the same thing 4001's a much smaller station than 4002 so there's your 650 for 4002 and 400 000 4001 two is the one down there by indigo off of um union so we're gonna go this uh that parking lot right there and then four thousand and one is down closer to king and prince 4001 pumps to 4002 as well 4044 rehab 4002 was already rehabbed wasn't it a few years ago we replaced the pumps in there we relocated pumps from a different station into there but that's the extent of the rehab work that's been done so we're going to rehab like we're doing on 4003 and it won't be as extensive because we won't need wet well work or we're not going to add an odor control unit but very similar yes sir basically mechanical and electrical mechanical electrical upgrades at both of those stations 4044 you may recall a little bit about this we had an unsolicited proposal with somebody was going to do some development at the mall area that has since ceased and that station is in dire need of attention we would be building a brand new station adjacent to the existing station than using the existing wet well as a receiving manhole we have been in contact with the bank right there by that that's on altama in front of the old payless use location the bank that's immediately beside them we had been communication with them they have an existing grinder set up that we would be putting in the station then they could gravity too so they're willing to give us the property to do that if they don't have to be on a grinder system anymore and then this actually 4044 drains everything up from home depot down through pepper tree crossing on the other side the mall area so there's a lot of water that goes through that station so this would be to completely redo that station and also would cancel the unsolicited proposal that doesn't appear to be making any progress you're going to use the existing uh station as the receiving the existing wet well yes sir okay we'll take all the electrical out all the valves out but the existing wet one would be a receiving manhole [Music] priority base and cleaning cctv these would be projects based off of the master plan for the basins that they say had the most eye and eye in them we'll get back to that one in a second highway 17 north pump station that is the construction of a new pump station between golden shores mobile home park and cabana court mobile home park to utilize the new force main that we just put in the ground there that would allow commander court to tie onto that pump station and the hope would be to also allow customers across 17 when the widening project occurs they're going to install casings to come into that station so we did get approval from d.o.t that they will install casings while they're in there doing that widening for us okay 400 000 this year that's what we're estimating the 4116 project which is essentially a whole new station so that's where that number came in 3101 is on the south end uh it takes the flow 3101 comes from clearwater and all that is that correct todd uh yeah it does yes all about clear waters to the south 3114 3101 comes from rv park rv parking north truck stop all that stuff comes through so it was also listed in the master plan for complete electrical improvements but if we're going to go there and redo the electrical we're going to take care of everything else while we're in there too look at the pumps bases rails everything of that nature get that taken care of is that where most of the eye is coming in on that system since it's coming from the truck stop it's likely coming from that area from the truck stop and the port that comes through there yes sir doug we don't have definitive answers on that yet the run times don't seem to indicate where it's coming in at necessarily the villas drive water main extension that would be to run a new water main along village drive is about 2500 feet from lawrence road to the end of village drive we have got multiple phone calls asking for water service back there for vacant lots so if we ran this line back there we would be able to serve the overall majority of the village drive area with water service as those new constructions come online how many existing houses are back there how many because there's a lot of unopened right away back there um especially to the south village drive i guess yeah 30 maybe something 30 houses and what size line would that be it would be an eight inch underneath lawrence until the front of it and then we were we'll have to consider how much further likely be an eight inch the whole way just to provide fire protection to the area we haven't sized it exactly yet but the cost difference between eight and six inches pretty negligible we'll find one or two houses town that's going to be right pretty still water right you can see theoretically these buildings that are in there and the number of vacant lots that are along village drive on these side streets we would be going from lawrence back here to wade and virginia the intersection there with this line so you could feed both directions off of that main as people came onto the system gravity we have gravity or force main sewer on lawrence that near that intersection that's force main and then there is low pressure force main in village drive as well okay there's a low pressure force mate going all the way down not all the way down it stops here at uh i don't know the name of that three sizes a single homeowner put that in to run grinder systems to their house when it crosses lawrence road it does it goes underneath lawrence road and ties in is that where the pump station is over there yes sir if you put a bore in underneath lawrence road with gravity that'd be the way to extend gravity but right now it's all right this would just be to add water service it would not be running sewer service as well i understood my thoughts are is if you know if we're going to cross with a water line why wouldn't we just go ahead and put it in a sleeve give some flexibility later while because we're in the neighborhood now right how deep is that wet well very shallow it's maybe seven eight foot deep 20 56 it is very shallow those pumps were in the process for replacing the panels but vfd's in to keep them from short cycling with the shallowness of that wet well is that the pump station that sinclair plantation was going on that's the one they would have they would have been improving yes sir is that project dead sinclair plant we had heard nothing on that so no progress on that and then the last project on the list would be to continue to fund the galvanized project as we're going through we've got about a mile of galvanized replaced thus far with that money so so picking fixing to do some more galvanized work so that'll be hopefully funded continually until we get through all this galvanized stuff in our system now i said the priority based on cleaning cctv we come back to that that money was being allocated in there because we had 1.75 million worth of cipp on the splash list since that was unsuccessful yesterday that project doesn't necessarily have to be expedited for the splash list we can televise those basins ourselves so i have produced a new list you'll see a couple of fairly significant changes here the main one here dunbar or not the main one but dunbar creek engineering would be replacing that clean and cctv project dunbar creek is in need of some rehab uh to the filters to the uv system the aeration basin the energy at the blowers potential odor control improvements there potential addition of a new clarifier so that would be to do the engineering at dunbar creek for reference point the engineering on academy creek was right at a million dollars so that kind of gives you a scale of what the overall project costs we're estimating 3.25 for the project cost how long duration would the engineering contract be is that a nine or ten i'm estimating nine months i don't know commission trump see what your thoughts are on that but i'd say nine months so if we let this one in the second half of the calendar year then we're looking at basically summer of 22 per potential results available and then we'd look for funding to right in the capital rehab there that's correct and then the other two as you see at the top on the splots list we had the arco community road water and sewer extensions you see in the funding column there's both capital and sif if you remember from our finance reports there is a capital reserve fund that's separate from the capital improvement fee reserve fund that we fund at three hundred thousand dollars a year there is currently um well by the end of this fiscal year there will be 3.4 million dollars in that fund so four months into next year if the budget is approved will be at 3.5 million so we could go and get that project started if we wanted to pay for the arco project out of that those projects that project is under design and expect to be completed in april so we could advertise that project in may if we borrowed money to do that how would we address the debt service well okay so that was option three one of the things we uh we have been discussing is uh potentially borrowing the 15 million dollars for the that was on the splash list right it should be slightly less because interest rates are a little better right now the 15 million loan for academy crete was about a 700 000 debt service a year 720 000 a year debt service so using that figure my suggestion is if we want to do that that is perfectly reasonable that we would do one of two things we could discuss increasing the usage only rates not the base rates to cover the new debt service or we could increase the actual debt service rates which is determined by your reu allotment so there's 45 roughly 45 000 reu's in our system just to give you around numbers so if it is 700 000 that would go up everybody's be able to go up about a dollar and 30 cents per month per month to fund that if we did it with the debt service if you did it with usage it'd shift a lot because the higher users naturally would pick up a i'm sure okay well i think what we need to do is look at a few scenarios there and determine what what's best for us and then also an exit plan two years out for example we pay off that debt um if the uh if there's a new splash there's another funding source available two years out actually it'd be about almost 30 months by collection so that's i think that's reasonable that we look at that it gives us the flexibility to keep on track our major capital projects that are going to benefit the community yes sir and if we did we took that approach the original capital plan that was sent out last week we could still do those projects plus the splost projects with the blown approach so that clean and cctv project would still be a good fit at that point because then we could go cleaning cctv all those lines and then use the loan money to actually fix the pipes i agree so i also threw some timelines together for you just to give you an idea some of these are a little longer projects i was a little conservative with this i would give you a fair warning on that but uh so the capital projects plan for canal road you're looking at you know if we started the monday the 19th is the monday following the april budget meeting so that's where that date came from so to go out for rfp review the numbers and come back to a commission meeting for approval for an engineer you're looking at august getting that back at uh just because the way the calendar falls i assume six months engineering on that project and so but and also with 300 days because that's what the last contract was for construction so that would be finished up april of 23 if that schedule is correct so you know it's one of those when you look at it that's not going to be a short project 4044 you're looking if you started that one in april for engineering procurement looking at september of next year before that's finalized the water loops a little bit shorter august of next year four thousand one four thousand two my recommendation would be to put those together into one contract because they're very near each other and they do pump to each other so rather than having separate engineering firms work on that that would be a little bit longer construction with both pump stations being rehabbed there so january of 23 3101 we start we would start 3101 maybe a little later to give us some time to space out some of our workload a little bit so that it's a shorter duration project but because we'd be starting it this fall cleaning cctv we got specs prepared we can put out a cleaning and cctv contract very quickly it's just literally getting maps made up adjusting the specs just a little bit for the existing project we could have that advertised very quickly within 30 days and let me ask you this i i think i saw somewhere i don't recall that we were forecasting about 78 000 linear feet cleaning cct what's our capability in-house on an annual basis we do about 100 150 000 feet in-house a year wow okay and this other 78 000 on top of that that's correct the thought process when this project was put together they will get seventy eight thousand feet much quicker than we can get seventy eight thousand feet done i understood so when that was on the spots list for the cipp was to get these basins televised as quickly as possible so that we could turn the splost money over i understood okay thank you and then if we started in-house engineering on the highway 17 north pump station i allowed todd 120 days to get that one done uh the only workload i only work on that project and then that's 120 working days that's not correct weekends are included so that would be in april of next year finishing up galvanize is just construction in-house so that's that would be through the next fiscal year and then village drive the first one again that would be an in-house design pretty straightforward to get that one done and then we'd be finishing that up next spring as well so that's if the first plan were to come to fruition the second plan i'll just talk about the projects here that we got added dunbar creek depends on how we want to do this i said seven months as an estimate to get that done may take nine months depends on honestly how much is included in that and then arco and community again that'll be ready to bid in may so we may stagger the bids a little bit so they're not both taking bids at the same time but we'll stagger them a little bit but those are going to be arco's probably a year-long project and wouldn't you say todd to get all that installed and all the paving work and everything redone back in there and community road i assumed nine months to get that one done that's a about two-thirds the size of arco yeah yeah my thoughts are is we may want to flip those in terms of timing simply because the scale of of our co is significantly bigger with all the paving involved right and frankly the subscription rate may be a lower in terms of folks wanting to connect sooner compared to the community road area i think both of them were viable projects and both of them were worth doing but i would suggest we just flip those in timing so certainly that can be done you know the start date on all these depending on priorities are flexible another thought we've got a lot of engineering going out the door for requiring outside resources i think it would be beneficial for us to look at doing some of it internally and and staffing accordingly just i think we need to have more of a mix of what we outsource compared to what we insource and right now we do a lot of work outside yes sir and i think we my thoughts are we could probably be more responsive projects of small to medium scale for example not getting into the complexity of the treatment plants per se but i just think it's going to give you more flexibility to be responsive and control the cost and the quality yes sir that's certainly that's just my view is to look at it uh the other thought is what we're not seeing here is a lot of the stuff that's in our update of the master plan we've got a lot of these blue lines which are construction that are stacking on top of this so my other concern is our bandwidth total because we're the construction management organization if you will as our team is certainly some of that is outsourced and we do some inspections so i just offer caution on to that is to be sure that we have the right staffing looking at the right things now those plum station projects that were listed those are all based off the risk scores in the master plan except for 4044 because there's a there's a need to do that just because the development going on in the area but the other pump stations are the highest priority lift stations listed in the master plan so that's where the vast majority of that list actually came from you know i have no concern about what you've outlined here i think it's it's commendable that you've really taken a very broad brush look and given us some granularity to it um let's look at the everything as it stacks up our current list of some few dozen projects that are going to continue uh to completion along with this list and our master plan that's one thanks uh if you look at that plan it doesn't show a lot of construction kicking off immediately because we would be doing a lot of outside engineering right that was to allow us to complete some of these ongoing construction projects before we had more necessarily coming online so obviously academy creek in the north mainland space three spots they'll be with us into the first quarter of next year next item is uh water push control plant close report not [Music] with wet available inflow at this point however the plant did handle it pretty well tss is a little higher but well within permitted limits for the month same with bod do you see the enterococci again well within limits again for the third consecutive month we're looking at 96 percent removal of body 94 percent of tss you are seeing more sludge going to the landfill at the end there which as we've increased our solids the biomass in the system we're creating more sludge trying to get the treatment better for the ammonia so that's where a lot of that is coming from but even with a little heavier rain month still only at 58 capacity there at academy creek yep what's the ammonia and the new permit going to be one um and if you look at the graph one thing i will say you look at february last year this year that gray bar is this year's rainfall which is drastically more than last year's rainfall in february but the actual flow was lower so we have made improvement it's just we've got a little ways further to go on that good progress yes very good progress and dunbor flipping over there again a little more rain this month but still below 3mgd so 73 effluent capacity there that plant handled it very very well everything well within permitting range 98 on the bod and tss removal there and very very good consistency month to month there and what we're seeing for both sludge and effluent concentrations so dunbar being operated very effectively again similar story to the last one more rain in february but less overall flow so from year to year so that's that's encouraging to see in southport uh much of the same from the previous months within uh eight thousand gallons a day difference from the flows we even with the higher rainfall there and the plant responds very well down there 93 bod and 98 tss remember what that may seem like a lower body removal there's a lot less body coming in so you're limited on what you can actually take out yeah and then uh finally did have to send some sludge to the landfill this month after three months so but 11 dry tons in three months isn't too bad coming from a wastewater plant should we consider smoke testing in the south port system we can locate where this is yes sir we could do that we could we could smoke test southport in-house because it's real obvious i mean look at your b.o.d yes and it's gone up substantially since august of 2020. yes sir capital project report mr klein mr burrs all right thank you commissioners second i'll pull right up so we can fall right along okay all right you should have in your packets there the photo report let's see no okay i'll go along through here touch the high points on these projects uh well project 72 which is the north mainland pump station 35 36 upgrades one thing you'll notice here at the top of the line right after the title of the project we added a percent complete you know roundabout percentage complete uh based on a few factors and then also the projected at this time completion date so it kind of helps you track along there what do we think we're going to finish the project i thought that might be helpful it is pictures of that just inside again that's a 35 pump station 35 and then 36 uh stations are coming along looking forward to getting those underway the notice proceed date march 22nd coming up very quickly on monday correct next project uh in tandem with that one separate contractor is the force main extension down harry diggers boulevard and uh also looking forward to that one kicking off or it's already kicked off but looking forward to them mobilizing as well they um no superseded on that one's april 1st first in the pre-con they mentioned urgency in getting these materials older so uh materials costs are very volatile right now and in one in one direction it seems to be to get in hands-on is tough some some level of supply chain issues with pvc right now my understanding is there's three resin plants in the united states and only one of them is actually producing resin right now so pvc becoming a little more difficult to get especially when you're trying to get three miles of it so they did ask us about purchasing and whatnot so they're doing everything they can to secure everything for us and get it going next project 703 pump station 4003 upgrades again that product's uh six to round about sixty percent complete april uh of this year or april 22 supposed to be 21. april 21 completion um they're getting pretty tight on their schedule there a couple things uh it's looking at the quality of the work's good uh scrolling through here you can see their structures on site for the gravity segments can begin being installed we've got the right away permit finally in hand we should start seeing them they do have 30 inch gravity on site though so we did get that piece yeah so not what you can't see in this picture but has since arrived is the 30 inch pvc for the gravity system the gravity a couple manholes that are part of this project and you'll see digging going on they're already starting to put their well points down to dry it up for the excavation picture the bottom of page two there you see is a look through from standing inside the dry pit that's i took that looking through the dry pit through the cord hole you can see the wet well on the outside of the structure and that is a annular space in between the two it's now since been backfilled but that is where one of the suction lines that's the third hole the third suction line hole that penetrates and comes into the dry pit where the pumps are situated so that's looking through there i'll be talking a little bit more about that here in just about half a second if you scroll to page uh number three there this is something you never want to see um in a dry pit dry pits are supposed to be dry you see some water in there so mr patel made a site visit out there last monday and noticed a good bit of water standing in the bottom and quickly inquired as to what happened that is groundwater groundwater that's made its way from outside uh the dry pit station into and what happened well when they leave for the for the weekend they typically turn off their dewatering on the outside for the wet well they did that just as normal the suction lines that come from the wet well into the dry pit there were some fittings that weren't able to be completely tightened and they were left loose they figured that the little bit of water that would trickle in through that would be a problem the sump system they had set up to accommodate any water that got in the dry pit they made the assumption that it would have no problems keeping up with it well that sump system inside the dry pit it was a series of two sump pumps daisy chained up to get it out of the that height out of the ground and up outside the dry pit area or the station it failed on them and so what happened is it filled up with water over the weekend and that's what we had it did this picture here at the top of page three the water was a good bit higher than that if you look at the picture down below you can see the witness mark the mud line the darker shade that's not paint that's the paint is supposed to be white but you can see the red stain that shows the depth of the water so the issue with that biggest issue with that obviously is the pumps those pumps are not meant to be submerged they're meant to operate in a dry environment biggest thing with the pumps is the electrical motor that drives the pumps the pumps casings and themselves not so much they're made to operate you know by nature with water the other thing you have to be concerned about with that is the drive line that connects the motor to the pump and that is an oil based bearing system um so concerns being wet with that so uh contractor you know engineer record everybody quickly jumped on top of this figure out what happened figure out what the solution forward was pump vendor got involved manufacturer everybody on board pump manufacturers hey we won't get these pumps back the contractor they arrived yesterday they're now in the hands of gorman rupp going rupts going through diagnosing what damage possibly occurred to these things and they're going to come back with a recommendation which could be anything up to including full replacement so a decision has not been made on that we're simply reporting the current current situation what's being done to provide information to make a decision so contractors fully taken responsibility of uh the incident um and uh in addressing it so we've had a lot of conversation with them here in the last time any questions on that i figured i'd open up to any questions okay moving along um count road to glencoe 12 into water main of course construction-wise nothing uh accomplished on it yet as far as construction hasn't begun yet that was an in-house design project currently water distribution is gathering they've already taken an inventory we've got about 2 500 linear feet of pipe on hand that we're going to use in this project that was left over from the previous project and we have to order the balance of the pipe and there uh mr simmons is in the process of doing that there's also a section of that pipe that's included with the sploss project being paid for out of this budget that will be bringing it down canal road correct correct that is tying into that project magnolia water improvements so we were told well the underground contractor working for the city uh this is a combined city and joint water project city being storm drainage roadways the underground contract had been focused on the storm drainage over about the last month so we were told they were going to be again back on phase two of the water on march 22nd but actually started back on the water on monday so our phase two water is back under construction phase one uh uh customers are reaping the benefits of that and uh i think we've had really really good install as far as the water goes uh joint waters portion of it on phase one and all of the customers in phase one have been tied on to the new system so all of those new services have been tied on so everyone's using the new system next project is 40 21 pump station rehab and upgrade last we spoke uh the contractor was there were some pump delays the pumps were coming over from overseas an update on the pumps now it looks like we're gonna get those a little bit sooner than so around may 1st or the first week of may we're hoping to get those pumps contractors going to mobilize within the next two weeks get bypassing on site and you can't see it uh because it's a still shot on the right there at the top of the page but one of the discharge lines uh inside the well actually has a good sized hole in it and so right now operations can't run that effectively because it simply blows water right back into the wet well and you're re-pumping it doesn't work that way or work well that way so uh timing is great on this project contractor understands that they're going to get on site as quickly as they can take our bypass pump out get theirs installed and get it going water pollution control our large project out there academy creek just had the monthly meeting yesterday monthly meeting was yesterday they have on the picture on the left they've begun to they've not begun they've completed the excavation for the sludge off-loading facility you can see them tying still there they have now poured a slab in the bottom of that on apparently it was a little bit of a trick to get the concrete trucks back in that building to actually pour that slab but they were able to figure that out moving over to the next page you've got the filters they've poured the slab for the base and they've also started forming walls and poured one of the filter walls so essentially what they've been doing for the last month is tying steel and pouring concrete so some large new structures growing up out there uh the excavation on the insult work was originally scheduled again next week found out yesterday they are going to start that april 5th they had to have their pipe crews coming from out of town and they got delayed on another project it is not going to impact project completion because that's being done by a completely separate crew then who's doing the rest of the work but they are moving right along with that project things are going well we get inspections reports from our engineer record and so things seem to be moving along quite well with that project right now i said it right with a lot of steel there's a lot of steel down there it's pretty impressive the the filter structure in the back right now what heck the excavation in the in the building for the receiving pit's pretty impressive too so all right uh pump station 4105 basin expansion force main reroute cipp it's out for bid right now just to see how people do excuse me yeah cipp portion of it is uh this is the one segment of this gravity sewer rehab uh runs underneath the exit 36 overpass and several other segments in that area in 36 base and so some critical gravity sewer rehab going on there with that hopefully we get some good bids in on that one when they come in uh next project 2002 altem avenue cipp we're trying to wrap that project up it's down to the project as far as the the uh the segments there's one segment left aligned it's under discussion whether to continue to pursue that one or not but here in these couple photos this is ipr who's our prime contractor has capital city who is their sub coming in doing this specialized defect removal which is punch list and defect when i say that when you slip these liners and invert them inside their their loose resin impregnated fill essentially um you're doing this all with the hope so the thing inserts and inflates correctly inside the pipe occasionally you have a ripple in the liner that kind of thing or a rise or something the way to address that is you send a robot in you remove that defect and then you go back in you put a short liner to bridge the gap and that's what they're doing here it was right here in front of the college club station 4006 there was a defect such as that uh capital city now interesting part of this work capital city mobilized about two weeks ago began the the work got their camera unfortunately got hung up in the defect about uh 400 feet into the pipe so uh they tried for about a week to get it dislodged and this whole time the the uh that segment of gravity is in bypass you can see in these pictures looking northward and that's altama to the left looking north where you can see that pipe that is the bypass pipe that's pumping the waste water to station 4006. that's a picture of the camera that got stuck there on the front that red portion that's the wand or the uh the actual cutter head it's a water jet um hits it out with so much such high psi that can actually he's got caught on that broken pipe sir you got caught on that broken pipe no sir that's that's a piece of what the pipe that's vcp pipe actually right there as you can tell and i think there's a piece of brick off the side we're not sure if that came out of the defect or if that came from upstream once you line these pipes so you can see we think the camera got caught on the the fold in the actual liner yeah i've got a picture matter of fact since we're talking about it let me jump down to it what's that defect doing in there what's that what's the pipe doing in that line that's a line pipe we've lined it it was from upstream obviously when we jetted it previously pushed it down into one of the segments that was wasn't being lined it set settled out there and then when we got the flow back to it it pushed it back down so that was likely from one of the upstream segments that got lined so when they cut out a defect and you say put in another piece of the liner is that like putting a stent in there exactly exactly what it is yeah okay and then they use where they use the hot water to cure it also just spraying surface spray or since it's a short section when they mix it on site it's it's reacting it's just like so they just kind of get it in place and they'll get it in place you know they have a little bit of working time they get it in place they inflate the plug spreads it out presses it hard against the host liners so this is a picture of the camera actually where it's stuck um you know unfortunate accident these things these things happen uh but here's the defect they were cutting out and it's kind of difficult to see this is the camera itself and its will actually drop down in to the defect and we think probably where the pipe just what we were repairing right there the hose pipe was fractured will drop down into fracture and got hung up they have tried everything coming both directions hooks and all this kind of stuff and uh you think man just hook it to the bumper of the truck and pull but that's uh that's some expensive equipment uh down in there so it was 400 feet in you said yes or approximately so um that's about 35 feet from the other end from the other right right right there yeah they almost almost made it unfortunately you have to go in one way um and uh since we're right here i'll show you um this is what capital city decided as a solution um using industrial divers so it's not really a diving situation it's a supplied air situation more than anything in a confined space because you can imagine this 24 inch diameter sewer pipe that these brave souls are inserting themselves into so they've gone in there and the good news is they've already cleared one defect and they're at the uh they made it up to the camera now so they're working on dislodging the camera now songs that been in there a week now a little over a week they have been working very hard and it's a full-on diving operation for sure but you see the the hoses off the side different colored hoses that's the air supply lines so you can imagine the this is a highly specialized and highly you got to know what you're doing to say it lightly everything was vetted very carefully albeit there they are capital city and ipr sub not our sub we are not contracted with them but we ensured that we had uh sufficient uh right of entry documentation and hold harmless agreements and were also named on their insurance and our illegal folks are very satisfied that this type of operation i presume they went in the short end yes first yes correct well that makes sense doesn't it yeah because the other end is occluded with cable and other stuff exactly it's only 20 it's 24 inch switch we've been told is the same size as a standard mri machine i was going to say it's like getting an mri practically but you get to move in this one i don't know you can't move much in there no no just kind of shimmy did they ride in on a little trolley type thing yeah yeah creeper yeah yeah and it's uh you know by the time you put a dry seat on all this other stuff and the hard hat uh boy yeah very little room and those guys are you know they're working with their hands in front of them with their pneumatic tools and hand tools at times so but anyway uh sometimes there's there's not much other way it always goes yeah it happens uh hey it's how we react to it and how we uh handle it learn from it so but you're satisfied with the reaction from that from our content from the contractor absolutely and it's uh it's they made the call it was you know to do this in fact we slowed down their reaction making sure we had everything we needed for them to go in that line they were ready to go in their end of last week so so uh that's one thing about this job you learn something new every single day so uh but i i you know you feel bad for these guys very professional outfit just stuff happens so uh see palms so that project is wrapped up except for one punch list the same crew had just gone over to see palms to work on those remaining punchless items on the same liner project uh you can see from left that's uh the post or priest excuse me with the defect this is one segment where uh an unknown grinder station was tied in actually of course kicked on when they were trying to do their liner it would have been relieved anyway at some point but kicked on and bulged the liner causing defect and then you can see to the right that's the post defect repair much better situation with the final result there and oh to answer your question here's a good picture of it showing an answer that's how they're mixing the the short liner on site so they mix up the the resin saturate it on site put it on top of their plug and uh draw it through the pipe and do their their stent so interesting process coastal club departments 4059 is next project 2005. so that project was incorporated into a conference of agreement as part of that 40 59 was going to get upgraded by the developer they're going to handle all the contracting directly with the contractor to do that and we understand that they are signing the contract with them and looking for a uh mobilization date from those folks but that one we wrapped up we're assuming by august here should be sooner than that bergen woods off-site force main we tied that one to the pump station 4116 rehab which is out for bid right now we just had our pre-bid meeting yesterday a handful of contractors six or seven prime contractors they're in attendance so seem to be interested in that product so uh hopefully we'll get get a good bid on there and of note of this project is that this will serve the safety complex glenn county safety complex multiple users in there gdot everybody else but what is under construction now is glenn county animal control so they'll be served by this pump station as well at the theoretically at the april meeting there will be a mou brought forth where we will manage the project and then build glenn county for the construction that's ongoing similar the way glenn county does he speak east peace and democracy and the village project for us last year this is our specialty not theirs so we'll do the pump station work and they'll just pay for it another in-house design designed this pump station in-house glenn county provided the survey work so it worked out pretty well all right c palms east waterline rehab has not kicked off yet i know distribution is coordinating to do that he's getting pricing on boring underneath frederico correct oak grove force maine formerly had 4132 pump station improvements to it but will likely just manifold that project they're still going through their permitting uh on the actual construction of those residences but as part of that they have a conference agreement with joint water to run the force main to serve that development on oak river island so we've been through several iterations of design review with them all right print street elevated stories tank and after this we'll talk about demary so if you've come over the bridge you've been downtown off print street you've probably noticed the curtain hanging around print street elevated storage tanks you wonder what it is behind the magic curtain that's what they're doing they're they're blasting it down to white metal or down to bare metal prepping the surface for repaint and they're done with a blasting nail priming almost complete inside the tank is blasted and primed and they're they're going to wrap this tank up pretty quickly the this one's going to get the logo the city logo city chose the logo that's going to go on there so it's going to be kind of coming over the bridge you off the distance hopefully be able to see that pretty well uh they've got some tight inspection on there from our one of our juniors i see you expanding the staff there that's a special request when i get to pick mr klein up from school he wants to go around and see what's going on with projects and no safety issues at the tank at all no safety issues thank you for your remarks when this project got kicked off and uh from what you shared with that from your previous experiences we hammered at home with these right folks yeah and uh we have seen no safety issues right they have the pretty good practices they meet before they do anything beginning the day all appearances yes they're operating safely as far as we've we have seen any feedback from the neighbors zero feedback from the neighbors zero feedback kind of wanted because that that's on a small lot right next door to little houses so it's yeah i think contracts are done very well with their staging their lay down it must be and they must be the neighbors aren't complaining yeah we we have some very good neighbors very good neighbors out there very understanding well they're probably waiting for the unveiling so gonna be happy there uh let's see so uh in tandem with that project is denver street yeah well denmark uh on st simon's elevated storage tank that one is uh underway now as well they mobilize a second crew same contractor mobilized the second crew over the beginning on that they've already done the pressure washer on the outside they're blasting and priming on the inside now now they're not going to hang a curtain on this one they're going to use a paint system called dry fall and it's just a type of paint by the time it sprays and any back splatter over spray anything like that it dries within seconds so it just simply falls to the ground so wait to see how that i don't know if you get drift or you get anything like that let's see so but anyway it's the industry standard type paint so if they were to blast this one they they definitely would have hung a curtain but uh it's a good thing with this because there are antenna everything like that we do lease this out for antenna space so with no curtain works out well so that one is underway as well horse lane replacement for 2002 engineering is just about done no i'm expecting to get the 90 into this week first next week and so we have located the exact connection point so we will have to open cut demori to make the tie in so that'll be night work but moving along pretty good they're going to be a slow it's 1300 foot of pipe that sounds like it should go pretty quickly but they're going to have to open cut the whole way through and it is very tight along arnold road so it's going to take a little longer than what it may seem it should take to put 1300 foot of pipe in the ground but presumably they're going to plate it most of the way either that or dig a short section and cover every single night okay back fill it backfill it every night we looked at boring it but uh there's so much in the ground right there we figured we'd rip more stuff out of the ground trying to bore it than we would do trying to open cut it all right moving along arco we talked about it before uh so designs gotta check i haven't seen the submittals yet we're supposed to get them friday yep is when we actually are on on a road you may want to have some discussion with them about their stop work at the end of the day and how they leave the site particularly as you um approach the five o'clock hour right because that's kind of like restaurant road right around in that area it gets really congested there so just thinking safety of the workers equipment parking and that sort of thing another thing we've got to consider there is depending on when we accept bids on this project obviously we're going to have to not work during the major holiday weekends and yeah things of that nature to avoid causing significant disruption so it may be a little bit of a start stop yeah project right okay after arco community road server expansion so uh we did get back i believe we got back since the project was or since this update was written 90 uh with under review of that so a lot of interest in this area obviously commercial and then we're looking at the funding for construction galvanized replacement system-wide self-performed you can see some of the we always try to get some shots the good stuff coming out of the ground uh some iron pipe there to the right or to the left and you can see the big pile iron coming out what's the largest size of galvanized pipe we've replaced two inches the biggest we've replaced thus far of galvanized and are we replacing some of the service line to the meter also we are replacing all the surface lines to the meter that are tied to the galvanized okay let's put they're putting all one in there all one-hit services um off of the even if it's a three-quarter inch meter we're putting one-inch services and reducing it okay standardizing all right and are we uh talking to the property owner about their own line too we do we tell them that when they tie on when we tie that system on they may develop leaks on their side if they're having galvanized or if they don't see increased water pressure it likely is a defect on their side we always flush the meter out to make sure it's clean at the meter we have in a couple of scenarios customers have noticed leaks showing up almost immediately after we tied on because of higher pressure just cause the pressure was so much harder they're telling them this knocking on doors there's always somebody there not always somebody there but you know usually there's enough people in the neighborhood that the word gets around to the people that weren't there while we were there should we be leaving a leaflet or something we can it wouldn't be too hard to get printed up yeah we did have one that had their irrigation system tied on they had to adjust their sprinkler system because they were watering the road after we got through there a little more pressure i'm sure we're selling more water there's it's just another picture there to the looks like we've got some inspector trainees there yes inspector trainees see that working here is a family fair man after our stuff you have to bring the family along um we've been along the 118 119 that was the in-house project done by systems public maintenance 119 is complete and 118 is 90 95 complete got a little site work to do dressing it up a little bit and have an issue with one of the pumps from the manufacturer manufacturers been down looking at it trying to determine steps forward with that but doing a lot better we added de-agger functions to these with vfds so previously we were pulling these pumps two to three times a week and the ones at 41.19 haven't been pulled in over three weeks so reduction in staff requirements there now we're going to put uh green barrier on those fences around there or something or what are we going to do how do we because now i'm seeing when you see some pump station like i'm 17 we got the wood wood fence i think a 118 we're not going to do anything because it's back in the woods 119 just currently don't have anything on there but we could add the green screen fencing if you prefer i mean i just wonder what we're doing do we have a standard now but it's uh more about location if it's in a neighborhood usually we try to tuck it away a little bit if it's on the side of a major highway maybe not always on the floor on 41 40 48 on 17 i'm not really sure where why a wooden fence was chosen there but uh yeah it was a preference it was operations preference they felt it was easy to repair and stain and keep keep looking good i'm not sure it's been stained it's not looking very good now and on these i'm concerned about these as far as being target practice if they're in remote areas target practice remote areas that is true yeah our generator out backs got a nice hole in it when it was at the end of the spur so i mean we need to think about that yes sir out of sight out of mind is that the idea of fencing around it i don't understand why people do that but it's awful tempting to some for some reason okay go back up to the one above that facility construction the march knee okay failed six inch duct line pipe connected to a galvanized pipe removed on kelvin grove drive was that a six inch galvanized pipe too no six inch iron this is one that blew out uh this is the kelvin grove blowout well that pipe didn't blow out this is the valve replacement um when we had a blowout near bloody marsh we went back to try to shut the system off and could not shut it off so we ended up having to shut down a much larger area so we went back in dug down and replaced the valve when we were in there replacing the valve we had to excavate a bit more pipe than we were expecting to find something we could actually tie back to so the valve failed the six inch duct line pipe didn't fail right that's correct okay okay master plan update um looks like the full or the uh the final you'll get printed copies of it tomorrow to look through the final version final presentation someone water line replacement uh that one is 100 complete so this will be falling off the list here and that was replacing a four inch or six inch or something it was replacing a four inch connecting two sections of eight inch together uses some of the improvements put in on l street that's correct yes that's neat uh meter replacements we are well as of lunchtime today we had just crossed the 2100 meter mark we started doing some one and a half and two inch meters uh i think we've got about 15 of those done so the vast majority of them still three quarter inch and one inch meters but uh projects go along very well and you know a couple of minor leaks show up where the things didn't get tightened down all the way during the media replacement but they've been working along triggers in all in those areas and we are scheduling for the first of the large meter replacements um early april we're working with the hospital they'll be the first meters that get replaced out there they have an eight and two six inch meters so we can go ahead and get all three of those taken care of in one week but things are going along well there we have notified a handful of customers already that when we put the new meters on there they did have a small leak that previously wasn't being detected so we can call them and tell them they've had continuous usage a couple of them have argued with us that they did not have a week but 30 days later they would get the bill found out they did have a week so a lot of what has been replaced thus far has actually been the meters with the registers that were not transmitting the digital registers failed and you can't manually read a digital register if it's not working so they've been getting minimum bills so now they were getting actual usage bills but we've had conversations with several of those customers and thus far they may not be pleased about it but they're understanding that their bill will be increasing can you zoom in that picture a little bit on the left yeah oh that would be great ah there we go it might pixelate a little bit here well oh on the left i'm sorry on the left yes this is much more interesting than the box of scraps wow that's just a bit yeah yeah very nice yeah one thought came to mind is as we're now able to notify our customers soon if there's we determine a constant usage we may want to review our policy for leak adjustment because currently the ones that we typically see have had a high bill for two or three months and i think it'd be appropriate for us to revisit that when we've had it now we've got much shorter notice that we can provide to them and they can engage quicker and quite frankly that reduces the subsidia that we put on the rest of our customers for absolutely water consumption that's forgiven and sewer for that matter absolutely existing meters though when they ride by and they get a different reading than normal it alerts the guy in the radio read meters not that they upload once they upload the readings it will go to the billing system and we can get indication at that point because the usage is higher but it's that's 30 days worth of usage i thought radio read meters that would go by and it's different than a certain amount it'll automatically so then go back by and read it again or something they will do that yeah so we'd have to go re-read them to confirm but um obviously we only go by once every 30 days so if they had a leak that showed up three days after the last reading they've used a lot of water we'll be able to notify everybody within 24 hours you know the park's only 37 complete that that's it's more complete with that that's where the billing percentage is right we base that off the uh pay apps and the you know the five of the five of the seven streets in there are completed okay so what's that seventy percent sixty percent something like that and are the automatic transfer switches have we awarded that contract contract is out for bid right now expected back i believe well it's going to talk to you all but that is due back the tuesday before the next meeting obviously i will not be able to provide you with preliminary information for a bid that's due back the day before the meeting but fema would like us to move forward with that as quickly as possible so we need to so i may uh may be bringing that to you late tuesday night uh for your review for a wednesday meeting and when we're going to be able to take bids on the generators with our electrical engineer now on spacing all the generators out so i don't have a date on that one yet he's got to come down do site visits and confirm everything well that concludes the my section of the capital report there i'll stay here and answer any questions as you go through this and we'll say on the earned value earned value report which printed a little weird this month overall the schedule is improving not rapidly but it is improving we were in the 0.5 range a couple of months ago 20 improvement 20 improvement now some of that is because the two large projects that we kicked off with academy creek and the meter project are both going very well still running ahead of cost most of that being associated with some of these tank projects and galvanized projects that have not been that a lot of work has been done but not a lot of bills have been sent in on and then of course the overall performance index is a 0.84 indicating we're about 16 percent ahead of schedule good the only other thing i will say is we've had about four waters this week which seems excessive um every one of them was from a contractor digging through a line from a contractor digging through one of our lines so any commissioners have any comments none meetings adjourned thank you let's pull up that meter map", "BKzABGkE06E": "hello

march i haven't done one of these for a little while so i thought i would get back on the old guide vlog program here mainly for elliot brass because if i don't show him what to do out here he doesn't know what what's going on this one's for you buddy i'm just going to run through and do something that i have kind of done yet and just go through some some tips and some tactics on how to fish skinny water on a bright sunny day which is kind of what we have today um it's kind of overcast a little bit but what we deal with this time of year in early march is uh a lot of really low water systems that we're fishing here on the in the pacific northwest they are all glacier-fed rain-fed snow-fed so we're kind of at the mercy of freezing levels when the freezing level is low there's no water coming into the system so everything is tight tightens up um it makes for tricky fishing and so what i thought i'd do today is uh run through a few skinny water tips here and maybe get something out of it maybe you don't here we go starting off here gear wise these are the two rods that i really fish the most in the spring pureway 600 rod here i haven't set up yet spooled up with a islander 4.0 um this is a 600 so this is sort of my go-to steelhead salmon rod and this is the rod i'm gonna fish today it's a pirouette 510 510 is the grain weight and i got an islander lx 3.8 on here this is a this is a nice rod for sort of bull trout fishing um fishing some smaller stuff so that this is the rod i'm going to fish today so we've got skagit line on there skagit short and then what i get asked the most is what tip do we use so what sink tip do we use i run sort of only two tips and they're both imo tips it's a five and five t11 or a five and five t8 and you might think that's light but that's just just what we fish here we're not really targeting fish in any more than usually two or three feet of water so this system will go get down to it if you're curious about what a tip is and i don't know if you can see that on here but so this says five slash five t8 which is telling you that it has five feet of floating line and then five feet of sinking line if you're ever curious what a fly line is and you just don't know fly lines at all anything that's light in color is always gonna float so yellow or white light blue is always gonna float and anything that's dark is always going to sink i'm usually not fishing deep water i'm trying to i'm trying to swing that fly into shallow water um and fish fish as shallow spots as i can without getting hung up if you move to a 10 like a straight 10 foot sink tip or you move to a heavier tip like a t14 you'll find yourself on bottom a lot it gets a little frustrating and a lot of the time what we're trying to do is we're trying to swing this fly into the shallowest water possible and see if there's a fish in here so this system seems to do it there's not really any reason to fish anything anything heavier than that these fish are feeding looking up or they're going to hit something that they're going to look up at so if if you can swing this stuff through shallow water that's sort of key for skinny water fishing and then the other key is just dumb down your leader a little bit and the trout guys are going to laugh but 12 pounds straight 12 pound for us is dumbing it down out here when we get a little bit more colored conditions we can move up to a 15 pound leader but like four or five straight feet of uh of 12 pound maximum is is my go-to if you just run it through your thumb like this you'll straighten your leader out it kind of heats it up and gets a little bit more pliable and then with this loop system here and this is this one's this one's getting pretty worn out with this is tie a figure eight on a bite the knot that i found just works the best it holds best you guys will fish perfection loop whatever else but that's kind of the go-to clean up your tag end and don't throw this on the ground it seems minimal but this is something that just all good anglers should take that throw in your waders don't don't spit it out on the ground and then with this little loop system here most people know how it works but if you don't this is your tip right here your leader material over the tip and then this section where your fly is going to go in a minute is going to come through and then you got a nice sort of system nice and strong check your knots right that's the one thing you want to do is just give it give it a little pull test always um i will pop probably one out of like six or seven knots just sort of the way it is and then fly selection i'm gonna fish because i'm fishing this eight and type eight which is a really slow sinking line i'm gonna fish like a little bit of a of a heavier fly but i'm going to fish something small i find that if you fish really big stuff when the water is low clear and sunny the fish will actually swim off of it i've watched i've watched fish sit there and swim off of it so just find a bug here my fly box a little bit of a mess but i'm running a little light on flies but i tied a whole pile of these and this is uh this is this is kind of one of my go-to patterns in the spring out here um call it the mr march but it's uh it's a fly pattern nut seems to work out here you get all kind of things eating it there's number one we always check that our barbs are crimped and i'm just going to run a little loop knot here well if you don't know what a loop knot is the loop knot lets your fly kind of swing a little bit just gives it a little bit more action in the water clean up your tag it's kind of going to look like that you can see how it how it moves around a little bit on there uh what else do i got to tell you not much that's pretty easy right um and then we'll just kind of run through i'll show you why we fish this t8 why we fish this light line and uh try to give you a few tips as we uh as we go through and fish some of this water so what i'm doing with this light tip and and i mean it's a weighted fly but it's not it doesn't have a ton of weight to it what i'm trying to do is when i'm fishing this run i'm trying to throw a big long cast out i'm trying to throw a mend into it right away and then i'm gonna i'm gonna high stick it and what i mean by high sticking it is i'm going to toss that line out i'm going to throw that big mend into it and then i'm just going to get everything as much as i can up off of the water and what i'm trying to do is just have my skagit head kind of floating out there with my tip coming off of it and then my fly as my line comes around i'm going to put a little mend into it and that's because i'm fishing that light tip light fly and i'm just trying to get it down so as it comes around you can put more than one men into it a men just means to fix so i'm not mending it to do anything except slow that fly down and get it to sink a little bit as it comes around everything starts dying on the inside so now i don't have the same flow and i'm also shallowing up so as that line comes around i'm just gonna start picking it up so i got this running line in my hand and i'm just starting to pick it up and the only reason is i'm not trying to put action on the fly i'm just trying to keep that fly in the water column and not not hanging up on bottom the closer you can fish any of these flies to the bank the better off you are you will find fish that live on the bank so don't always think that these fish are way out in the middle and the only place you might find one is way out there is a lot of the time is you'll get those fish coming and grabbing on the hang so when that flaw when that fly line comes around starts to slow down you still have your sink tip and your skagit head and your four feet of leader and your fly that are still swinging around and very often in this kind of fishing you will find those fish sitting on the hang which are right down below you up against the bank that's why we're fishing this this uh light kit too so i can fish it into the bank as much as possible if you can fish with those lighter tips and those lighter flies a little deeper into the tail outs very often you can sort of see in here there's some big rocks in there and very often on these low clear conditions you'll get a fish that is going to come back and instead of living sort of up in the in the normal part of where you would think it would be very often they'll push back into this stuff right here a little faster moving shallower and the fact that they have a little bit of protection is a good thing [Applause] that is as skinny water fishing as you want to do so skinny that i actually just pop my head off that is my skagit head i popped the skagit head off in a bunch of nugs so hopefully he got something out of the day um if nothing else you gotta laugh haven't done that before um but yeah skinny water light tips lighter flies dummy down your leader just a little bit 10 or 12 pound test and uh fish fast fish through all the stuff that you think might be efficient fish through it fast if they're not going to eat it they're not going to eat it so or they're not home and fish into tail outs like i just did and um fish where there's a little bit of protection so swing that fly into in a spot where there's shadow or it's maybe a little deeper there's some big nuggets and um that is the pro tips right there thanks for uh checking out i'll try to run a few more of these over the next little bit and uh hope everyone's staying safe and being awesome and uh thanks for watching", "Ue7w0QLRUZM": "you [Music] team match let's go cover me [Applause] great cheap doesn't have a lot of time left nice shot blue team victory", "tWkimXi67ec": "good day friends of buzzy and for our new podcast listeners hello this is our first live podcast and this is the first time where we're going to be talking about what is in the pipeline for pain care labs those of you who have been following us we are a company that is all women woman owned and we make devices that use mechanical stimulation mechanical stimulation is what some people would have called vibration about 10 years ago but now we know that there's a very specific way that you can use mechanical stimulation to block pain it's kind of like noise canceling headphones in that if you have exactly the right frequency and you know the frequency of the pain that's coming out you can stop pain like rubbing a bumped elbow so today i'm going to talk about the new products that we have on the horizon and the exciting new developments in the past two or three weeks first of all you'll know that our initial device buzzy is a very high frequency little bee guy here's one with a mask for cobin covent but it's a very high frequency device that has a motor that gives the right frequency to cancel pain at the bottom now about five years ago we made the vibracool devices which were essentially a buzzy vibration unit which is curved to fit around the joint that has problems but made to fit inside a pocket with a compression unit turns out that ice doesn't work as well for pain in clinical studies unless it's combined with a compression unit what we did was we took the vibration part or mechanical stimulation part of buzzy and we added to it the ice part in a compression pack so that many of you know and love as fiber cool so what we have done most recently and just got them so there's a bunch of research that's out now and so here's a vibra cool with the 28 inch compression strap for knee pain it turns out that there are different frequencies that are better for pain blocking and different frequencies that are better for increasing the muscle frequency is about 100 hertz the pain frequency is about 200 so what we have done is we have created something called the vibracool pro we have a number of these that are better shaped to fit on knees and embraces these are actually put together and i'm showing the camera now to go to france because there are a couple doctors in france using 100 hertz so we've created these for them to experiment with and available soon to patients in the u.s we have the vibracool pro 200 for paint what we're doing with it is we're taking that same frequency and putting it in two places so instead of just having the compression cuff with the device in it what we're doing is taking the compression cuff that has one unit we're putting a it's called stereotactic but a second unit on the compression strap and then making it so you can put two of them together so after limb surgery after knee surgery for elbow tendinopathies we've got these two that are coming out and so the vibracool pro units should be available by mid-year we have just sent the tooling information to our manufacturers and so these will be coming out soon and right now we're talking to doctors who are putting together protocols to research these for opioid reduction there's an opioid reduction grant that just came out from ahrq that we're going to be sending around with the idea being that if you can be discharged from the hospital after a knee surgery after an acl reconstruction after uh tendinopathy or elbow repair total knee replacement hip replacement that if you can be discharged with something that you can control the pain of that works that this could be covered by insurance and that it can decrease the amount of opioids that you need to be sent home with so to that end another new thing that's in the pipeline is a viral professional kit so these kits of which you can see a nice little prototype now these kits have not only a 100 and 200 hertz unit for recovery and for pain but also ways to clean them for patients between between patients for covet and a really long strap like a theraband so that doctors can try them on patients without having to dispense one unit per patient so this vibral professional kit we have 10 of now and these we are distributing to the physicians that are doing the research on the opioid reduction and finally for our new stuff um as many of you know we started a few years ago 2016 with an indiegogo campaign for a low back pain device not only did this one swedish guy find that high frequency vibration decreased pain but also when it was used in a back plate for about 20 minutes it could cause decreased pain for between 6 and 24 hours so we started by making a plate that looked like this and we tested this one we got an nih grant which we're doing right now and so this was the first one with three different vibration units put on the back so this is what science looks like people that's the device that we started with and so there are a lot of interesting things about vibration that we're learning and looking at for how to best address the nerves in the low back and where we are now is we've got a fancier version of it and just if you want to see what the inside of science looks like so here is a three motor device on the back of a metal plate that's about six inches by eight inches so these motors together with a hot or cold pack against the back are then put into a new we're calling it do a therm we may change the name but right now so the duotherm has eight different frequency patterns so that we can test and see if there are different frequencies and combinations of frequencies that do better for that prolonged low back pain that was first described and the fun information is that this week we sent one of our 10 prototypes to a patient who was so excited about do a therm she's been waiting for duotherm since we did the indiegogo campaign and said she didn't care if it was a delayed outcome or if there was another new one she wanted one now she could get it so we sent it and her email was omg i have tried everything tens and soothy packs and ice and this works better than anything so that is very exciting so these are the things that we are working on at pain care labs we are sending out our week or monthly letters to people on our email list so if you sign up at paincarelabs.com you'll get a monthly letter from me talking about what we're up to at pain care labs and thoughts about what it's like to have a small business and to run one of these times if there are any questions about anything related to painkiller labs stimulation new products when you can expect new products and what we have in the pipeline drop me a note leave us a message and i will be back in a short period of time answering any questions on coven but wanted to give a paincare labs update thank you so much and it's going to be fine", "ICxkjCW_NBg": "hi guys welcome welcome welcome back to my channel guys hi

everything seems to be good in an order now happy happy monday nope not everything is in order quite yet who's ready who's ready for a bill today it's going to be a good build you know it's funny it's like i think of this build sometimes like especially when i just kind of put parts together and oh blue moo dropping the 10 community subs already thank you very much for that buddy uh i'm gonna get that level five hype train already man um i uh i always know when i put builds together like this these are like optimally like optimal builds right like just really nice super clean optimal builds um that are just going to come together nicely and anytime that you compare you like pair like asus and corsair outside of us using a z73 like outside anything you do you asus and corsair like you know that you're gonna end up with something that's that's gonna look great so this is gonna be one of those like just nice primo builds that's gonna kind of come out of the the whole thing but enough about that let's let's get started my name is justin roby welcome to roby tech the show where we build pcs we do dad jokes we play around we have a good time and you know all in all it's like it's just it's just a good way to kick off the week we had so much fun on friday i hope a lot of you got a lot of sleep because we played that game way too long uh but at the same time hashtag i mean exclamation point vikings am i right 320 installs on friday and now we have a new tradition of being able to play some games right here in the studio on friday we're going to be using that n7 that n7

about the giveaway since we have a minute and 59 seconds left um the first and foremost we have two giveaways that always happen on the show the first one is when we get to uh two level five hype trains which we're already done we get two of those we give away a 250 gig nvme ssd uh and then if we get a uh if we get 700 likes on the youtube video uh then we'll also give away another 250 gig nvme ssd so there's two 250 gigabytes and then finally down there you see that 34 out of 50. if we get to 50 subs we give away a 50 new gift card get to 100 subs it comes 100 new a gift card 150 something comes 150 new a gift card and then it goes on and on and on and upgrades is better and better and better we've given all the way up to like 30 80s away um which has been uh which has been super crazy and a lot a lot of fun and then finally we have the sub only giveaway for the month of march which we're giving away two 30 70s to two lucky subs here on twitch you gotta be subscribed on twitch so if we're on youtube.com rubytech or twitch.tv pop on over to twitch.tv rubytech drop your free prime subscription if you have amazon prime you've got a free subscription you might walk away with the gpu now if you want to get extra entries to that you can do things like gift subs like blue moo did and so many others do you can also do things like you can also subscribe to tier two tier three that gives you the most in terms of extra entries and then finally the last one is that uh you can subscribe for multiple uh multiple months in a row all of our rules all of our legal legal legal legalese is all up on discord if you want to get all the information on that how we basically make all that stuff happen and then where it is and all that sort of stuff um so yeah that's that's all the deals for how the giveaways work we're not giving this pc away i know we're still going to get a million questions because everyone's going to pop in and be like hey are you giving this pc away no we do however are giving away the carter pc which you're gonna start seeing the links for that here in just a second that pc giveaway is still happening we're giving it's got an msi gaming s trio 3080 in it it's an overall super just beastly machine with a 10-700k i think is what's in there um so that pc is currently active that giveaway is currently active so if you do want to win a pc we have that one coming up and then we have the intel rocket lake pc giveaway coming up in april so we got lots and lots of giveaways coming up um so even for pcs we try to give away at least a pc per month so really good stuff we got some really cool awesome ones including some like white zotac i know there's a couple zotec fans there who who are going to want to get in on the the zotac stuff we're gonna get we got some a pretty cool uh cooler master zotac theme build that's coming up as well so some really neat giveaways coming up and this should be a lot of fun um some pc giveaways as well um i i was telling my son this joke because we were watching the show turbo so here's your uh your first dad joke for the day um so uh this this guy is sitting there he's basically chilling in his he's chilling in his house just like eating some like eating some chips watching some you know uh he's watching some expanse right he's a big sci-fi fan so anyway all of a sudden he hears a knock on the door he pauses for a minute and then the never said he hears the knock again he's like oh man i wonder who that is he walks up and opens the door and down on the floor is the snail snail kind of looks up at him so the guy looks down picks up the snail and throws it as hard as he can closes the door like four weeks later he gets another knock on the door he's like what he's like who's knocking on the door he's like nobody visits me so finally opens the door snail's there and he says the snail looks up and says what the heck did you do that for [Laughter] because he's a snail okay hopefully you guys get that some of you guys don't know if you're gonna be able to follow along with that joke yes i got a haircut i yeah there we go there laugh out loud there yeah we got a couple people are starting to get that um right there so uh yeah that's uh that's what's going on so let's talk about what's happening on today's build uh today's build we are having uh it's gonna be an awesome build uh we're building in the corsair 5000d uh for uh for this particular uh build we are building this is a commission build uh and uh commission build for mr heaven's phantom over on discord i don't know his twitch information or anything like that i don't know if he's on twitch in youtube but it's for heaven's phantom we're going to be building a pc for him today and so uh it's got all the bells and whistles of course obviously getting 30 80s is been extremely tough and we're going to talk about the pc parts yesterday but the stuff that i've been the part that i'm excited about for using in this building i think is going to look really good we haven't got to put this in a corsair 5000d is the strix 3070 right so such a great card i just really love the way the strix cards look um and they're just they're just amazing looking cards we got to use the white 3070 and the valentine's build which is now owned by intel by the way so you guys are going to see some videos with intel having that show up but yeah it's a it's a it's a great gpu and i'm really excited about getting to use this in today's show now before i get too far this is a sponsored stream don't worry you don't have to watch me play a game a really weird game for three hours this is an easy one but it's from our guys cdk deals you guys know the drills cdk deals one of the most expensive parts uh any time when i buy pcs or whatever it was is a lot of people are like okay i've spent like fifty thousand dollars on this pc i now need to install windows man it's a hundred and twenty dollars well luckily you are in luck my friends because one of the things that i have done is i've done a bunch of research uh as a tech tuber we get a lot of offers for a bunch of what are called cd key resellers and the some of these resellers they sell gray market stuff and i didn't want to do anything like that just given my history with um with uh working at microsoft et cetera i wanted to have something that was a little bit more legit and this company jumped through some massive hoops to prove to me that what they were selling was legitimate so uh let's just take a look here at cdk deals um you know they many of you if you guys have questions like hey is this something that is legit like have is this something that can actually work that's weird that the let me fix the the thing's not quite lined up here hold on uh uh it's not dang it this is not what i need right now i was on a roll there's stuff happening and i need okay i'm gonna uh anyway okay so we're just gonna keep going with it so anyway if you go to cek deals check this out if you go to windows 10 pro i don't know why this is so wacky but if we go to windows 10 pro you'll see here that um you know usually it's 119 uh for uh a windows 10 pro uh key and so these guys sell it for 19.72 so 19.72 is a quite a significant uh quite significantly less than what you would pay for uh what you would pay for a typical um copy of windows so uh what we can do here though is if you go ahead and hit add this to cart someone hit buy now and then you can go from here you see this down here it says promotional code all you got to do is hit rb 20 and you get an additional 20 off and there it is right there so now you're 15.78 uh down from what's essentially 120 and you end up with a pretty pretty inexpensive uh windows 10 key now these guys are legit we've had a couple people i think we've had one maybe more than that um but here you can take a look at my purchase orders you can actually see that i've actually purchased uh keys from them in the past i don't i don't need a lot of keys but yeah it's uh it's it's a pretty cool program it's a pretty cool program uh saves you some money um and uh gets you uh get you uh windows uh for a very uh inexpensive price now the thing is is like i said there's a couple people who've actually had issues with these guys their customer service was on point to get them to get them squared away um and uh basically uh got people uh got people uh new keys if they had an issue or whatever it was and again they went through a bunch of hoops to prove to me that they were buying keys legitly from as an oem partner etc so that's what's going on there if you have questions just ask in chat there's a ton of people who've purchased keys from them who are here in chat there's over 750 people here right now 730 people right now and so if you just have questions just put it up some people bought uh office some people bought windows so there's a lot of stuff so you can just get that information uh just right from here inside so cdk dales cdk deals give it a go check it out i'm worth worth uh worth giving it a a look-see um and let's talk about parts oh the vikings code is still up 327 to 320. man what did what a day that was um i did want to remind you guys we are 10 away from the 50 new a gift card love to see about getting a gpu away today if that's awful now i do want to talk about something something near and dear to my heart and then we'll start talking about parts so um i know a lot of you guys are asking roby the february it's now almost the middle of march it is the middle of march and we still don't have a winner for the february uh sub only giveaway well um i i've told you guys a little bit about what happened there uh thanks to the awesome people psycho cdkcc and vega they essentially gave so many subs that it broke the algorithm that does all of the choosing for our stuff right like we never it wasn't something that we were expecting to do so our coder guy who did all that stuff has been reworking on the algorithm and the code that does all the picking and so much so that what we thought was going to be an easy fix is ending up being a complete rewrite of the whole thing so what was supposed to be like a week-long endeavor has turned into a much longer endeavor and he is working as hard as he can to get it chosen and fixed so um guys we promise this won't be something that will happen on a consistent basis but a huge shout out to psycho and to uh basically vega and uh this to all of the others who are such incredible supporters that we had to it broke our tools um in terms in order to select people so we will get it fixed we will select the winner um he expects to be able to do it on friday um he just wants to make sure he gets time and contest and stuff like that and so we can get it out so uh other people people are asking questions about the merch news um the merch has been ordered the merch is showing up uh there has been some delays um it's just basically a day for day slip i know people are expecting to be able to buy it today it's a day for day slip uh in terms of when merch is going to be available i will wear some probably this week uh maybe next week at the latest so you guys can basically start seeing some of the shirts and the jackets and stuff that is coming out um but uh it will be available sometime between now and like april 1st uh is the expectation so i will make sure that i give you guys tons of heads up it will be coming in waves because we know there's a lot of demand unfortunately like it just because we're running it like a full store the thing that you guys need to be aware is that more than likely it will it will come up and then a lot of it will sell out we will have consistent orders coming through uh so that way you guys can basically get a hold of things like the build mats also things like the t-shirts we have some really great t-shirts if you if you want to see them they're up on discord we have a really neat beard comb one that's going to be displayed here in the next couple days so should be really really good sorry for the delay guys it's just one again some of that stuff was uh because the midwest stuff and then some of it's just coveted so yep it's getting uh it's it's getting lined up it's gonna be good so we got merch coming pretty soon and then psychos dropping 10 gifted subs right there so uh just just another salt in the wound for those of us no i'm just kidding psycho is amazing so appreciate you psycho uh i did want to talk um uh there are people psycho vega um some other of you who i did want to remind you i meant to text you today today was just kind of a weird day but we are super close to 10 11th gen intel uh rocket lake stuff and i just want to know if you guys want to wait to see if you want to see what the rocket lake details end up being before you make a commitment in terms of your builds i know a lot of people are waiting for their builds to basically get done but we're so close now to rocket lake uh that want to know if you wait so give it a go vega some of these guys if you're still here um let me know uh in discord if for your commissions if you guys are wanting to wait for rocket laker just to go ahead and move forward so going from there ah anyway i think that is everything 54 subs let's do that giveaway and then we'll start talking about parts you guys are awesome how much you support me is amazing and i am grateful but i need to switch the giveaway here we go oh i forgot to get my ice i'm i'm thirsty thirsty okay sub goal okay so we're on our way to the we have 54 okay 100 new a gift card we have we need 100 we have 54. there we go okay let me go grab an ice real quick and then let's talk about parts because uh you can't can't build a pc without ice and then we'll do another dad joke i i like the snail one that one was a that was a particularly good one today's sparkling ice flavor is strawberry watermelon guys strawberry watermelon what i've chosen from the refrigerator to get this going i think it matches i don't know what do you guys think it kind of matches the box a little bit there we go a little strawberry watermelon to get things going i think it sounds good okay let's get let's talk about parts and go from there okay so at the heart of this thing and i'm pretty excited about this because we have some we have another cool part at the heart of this this whole pc though is the ryzen 9 5900x this is the 12 core 24 thread you know like i talked about the 10950 sorry the 10 900 versus the 10850 this is like the 5950 versus the 5900 definitely the much more budget conscious but just slightly less powerful than the 5950x such a great cpu um and probably like the for the mass market probably the better choice in terms of people just want to flex and get a 5950x so that is our um cpu for motherboard making a debut and this build got delayed for this is the rog strix b550xe this is a brand new motherboard um probably one of the most expensive b550 motherboards you can get coming in at 339. this is a beefy boy xe standing for extra extreme awesome pronoun i don't know i don't know what it actually stands for but um really really attractive board it actually also comes with a hyper m.2 by 16 gen 4 card it's got integrated i o and a vrm heat sink it's got the bios flashback it's got 14 by 2 power stages this basically supports 256 gigs of ram it's all the super awesome in a very expensive box with a lot of the cool rgb it kind of looks like it got like scratched from like a really angry person like blondie or eternal who like got mad at it and said oh you're you're trying to cheat sort of scratch it or whatever it was or hey um you're standing in front of me when i'm shooting blondie yeah so stuff like that you know where you end up getting scratched and stuff like that uh but anyway uh really really great motherboard it's gonna be a lot of fun this is brand new um it hasn't been out very long and so uh one of the reasons this build was supposed to be last week but got moved to this week so we could actually get this motherboard in so big thick boy motherboard um and should be uh super cool for there um for storage uh he's actually gonna be doing uh a sn750 500 gig but we don't have any sn50 i thought we did so we're gonna throw in just as a temporary this sn550 just to get it um set up or just so we can basically finish the install and then we're gonna put when we set it up and all that stuff we'll put in his real one we just had to order one today for ram we're using 4000 megahertz vengeance rgb pro um this is kind of like the staple it's big it's amd it's basically amd um uh certified so to speak uh ram it's cl18 so it's not necessarily that in terms of best timings but it's just kind of like for what you need it's like the ideal for basically the infinity fabric etc cetera so it's going to be 32 gigs of that as well and we'll be putting that in and let's see for some fans because we haven't done these in a corsair 5000 d yet we're going to be putting in the ql 120 rgb fans uh instead of i think the last couple we've done has been the ml 20 ml 120s or ll-120s for the white builds this is our first black corsair build so we're going to be throwing in the ql 120s which i think are going to look super sweet inside of this case and then let's see keep going we got more parts roby we got more parts for our cooling it's the only corsair part we're not putting in but he wanted the awesome screen and who doesn't it's the nzxt z73 uh motherboard z73 aio um probably one of the like probably most premium aios that's basically out there right now just given the screen a couple things that obviously comes with that is like there's some weirdness in terms of just how much room it takes over the cpu um which makes it a little bit hard you have to like rotate it a certain way and it doesn't it's basically it will cause some no matter what no matter how you install you'll have some pressure uh on that far left dim uh for your uh for your ram but all in all like what you get like just from like a functionality standpoint is pretty huge we're gonna be throwing ql 120s in this replacing all three of the stock black fans in here just to give it that little extra bling um as well so it should come out looking really really nice really nice that's a nice clark real nice and then finally last part of this uh we're going to be using the uh rm850x from uh corsair uh again it's pretty much all a corsair build minus the fact that we're using uh minus the fact that we're using a uh nzxt aio but it's going to look out so it'll come out looking super clean this is an overall really great uh power supply more than enough power for what we're going to need for a 30 70 and then again that last part is then we have the you know the premium part of the build here um and that is the rtx rog strix sorry the rog strix asus rg strix um 3070 which will be that final part so that's all the parts what do you guys think i'm thinking i'm thinking this is a pretty good build i don't know what do you guys think i think this is going to be a very very good build and i'm glad it's not an alienly 0-1 dynamic jeez i'm croak real nice clark real nice yeah people are like oh no why not put it in 0-1-1 because that's kind of been done like a million times so it's nice to put it in a different kind of thing uh oh man i saw the new egg shuffle over 540 for 30 60. okay okay a little diatribe time i want to let you guys know newegg does not set the prices for what they charge for the things that are in the new egg shuffle those prices are set by the card manufacturers please please stop at newegg and tell stop telling newegg to change their prices or that they're charging an arm and a leg it's not newegg it's asus it's msi it's evga in fact the prices have just gone up again because of the tariffs and it has nothing sometimes it could be tariffs some companies are doing it also probably because of tariffs and just demand but newegg does not set the price it is actually um it is actually uh the manufacturers for the most part so i just want to make sure that you uh you guys know that um when it goes through there oh cool roland dude actually won the 30 60. i i got one of those msi ones too so it's just it's just one of those things to know the other thing too is so understand the price that's on the evga site and so i i have i'll actually ask jacob this question but the price is on the evga site and then what you actually get if you actually get chosen by the card are actually different as well um so just so you guys know even though the site may say one thing when they actually buy the pc it actually has a tendency to be more buy the card as a tendency to be more expensive so okay uh yeah and also yeah make sure you sell it select sold anyway um i'm trying to see what else is going on here hey watching from columbia when do you think that the kai okay some people's asking when do you think uh tariff i don't know um i think once april comes around especially may wants the coven 19 and everybody can basically get their vaccination um it feels like it hasn't been a priority technically it's a biden administration thing because he has to go and look for the exemptions again if he's able to set the exemptions like we had previously that expired in december if that happens and you should see prices of gpus and everything else return to normal but until heat that becomes a priority which the semiconductor shortage the the we have the semiconductor shortage we also have the the drought situation is happening because of the lack of typhoons in uh typhoons and monsoons in hong kong and all sorts of things that are that are driving the overall prices up and so that's the reason there hasn't just been an overall stock shortage and then price hike in a lot of pc parts the other thing is is that as an fyi it looks like the other short as it may be happening very soon is a psu shortage so if you are planning on getting a build and you're like hey i really want to get like i really want to build a 3080 or 3090 build or a 3080 ti build if that's a real thing then you may want to pick up an 850 or a thousand watt psu now because getting those later may be actually very very hard so you might be able to get a gpu but now you won't be able to get a psu so just something else to go does new excel use parts no not that i know of not like amazon amazon you can buy used from there but i don't think you can do that on newegg but i know i'm not sure 3 000 builds are fake news okay well there we go um i know anybody at this point in time any gpu build seems to be a fake build so that's going for that okay who would you think wishing for a typhoon to hit someplace yeah i know they just but they need the water no 650 watt is not anger you want a 750 or higher um watching from africa that's awesome congratulations australia wasn't going to address it until next year and he uses leverage against china well there you go super doomsday that's he brought super doom news so that's there you go sadness all around okay guys let's go ahead and get started on the build but before we do that let's look at our dad jokes because we need more dad jokes to bring up the overall vibe that we got here um here we go uh okay okay did you know that scandin the scandinavian area has the highest cost of living in europe did you guys know this so just reading this right now thank you craig lilly for for this information this is critical there's no way i could afford to live there [Laughter] there's no way i could have fjord to live there i like that one i like that one that one's that one's a good one okay uh um okay if i had a choice between having a skill or common sense i'd pick common sense because a skill is being able to walk a tightrope across the grand canyon common sense is not giving it a try i like that that's a that's that's that's good uh that's good uh that's good info right there and then um uh i ate an awful german i ate at an awful german restaurant last night i'd rate it at night that one's also good okay there's three there's three jokes for you right there uh we'll go from there and let's go ahead and grab our uh our motherboard and uh let's start our build down ladies and gentlemen top down oh i almost poked myself in the eye look at this board man this thing is massive massive board we got a big board i'm ready to open this up oops need to grab a knife here there it is grabbing our knife rubytech knife and opening this up 1130 people guys it's it's a good monday already yeah yeah there you go got some people going to spreckensie deutsch susan i think i mean sweet pickles bus and then some random german at the end um okay there we go right there this is a big board look at how like look at how well it's packed oh yeah let me get rid of that massive box uh curious thing do they i wonder if this is like oh this actually like comes all the way out that's nice i'm gonna see what we have in the spare thing here i'm gonna grab our motherboard components here okay i'm gonna see i'm curious if like i don't i know in the z59 i'm wondering oh look at that see there's that gen four here's that hard drive if you want to throw like a ton of m.2s in there it's like a basically a hyper m.2 gen 4 card that comes with this that's like extra hardcore um okay okay we do need we're going to grab our standoffs just to make sure we have some there's some hopefully no oh there's lots of standoffs ooh look at that more standoffs i don't think we'll need all of them but i just want to have them all out just in case okay cool because sometimes they're different sizes okay there's our there's our motherboard out guys you buy it's the same thing that i tell every time how you buy a 30 series card is newegg shuffle or evga the uh basically getting in the queue at evga that's really kind of the only way to get them right now all the other ones seem to be pretty much um bots getting them so and 3080s i don't i think those have become like i'm guessing i'm it's if i think if there's anything pointing to me that the 3080ti rumor is true it's the lack of 3080s because 3070s continue to show up in pretty consistent numbers uh pretty much you know like at least weekly 30 80s i haven't seen a 30 80 in stock outside of like that one drop in best buy in almost a month so okay so what we're going to do now we got a little bit of peels here gotta get those peels off there it is i think this one's probably peeling too got lots of peels yeah it it has a tendency to i think on average and i don't know some of some of the text might be or mods might be able to back me up on this i think on average as a tendency to be about three times a week so if there was one today which there was it was a slim one ps5 it was a playstation 5 um playstation 5 30 60 msi and then a 30 90 evga which is a beastly card beastly he was a strong beastly man i don't know if you've watched a lot of uh watched a lot of uh national lampoons but um yeah that that card is incredible so i love that card but uh yeah those are the only three things on the thing so it has a tendency to like then it won't more than likely will not happen tomorrow um this is a freaking amazing board uh only thing is it the cool thing about the v550 couple things that i'm digging about this real quick number one um it has a usbc which is good uh something that doesn't come with a lot of b550 motherboards you actually have it's good spacing here um for your between your by 16 which this is pcie gen 4 and your buy eight um which is nice um so again these are these are like so if you want to use a thicker car that's kind of nice you've got a couple by ones here um let's see a couple other things uh only a single this is oh yeah good no so in this case you've got two uh five volt uh addressable rgb headers which is something that has been lacking on like for instance the b550a the white one that only has a single one um it also has the digital readout here um thing that's super nice about this is that like if you have an issue with the motherboard or there's a problem with it posting you'll get a postcode versus having a plug it plug in a pc speaker um um outside of that i mean i mean outside you you got a ridiculous 14 by two phase power you can see this is a very very thick uh vrm uh another thing i also like about this is you see this gap here i do like these gaps and cards because it makes it a whole lot easier to route aio um stuff up above which is nice um but in terms of room here uh again one of the things i really wish that mother man and i we won't really have a choice i wish there was a way to get a little bit more room between around the actual um cpu or if hopefully in the next version of whatever their aio is or nzxte that it ends up not being as as as big um the one thing that is interesting about this and where i i do see b550 is just a lack of i o one thing that is nice is that this actually has two usb 3.2 gen 2 usb c slots which is nice um but in what you see when you which you're starting to see is a lack of just normal usb type a which you may not care and then this obviously has wi-fi 6e as well so great motherboard nicely priced uh you know well nicely priced as terms of premium um but you are getting a lot for that money so let's throw our cpu in and go from there here we go get this in take this out another 5900 and i one thing i'm saying is like i go to amazon and one of the things i will say is at least cpus are starting to become in stock pretty regularly they're just slightly overpriced but they have become pretty regularly it's been easier to get like a 5900 a 5800 and a 5600x um so i expect the cpu shortage to actually end here pretty quick just in time for rocket lake um which will probably have the same problem with like getting 11 900ks um because right now it's looking like they are more powerful game wise than the 5000 series amd processors but again we'll have to wait for final numbers and stuff like that yes the motherboard does support uh in vlink uh or sli old sli um and also probably crossfire as well i think crossfire is dead but i'm not entirely sure on that um okay let's throw our ram in here there it is a beautiful vengeance rgb pro it was doa that's brutal that's terrible yeah that sucks dude getting a car that's doa well it's kind of like what happened to us right like last last week's build um with the only 3080 i had in stock and the back plate was uh the back plate was snapped so we're trying to work through that and get a new back plate at least from msi but yeah i feel your pain i mean yes the card worked but still having a snap back plate of a very expensive um very expensive gpu is never a good thing either okay let's go and stop again we're looking for the little slot in the pcb we're just going to line those up like so pop it in oh oh that was that was another look we've had like a series of solid clicks here um that crucial was just a little bit thicker but still i mean like good oh that was good that was oh that was good did you hear that that was a moment guys let's just can i just get a can that was that was a good solid that was a solid solid click solid click i mean like i just made me weaken the knees almost with that click one there okay here we go gonna get some more in here just enjoying the clicking here oh yeah good just good solid clicks here there we go in like flynn yeah i need to smoke after that click exactly we need a click remote i know i know i we i have uh i think blondie is actually having shawn's reaching out to blondie to get some updates for some of that stuff so um blondie can just add that into the package from sean who's going to be doing some refreshes some some of that stuff because we're coming up on one year guys uh we're uh i think i just shy i don't know i think my first stream was in twitch was in april i don't remember the exact date but we're coming up to our one year anniversary on twitch as a twitch uh affiliate um so yeah it's it's coming up guys one year we went by quick not bad uh what are we at like sixty nine thousand sixty seven thousand followers something like that that's that's not bad for a year so yeah okay so again we're throwing this in this is just temporary just to get it in get it to post all that sort of stuff um we are going to be putting in a different now he has other drives that he's going to be putting into this uh so he has another m.2 this is going to replace another system oh this has two i wish i wouldn't have opened it okay well we'll just pop the other one down and get it in we just want we don't want to lose his other we don't want to lose this other header okay now these might be the one thing that's crazy these might be too tall well we have it let's likely have other little ziploc bags so i'll put it as a plug if that's too tall just putting in his header we're using corsair vengeance four thousand megahertz ram that seems okay okay cool we seem okay okay let's swapping this in it's gonna be on the pcb as well slip there's a little slit in the pcb there just stick that down like that and boom that is in now we're going to do is we're just going to peel our heat thing here and i'm guessing this goes like this line up with the angle the cool thing about a lot of these boards now especially asus is they've made it really hard to install them upside down because the screw the the tooling for the two sides is different so like this one screw is actually thinner than the other which keeps you from putting it in upside down okay nice little fingerprint there clean that off [Music] very big fingerprint okay just as an fyi those things take those things uh definitely show fingerprints okay there we go m.2 is in we're going to go ahead and grab a little baggie if you don't lose this for his other one [Music] i don't want to lose this other thing and we'll put this back in the motherboard box okay it would help if i actually got it into the baggie way to go rubs okay cool there's those back in the box [Music] okay next step we're gonna go ahead and get our we're gonna go ahead and get our um aio bracket installed which is pretty easy for this one nothing too crazy there we go [Music] come on [Music] there we go okay gonna come out it's gonna come oop there it is there's that one same thing with this one wow stick wow stick wow stick oopsie see yeah that's not coming out oopsie oops see the uh techs are getting drunk right now okay let's grab our z63 z73 box z bajillion katrilian box get our wow stick out of the way kraken z series into the box with you into some box with you okay there's that there's that right there i'm gonna take these fans out because we don't need them we don't need no stinking nzxt fans no nzxt fans don't need no stinkin nzxt fans what we do need is the am4 things here that's what we need right there put that back put this over here because we don't really need it right now right now there's no tomorrow put this over on the side or when we get to the next part and then what we're going to do is drop these out so these little things go in each one of these little four corners like so release the kraken that's right cosmic jordan gotta release the kraken there we are right there that's beautiful just beautiful these pillars of awesome are in oh get our racket and all that stuff in okay guys well that is done let us put this off over here and let us get our case prepared this is a non-prepared case this is just going to be coming up from the top but motherboard is basically ready so hefty boy for sure uh the only thing too is this is also b550 is for all the other stuff they've gotten here it's not a very thick pcb um but still very very premium board okay let's grab our case the black case we've only done the white in this one it's nice to be able to do a black one this time let's get this stripped we've been trying just to make it you play like peekaboo guys you ready yeah like are you guys like here we go here we go peekaboo you guys won't know which direction coming out peek-a-boo oh wait i guess you can see my hands peek-a-boo you having fun should we just do that for an hour that'd be fun right i'm hiding again where am i gonna come out it's a mystery okay so here's on the back side again one things i really like about this case is just how clean the uh how clean our uh how clean our cable management is going to be just because of you know awesome covers nothing nothing too fancy there here we go [Music] okay there we go um we're going to take this off it just pops off ooh i didn't notice this but on the black one in the little top there's a little i can show you here let me show you top down versus like popping it down there uh on the white one this is yellow um but on the black one it's actually black which is kind of i was trying to show you here you see it there yeah see this this is yellow on the white but on the black it's actually just black so we're gonna take that off done [Music] okay we're gonna pull our tape here tape and pull that out that's yellow so we do have that yellow from the from which is standard there's our [Music] got that open it's basically to prepare for our top installation and now we're going to go to the front i think you know it's funny because it's like one of those things you could definitely get pretty regularly is just do a case like do a new case you know they're not you know 170 150 160 bucks i think for this one right and then like just like get a new case on a pretty consistent basis just give your like your pc a regularly a regular facelift so to speak okay so we got all that last thing we're gonna do is we're gonna remove tape here in the back there we go yeah i like how expandable this board this this case is i think the only issue i have with it is just like some of that expansion like uh uh some of that expansion just kind of comes with a cost it's like so modular that some of it's like quirky um and then the other thing too is like the only other thing i would fix is here on this cable oops drop deck remote here on this cable this cable basically cover this is like this is way too small this needs a bigger gap here where you can see my hands coming out it needs to be a little bit wider um especially if you're using like thicker cables that can be a little problematic um some of the other things that's nice about this case is it comes with like for custom water cooling it's got some additional um like add-ons that kind of come with it which is kind of cool and then of course we've got a ton of channeling options and it also includes a six fan hub which we'll take be taking advantage of today but i'm just going to remove right now what we need for our on there it goes there okay so now all of our stuff is stripped our case is ready first thing we're going to do just because we need to is we're going to remove the black stock fans that come with this and then uh let's get our get our qr fans our ql fans in here we're gonna get those in first so we'll do a side camera here first one get our ql there you go get our ql fans in here there you go so that's ready just sitting there right now there you go okay next one grab our rear one rear fan get that out last fan last screw okay there's that pull out the last fan kind of twisty tie it onto the tie down here in the back okay that's done cool okay time to get our qls in there now we'll go back to our side view our side view is not working hold on one sec guys um i want stream deck that's what i want side east side okay oh none of my my whole thing is not working it just got wacky okay we're gonna quickly just unplug this and plug this back in okay sorry about that guys nice little uh drop off there for the stream deck okay what we're doing is open up our ql fans okay let's see are we back still not done yet waiting for the stream deck to come back green decks being wacky trying to get our stream deck back guys we're seeing it oh there goes okay here we go i feel like we're good aside now weird none of these working okay top down works but for some reason this side work okay side now works okay cool stream decks back that's kind of weird okay let's get our now we can finish our stuff are we doing likes on the youtube video guys we still uh crank in there okay 311 come on guys we can get remember if we get 700 we give away a 250 give me all you got to do is pop over there drop that like and uh yeah we're gonna give we're gonna give stuff away easy peasy lemon squeezy for sure okay funny this one like would actually like use like very nicely like ql 140s you could throw like some serious qo 140 so it would help if i actually had oops that but okay here we go first man really where'd that go wow that did not wasn't expecting that there we go always fun when the screws don't quite go in the holes i will tell you man most of my time spent dealing with screw screws for fans like like comparatively to everything else i do in the build i feel like i spend the majority of my time dealing with fan screws and now i have like one that fell and i don't know where it fell to it's like hiding from me here black screw where are you where are you little screw put the deuce not even that hard man yeah we'll grab one more out of the bag this really didn't want to be in your build hidden oh yeah there it goes i don't know it's like i don't want to be in this build i don't want to be part of a pc we go in next let's grab our next set of screws this one's not going to get away from me guys okay doo doo doo [Applause] and that one's done [Music] oh shoot almost forgot guys we got we got peels i'll get the back ones once i get this installed yeah i've almost forgot the peels there we go i swear they were actually easier when the fans were on the uh on the installed than they were i'd do this without having them installed or just i guess maybe more static i don't know i don't know what's the deal is there but this came off pretty easily when i had them installed like this there we go one more and then we got one more fan okay last fan we're moving with we're cooking with gas somebody said i wasn't saying that enough anymore cooking with gas now guys the fans are in all our dreams start to come true when the fans get put in but everybody wishes for is just better quality fan install parts i'm gonna take this one off though there you go it's kind of in the lower lower area so boom okay fan installation can commence now for these lotta okay last bit here i know you guys are super excited giving all the fans that are getting installed there we go almost there we go yay whoops yay whoops quite the juxtaposition there okay now we are now we have fans in let's get our mobo in motherboard installation time is always a prime time and a big moment in a pc's life oh i forgot i had these random screws that they used i use them for the rear though for sure okay so let's put this down you guys ready for a big moment of pc's life big moment of pc life right here the motherboard installation just makes people's days better makes everybody's days better when you can install a mobo this is like it's like a moment a happy moment in any owner's life 75 subs ah yeah it will fit 340 millimeters in the front yeah you could do three 140s in the front let's take a look at what's going on here got 628 on youtube 628 on twitch 443 on youtube 88 on twitch.tv newegg and two hanging out in the facebook faithful thank you very much facebook faithful you are you are there for me okay let us grab our motherboard here comes the motherboard it's gonna look so good look at that so good oh that is nice that is nice that looks nice in there okay let's grab our beautiful i think these are the ones i want right now we're gonna grab our little our motherboard screws wow stick time and motherboard screw in time boom magic is happening oops whoopsie these are not quite as like magnetic as i'd like they're coated a little bit there it is whoopsie that's right scott you tell him you tell him man okay we're gonna grab the other screwdriver here like lack of magnetic is killing me here going back to old faithful temporarily thank you i appreciate that you like the sweater thank you uh the fine folks at bioware actually actually never mind this one was not given to me i got this one off of their merch store [Music] two more two more yeah and then it's aio prep time like if you've you've watched the show you feel like we are where we're at you know it's almost aio time big big [Music] feels like the angle of this board is just a little bit off loosen the board keeping this bottom one down here from going straight [Music] baby weird this one is just like a little bit slightly and it's not like this the pin the pin is right it's like on a peg so it's just like the the hole for this is just a little bit not straight let me make sure these are really loose here know what i wanted to do come on i'm not gonna get a lot of motion on this it's just not gonna there's not a whole lot i can do here there we go okay got it okay all of our screws are in tighten them one more time get them down remember this one's being wacky kind of like a weird it was just like weirdly angled but got it in and we're good to go okay now we've got that done and now move on to the next step which is getting our aio built here is these two things i can put away is the there we go okay let's get our screws out okay i think that's everything i need out of here yep okay now got our aio ready to get set up i'm pretty excited about friday's build guys we're going to be building in the antec like an antec dark cube i think is the cat i don't remember exactly the name but like the antec something or that just came off i'm so excited about friday if you want to check out a new new case uh hopefully better than the montec but i've had some pretty good luck with antec uh pc's uh antec cases uh in the past so i'm not they're they're their airflow one that we did not that long ago which had like a pretty neat um uh pretty neat kind of airflow design in it was pretty cool with like their triple chamber stuff so i'm actually pretty excited about checking out the antec one too okay get these out replacing our fans on this build something a little bit more courserish firsthand fans please i want something a little bit more posh please a little bit more fancy and yeah we want oh that's awesome port uh sl-120s and the ml-120s a lot uh which one is better the m120 is better than an sl120 for sure um ql120s are kind of the highest in if you want best the ones that push the most error ll-120s but the l120s are pretty loud mls are super quiet they're kind of like the best balance qls have a tendency to be more expensive but they are more uh and then they don't push as much but again they look they have like a lot more lighting options so hopefully that helps you make a decision there we go i've given up on twisty ties i just cut the cut the dang things and then one of these days i'm going to cut a wire and i'm going to be mad because these fans aren't cheap you know nobody's gonna be like oh that's okay roby i'm okay with you hunting one of my fans that's no biggie i'm okay with it i'm not angry yeah you are yeah you are you're angry okay so now i'm gonna put in this like this which means the fans are gonna go like this which means this goes like but okay oh let's not forget to peel peels slow things down but are oddly satisfying there we go there we go one more set of peels here we go okay cool now because these are [Music] where is it because these are um yeah we're gonna be exhausting hot air out of the case which is why we have them set for exhaust here so uh we're gonna be sucking but exhausting the hot air out of the case which is what we want um so yeah we're gonna grab there it is [Applause] did you miss an m.2 screw no i did not not that i know of okay not that i know of i am i'm gonna write uh nzxt i'm gonna talk to andy about stop using rounded screws for your aios another thing i'd like them to do use flat screws next to the m.2 no the m.2 all has screws mobo's screw next to the m.2 no that has a that's a pin guys no there's a pin there so there's no way to put a screw in there i see what you're asking no there's a pin there that's how you that's how uh that's how you uh that's how the motherboard lines up good question all right i get what you guess i see what you're asking now i see what you were asking now i see i see said the blind man as he peed into the wind it's all coming back to me now oopsie why don't you go in the hole there robes no for sure roland for sure somebody like that joke i'm glad hi him koosh anyways it's party time here nice tricks for trey i'm glad it's party time here do hamsters take fall damage only only if they're out of their cages i think in their cages i think they're impervious to fall damage oh dads i told my dad the i told my dad the uh koala joke the koala bear joke and he was like that's a good dad joke i mean he likes all my dad jokes but every once in a while i like the ones that like i can be like storyteller-ish with you know like the snail one um and uh i have a tendency those deliveries have a tendency to be better so hey joker thank you very much for the five gifted subs my friend the snail joke yeah the snail joke hit it was a good that's a good joke and that's the thing is like i have a tendency like the ones that i can be like more like more story-esque you know what i mean have a tendency to hit better um so i'm trying to get some of those i mean a lot of like i love the ones that we have on our discord channel but if you have like some story-esque ones i'd love those too so let me know i always always want to hear dad joke real legend hunter okay we are getting close to the end of this now those i love how shiny these fans are they're just so shiny you say shiny fan shiner fan shiny fan in my head everybody likes shiny fans yeah let's uh get these ready let's get these controlled okay there's that getting these ready for there running them through the in the middle there we go okay real some are somewhere i missed it i want to see an sff build we are doing one um we did we did a kind of sff build the 0-1-1 dynamic mini was an sf technically a small form factor build so we did the valentine's build on february around february 14th um that was the smallest we've done i'm working with i'm hoping to get dan's newest danny four's newest um we're also gonna do a phantom uh we actually i just got the replacement motherboard from asrock for um that evolve case that we had it die so i need to order new um a new aio and then we'll do that one too i missed it real what would happen to the us switch from pounds to kilograms overnight there would be mass confusion i've heard that one before i like that one i've read that one before and don't forget guys if you have dad jokes you can go onto our discord channel and then i'll uh i read them out from there i'll read some here in a few minutes get this this mounted real quick though but that is a good one i like that one okay here we go okay kind of clump all this stuff together now we're going to grab our case right here and let's get our aio mounted a-i-a-i-o and on that aio he mounted it into the case a-i-a-i-o okay here we go side view can you see it you can sort of see it oh maybe i'll do it on this side it can be maybe i'll do it here so you guys can see a little bit better a-i-a-i-o i'll i'll bring the uh i'll bring the light over oh there we go you got this little our little nan light so you can see a little bit better look at that fancy okay fancy so now we're going to do now we have a lot of room because of how this works so shouldn't be too crazy works of these cables are not behaving behave behave cables behave [Music] oh these are some spaghetti spaghetti cables for sure okay okay down like that rarely then i'm gonna grab our screws here okay i think how much room we have quite a bit okay cool i thought what i thought i remember there we go that one i'll push the case off the edge here kind of happen in here there we go okay now our aio is in good there okay now let's take it down and let's get our get our screws in nicely we're gonna move it down one row with the second bench top then you watch this magic happen do a little bit of loosening bands look good and now i'm going to loosen this just slightly so i can move these a little bit more [Music] there we go [Music] okay wow an sn850 for 120 buck for 180 bucks is a good deal so if you didn't you should that deal's still going uh one of my if one of my tech specialists could uh pop that channel if you're looking for a really good pcie gen 4 m.2 drive 180 bikes for an sn850 if we get a link for that that'd be great okay now we're just getting our getting our screws in and then we'll be mounted aio ryzen 7370x is still a good cpu yes we do trend dances on on tick tock all the time samuel ryzen 5 3600 is also a great yeah again a great one to pair with a a 30 60 or even a 36 ti or 50 a 3 600 be great for that what's up rebel how are you man welcome okay we've got two more screws then our aio is mounted at the top and then we can move on to the next evolution which is getting it mounted inside hey cat eyes thank you very much for that 92 guys are coming up on the 100 coming up on the 100 100 the century mark for subs today thank you very much for all the support okay we're good there all of our cabling is through here which is good now we're just gonna add our cables let's bring this back up to the side camera now you guys can see this part and now we're going to do is we're going to add all our cabling get that stuff hooked up i'm not going to bend a pen like we did last time right guys easy there we go there's that we're just gonna add our usb okay now to prep this uh i do need and i think i put it in here instead which i shouldn't have yeah here it is you need the right bracket okay so let's go ahead we're gonna do is get this mounted up here i'm just gonna get these through okay there's that one now all of our triple fan hookup stuff and then a random rgb thing that we don't use because we're not using nzxt but if we were would be great my fam my famous searching hunting for cable face it's like a very famous face here on the show hunting for cable this one has like a nice big gap for running aio cables which is nice probably not the best for brm cooling but okay now all our cables are through got one more it's our power one okay now we can where's our power cable there it is now we can mount now we're going to be mounting like this as much as i would love to do sideways it's just not going to fit so i've just done this too many times to know what we're going to do is we're going to remove and remove working out guys now i'm going to grab a little bit of the one thing i'm trying to do is as i push this up i'm going to pull the other cables get these more through there is the power cable here these oh that's one thing for my power cable there it is skate so i got it okay and then we have one more cube you wanna hold me like you used to but i keep saying we're done guess this meant more to you than i just making sure that my cable stays straight [Music] and just like that [Music] [Music] oops the whoopsie is i unplugged my cpu fan you don't want to do i just wanted a little cable for it [Music] oh he's like that this is like the longest part is just routing all this [Music] crud now everything is up and routed tables are in i'm just going to put a couple of these on and then we'll set it down and cable manager [Music] okay one more and i'll feel good about laying this down just getting it getting cables managed and then we'll be good [Music] oh [Music] [Music] okay there that one's in that one's tight that one's tight you put the last one in why not why not already have the other four the other three in okay now all those are up and installed aio is on and we're good to go people are asking hey what about the what about the um thermal paste it was pre-applied and it's on there now so we're good there okay just gonna put all our spare stuff in there and now move on some cable management stuff we're gonna do here we're gonna try and get shirt make sure all of this stuff is basically as tight and back as humanly possible please we'll do some in the front too but we just want to make sure that this stuff is up one more i'm still here okay we are now about to hook up all of our rgb always fun first let's go to top down there's all our these all go into the motherboard box open this off and let's set this down a little bit a little bit additional cable management up here just to keep this tight we just want to keep this to look like a single cable as much as possible that's what we're working on here and i'm going to install this give ourselves a 90 degree bend here see if that works it may not be but i have it just in case i have another here now let me this let's grab our little cable management cable ties [Music] there we go yeah i'm excited about how this is gonna look when we're done that'll keep that nice and clean nothing popping out it's good here we go okay now so we have all of our fans we have one more fan we're gonna throw in the back i gotta go grab it um we're gonna throw another ql 120 which is actually the thing that's kind of rough about that second that last ql 120 is it's gonna uh force us to use a um you know i'm curious i thought i had i might have one in the fan drawer here not i can grab one sometimes i think i do have one you know [Applause] i'm gonna take ml you know 120. equal extent we have our rear exhaust fan you do do dude actually i'm curious yes i don't know if this is gonna work though look real quick [Music] see if we can use a 140. there's an exhaust that'd be kind of neat i don't think you can though which means i might have somebody come bring me e120 oh no i can use a 140 back there if the mounts work nope you need a 120. that would be kind of cool okay i think i have a lot of fans the other one twenties are the forties are at the house aren't they sir ring okay see if i see them anywhere else there's a lot of stuff that's back here that could be them oh wait what's this oh those are white black i have like 93 packs of white i have a pack at the house okay once that guy's got to do a call see if somebody can bring me a pack of go on 20s from the house we're gonna have to do a do a call to call the wife here we go you want to call the wife guys hey uh can you have somebody bring over a pack of ql 120s that are on the front entryway they're fans they're called q ql120 they're in a yellow box and they're they're in a yellow box they're fans i can see a picture hold on here let me show you facetime there you go yeah we're live on stream 1000 people watching you see this you see the facetime that's what they look like i need a box of those maddie they're in the front they look like this you bring them by one box is that all you need yeah i need one box and if you can bring them by that'd be great we're in the middle of the build so i need them as soon as you can bring them over thank you bye okay qo120 is on the way yeah lifeline to the miss that's right okay let's turn this over we can hook up at least a lot of our stuff now and get that going [Music] oh look at this mess so we're gonna actually need two of the lighting nodes oh you know what oh man realize something aren't i we're gonna need three usb we're gonna need three usb things for this to work do i have a this just got complicated uh because we have the usb for this and we have the us we need we'll need us each one of these requires usb and if i use two of these i use two of these i'll have to uh because i'll need two of these because it needs six fans one sec guys i'll be right back i need a corsair commander pro because he needs a he needs a usb hub i don't think i have another usb hub other than a commander pro i don't even know if i have another commander pro i thought he did i swear i did okay there it is [Music] yeah this is always the fun part thank you maddie appreciate it okay guys got more qls and i got a commander pro we got to do usb hubs so we need more usb hub as well so lots of extra stuff having to go in this build just because we have more than [Music] six fans the moment that you go to seven fans you now need two of these which is always rough okay so okay one kind of a waste of a usb of a commander pro that's for sure three but three that's why like a cappellix or something like that always works a little bit better the moment that you need like multiple usbs okay what we're getting out here is just we're gonna kind of untangle things let me get some untangling done here there you go i'm gonna separate this stuff out okay so there's that to these let me go and hook up here because i want them to be controlled by the aio these are those fans for three fans at the top okay there's our fans and stuff like that let's get these we can push these off to the side here along with this because this that we'll need this stuff we can basically just put it out of the way go top down i'm going to kind of create what's called like an even like okay so there's all of our that's this stuff is all it's all for our fans essentially fans and aio fans there we go yes there's that clump there's all our fans all done here this is our then what we have is we have some more fans what i'm going to use for these fans is just to be safe is we're going to use the hub there's one there's our rgb the other hub there it is there we go [Music] and hub there's that i'm gonna check real quick might brown i forgot we got some of those do i have any more usb hubs i thought i did i thought he sent me some [Music] if i have one more fan i prefer to use a usb hub over a usb over a no that's a eks water block stuff over a air commander because it's kind of like a kind of like a waste did not see another hub there might be one might be one in this bin of stuff in here hold on one sec guys we want this to get done but we want it to be done right here looking to see if i have a usb hub oh this would make it a whole lot cleaner see one here let's check the drawer i feel like there's one in here somewhere i feel like there's a hub in here yes there is okay good i found one this is what i was looking for i knew i had one this is what i was looking for right here this is the new nzxt usb hub so that will save me from having to use a commander pro and waste to commander pro when i could just use a usb an internal usb hub i knew i had one much better much better much cleaner much cleaner just saying [Music] because we'll have to use two of these so i'll do is put this right here this will be and then the cool thing about this is like i said this is nice and magnetic so it should look nice and then we'll need one for this this one comes off of here like so there we go and that's going to go here these are going to plug into this now we've got a clean setup here which is what i like okay so now i don't have now i can use my usb hub and not feel like i'm being weird i hooked all three of those up yep i hooked all three of those up these are going to go across and plug into our rgb over here running my way to a foreign and lastly six okay cool now there's all our rgb minus one has to get hooked up separately we're gonna hook that up in a minute lots of stuff unfortunately with i mean fortunately slash unfortunately with this build there's just a lot of stuff that needs to get hooked up we need to grab a need to grab and install our last fan [Applause] our last ql fan for our exhaust thank you for the lifeline from mrs roby oh we're at 100. oh next goal next goal am i looking for next goal okay ending that goal we're at 101 sub goal reach okay there we go on our way to the 150. starting that now cool how are we doing on likes on the youtube video there we go okay let's grab our one we just need one of these forever okay cool now we got our last fan oops put all the put all the oh i have one more one whole hub for one fan kind of funny but we gotta make it look pretty got to make it look pretty okay last bit of this let's get our peel off oh shoot [Music] just notice something i think i might run this not down here rerun these cables i need this rgb right here [Music] okay i'll run this this one is being i was hoping it's like there's some cables up in the front that are not looking very nice that's because i ran them through the wrong hole now we go now it looks better be much cleaner and now let's fix that and fix this okay there's just fixing one weird cable scenario up in the front we just want to make sure these look cool i'm probably gonna have to zip tie these keep them from wagging out it is repealed get our these up here now okay grab our fan [Music] okay let's get this last fan in kind of completes the ensemble of rgb awesome a lot of rgb awesome in this one [Music] i was like i was the clock my clock is saying 6 37 was like no that the clock for the uh the daylight savings hasn't updated so i was like wait a minute i haven't only been on streaming for an hour we should be hitting uh we should be hitting the uh hitting the level 5 hype train here pretty quick there it goes now it's right now i have the right time i was like wait a minute there's no way i've only been streaming for an hour this is amazing okay i've gotten so much done in just an hour okay that takes care of the last of that now our fans are installed come all the way through okay fans are all in good top down so all i did guys is i ran a serie one series of the rgb of the fans instead of coming from the bottom that came through the middle now that comes to the middle now it was just one on the front so i that's what i i basically needed to make sure and then this is the only reason this is why we needed a usb hub because we have to have two of these because it's got seven fans just that many two aren't that much more rgb which makes us have to use a second um node thing and then we're going to start kind of cleaning this mess up and then you have to put this in one just as an fy okay that's all hooked up we're gonna take one of these out and then take this and now all of our stuff is in the right spot and hooked up rgb sucked up it's a giant mess right now but we will get that fixed momentarily okay uh i am going to do one thing on the other side just for cable management purposes and then come back to this side and get everything under control because right now it looks like a rat's nest i would nobody be prey no would be nobody would be proud of the current cable management situation we have right now but we want to make sure that these cables over here down here stay under control which is what i'm going to fix okay okay that'll keep those in line let's restart the music we just ended restart the music there we go now the next phase of this plan we need to fix this mess so prepare to be entertained for hours at a time i hope this does not take that long i will try and go as fast as i can but at the same time need to keep quality job one we're gonna put this set this right here and then as we do this start cleaning itself up there's that one so now what i'm going to do is pull these all taut make a giant thing of nice quality wires here little by little this will start to clean itself up and look nicer and nicer as we work our way through the build and obviously every time the thing that always makes a build always the most complicated is just rgb in general because because it requires a lot of wires unfortunately okay what i'm going to do here i'm probably going to for this one make the most sense is just to run this like i want the i want that fan separated that's all rgb right there a good plan barely goes together no okay there you go okay that'll take care of these that'll that'll hook these in one two and three we'll do for this one more okay so there's that clump that'll take care of that's all the that's all the fans okay next up that's not important these next up is our rgb fans one thing we want to do is just make sure none of this stuff is like twisted into other bits like this this is right now so let's undo that now i can just because we don't need to these are getting in the way just get rid of this get rid of this get rid of this get rid of this this now remember we have a giant cover that's going to go over this whole thing so it's not like i it i don't because you can't see it it's still going to make it look nice but there's not as is as crazy of a it's crazy of a need to be ridiculous here still be ruby ridiculous but not [Music] of that this goes right here okay now let's get these done this is its own thing so we'll take it let's for now unplug this just so it's not twisted with the rust notice what i'm doing is i'm just trying to make sure that everything as we do this like is just in groups of its own stuff and then where i can you know i mean you want to you want to create like the longest i'm going to use this here to create like the longest potential i want kind of a i want a like 90 degree from here down this is kind of my hope so again it's just like how long can i make this so this ends up being like 90 degrees looks like about that long in [Music] okay so a lot more clean now a lot more clean there now we're gonna do is we have these are all like the like like we have one more that we got to take care of here we're gonna do this very close to having this done see if i can get this into this same clump right here be ideal and i can just clump all this and do like a single okay so now we can see here it's gotten a whole lot cleaner you guys can't really yeah there you go it's got a whole lot cleaner there we got a couple more striders we got to take care of but we need to fix this thing which i think for the sake of safety i'm probably i think i'm gonna be okay i'm gonna test i can literally just stick this on top of the other one and then we'll have that'll basically make it really easy but i just need to make sure that the door closes here if i do that it's not magnet oh this what is it hitting something is causing this not to let me see if i put this down no it's not that oh did this actually the the hub is too high do that there you go okay that should be okay i might have to remove one of these and move the hubs down the hub down but it doesn't affect this so this is actually okay we're gonna have to put the hub here and replace one of these like that i guess if we do that we could actually stick these next to each other like do like a diagonal thing like do it like this it's a little bit cleaner okay we'll do that there we go this again there we go nice clean run there okay okay so now all of our stuff is controlled that's not okay so these are all those are all our usb this is power see what i can do to make this look a little bit nicer but then i could actually run that all through the bottom underneath this not a whole lot i'm gonna be able to do for usb is one of those things you don't want to crimp the cables too much so but it's all in and then like a little loop like that a little loop keeps everything oopsie oopsie there you go okay there we go nice clean little loop of cables there and now we have like something a whole lot cleaner and easier to just kind of see where things go we'll have to figure that out here in a minute but let's go and run all at this point in time all we have to do is run our front panel connectors let me go ahead and she might do one more here bring this up one more time there we go okay now okay so power power power a three power they need four power here's our fourth power and this is all now let's do our front panels okay so let's untwist these long arduous part is now over which is the front panel and i mean sorry all the freaking cable management so you now get onto the fun stuff okay there's hd audio front panel connectors it's amazing how much time is just hooking up all the rgb and fans when you have long builds like this more front panel connectors okay usbc in each uh this is a fan header i think should be able to get a fan header hoping there's one like right here and that's some stiff cables okay and then a usb 3 and usbc should be right here like the world's most difficult bend there you go and then usbc also is up here okay go to cam link i'm just gonna run this now there it is let's actually run it from the bottom actually they come from this one there we go usb 3.2 will go beneath it thank you aftershock okay so all of our stuff is now on the other side oh okay we're gonna see a couple things right um top down we're gonna see how this looks i think it's not gonna look right but we'll see the usbc 3.2 goes right here [Music] hmm [Music] i don't think that looks right it's going to be better the other way just to do it the old-fashioned way there you go i think that just looks better okay there's that fan header there's one right here i'll walk you guys through all the stuff i just hooked up hd audio goes right here there we go now we have all our little front panel connectors which is power switch reset switch okay nothing too bad reset switch power switch above it and then power plus and minus [Music] okay there's that [Music] okay so we need to run this through a different hole easy fix ooh hype train is up high train is up i'll read the hype train here in a sec because we're

cpu we're at the fun part now okay let's uh let's turn this over do a little bit of more cable management but let me oh i forgot i was going to walk you guys through real quick what we actually just did hook up that's important it's important to tell you guys i'm trying to try and teach at the same time so right here we've got our usb uh 3.2 uh which is our front panel for for usb 3.2 we've got usbc uh front panel usbc down here at the bottom we've got our front panel connectors we've got our usb hub which is our nzxt usb hub plugged in right here uh we've then got a fan hub which is the fan hub for all of the fans the six fans that we're controlling from there remember we got three there and then we've got four being controlled on the fan hub and then finally we've got our hd audio cable which is crazy long which we're going to push down here and there's all of our cables plugged in so that's all all of our front panel connections are now hooked up let me turn this over do a little bit more cable management and then uh get to gpu time which is like it's like the the the downhill slope of the build at that point in time when you're when you're up to gpu time oh we just got to get a couple more of these things under control though now that we've got them all hooked up so we're going to pull all our power cables off to the side they're going to get plugged in separately magnetic okay so this try and pull as much into this as humanly possible back up into this as humanly possible anyway i don't know maybe i'll use that i'm going to disconnect this for now okay cool this is another one of those like these weird situations that you get okay okay get that under control there we go and this our last cable for the day actually can will wind up that just long enough stick right here there you go i wonder if okay and that'll hold it in place which is great okay there we go now all of the cables are basically cable managed we've got one that's a little bit longer than i'd like but it should be fine it's going to be a mess it's going to be managed by that but there you go now all of our cables are managed looks pretty clean now we can do our gpu and keep moving but everything's now hooked up everything's hooked up so everybody say gpu time this is like at the uh we're at the core end of this whole thing now it always makes me happy gee everybody's saying it gpu time flip this over good old ice okay there we go and there we go that's ready let's read a dad joke real quick i'm over here okay what concert costs 45 cents what concert costs 45 cents it's uh 50

know what i mean like their gpus are just so massive still uses only two yes okay good let's just make sure okay so only using two power it's already just seals [Music] there we go now we got a lot of peel on this one because you always do with the with the strix it takes a little bit of time to prep this one just because of the amount of peel here there we go okay next up look at that oh beautiful so much peel okay it's a little bit different than the 30 80. a little bit more black back here massive peel mass appeal okay there's that field other side got your front plate peel there it is okay

cables can i keep my head [Applause] oh for everything foreign okay first one we're gonna do is we're gonna do the top this little one up here we don't want to give this too many of these and shroud is a bit off take this now the sign when we boot this that this uh aio will be this aio will be um a little bit sideways i'm sorry the i o will show the display will be sideways it'll get fixed in uh we'll get fixed in software because we had to rotate it sideways [Music] yep the cam's offer for the win that's right there we go come on come on there it goes okay we don't need too many on this because just of how the way this works okay one second guys i gotta lift this up to put this in correctly i don't rip the unfortunately this this one there we go came out anyway oh shoot yep i did it totally freaking installed the ding cables wrong cable comes on the wrong side our stupid thing came out i love it when i do that yeah i know that's true torch iced i just seem to like i hate it when it happens like at the end right when i'm like at the home like at the on the home stretch and then you do something like this which is just like it's tedium right because you're like i have to like tediously put the cable combs back on it's not it's a little bit different like there's a different kind of i don't know some reason this is like one of the most annoying ones to miss [Music] okay now fortunately the little rubber grommet came out so fix that now too [Music] okay let's turn this over real quick and you guys will see it when i'm done [Music] [Music] [Music] my there you go there we go let me get the rubber grommet back in there we go this side now there it is okay now okay there's that top down let's get there gpu that's in okay top down for you okay so that's cable's in and we're gonna do the top one up here make sure we do this one right ruby okay my we've been trying just to make it through everything i feel so out of place feel so feel so out of place [Music] okay take care of that i'll be by your side okay last cables for the whole build [Music] for the sorry for the front essentially then we got to put psus in sorry the psu cables [Music] if that went in we can figure it out okay we'll give this four that'll be pretty good [Music] one two three four yeah we have five pepper okay now add one more to this okay there we go okay so that's all in get this last cable come on this last set of cables hey what's up melaton how are you man we're getting super close here just the front being done 8 33 so we're in time wise we're actually doing in good shape too hey grandma hey grandma says grandma hates text here thanks man i appreciate it manta i'm gonna be turning this on here pretty soon yes don uh there's a video called uh windows uh how to put windows on your machine that's all in there um and then the other thing too is that uh for wi-fi you just need to buy a usb wi-fi adapter dawn okay ninja i'll get on that i will play some i will play some this week for sure okay here we go it's last kind of spaced out now he's like way down here good okay there we go turn this over let's get our psu and psu time guys last component of this build now one thing i'm gonna have to do i'm pretty sure you have to move this over in give us enough room let's move the hard drive cage over there's plenty of room for the so you don't have a hard drive to put in there's plenty of room to just do our last minute get this controlled there we go okay grab our psu rm850x there is power cable book here's our psu stuff for making it i will don't worry don't worry sniff test is coming guys i i know i know that's important okay by the way these ones are kind of smelly so they're never my favorite oh yeah oh man those are the horse to smell those are the worst to smell they're so bad that's yeah that's like those are those are like yeah those are really smelly they even double take oh oh man oh i may i may i may need to go take a rest after this yes they do i love the nzxt pencil pouches i agree those are pretty awesome okay so i need one of those two of those one of those you don't need that i need that i don't need that i need that i have four one two how many i have five of these right five power one two so i'm going to do two of these there you go yes this is good well not garbage storage okay okay [Music] open these you know what just faster we can save a little time there we go okay now just to get these plugged in first one motherboard or 24-pin atx power there you go there you go then we've got two peripheral we use both of these because we got quite a bit of little sata sada bad we've boys a 24-pin cpu another sata there we go then we've got two pci e there's one and there is two okay there's that there's all our cables ready to go into the hole there we go [Music] just gets hefty the moment you put a put a psu in it [Music] okay there's our wow stick you guys will see me from the top put this in smooth like butter just great tooling on of course there's stuff makes it really easy to install [Music] when you drop the screw screw or the stew or whatever you want to call it there we go and one more there you go okay now comes the fun part let's get all this stuff plugged in fun part so we have some i don't know how it's just going to be a little bit harder to cable manage just given what we have from a connection standpoint we could run this over here and then we have this and this just stuck in something there we go there's that and there's this one and there's okay so we have four that we had over here [Music] and then there's our hub okay we still have a cpu cable it's got to go over here so i might see about doing that and then how far we can make this go down and then like kind of create like a nice little channel here okay i have like a channel a cable here goes along the side let's grab our cpu cable right here this one connects to this there we are there we go okay that gets that kind of out of the way okay now we've got one more like random little this is like for the case or something i don't know get that hooked up here's all our satan now that's plugged in okay let's take screw that put that down in here so it's out of the way that way if we if he does install hard drives he's got sata like kind of stored where they're going to go okay next up we don't want these to be too tight right so this is like the biggest these are the important ones i don't want these like these like need a lot of room so by room i mean the cables i want to feel i want them to be pretty natural in terms of how they lay or your gpu cables are going to look all wacky unfortunately these are have a tendency to be some of the stiffest cables [Music] i might actually want to not use here i might not want to use this one you might want to use this one actually a little bit more bendy okay same thing with this one i'm going to use the bendier of the two sides we can have the cable be all wacky and cable management shoving it down here as much as we can okay last cable fortunately easiest slash thickest come on dude okay get that flat okay now technically everything is plugged in i'm going to fix the gpu cables because i'm pretty sure they're probably whacked out yep [Music] okay we're gonna fix this one with our normal little trick it's a four pin hold them together [Music] baby that should be good and it's not sticking out too bad over here okay let's pop this on make sure it closes keeping this from closing it should be nothing okay cool it's not quite wait it's not gonna hold but now that covers up okay put our back rear on now it's my hand okay okay ladies and gentlemen time to turn it on this looks good looks very good very happy with how it came out this one cable is like being problematic there we go okay cool do [Music] okay wow stick plug back in okay let us get this up guys can see it there it is boom and done build completed time to test it question is i'm hoping that one thing that could potentially be an issue is the fan hub i'm sorry the usb hub it's the only thing i'm a little nervous about i think everything else is fine boom and boom okay whoo five gifted subs 300 we're there let us i'm gonna do one thing real quick refresh because it's being wacky there it is i mean the color the fans look good the cables look good okay let's turn it on first step power switch and boom that's a good sound oh it's all on this is hitting this there it is completely powered up man that is a good looking machine now remember this is sideways because we have to we install it sideways let's fix it and cam but yeah this whole thing is on looks beautiful all the hub is working all the lights are on yeah it looks awesome oh man those fans look so good

week i mean on wednesday", "hNG9Pg-68KY": "hey what's up this is among us here this week is something that is definitely going to appeal to techware fans the snowpeak and new balance tokyo design studio rc4 this is the latest in a line of snow peak and new balance collapse the first of this particular silhouette came out at the tail end of 2019 well we're back here with a new version there was also a non-collab version of the rc4 as well which was a more sneaker-like design but these ones of course the mids looking a lot chunkier here and also now coming in this all-black colorway as if the last version black and blue wasn't black enough this is a feature-rich sneaker boot absolutely packed with different technologies and it certainly doesn't skimp on aesthetics either and as a result of that commands a relatively high price of 270 pounds or 320 so it better be pretty good let's take a look normally i talk about the look of a shoe first but with this every aesthetic detail has some kind of utilitarian or performance-centric feature behind it so it's not just about a technical aesthetic there is something behind that too that of course runs far deeper than the all-black colorway this thing is a bit bulky chunky it's clearly rugged looking and there's a whole bunch of different features that contribute towards that there is not a single element of this shoe that feels kind of delicate in any way the midsole and outsole are super oversized with this split at the back that only emphasizes the thickness at the back of there these things are gonna probably add an inch in height to you so uh for all you 511 boys out there this shoe's got you the outsole has nice thick vibram lugs which alone say wet weather rough terrain grip snow peak is very much a brand associated with the outdoors and camping in particular so it stands to reason that their sneakers be primed for exactly that kind of environment let's look at the upper though the blend of performance and aesthetics continues with the kinds of materials that are being used here the front half of the upper and toe box is cordial and nylon ripstop with a real feeling of durability and the diamond pattern having a slight sheen to it which brings that reinforcement to the forefront visually the toe cap is further reinforced with cow lever here which you'll also find at the heel that leather is actually an upgrade for this release specifically the old version didn't have this and it's definitely welcome here it gives a lot of resilience for treacherous terrain where you might find yourself kicking rocks or tree roots by accident whilst maintaining a level of comfort and certainly that luxury touch that's particularly welcome considering this shoe's price point but we'll come back to comfort in a bit more detail later because we've got some more materials to look at the other primary material used on the upper is neoprene which you'll find more at the top end of the shoe over the tongue for example and around the back towards the ankle too this of course provides greater comfort to those key areas which are naturally a bit safer from the demands of rough ground and indeed this neoprene is quite heavily padded at the top of the ankle at the base of the heel at the back of the shoe along with leather a plastic cage adds stability here and helps lock your foot in throughout these material changes give you a lot to look at from a textual perspective even when color wise it's all tonal the lace straps on each side and the laces themselves are more areas which contribute to that rugged utilitarian aesthetic these are fully attached to the shoe so there's no flapping about and makes it far stronger metal d-rings at the first and the last strap provide further reinforcement whilst having that aesthetic reference to outdoor gear the laces themselves kind of do this too with a thick rope-like construction with grey woven in resembling a blacked-out climbing rope like everything else on this shoe they don't feel like they're going to fall apart any time soon and it does come with a second pair of gray 3m laces as well if you're feeling fancy although to be honest i quite like the default ones all those things combined and a few other bits like some leather over the tongue here really make this feel like a maximalist shoe there's certainly a lot to look at every single inch of the shoe there is just something different on here and it's all of those design elements that's allowed the branding of the shoe to take a back seat strangely one of the most prominent things is this tiny little cordier tag at the top here of the ankle purely because it's the only non-black thing on the shoe you've got a few other examples of technologies here which have lent their branding to this shoe you've got the gore-tex logo here on the heel and below that the end cap reveal logo which is some of new balance's premiere midsole cushioning technology underneath you've got vibram and absorber logos here as well but you're not going to see those too often there's a woven new balance at the back here at the heel but there's one extra piece of branding which i thought was pretty cool and it's kind of hiding in plain sight you've got here these straps on each lateral side actually form the new balance signature n it's so well integrated with the design though it doesn't really look like branding at all so i thought that was a really cool solution to that problem one tiny other thing you've got the shoe model embossed on the leather part of the tongue here as well but that is so subtle you're not going to see it most of the time and how could we forget the only piece of snow peak branding on this shoe is uh just at the tip of this strap here which is uh yeah not too much they've hardly gone overboard branding wise with this collab one of the big aesthetic features though which is also rooted in performance is the fidlock v buckle that you'll find at the ankle this is something that's become quite popular in recent years with belts and bag straps in particular so it definitely feels like a kind of techware reference in that sense but how well is it actually implemented here i think it certainly looks fine there's so much else to look at on this shoe that doesn't really over centralize things i just think it sits there pretty nicely but of course we've got to know how well it actually works with this implementation the main benefit of the fidlock v-buckle is the speed of connection and detachment with the former it's definitely not quite as seamless as on a belt for example because there's just less travel here you have to exert a little bit more effort to actually pull the two ends of the buckle together to get them to lock however taking this off disconnecting it is still super easy you can just grab this and then pull it off straight away and that makes the shoe deceptively easy and quick to remove relative to how kind of chunky and protective it looks they also clearly thought about the tension that this would create because right around where this strap goes is where the neoprene at the ankle is at its thickest so despite this yeah helping to secure your foot in the shoe and it doesn't actually feel uncomfortable in any way comfort in general i feel has its ups and downs it's certainly a very supportive and a very stable feeling shoe and there's a lot going for it in that regard you've got that real nice chunky midsole you've got the big lugs there you've got of course the materials used as well with this lacing system that provides a fairly decent tightness as well i originally purchased these in a uk 11 which would normally be a us-12 or an eu-46 however new balance say that that's actually a u.s 11.5 or an eu 45.5 as a result i found those a little bit tight to be honest so i ended up sizing up and uh getting a uk 11.5 to fit my us or eu size so i'd say definitely stick to your regular us or eu size for these but even then these are a fairly narrow fitting shoe so if you've got feet that are on the wider side i would definitely recommend going half a size up on these and you can of course slack in the laces which does help a bit because it's really um laterally at the mid foot here where these you'll probably notice will be tightest but there's only a certain amount that that can do the upper of course is firmly in sneaker boot territory but with some appropriate material choices to help these be as comfortable as possible you've got the greatest reinforcement in the areas that need it that are most likely going to be seeing the most punishment over the toe box in particular but then with cordura here in these kind of mid-wear areas which is of course lighter weight but still very protective and then up at the top here where you're probably going to see less physical punishment they've really focused on comfort with the neoprene areas although the cordial part of the upper does have a little bit of rigidity to it i didn't find this to be an issue i still find this relatively comfortable and the toe box definitely has more movement in it than something like the feel 2 boot for example that i've been wearing a lot on hikes as well despite their look too this is a deceptively light shoe they feel noticeably less heavy than many of your average hiking boots and that's mostly thanks to the upper and the corder is relatively lightweight compared to its strength a lot of the weight here is coming from this midsole and outsole overall though it certainly didn't feel like it was weighing me down in any way thanks to the absorber foam and the end cap reveal tech which combined are some of new balance's premier cushioning technologies there is certainly a bit of give in these and some cushioning however this is combined with the vibram outsole which is really designed with durability and grip in mind and thus is really pretty hard i particularly noticed this at the back of the outsole on the heel where this semi-circle here kind of feels like it provides some slightly uneven pressure on the back to the point that it really does feel quite noticeable and this is certainly a better suited shoe to softer ground than walking around on pavement all day but clearly what's happening here is the fusion of two very separate technologies so that you're getting some level of cushioning and comfort without sacrificing that grip and durability of the vibram outsole i have to admit though that even after wearing these for a couple of hours on a hike where it's mostly soft ground i still felt that on the heels and the balls of my feet there was definitely a bit of extra pressure there to the point that my feet were feeling a bit sore by the end so i certainly wouldn't want to be wearing these on real hard ground anytime soon i'm hoping that these do kind of break in a bit and they end up being a little bit more comfortable but certainly at the moment yeah wearing these long term even on soft ground you definitely do notice that rigidity of the vibram outsole the use of gore-tex here is pretty appropriate relative to the use case the kinds of other materials being used here as well and it only exacerbates that feeling of performance and that ability to take these pretty much anywhere i walked through some pretty chunky puddles in these and surprisingly came out fine and i think this is probably my only shoe that would have achieved that it just shows the use of all these technologies is not just for the sake of adding labels to the box but to provide genuine utility and performance for the wearer it does also make this shoe relatively warm as well that's certainly something that i noticed and i wouldn't choose this shoe for the height of summer that's for sure they do retain heat fairly effectively as for the price there's a lot of materials and technologies on offer here which do go some way towards justifying that you've got vibram cordura gore-tex all of these third-party things are always going to add cost to a shoe and especially when you're combining that with the more high-end new balance technology specifically absorb and end cap reveal it being a collab as well is always going to increase the price that's just a fact and even aside from those branded technologies just all these other elements feel pretty sturdy and pretty well constructed it would be hard to ask for more really from a construction perspective however considering these are significantly more expensive than new balances made in u.s and made in uk lines i was a little bit surprised to see these made in china not because that's indicative of quality because as i say this is a pretty well constructed shoe but i just thought that considering the price of these considering their unique nature and i thought that they would have been made in a facility that new balance themselves associate with their more premium sneakers the new balance rc4 overall feels like it's got that really good balance between boot and sneaker it's got a lot of those performance elements things that are genuinely designed to provide utility whilst also having a much more sophisticated and a more futuristic look than what we typically expect from a hiking boot those performance elements are certainly more than skin deep there is a lot going on here which does actually work and do the thing that it's supposed to that does mean of course that from a comfort perspective alone these aren't necessarily the best thing you know for walking around in cities and stuff especially in the middle of summer i would certainly not be going to these but if you're thinking more for that cold wet use you're out on the trails you're doing a bit of walking around outside and something like this is potentially going to be right up your street particularly if you're into this utilitarian technical aesthetic from a performance perspective the priorities have clearly been towards water resistance stability grip durability all of those kinds of things and yeah that does mean that breathability isn't quite as hot and underfoot comfort as well is certainly not going to match many sneakers but i am hoping that these kind of break in a bit more over time i start finding them a bit more comfortable and yeah i expect it's just one of those features of a vibram outsole that that hardness is probably something that you'll notice but as i say the absorb foam the end cap reveal goes at least some way towards mitigating that these are going to be my hiking shoe of choice i think at least until it starts getting too warm and i just got to hope that that heel breaks in a little bit but that's everything on the new balance rc4 the snow peak collab let me know what you guys think of them are you a fan of these do you think they're too expensive they certainly are a pretty high price here is that going to put you off or do you think it's worth paying for and as always if you enjoyed the video please do give it a like because it is super appreciated and as always thank you so much for watching and we will be back next week with another video out to trolls and everyone else who corrected me that elio emile is in fact danish and not french that was my bad just because they're both french names or they're used in france that doesn't mean that he's french so uh yeah apologies for that era and shout out to noah big fan of bibora yeah i definitely hope that i can pick some of that stuff up in the future i'm going to be keeping my eye out for future releases that's for sure thanks for making it all the way to the end of the video there's going to be some more going up at the top if you want to check those out maybe some more sneaker reviews something like that and if you haven't subscribed yet but you want to see more cool technical stuff like these bad boys then definitely consider subscribing because there's going to be a whole lot more where these babies came from", "PVdoYQaZFHw": "and you're good uh good evening um at this time i want to call our regular monthly board meeting to order if you're joining us uh live stream welcome you too um it's time to join me for a moment of silence thank you this time we'll stand for the pledge of allegiance uh before i turn the meeting over to our superintendent for some comments so once again i want to thank everyone our staff and how they continue to work through all this and the great effort that everyone's put forward and um some of the information and has come down from the state which we'll discuss later tonight um i do appreciate the fact that our legislators are local ones you get in touch with us and ask for our opinion and um i do appreciate the fact that we weren't completely blindsided with everything and um we find out um tonight before i turn it over to dr kenny he's first time i guess in seven years but he's not here tonight uh even the superintendent can be quarantined but we want to welcome dr danny bazoom share your comments please thanks good board members just want to share a couple of things that happened over the last month over the past month had a chance to visit some classrooms through zoom and leadership reach program i've read to john lawrence elementary school had a chance to read to miss johnson this morning and sigmund's first grade classes in the past month and also got a chance to go to coleridge byway and zoom to regions mid second grade class in this clark's first grade class so i want to thank them at the principals of both schools for inviting me in anthony warden and katie henderson and coleridge anthony john lawrence i also want to know that we're in the final months of uh finishing up trinity middle school is scheduled to open on august 2021 and we are busily taking care of many staff in needs associated with trinity middle school as well as wheat moore middle school which is currently artstyle trinity middle but come july it will change to wheat more middle school i just want to make board members aware that as we mentioned back in the fall uh student assignment letters were mailed today to all fifth grade students at the feeder elementary schools telling them uh what school they'll attend also as soon as the grade six at braxton craven received letters will put in the mail today identifying their middle school and then the grade seven students who are currently at architectural trinity middle received a letter today who will be receiving letters placed in the mail today identifying where they'll be placed for uh middle school next year whether it be wheatmore middle or trinity middle school so we'll remind you that uh one more mentality of the schedule to be painted so training that will repeat more middle colors in closing i just want to mention uh we do have spring break just around the corner march 27 through april 4. and i just uh want to know the following safety issues as we all head to spring break and one reminds students and staff and parents uh we continue to focus on safety and so we can come back from spring break and have a strong finish to the school year i want to remind everybody that call of face coverage will be expected at times on campuses and at athletic events i've we've been able to have athletic events because of the cooperation we've had for many people uh with our safety protocols i want to remind everybody as we come back from spring break uh the first day is a remote learning day april 5th so the only people on campus will be uh staff april 6th the students will return and cover the 19th century break we ask that you stay home and call the school on those days and ask for next steps if you've been around somebody in your house who has covered the 19th century they ask that you stay home those after spring break can call your school and see what next steps are same if you've been exposed to someone who's positive we ask that you stay home and and call and we will give you next steps from your school on what your next steps are and finally if you are positive because 19 please stay home and uh do not come staff from the fifth or students on six until you contact your school and let's discuss next steps um uh the last item is still in play if you travel out of the country when you return uh from out of the country you will be expected to quarantine for 14 days so if there are travel plans in spring break out in the country please know that make your school aware of that and just we just need everybody's help we know the number one thing we've wanted since august 17 and actually well before august 17 often last spring and then all through the summer and that we uh uh were very clear with everybody on august 17th we opened school for students on campuses that was a great day uh we would love to have them full but we did open school day one uh and have been doing that ever since and today was day 130 of the 2020 2021 school year i'm very proud of that i'm very proud of this board i'm very proud of our staff and our students and our parents because it's been a tremendous effort by everybody to get today 130. so i know we're going to have a big discussion tonight about what's next for the randolph county school system but i just want to remind you that all you board members all of our parents all of our students and all of our staff have been nothing short of champions this year in getting to day 130 it would have been very easy very easy to start on plan soon but the randolph county school system didn't do that randolph county school system so the toughest road we could take because we wanted to do what's happening now for kids during the school day as well as outside the school day we're beginning to see kids enjoy activities that were taken away from them last year this time so mr chair that concludes my comments for tonight thank you dr danny um i know he was talking about what a good job our staff and all done i know kindergarten restoration going on now i was looking at some of the um i guess he said each elementary school put out a little program have you looked at them or any of you you should look at them i mean they're really they could have easily just bypassed that but they went out and kind of invited and made it special like each school they really did a great job i mean it was kind of made a couple of made me want to go back to school but i'll probably get over it okay at this time i need a motion to approve the february 15 20 21 minutes so i have a second okay all those in favor say aye i'm emotional um at this time we don't have any recognitions tonight so we're going to move on to uh i have uh ryan debary signed up for public comments if you like to come up you have three minutes meeting board i'm ryan deberry a citizen of randolph county and apparently two students in the school system you oversee based on feedback my wife and i received after last month's meeting i believe my concerns and interests align with most parents and many teachers in the randolph county school system north carolina legislation is finally addressing the issue of getting kids back in the classroom i hope our community will be the example of how to do just that bring kids and keep kids in the classroom my thoughts go beyond that tonight i have many questions to ask how can we overcome self-censorship it seems many parents and teachers alike create echo chambers and discuss problems they see with no results ever to be found from their closed loop system i did not know if we are afraid to address those in charge or we do not have the energy to tackle these areas of concern maybe there is fear of negative consequences for speaking our minds most people may simply not know where to start how can we work as a community to create open dialogue how do we educate people about education who's in charge what board or individual makes the rules who signs the paperwork who can make changes when necessary who decides if school closes early or a full day for severe weather how do we get the people that vote for the members of this board to even know who you are so many of us feel the government is too big to change the part we forget is we are the government we need the people we elect individuals to represent us for protection and betterment of our communities there is such a disconnect with who is on the ballot and the person filling in the bubble next to the name i want for parents teachers boards commissioners to find a better way forward i believe on both sides of the coin we feel we are doing our best let us devise a plan to make it possible for both sides of the coin to be seen at the same time transparency of what is happening and how it is happening though i admit my late start of trying to understand this process i wish these meetings were full of committed members of our community and those ready to voice concern provide praise and rape to get involved to see change let me write this but i'm the only person that showed up on that very interesting in the middle of a pandemic and all the stuff that's going on but nobody's here i know the last commissioner's meeting the health department the school board were both addressed while all three parties are working hard it appeared not all three parties were insane my wife often assumed that i know all our upcoming events and i could assure you i do not my point of the evening is let us not assume let us figure out how to create synergy in our community students and staff parents and officials held ford school board all working together with as much input and connectivity as possible to not be a negative nancy which a lot of my friends might think i am but i do want to add that i'm glad they live here i'm glad our schools are more open than most and while randolph county is not afraid of change we do it in a conservative way i know this past year has been a learning curve for us all i'm guilty of assuming it will correct itself sooner than later i also believe you have a community behind you if you find the right way to ask for their help so thank you for your honestly i think we've we've been working our rear ends off trying to do the right thing for students staff and um i'm sorry some people feel that we have it but you know what i know for a fact our superintendent spent up all hours of the night and trying to contact tracing we started out august 17th kids in school we didn't hide in the basement what until two weeks ago put kids back in school we've done a good job we tried and we made everybody happy i don't know how you make everybody happy during the pandemic but um i want you to know this board has put to 100 percent of their heart in it do the right thing for kids and uh we care about our staff as well i'm sorry and i wish i don't know any other way our superintendents in quarantine i don't know how you fix that there's rules there's guidelines we have to abide by and you know we have to do that i mean we have no choice and when raleigh has something down you know what we have to find a way to make that work too so i mean it's not a perfect situation i mean there could be a whole room full of people here tonight to throw x or whatever you want to about us but i don't have all the right answers but i'm going to tell you something i'll defend this board and i'll defend that superintendent's staff at the end of the day that we tried our best thank you moving on now to um adoption of the agenda and evolution i have a second today all those in favor say uh first up for information items dr danny okay board members i bring you tonight um gifts or information items uh the first uh 15 gifts were attracted towards the volleyball program at northeast randolph middle school i put them all on one uh one memo because they came in between the 24th of february and the 5th of march i did accept them on behalf of the board i already did them uh quickly uh stephanie adkins 300 william j anderson a hundred dollars eric and alicia brown 150 david denise davis 200 curtis and alondra um weighed a hundred dollars michael and cora wiseman 100 adam lambert's 600 dollars penthouse farm 150 rodney betsy moody 200. kelly and kelly hathcock 100 james rad davis 150 main street girl a hundred dollars wandez myth fifty dollars kelly and shane whitaker fifty dollars and randy and kelly coleman two hundred dollars i did i hope i did not miss anybody that should be 15. um i want to say thank you to all those individuals who made donations to the volleyball program at northeastern randolph middle school again no gift was more than five thousand dollars full power before policy eight two two zero for a gift that's five thousand dollars or less i can accept that on behalf of the school system and um bring that to you as information item the emails from the principal dana albright johnson are behind my memoir also bringing tonight a gift from archdeal trinity middle school on march 4 bruce carroll the principal at arsenal trinity middle school made me aware of a gift from kevin jordan from boat foods in our store in the amount of 375.35 it was given to the school to be used on any need of the school i accepted this on the 4th of march again being 5 dollars or less i'll bring this information item and i accept it on behalf of the board critical policy eight two two zero and then finally um have a gift you already read on february 16 brian hill principal your age 612 uh made me aware of a gift of one thousand dollars from run five feet five organization given to a school to be used for the backpack program and for his summer feeding program this if that day on february 16 and again i bring that to you tonight's information item since it is five thousand dollars or less per more policy to zero so mr cook uh we appreciate everybody who's giving us gifts and donations to our schools and we'll continue to bring this forward as of as we're aware of those so that concludes that presentation [Music] thank you seems like people i mean even during tough times they have really been very given this year we appreciate it and um the run five thanks to everybody that run five feet five i guess that's the one yes based out of our still trinity is that correct that's that's really nice of them to go down to you already we really appreciate that okay next up is uh toddler for the finance and budget report this is steve we always look forward to hearing from you especially if it's good news welcome you look forward to the auditor speaking i mean we're doing it right you all know you have a copy of your financials i think electronically yes sir again this year as a previous year you have received excuse me is hot um you have received an unmodified opinion on your authenticity they clean our opinion in our in our own fashion if you'll turn to page 13 in the financials for scroll 13 is the page number at the bottom of the page not on the pdf this is exhibit 3 the balance sheet for all governmental funds which includes the school system this statement is an overall view of the financial position of random county school system on june 30 2020. the first line item has taught cash and cash equivalents for all governmental funds of 7 million 893 822 is up in prior year 1.4 million or 21 percent due from other governments the next lineup seven million one hundred eighty four thousand twenty one dollars which consists mostly of grants owed to the school system and your sales tax refund on your purchases during the year is up 2.4 million or 50 from last year now most of this is due to this increases to reimbursements randolph county for costs you incurred in the new trinity middle school the accounts receivable item of 174 thousand 54 dollars is up 20 percent of the price inventories of eight hundred nine thousand two hundred five dollars is up three percent of the prior year overall your total assets increased approximately three point four million or twenty seven percent prior the next section down liabilities determine plus resources and fund balances the liabilities section for total liabilities of seven million four hundred sixty nine thousand four fifty dollars increase two point five million or 50 from last year and this increase is also due to payables incurred for the new trinity middle school at the end of last year next section down fundamental section for all governmental plans the fund balance amount of 10 million 525 941 of which the general fund is included increased last year 1.3 million now the fund balance section is broken up in a different category that you can see some the non-spendable section is assets that you can't really convert to cash if you needed to use it the restricted amounts are amounts that are restricted by law or contributors economic user specific purposes the unassigned amount is what you have available for any purpose the general fund balance of 8 million 169 263 increase from last year 1.2 million now the amount available for appropriation of the general fund which this number's not on financials is a statutory calculated amount it's five million two hundred fifteen thousand turn ninety dollars which is twenty point six percent of your current expenditures which is well above the eight percent that the local government commissioner wants to see now last year your percentage is 15.4 percent so you've added more to your available fund balance this past year now the next page page 14 you'll find a statement of ranges and expenditures from governmental funds total governmental revenues of 161 million 252 655 decreased 9.7 million or 6.4 most of this increase is from reimbursements from randolph county where the cost incurred the new journey middle school last year total governmental expenditures for 161 million 338 thousand seven thirty seven dollars increased a little over eight million for the same reason cost incurred in expenditures for the history meal score and that amount had increased now page 17 is a statement net position for your school food service fund your total assets are 4 million 795 six dollars decreased six hundred eighty one thousand one or seventy five dollars twelve point four percent last year the cash and cash equivalents at the top of four million one or six five thousand one or seven dollars decreased by a little over 700 000 or 144 from last year the next item down due from other governments of 178 175 this includes grant reimbursements for your free and reduced meals and also your sales tax refund increased 22.8 last year the inventories of 189 444 increased approximately 75 thousand or 64 last year you'll notice an item there net okay of liability the item there the very opposite resources 1.4 million this represents the amount of contributions that the renault county school system permitted to the state teachers retirement system for current your contribution to that system this amount also consists of deferrals of amounts related to the pension and other post-employment benefits your opinion the benefits you provide your employees after they retire there's amounts including that amount of 1.4 being also for that total liabilities of 808 million fifty-eight thousand two hundred twenty-two dollars increased a little over two hundred thousand from last year this is due to a little bit of an increase of that amount that's owed to the state for teachers retirement systems those are not state positions as far as funded by the state position you know right there so local county money is that correct all oped is is a actual aerial evaluated amount it's an estimate of what your potential liability is future future liabilities and unfunded can you probably return unfunded that's what it is okay this is just a possibility of what you might have the amount you see there under non-current liabilities of five million six hundred fifty nine thousand one hundred sixty one dollars faster than that okay liability now your total net position at the bottom of the page is a deficit of 4 million 564 thousand 598 that deficit increased a little above 7 000 since last year now you know as well as i do with the pandemic in school kids not being able to go to school then some of the revenues were lost due to meals not being served etc and that's generated part of that loss and on page 19 the next page this is a statement of revenues expenses and changing the money position for school food services now as i just mentioned the revenues at the top 1 million 564 thousand 14 dollars decreased a little over five hundred thousand dollars or twenty seven percent from last year and that's why because of the lackluster meal now your operating expenses of eight million one hundred thirty nine thousand six hundred five dollars decreased six hundred five thousand from the last year or seven cents the net of these two created an operating loss of six million five hundred seventy four thousand six hundred ninety one dollars and offset this deficit you receive government reimbursements under the non-operating revenue section federal reimbursements that lower five million state 38 000 modernist donations of 454 000. this created an overall deficit for the year net income of 17 717 eight dollars if there's any questions i'll try and answer that all right thanks for clearing mud thank you thank you now it's toddler's time [Music] good evening board members tonight for your information i would like to present the 2021-2022 proposed budget so in your packet you'll see the superintendent's budget message and then you'll see a summary of our local budget request for the 21-22 school year on the current expense side we have two requests continuation costs totaling 518 thousand dollars you see there the items that make up the continuation cost and then the supplement increase of 0.25 for all classifications and an additional 0.25 for classified employees and additional flat dollar amounts for supervisors and directors totaling 510 000. so the total current expense request budget is one billion twenty eight thousand dollars on the capital outlay side an additional one hundred thousand dollars is being requested for the nine year facility plan so the total current expense and capital outlay request would be an additional 1 million 128 000 the next page outlines two current expense revenue items county appropriations the request would be 21 million 542 073 that represents the million 28 000 increase and then fines and forfeitures for now we would leave flat at 1v150 000 so a total current expense budget 22 million 692.073 the median 28 000 increase from the county commissioners would represent a 5.01 increase in the appropriation the next several pages outlines the current expense budget and basically in the difference column where you see increases it will either be for teaching supplements classified supplements administrator supplements matching increases for retirement and insurance and then some additional continuation cost increases whether it be property services um charter school expense items like that so i'm not going to go over these in in detail but as we turn the pages if you have questions please please stop me if we look at page 7 that is the final page of the current expense budget once again 22 million 692 073 are there any questions on the current expense before i move on to capital outlay the uh the money from the fines and forfeitures is it i don't keep it saying is it running ahead behind yeah yeah it's running it's running behind um it's been it's been coming in uh low since the uh pandemic okay so so we finished a year last year a little off on that revenue so far we we're not up to where we need to be i have i have seen some increases in that revenue in the past couple months so if we finish the year strong there we'll get close to that 1 million 150 mark if if not then we probably the last couple months of this year could potentially be a good predictor for for next year so we may have to adjust that item a little bit that revenue item a little bit for next year you may have to take it down but we'll we'll cross that bridge when we get there i'd like to see get the full 12 months under our belt for this year to see what that number comes in at and to clarify the fails on our experience we're all delayed for many many months and a lot of them are still delayed so that's the fines and forfeitures numbers okay capital outlet the request on the current appropriation would be 2 million 162 426 the construction capital piece or better known as the nine-year facility plan would be 950 000 representing the 100 000 increase and then activity bus revenue the in-house revenue that we generate from from use of bus at the school level we're going to keep it at 100 000 we won't have anywhere near that much money this year of course but that item kind of stands alone in the budget it doesn't affect the other items in the in the capital outlay budget we use we use that revenue to purchase and repair and paint new activity buses therefore if we have the revenue we move forward on those on those processes if we don't that's fine it doesn't affect the other items in the in the capital outlay budget total capital outlay budget 3 million 212 426 the increase of 100 000 in the in the appropriations would be a 3.32 increase from the commissioners page 9 represents the expense side of the budget and basically we tweaked about four line items based on the proposed projects for next year a lot of which will revolve around that facility maintenance or repair plan page 10 would be the child nutrition revenues 10 million 627 500 keeping that budget the exact same as it was this year you'll notice at the top of the revenue page 5.8 million dollars of the school lunch program we basically flip-flop that revenue from the emergency summer feeding program just because that's the way the revenue has been coming down to it since we've been in the pandemic so assuming next year will be somewhat back to normal we want to budget that revenue in the appropriate line item the next two pages represent the expense budget for child nutrition and we've just changed a couple of line items once again 10 million 627 500 is the proposed budget next page at tax once again uh keeping this budget the same 2 million 348 300 same as last year once again what we'll do is we'll see how the revenue comes in at year end and so when we bring a final budget to for approval maybe in august we can tweak some of these revenue numbers typically in the at tax budget the revenue comes in higher than what's what i've projected [Music] on page 14 i've added trinity middle school to the coaching and athletic expense allotments you'll see those changes there and at the bottom of the page i've increased the contingency fund line item to a total thirty one thousand nine forty seven that's really just a balancing number for this budget so when i have excess revenue that's where the additional revenue goes page 15 outlines the school budgets based on a total projected allotment of 4243 for the schools in that area 200 per student overall the allocation would be fifty thousand dollars less than the current year just based on projected numbers and historically we do uh adjust those school allotments to ten day numbers um per council [Music] 2 million 348 300 total budget for 18 tax and then the last one would be fund 8 these are the special revenues that we do not have to share with the charter schools and i've increased that budget by twenty eight thousand dollars for a total of two eight nineteen and really the only reason i did that was to cover a proposed salary increase at the state level if something like that comes through and then also the matching flag and retirement on those pieces so on page 17 you see the expense items we have the rotc program we have the nurse grant from the state the driver's education that's the in-house revenues once again on driver's education if we're back to our normal year we can easily see that 75 thousand dollars in revenue there and then the partnership for children program the nc pre-k program and energy expense just around out that budget so we split the energy costs between current expense fund two and current uh funded current expense two million eight hundred nineteen thousand dollars to fund a budget so are there any questions about any any portion of the proposed budget it's pretty pretty similar to what we what we've done in the past okay all right thank you thanks dog okay kathy what the hell birthday here's the next contestant good evening board members and dr gainey thank you for this opportunity to present the 2020 2021 december stakeholder survey information i don't know i don't know [Music] so as you all are aware north carolina legislation was passed last year on may 2020 that required all public school units to implement a remote instruction learning plan for the 2021 school year these plans were required to cover 15 components and of that it talked about stakeholder feedback so as a part of our remote instruction plan that we submitted to the state department regular surveys of stakeholders was included particularly in regards to technology needs connectivity and remote learning so the curriculum instruction team used previous surveys that we had used at the end of 1920 and other sample surveys to create short concise surveys to gather information for continuous school improvement we created surveys that asked similar questions across all three stakeholder groups and these groups included parents students and staff so i should be on slide four if you're trying to keep up with me at this point i kind of slave it off in my notes so i think that'll work out so we deployed these surveys on december 7th and they stayed up for about a week the survey links were placed on district and school websites along with district social media sites principals were asked to announce the surveys and their weekly school messenger phone calls and then we compiled the results and shared those with leadership curriculum instruction directors principals and assistant principals so i'm going to talk for a few moments about the survey the participation and some of the what nows or results that we saw so only a small percentage of our stakeholders actually participated in the surveys we had 435 staff who participated 798 students and 1 1982 parents and of those parents there could be some duplicity because we ask that parents complete a survey for each of the students in their home knowing that some students may be in different grade levels at different schools so we wanted to make sure that we honed in on the information for each individual student and group level so observations in some ways we saw some agreement in some areas and in some places we saw that there seemed to be a gap in information between the stakeholder groups for example 80 of staff stated students have to share devices while 70 to 80 percent of the students and parents who completed the survey stated that students do not have to share devices well and again these are all based off of those who participate 79.5 of the staff stated google meets are conducted on days when students have remote instruction whereas only 63.5 percent of students and 58 of parents agreed with this statement a greater number of parents and students cited not understanding coursework as an obstacle to students completing work compared to what staff stated so in a series of questions we asked about the obstacles that students faced in completing work on remote instruction days the highest rated obstacle for the staff responses was sharing a device the highest rated obstacle for students was actually not understanding work parents stated that no obstacles existed as their highest rated statement with closely following behind understanding the work being a second so when we ask students about receiving assistance or we ask about students receiving assistance from others the staff rated teachers is the main source of assistance at 63.9 percent only 28.4 percent of students and 26.4 percent of parents who completed the survey agreed with the statement that the main source of assistance was the teacher the students rated no one in other words they did their work on their own as their number one answer and nearly half of the parents stated that the parents are the main source of assistance for students all stakeholder groups did agree that a majority of students complete assignments using both paper pencil and online resources so what what's next what are we doing with that data so the data has been shared with the various stakeholder groups that i listed earlier a high school student focus group has been formed to further study student engagement and how we might better help students and planning is occurring right now for forming other focus groups other additional focus groups across stakeholder groups the media and technology department continues to offer professional development and support with google meets canvas and other resources for online and remote learning and we will revisit these questions and restructure some of the questions as we saw some some difficulty with them in the survey for our next survey notice i said earlier we wrote in regular surveys so one of the things we're looking at is not only what does the survey tell us but what have people told us about the questions and difficulty with the questions so we're planning for more surveys to come and we're also planning ways to increase the participation in these surveys questions i think this answer is a lot of maybe the question there uh public comments published today where he said you know about participation people feeling that they use the word self-censorship well they're not participating in this they're probably not as interested in that either yeah it seems like a big disconnect between our teachers parents and students and their answers i mean they're like exact opposites i like some of them in some questions it seemed that way yes for those who participate in the survey so i can if i have it broken down by grade stand level i do um but as far as looking in general there's such small numbers so i can tell you in terms of one of the things i remember off the top of my head is the piece about parents um about assistance more elementary stated that the parents were offering assistance than you saw in high school right which i would venture to say is what i expected to see when you were breaking that information down but i did i tried to disaggregate the information out by gradespan level as well that information was shared with leadership um so i do have some of that information broken there the one that sticks out i guess it's the first one there the the teachers assume they don't have devices i don't know if that's the students telling the teachers that or i mean and then the parents and the students are saying we do have advices we do have options right those two that's just like a polar opposites i mean that's kind of i don't know i mean yeah i mean the other thing you let's go ahead dog uh the other thing we've got when you look at these survey results too is um this was december and if you uh what i've seen now compared to then or compared to october is totally different i think i would have to say that our teachers have continued to work to refine their abilities to do what was a very daunting task early on and um so i don't know what the next round of survey results will show but i would i've said all along i didn't think we'd be in the same place in march or april as we were in august i'm i'm convinced of that what i've seen in schools um it's taken it has taken us a while but that's understandable it's if we hate that it might have taken you know time but you know we overnight we're put into this remote learning uh situation but i'm really proud of the continued growth of the staffs at all levels um so when i look at december to what i saw in february and march and schools um it's not the same and it's it's uh credit to our teachers and our principals our lead teachers just continuing to work with curriculum staff to to continue to try to get better in our areas so i think too when the next survey done is like sharon was talking about when we were getting answered questions it needs to be broke down high school middle school and elementary because when you throw that out there and you have a big difference between what teachers are saying and what the parents and kids are saying and you don't distinguish where it's coming from that makes it look a whole lot lopsided than what it actually it is and it don't portray the true statistics of it all i mean because when i look at that i'm sitting here thinking somebody ain't telling the truth you know but if you break it down like it needs to be it will explain itself yeah you may have elementary kids that don't have access to their own computer and that's not the case ever but high school made probably more with reference to the access to computer there is still a gap between the data and what is presented it varies by grade stand level as you mentioned it does vary in that for example um if i'm looking at elementary 40.2 percent have a computer was stated by parents student results 34.8 percent have a computer elementary staff results 25.9 most have a device so you do there's still some gap between the answers but it is different at the great space levels the gap does a little different at the grade span levels we're definitely there for high school all you can do well and like dr davey said i think when we deploy the next survey i think we will get we'll get different answers because we are in a different place in march than we were even in december really a lot less important i know people are understanding more yeah i mean everybody's come together and a lot better now that's good any more questions is google needs is that used uh what grade those is that all three levels okay all okay levels thank you thank you thank you bill thank you thank you thank you thank you kathy you're right kathy speaks i just i speak to something that uh where kathy's group is really looking on looking at something that could be thank you for randolph county school system moving forward and i'm very excited and i just want to say thank you kathy and her curriculum group for the stuff that's been going on for the last month and a half or so we hope to bring you some more stuff in april uh uh for complete uh proposal direction but uh that's gonna come off what kathy's gonna talk to you today but i just wanna say thank you kathy and your group because um for the first time during this pandemic i feel like we're really uh looking at a game changer here that can be a game nature for a long time for our school system for the needs of kids because we've gotten past the idea that you know we've got we have plenty of kids who are participating in activities who are 100 promoter and we've we've gotten past that and handled that and so now uh we all hurt another situation moving forward another scenario environment with with the remote learning okay thank you dr gaining good evening board members um in early february dr gainey tasked the curriculum and instruction department with looking at the option of the randolph county school system creating a virtual academy for next school year so that is the work that we have been doing one of the very first things that we did was to engage with our school board attorneys to have a conversation about the legalities of setting up a virtual academy we look closely at the number of students in our school system that are fully remote there are 3648 students across the three greats fans that right now are fully remote students so we've looked at various companies had conversations with other school districts gathered some information from other school districts as we tried to determine our next steps and what we have decided is that the next thing we need to know is who is interested what parents are interested in um having a fully remote option for their students next year so we would like to survey our community and find out we have a two question survey and in full transparency one of the questions on this survey has to do with summer school because that just happens to be another plate that curriculum instruction is spinning right now um waiting for the state to give us some guidance but the question that relates to remote instruction reads as follows i would like for my child to attend face-to-face learning for the 2021 2021-21-22 school year that's one choice i would like for my child to participate in a fully online option for the 2021-22 school year and we would like to deploy that survey this week so that we can get it back and look at those numbers to determine what the direction needs to be we've talked about a k-8 um virtual school we've talked about the fact that we have ilearn currently which um is basically what we use for high school we have access to the courses that i learned we have ccp we have ncbps we have apex for credit recovery and some initial credit apex can be used for so we're weighing those options for what we need to do but in order to target to get more granular about where we go from here we need to know what the numbers are and we need to know what grade spans are going to be most impacted questions well listen start with i'm 100 i'm 100 against the summer school option percent against that i think our teacher's been through enough uh but the survey option is an awesome idea i think that's going to help us get back in school and uh be able to find out where we're at with the remote learning about how many kids we got that went for boat learning and hopefully come august we're going to get back in school five days a week and we can still offer that remote option uh stop having the teachers if we have a and you're talking about this remote virtual just be clear you're talking about a separate group of teachers not not a teacher that's teaching in school five days a week it's going to be a separate group the goals the goal mr biggs is to have a standalone school that is a virtual academy that would um service the remote only students so that teachers would not be teaching hybrid instruction i think that's great i think our teachers would love that and i'm for it miss mr biggs [Music] uh one of the things about the summer school uh two weeks ago tonight i was in the commissioner meeting and spoke um i'll be very clear with anybody who wants to talk about it uh our principals are tired our teachers are tired support staff's tired our school system is tired um you just have to what kathy's doing with that question is we know there's pending legislation about a required summer school i am very concerned about that and i would tell i've already spoken to that i know i'm talking publicly now and i spoke publicly two weeks ago our teachers had bitcoin added since august 17 and worrying about it from many months prior to that as of our principals our assistant principals our counselors you name and support staff central service staff so i concur with you mr biggs we just have to get in a position to know what that would be pending this legislation and then we can all look at that when it comes there's been two pieces of legislation out there that have been kind of up in the air for a while one of which is what we're going to talk about in a little while but the summer school issue um we don't know what we're going to be required to do from the state but i concur with you mr biggs and that our staff's tired and and um they're tired because uh many of them uh came in on august 17 and many were still anxious but they did what was right for kids from day one and um for that they'll always be champions of my heart because uh this this tend to be difficult so kathy's gonna grab that data um i'm so proud of what they're talking about with this virtual academy we're looking at something for k5 or a8 because we don't have we've got we have stuff at the high school level but we're in a position to do it right and i know a lot of people were you know running to do this last summer last spring but we're in a position right now to do it right and that's what um i'm so excited to see the work and just just talking to kathy about the conversation they've had and you're right it would be a stand-alone school we intend to apply for a school number we intend to have a physical space but we're going to flesh that out more in the next month and bring that to you in a package probably in april so i don't want to get too much into kathy's work because she's much more uh skilled at this than i am but i'm very proud of the conversations have already occurred and i think this could be as i said it can be a game changer for our school system in many many ways because i don't think having a remote option for children is going to go away now there may be i have to at some point be a limit on how many remote seats are available but we'll get to that down the road we're also going to talk about if you go to the remote virtual academy you're there for a window time you can't come back and forth but we've got to do something for our teachers uh they stepped up and did uh the unbelievable this year and they're still doing it every day and the principals have been right in there with them sister principals counselors everybody support staff uh you can't question what's happened here since august 17 but i would tell you i would question if somebody said it started long 17 as it did it started last year this time when people continued to worry about what was going to happen with kids in the coming months and years so kathy thank you kathy brought me the survey the other day and i just didn't want uh y'all in a position of having to read it from his email she and i talked and felt like the best way to make you aware of it was just bring it tonight and she's going to kick this thing off i guess tomorrow kathy is that right if you say go sir i'm ready i'm ready if you are we'll get it we'll see what's going on with it with the data i got i got a question on the survey um you know you say we have over 3 000 kids totally remote are those 3 000 kids gonna be directly contacted and my feeling is if you don't you're gonna have the same reaction we have with this survey where it's gonna be a very few who actually fills it out even when you come back next year out of 3 000 kids you got 300 who said yeah i'm going remote then you come up again next year boom there says 3 000 kids it wants to be remote again my feelings if you don't contact them individual remote students you're going to be blindsided by this you're going to have more kids won't be on remote than you actually know about and also in the but also within that survey i think dr gainey answered the question but in that survey is there going to be an understanding if they go remote they are remote yes yes the survey doesn't specify that the survey is simply to gather information about who is interested okay and i i i agree with mr bowles we have to do some work to ensure that we're getting to the students who are fully remote so that we can get an answer from them that is where principals and counselors and folks in the schools on the ground can help us with that to so that they can make sure that they're sending out messages to families to fill out the survey get the survey done then once we see what we have because the survey also allows us to look and see what school they came from how many elementary middle what grade levels they came from it's going to be work to get this information i do agree with you uh mr bowles but i think that that is the only way we can move forward is to try to pin the numbers as closely as we can then [Music] once we gather all the information and we know what grade levels are going to be impacted and we make a decision about what company we are going to use for curriculum because we are going to purchase a curriculum for the re for the virtual academy once we make that decision then we are going to develop a memorandum of understanding that is between the parent and the school system about what things need to happen and in that memorandum is where we would put when you commit to us you commit to us for a year does that make sense that makes sense but going back and forth i think is rough on the teachers the administration for everybody else i think they should know right up front when they make that decision that's their decision to stick with it we've got a ways to go before we get there but we've we've thought about those things we've asked questions about those we have some copies of memorandums of understanding that other school systems have used and of course we will run everything through our attorneys before we make any of those decisions and it's just saying i'm i didn't hear you when you said in the survey but uh absolutely uh this is not going to be a back and forth if you select the virtual academy you're going to be there you have to commit to it that's one thing i've been excited to watch our staff uh work with the remote kids uh this year and they've handled this especially the extracurricular activities of students who have been remote but participating with activities uh i think they've handled it marvelously it's just been it's been great so we've we've crossed that that uh bridge too so uh but we're gonna have to have a commitment because we can't you're exactly right we can't have back and forth that we've learned that and we're not gonna we're not going there again mr big up mr biggs i want to clarify something for you the reason that i shared with you that there's a question on the survey concerning summer school is because we need to know what parents are interested in some school yes or some school no yeah i understand that and i appreciate that i just we just heard and and that we feel i mean lockstep with dr gaming just the outcry of people that's been busting their tail all year and they're like please don't do this to us and so that's what we feel i think gary you're going to speak on that with that my theory on that i would hope you know i would really have a problem with that being shoved down our throat since we started school on august 17th and uh you know some systems have just started back in the last couple of weeks so i would hope this board would have the opportunity if that i mean i would like to stand up against it if that's what raleigh wants us to do i would like to try to take a stand if we can't was a resolution or something that we don't participate if we can do that elizabeth i mean i would like to well we'll keep an eye on it it's all going to depend on what actually you know gets faster we'll certainly give you all your options we'll see we would just like to have the data to support your chairman cook frank can i ask that i know you mentioned something um about virtual reform maybe is that kind of what you had in mind uh yeah that's pretty much i think obviously it's like so it's a big process to get there even i can understand that so uh of the how many 100 percent remote students we have you said 2300 3648. do we know of those 3648 how many of them are k7 i know that 901 of them are k5 i know there's one thing you think about kathy what what do you think um what do you expect from multnet remote next year i mean i know you you wonder you've got to wonder what i think it'll be high i don't know i just don't know either it's tough that's hard to figure i mean i i'm gonna play one out here y'all may already know the answer adopted and you may know it from the athletic commission are we going to allow students to play athletics and be fully remote if we're in school five days a week is that something they have i don't see that that that was the piece i was talking about with we'll have to look at our um i've got to look back at our that's the home school policy uh being enrolled with us but if they're enrolled with us we have students right now that um uh high school students right now that may not even be coming to a campus because with ccp classes and virtual public school um so i don't see that as a barrier we'll make sure we're being compliance with our policy but i don't see a barrier there i can't think of one that's what i was talking about right now we have 100 most students right now that are playing athletics and i think the schools have handled that very well i think it's going to be a while before a lot of these parents want their children to go back to school full-time i mean even next year things are normal as we say i just think i think it's gonna be a lot for me but i'm thinking i think we're going to have a transition i think we're going to have to transition what the role is for remote because um we're going to eventually not have remote because of the pandemic we'll have remote because of people's interests and um i believe that's going to still be there even when the pandemic has passed a home i think will be required by the state to always always offer a remote option for children and so i want to make sure we get out in front of this and have a good vehicle because we have good vehicles at the high school level but as you go from ninth grade down and that plays because the high school is so much about credit and of course credit situation but as you start going down to new orleans elementary it's it's are not vehicles for for it to to sustain like like maybe a virtual cabinet i know you discussed the part of what the recommendations are going to be once you'll get the survey back correct yes sir okay uh also when that survey comes in will there be when you send out the recommendations of the remote academy and you thought that you said several different companies correct well will there be a time frame on the remote academy like during the day like when they set it up from nine to three or eight to two or how does that work all of the companies that we've talked to thus far they do have time frames for when they're going to do ela when they're going to do math and when social studies is offered when science sciences offered we have some flexibility with that to craft those times to meet more of what our pacing in our school system is because what you have to remember is that these companies are national companies they do this work all across the country and each school system that purchases from them then has the opportunity to craft the coursework to fit their school system so yes it is a lot of work mr burgess to get this done but we do appreciate the fact that you support what we're doing we appreciate the fact that um [Music] i certainly appreciate the fact that i have an awesome um team that they are wickedly smart and they are constantly coming up with ideas and suggestions about how to do this um and i look forward to being able to come back in april and share with you what we found out and where we're headed personally i think i'm a little surprised our numbers are as um as low as they are as far as 3 000 um [Music] well i mean because i mean i'm just i'm i'm using what little myth i have to you know estimate this but i'm figuring okay looks like maybe about half of those okay eight and um i don't think i mean i think if we are released to come back five days a week okay i don't we're not gonna have as many do that and then even i'm all for having some kind of virtual cabinet and do that but i'm also gonna say we're gonna spend millions of dollars on something that is gonna be for about three or four hundred students and that's i mean i'm very interested to see how the survey comes out there's no so we can we can't do it if we get results this survey but uh i'm very interested to see you know if we're on and just like trace that we have to have those uh those fifteen hundred and three thousand whatever that's in the especially in that ka i mean uh you know to see what they're interested in being affordable okay is there anything else kathy we appreciate you and your team i noticed that our last board meeting uh i was impressed with the excitement and i could you could tell it in the eyes of i think the three of you here last time we were talking about you are original and thanks a lot for i like the energy thank you thank you thank you kathy okay this time i will need a motion to approve the consent items have a second second all this in favor say aye all right okay dr gainey i was wondering um would it be possible i figure it's going to take a little time could we um can we move the curriculum and instruction and the operations and save the uh school rehab plan for last then these people wouldn't absolutely absolutely laid around very well i mean some of the people yeah that would be yeah because those will be pretty quick they shouldn't be too long [Music] i don't know that they're um okay on the staff there it's kathy we need you still back there as well okay kathy or lynette needs to come thank you boy members if i if i interrupt when you're talking just tell me i'm i can hear sometimes it's it's muffled so i'm afraid i might come you've been doing that a lot more tonight you know usually when he said beside me i kick him or something when he does that but thanks miss graves good evening members and dr gaby at the february 10 2020 board meeting the randolph county school board approved the uh 629 for students in the first second and third grade we demonstrate proficiency on the standards as defined by the ring to achieve law however as a result of the school closure last year the general assembly excuse me um wait for me to achieve summer camps since we do not have data from last summer i'm asking that you include this video 629 that was approved for students last year excuse me along with the applications that are attached to your information can i make you run i'm sorry you seem out of breath i think i and we will continue to monitor the developments of the requirements for summer school um in the general assembly um throughout the semester but we would like to go ahead and get this approved in case it is needed for this year some of these uh these will also be hispanic yes we don't have really the data to use to project it out and when that i think there's uh we always come in right at cost even though we could go higher for that we come in we got 825's max you could charge for the kids children who are performing at the appropriate level but choose to come anyways they're the ones that pay the fee correct when that that is correct okay any more questions i'll kick an email at the not i need a motion to approve the summer 2021 reading camp fee and the applications for proficient students stay mood have a second second all of us in favor say god motion cares thank you okay i've never seen this guy run welcome there good evening hope everyone's doing good um tonight i bring to you the recommendation for the 2021 2022 rhino burley college high school calendar the calendar

days obviously this started several weeks ago it was vetoed by the governor and then the new bill came back senate bill 220 was announced last week and signed law march the 11th we have to respond to this bill within 21 days of march the 11th so for our school system uh 21st day is marcus april 1 which is thursday of spring break so our first day of response would be for traditional schools that they are expects because april 5 is a remote instruction day in our calendar as mandated by the state last summer so we will not be changing our calendars so traditional schools any changes we make in relation to the senate bill would be effective uh april 6 for the early college any changes we made would be effective for april 2 because they just have spring break i want to point out a couple of things about this legislation a plan a means up to five days of in-person instruction to the greatest extent possible and best desire interpretation of plan a and it has been reaffirmed multiple times uh and i get into it by legislators and by the study board and our policy was approved today our plan a in the randolph county school system is as follows in-person instruction on monday tuesday thursday friday a remote day in september as we move through this tonight we talk about our plan is that plan a requires minimal and social distancing and b requires 6 feet of social distance it is where we are right now with 6 to 12. plan a is where we and have been since october 26 with uh pre-k through five we put pre-k with k5 another thing that's mentioned in this is that grades 6 through 12 can go b a plan a or plan b but no one could stay on plan c anymore which we never used also if a child has an individualized education program or a 504 they must be offered plan a and plan a in the randolph county school system is again monday tuesday thursday friday wednesday or remote day has been in place we've been using this plan a approach since october 26 in our school system a couple other things with this legislation i want to point out is that if we choose to take rates 6-12 to plan a uh i will have to report our plan to the department of health and human services we have a plan we've had a plan since august 17. also i will have to engage with what's called the abc science collaborative with the school of medicine at duke university uh they've asked for it'll be reporting data uh i feel like we have we've got good data so we will adhere to that centerfield 220 i was glad to see that it does still give the schools systems the authority to put schools or groups of kids on remote instruction as needed we've been doing that all year and i greatly appreciate the support i know it's not been fun when you read the emails the school's been put on 14-day remote nor has it been fun for staff or for students or for their parents but we've done what we had to do also this scientist senate bill says we have to continue to allow kids to be remote have remote instruction their choice if they wish one other thing that's important is involves buses plant a uh we can put two kits per seat on buses we've been doing that october 26 at the elementary level in fact there's cases we put three percent when they were all siblings so i want to just give just for reference why our plan a it was monday tuesday thursday friday when remote down wednesday because when you read the information it says that plan a means up to five days to the greatest impossible well five days is not possible in our school system and here's some reasons why number one our contact trace is way too extensive and way too time consuming we need a day in the middle of the week to limit the chances of spread of coba 19 schools in our campuses another reason why plan a five days a week is not optimal and not possible in our system we need a day in the middle week for separation time for everybody from school campuses uh the students from the staff and the students from school campuses again to mitigate possible spread exposure another thing people don't realize is that middle day of the week enables us to incorporate all students into the academic program on school at the same time that's the only day where everybody is learning in the same way everybody is remote learning monday tuesday thursday friday are very difficult for our teachers we have students in each class summer some are remote some are not and our teachers have continued to work at it but that one day uh on wednesdays where everybody's learning in the same manner is key to our system that's why going five days is not possible and finally um this has played well in our system i do believe i'm sure there's somebody out there that would say maybe they may not be i don't know for their high school i mean we think it's perfect no i'm not saying it's perfect either but that one day needs to stay in place our plan a of monday tuesday thursday friday needs to stay in place because if we go five days like we take elementary to five days and we take we take six twelve to five days there will be children who will not use remote learning uh tool strategies and then what happens if their school gets put on remote for 14 days or they get put on remote from their class for 14 days or a group they're in now we have loss we need to continue to practice remote instruction with all students and that one day allows us to continue to practice that even with the child who if who may take advantage of four days in the elementary level or or um in case okay say we go six twelve uh four days so [Music] there are four reasons that come to my mind why our plan a in the randolph county school system is monday tuesday thursday friday and wednesday being remote there are four reasons that rests with me um i want to speak to our staff a little bit speak about our staff a little bit um our elementary staff has worked very hard with plan a since october 26th they've learned to make it work i also want to tell you that as you deliberate what you might want to do i have some options i will share if people would like me to tonight um uh i want to i want to just say this is our opportunity to look at what the next step to transition to august 20 2020 to 21 looks like uh i so much want to see the doors open with five five days of school so what we do can be another step in the transition or we may decide that this is uh not a direction to go in but but right now i want to be clear with the board as elementary stitch right now k-5 is what legislation talks about what i really refer to as pre-k through five grades they are in plan a now after randolph county school system has identified plan a we are in compliance the one thing that's required in that legislation is that k-5 which we call pre-k through 5 will be in plan a we are in compliance now by our definition so um so we've got a lot of things we're covered there so the board may choose to say we want to go to five days that's a different plan a we are satisfying plan a right now and i'm very proud to say the randolph county school system has been satisfying plan a for from pre-k through five since october 26 because of the great work you did back when the option came along back in in september and october when we work through that and the great work of the school staffs that wasn't an easy easy uh challenge that they've tackled so mr cookoff stop there i answer any questions and if you would like me to present some options to the board i will certainly do so i mean if there's any more questions but i spent a lot of time studying this and i didn't want to say thank you to help because we've she has let me um debate ambulance and uh look and also y'all mentioned earlier our legislators all three of them responded to me with the question early on and do appreciate that as well so i'm thinking what i understood you say basically and i i think we all completely understand that um we are in plan a happening at the elementary and um we satisfy that leaving it four days so i guess the question is um probably one of your options there is no option of going five days a week for us it probably wouldn't work you're probably going to cause a lot of problems if you do that so i guess the option that you would say uh would be uh make middle school and high school allow them to go four days basically like k-5 pre-cable you thought i was going down is that or is that your option basically and what would you like to know would you like to speak options yeah and i'd like for you to maybe if you don't mind what option you think would work best for grandma county schools is that asking in your opinion you would like me to proceed i will yes well okay so let me just share with you when i look at this there's three options that stand out one is you could just leave k5 pre-k5 on your plan a or our plan a and you could leave 612 on plan b that's option one in other words you could do nothing we're in compliance number two option number two we could take leave pre-k through five on four days a week monday tuesday wednesday monday tuesday thursday friday wednesday being remote four days in person a week we're already there we satisfy the law and then we can do the same with grades six through twelve monday tuesday thursday friday and then option three would be pre-k through 12. everybody go five days a week that's really what stands out to me um and uh i guess mr chair you asked me what my recommendation would be is that correct that's correct because basically you said earlier that um you didn't think everyone going five days would work for granddaughter county schools right now can you say that's all right i i would recommend my recommendation would be option number two we leave elementary like it is they're in compliance with senate bill two um i think we and i can talk a little bit more about what next steps would be uh option two would leave a pre-k five like it is and then turn around and give six twelve the option to align with pre-k through five and that will be uh monday tuesday thursday friday with model wednesday and the way i look at that that is a tremendous next step towards five days a week in august 2021 so my recommendation would be octo would be option number two move six twelve to four days a week answer the question anybody in the system i think some questions i know mr burgess you spoke on this some and you might want to touch on better speak on more than i can with the dhhs the plan that we put in place and what i understand is they cannot veto your plan you can you present to us the options the plan some of the things that i know contact tracing is a big thing is that something that you're going to address with them if we do move forward with the uh option a in a different light they're you know moving forward is that something that you're going to look at the contact tracing is that something that you can do is that in your purpose well so just to clarify about the plans um all of the contact tracing is mandatory for all plans and so really the question is just difference between b and a is the enough social distancing b is six feet mandatory which is why it's so hard to have everybody in the same building so all of the other health and safety requirements for dhhs have to stay the same yeah and that that's what's different this time going to uh more days um and this the whole this would give uh four days a week we'll give children more time for in-person instruction to catch up and also we'll give obviously there's some children who uh have opportunities to accelerate as well so um i see it happening both sides we've got a good little chunk of time here to come back from spring break uh to run right into exams and um so uh but we will mr biggs to your answer we will talk uh what i would submit to dhhs is the safety standards in place which are no different than we started august 17th with uh i would make note of uh our also of our contact tracing uh our just make put that reinforce that and um so i looked at dhhs as that report that goes to them would be more what is your overall safety plan which really wouldn't change much the only thing that would be different is it's just like back in october but y'all if you remember we had a chance to take the elementary four days a week um we um we knew that social distancing was was recommended the best we could do it but was not required so three things to really only change that's cool i ain't really i keep hearing the rumor of three feet but that has not been announced i have not seen that in writing that i've seen i haven't seen that as we're going three feet and seven six feet all i see is now we're not mandating six feet we're um just as best we can there's still more we're still going to face coverage [Music] get students in the door uh yes it's gonna work um in contact creation in possibly could be but if it's what what it needs for kids and it's what's needed for kids from my end um um not going back away from this next challenge if we've got it there for the kids we're gonna we'll try to do the best best we can i mean when you say it here listen that's what they'll talk about this virtual school law and you know if we look at global school we already i can tell you that five days would be an option for any grade level i mean we fought hard had a lot of discussion a lot of votes on four days versus five days um our teachers wants that virtual day they needed merchandise so in my opinion in five days it's not an option it can't be we got to be fair our staff you know there's parents out there monster elementary kids in school five days come on we do too let's don't be selfish you know it's gotta be give and take on both ends um in the same way would be you know nine through twelve i mean well six through 12. i mean like dr gaines said i think the second choice would be the best choice you know uh we know we got over three thousand kids on the remote totally remote if the parent was real concerned it'd be six thousand kids and these kids i mean you know we all say and get emails every day how people want their kids back in school you know how they're depressed how they're bored and all my opinions this is time for us to step up this is what people elected us are asking for no not everybody's asking for it it's like mr cook said earlier we ain't gonna make everybody happy we never have we never will so you know i hate this is coming with two months of schoolway and instead of six months of school as well but my suggestion would be dr gaines option too dr danny do these middle and high school can they can they get it all together by the time we come back from spring break like ready for k-12 four days that's the next thing i want to talk to you about a little bit what we're gonna do real quick it's going to be a short window so going to be um it it'll fold in it's going to be different miss farlow it's going to be and but remember you're going to have i don't know it's going to be a matter of if we how many kids are remote now if they have four days they come in because remember the eight day v-day kids that are already coming in person the teachers are already working with them it's just going to be there having them together i'm not saying that's going to be easy i don't want to i don't want to put myself in the shoes of the teacher because i um you know every teacher's going to have their own set of challenges um uh and so i don't wanna speak for them but it'll be different i know it's gonna be different many of them have not seen uh classroom very full since we stopped on march 13 so uh but we're working on we have to work on bus routes and i can speak to that in a minute as well where we are with that we've already had uh transportation whitney anderson's already uh been working on that if you can't but i'm about to call for some data here really quick from parents and it'll start with a phone message tomorrow night i mean one i'm sorry well i got a lot but you know one thing we look at tool if we propose to go back four days a week you know we might have more kids go totally virtual that don't want to be there four days a week and like dr ganny was talking about earlier you know his parents want their kids go back to school but they also don't realize if we do send them back to school four or five days a week and there's a case of coding and the schools they've got to be realizing there'll be a chance the school will be shut down or part of the school seemed like i heard something on the news or something on my way here there was somewhere there was 180 kids born in somewhere yeah so you know i mean it could happen here you know parents won't get back to school they don't have to realize it it can happen it not may will the classrooms be equipped to handle 30-plus students at a six foot distance or whatever no sir it won't they're going to be past where the classroom is going to be equipped for six foot distance yes i mean it's we've got some classrooms i've talked to some teachers over the last several days that are going to have 30-plus students in it where now they've got seven i mean if we go back yeah so the whole thing about plan a is that there is no social distance requirement so it's you're going to do the best you can to spread everybody out but there's no no six feet of social distance required which is why you can put everybody in at the same time and that's consistent with what happened back in october with the elementary k5 mr singh when we went back within four days this same uh standard dropped that's why back early in february when they had the version of this building got vijay by the governor um we couldn't have done that because that version um required the six feet of social distance and what you're saying is exactly right with too many kids and there's no way and older schools may have smaller classrooms i know they do compared to some of the the two newer high schools but um the social distancing requirement goes away you do the best you can with it if you go to if you move forward to uh put six twelve back uh on plane there would go we go right into and so the only thing helps you there the number of remote kids right when we go back into the lunchrooms or how would we continue to do that well that's that's another conversation we've started having kelly green at some point we can't continue to have uh the more students and food all over the campus in different places in the campus it's not going to be manageable so i do believe i haven't talked and finalized this with uh kelty green dale brinkman kelly green but i do believe we'll have to start using the cafeterias because we can't just continue to have staff taking care of food service in two different places you know that's gonna get very difficult um i have a couple questions first one an easy one i would assume do we have any idea of those that are 100 remote now uh will any of those come back if we afford a [Music] week i only will know that mr burgess is something i'll talk to you about in a few minutes we'll know that based on their response to the telephone message tomorrow night if we come in this direction we'll come we'll we um i learned this piece of legislation was coming out um i think my email was time stamped at 9 49 wednesday morning it was announced soon thereafter so um uh not not many people beyond people directly connected to it knew it was coming out um it quiet i wondered if this was going to just go away because time of the year i didn't know but no we don't have any data i think there's a likelihood of two things happening i think there's a likelihood of you know i think mr bulls mentioned there may be people who are doing two days but don't want four go to remote now the rest of the way and i do believe there's some that are remote that will [Music] now say well i didn't two one enough but if you gonna give me four i will come back and i'll talk to you at the structure we're gonna deal with it the same way we deal with the elementary the same method we used with the elementary school back in october as far as how we gathered out of now um so but i think the uh [Music] the bigger problem elizabeth you said that as far as the contact tracing is uh is required by dhhs the way we are currently those years and what do we have in the state 130 how many school systems we have in the state 115. all right 15 150 so 115 systems of the ones that are back in school in some form or fashion all of those are doing the same kind of contact tracking tracing can't speak to what other school districts are doing i can just tell you what's required so it is required you're telling me it's required that if i'm if if this is a classroom right here and i test the positive that everyone in this classroom has to be quarantined for 14 days there's a determination that gets made about um whether there was contact which means within six feet feet for 15 minutes but the health department in each jurisdiction sets out how they determine the contact and those you know more granular details i'm just saying that you are required to do contact tracing and keep people out for 14 days if they were exposed by the state but if they were exposed so whose definition are we using for explosion we would use our local health department's definition for explosion yes yes yes we are we are following the guidance of health department and when we've had a positive in a classroom uh it has typically been the entire class because it's a closed area uh sometimes we've been able to have enough separation in the gym with the higher ceilings buses treated just like classrooms so yes that's been the way that's been since day one when they're outside it's different we can get more into the close contact but uh yes it's been the classroom or the bus has been uh basically if you've got a positive the whole class is going home yes and so and that's business yeah so we moved this to middle school in high school at this room we've got 25 people in this room and our test process so everyone's out under the current way we contact trace the way we decide or told to decide if someone was exposed or not then i'm in high school class i mean i mean i may be with 101 125 different students all day long 100 different maybe three four does mean five teachers i i think we i mean i don't know if this is a thing for the health department not and perhaps we should have uh someone from the health department in here but if we're going to have middle school high school students go back four days a week we have to we have to relax not contact tracing relaxing that we have to relax how something has to be done different as far as what we're calling someone who is exposed and it's just personally i just think that what and it's not just this school system that is actually just this this whole uh this whole panda it is the what we're doing is the implementation of insanity we can play basketball i can box tracy out i can sweat switch sweat with him all day long but i gotta wear a mask that that is it absolutely insane if it is that bad we should never play basketball i don't know that we had to shut down the whole school because we played basketball i want randall and paul stroke play football both or not 11 guys had a little square foot of 10 feet they're in there talking to each other doing whatever yelling each other busting each other they break out of their huddle they they line up across 11 other guys they swap sweat with them push all over them tackle them do all those type things but at the end of the game we have to wave to each other from one side of the field to the net say good game we're not allowed to walk by then it's not certainly not about shaking hand or anything i mean that is absolutely and it is implementation of insanity that we're that we're putting out there it is that makes no sense to me you cannot tell me that i mean you know we've had we've talked about how many students have we had warranty that we sent home for 14 days and how many of those did we send home came back for some kind of positive test positive results just because they were in a room with someone who had when everyone was wearing a mask when i may have been 25 feet from that person and it just we i think something has to be changed on what we're calling someone who is exposed or if we send high school kids back and middle school kids back four days a week we're going to shut schools down more than what department shutdown i think we need to check we have need do i don't know how it's going to be done but it's as far as with the just through the health department what something needs to be something needs to be changed as far as the exposure of what we're calling someone has been exposed i agree is the health department tells you who quarantines they have that power so the state health department issue guidelines on what to do in your local health department follows you through point so this isn't really a school board decision i see your point but i think these situations about determining and exposure are really dependent on all the facts um and you need health officials to do that school people don't we're not doctors um and so wrong either though some of the ones that are making decisions are not dr zebra they may be taking information doctors are giving them and making those decisions but not necessarily ones making those decisions or dollars well the guidance is from the doctors i mean you know and the same doctors who said you don't need to wear a mask said we do need to work man the same god i mean so i i mean i'm saying we can't use that as excuse over we're letting the doctors make the decisions the doctors make decisions change them every day and also is what is being called and spoke well okay and why is what is being called an exposure in north carolina different than any other than other states in this union other states may have stricter exposure uh guidelines and other states have less restrictive guidelines well if it is so dangerous why when i go into walmart why don't we i have to check in and say okay fred was here between this hour and this hour everybody and he test positive everyone else was doing that in their during that same time needs to be uh quarantined you don't see anybody account at the door anymore it's just i mean it is the implementation of insanity for us to do this i i go to i go to a church we have well we have 200 people there on sunday mass were optional i don't know probably less than five percent actually wear masks there's not been an outbreak at that church we're not walking in a glass bubble or anything like that whenever someone does test positive within that group within that church they tell all right we've had a positive case you know it's up to you whether you want to attend or not be very uh cognitive of any symptoms you may have but we haven't had a big outbreak like that and that's just another that's not an anecdotal thing that is all all across the this area and also that the come back to is if we allow the current contact tracing exposure definition of exposure uh i mean we're going to shut down middle schools and high schools they're going to be there less whenever we're saying they're going to be there less than what they are now under two days of schedule they'll be they're less than their four-day schedule because i can go there and i can shut down 150 students am i way off on this friend i think you know well the uh the state when they come down and throw those things in our lap they have they're only they're not thinking the whole thing out at all and i mean i mean how many times have we had it thrown in our lap this year you know i was talking to sharon earlier today one of the questions i asked now wouldn't it be a shame kid playing baseball wrestling or something the last chance they get to do it and um yeah or whatever playing football now and and you know what they're quarantined they can't finish and you know she made a good point a lot of athletes are you probably can relate to that you might are um promoted now just for that reason and um you know what it's a that's a tough call it's it you know i agree you know the four days would be great and all but i could see where fred's coming and todd and i had a conversation i mean you know what we're down to like quite a month and i i mean so a little time left in school and [Music] we're still closing schools i'm not sure how many we have closed now maybe three two and what two or three weeks ago we had two or three high schools it's it's tough once again it's on our lap and they haven't thought it through and um i just i think i would like to see something that has is a directive that the health department has to follow throughout our state because i want to know if we're doing the same thing as everybody else in this state that's what i need to know yeah and i mean todd said earlier you know with my hermes at graduation we had a graduation last summer that was like i mean to many people at least help in the dhs s whatever all the letters are but to all of them it's like we were the devil because we were going i mean we were going to infect everybody in and then everybody was going to be going off their way and we're going to affect they were all across the country because we had a graduation and yet nothing happened so and again it's not like again it's just that and they weren't sticking their nose in it again i know it's it's a great idea but i i think and i've just been here a short while but i thought y'all have done a great job this year that's for us having school and i would like to see us continue to have it with what too much left i guess and you know i think this was pretty much because targeting the school systems that happened to school i mean i resent the fact that we had went to school all year when nobody else was going and then you know we we're part of part of this throne in our life i really you know what this is about 20 25 school districts across our state that are all for nothing but remote learning since last for a year now absolutely that's what this is about it's awesome there's no school like we have here and now they're getting all the credit for it that's the one you see on the news hey you're going back to school uh yeah it starts starts it's been great for the kids i know parents want them back in school i understand that i totally understand but i don't want to send them back i just said here we send them back and then we've got to have teaching staff and have schools all right i don't want my intention to be um misconstrued i do want to go back yeah and but um we've got to change this but what what the definition of exposure for us to go back all we're going to do is send them back everybody's happy then next week two weeks what three weeks and everybody is and you got over half the school is going to be quarantined and that's again the implementation of insanity right we put in another insane uh directive you know here so like uh fred was talking with dr gaby when we you know seeing kids home on the quarantine do we do not keep any kind of record if they do come down with code do we have been out in front i feel like we've been out in front of a lot of things i mean i don't have the i don't have the authority to go against uh what dhhs and what our health department is saying i suppose this uh two weeks ago as well um you know i've expressed the same concerns mr burgess that you do when talking about bringing kids back i've expressed them it's not really the health department much it's the state you know um what are the expectations for contact tracing you know i've lived it from day one i know exactly what's been expected and you know everybody everybody's fine and then uh you know somebody gets sick and they're gonna come at us uh as hard as they can with um what only we do um to contact traits um so i i get where you are with that um thank place we were back in october with elementary um so i i i understand that uh but i don't have the uh minister bulls um when we quarantine people yeah we do get the follow-up but to tell you that i've got the positives i don't have the in that data set and yes if we went the option to yes mr burgess you're right i'm going to spend time collaborative whatever that entails i've seen some of what i turn into them and yes it's you know it will be more uh than what we're already doing doing um uh mr burgess mr bulls i don't um we've kind of we've brought down our average number of cases since a window of four weeks in january of 59.75 passes in a four week period now down to about 30 or 32.1 so our numbers are getting better they're looking better but i don't know i don't have i haven't triangulated that per say we've been focusing on getting the positives out anybody affected by him um so uh one thing i'm a little confused though and hit help me out with this okay i read several different interpreted several different ways um okay like four days we're in compliance k through five compliance with plan a all right if you stayed on the plan that we're on plan i mean would you even be in compliance with what the state's telling you to do now with middle and high yeah it will be yes you stay well we haven't you can do plans but we haven't played right now we what we have in place right now we're in complete compliance with the bill 220 now if we do nothing this school system compliance with senate bill 220 uh other than we would we would have to go to middle and high and offer the option for any child for grade 612 that has a uh iep or 504 we have to offer them the option of coming back uh monthly thursday friday that's the only change if you stayed where you were we would handle that directly with those families if you didn't do anything tonight we'd be in complete compliance with senate bill 220 because the rule has been that plan a is up to five days and our for elementary and our elementary is four days we're clearly compliant so that's why i offered that as an option option one is uh basically do nothing different than we are keep pre-k 5 on plan a and keep 6 12 on plan b so i don't think there's a perfect option i think you can debate any one of these options have risk the risk would stay where we are is not taking not getting a chance those four weeks or five weeks before testing that some children would like that i would need those four weeks in person flip side of that is to your point um we would give everybody a chance to make a decoration if you do option two with the decoration they have to do it by friday this week and you may have children who don't want to come back four days a week so they made clear to go 100 remote the rest of the way and you may have kids that are only coming are 100 remote now and they declare it be in person i mean yeah it's going to be a lot of it's going to be a lot to do if we do anything other than if we do option two which is the one i mentioned for option three taking them five days a week we'll have a lot of work to do bus wise uh mr sink you raise a valid issue uh the older the older high schools our middle schools have good size classrooms but those are high schools the classrooms are smaller compared to the two new high schools but that's the risk we would take as well just like we took that risk in october so um there's not a perfect answer here um uh danny can i ask you a couple questions some matter come out the other day i think that when we do this number one i don't go five days a week because i don't know if i can not i'll agree to four days tonight if you want to do that but we have to push the ball forward because i'm telling you in august of next year we're going to be having this same conversation people's not going to go back to school we're going to be having it we can have it tonight we have it august students first and all we do dr gainey can you give me some numbers we're uh the other day the numbers come out in the third grade i guess our dogs or whatever come out that 75 percent of north carolina students were failing where are we at in that as far as randolph county had 75 percent of them and 75 percent of our freshman high school took their following course test and they were failing also as north carolina where are we at randolph county because the thing is students first and all we're doing the students are failing they're losing they're losing and we keep on figuring out what if we can do what is tonight where we get contact tracing or whatever you want to do but come always the next year write it down we'll be doing what ifs on august and we will be going back five days a week so i want to know where we're at as far as those numbers are we close to those numbers the same way the rest of the state of north carolina is are we just knocking it out the park we're doing a great job well our numbers aren't i don't know their numbers are much better i don't have those numbers but my thing is is bored y'all can decide what you want to but tell yourself be honest right now are you ready for me having this exact same conversation come on but we're going to have the same conversation sorry well maybe we will and today we gotta deal with all this but i agree with you as far as wolfman is school but i i'm not saying not to do anything i'm telling you that i won't be in school you want me to school we i won't be in there four days ago i understand i want four days a week but i'm telling you we sit here and vote four days a week today but if we deal with the same exposure they're going to be in school less than they are now i agree talk to the state teacher i mean those are the people who are studying the guidelines i do not believe that they said they could not be to our plan what does that mean what does that mean that was the new god that's passed down they could not be to our plan what does that mean that means nothing remember what does that mean somebody don't know that it means anything what's that don't know that it means anything but that doesn't mean that you can just ignore the toolkit well she can't stay remote i don't believe 115 schools i mean i believe 150 school systems are doing the same the same guidelines the same toolkit they may get the same toolkit but they're not doing the same toolkit we've got about we have thousands of students you know using some students multiple times we have thousands of students that have been quarantined that have come back with non with non-positive cases and just multiple times we've sent them home and i mean the survey it's just it it is there is a way i don't know the way and i don't believe it's the place who do you talk to well you haven't talked to the cdc i don't believe every school in this county that has done some i'm sorry every school in this state every school system in state has talked to the cdc that they have done something different as far as doing exposures okay sorry i was being surprised i know you all right well i'm being smart all right anyway but uh well we can write it down but i want to make the motion that we move to option a in grades 6 through 12. students will attend in person school monday tuesday thursday friday and wednesday being a remote day can we have a motion do we have a second are you are you saying option two mr that's exciting yes sir option two keep keep pre-k through five uh monday tuesday thursday friday remote wednesday is that what you're saying yes sir i think it was quickly through five because i was thinking it was already in but yesterday exactly option two four years for a second for a uh workbook can we do anything about changing the exposure no to where everyone you is you gotta think about that i mean it's so late in the year that it could really people said i'm done i'm not coming back it could affect the numbers i don't know we'll just never know unless we because i've talked to a lot of kids about this this has nothing to do with the exposure or anything like that we go back to school and we go four days a week i know that several kids that i have spoke with will go remote because they don't want to lose their job days that they are out and that's why you have so many kids who are failing it's because they have put a job in front of education and that's what i second the motion if we put the actual grades of what the students are making out there in public that would help to be shocked and i understand about people work and and it's not the whole point is about the oh i don't want that at school because it's not it's too dangerous that's not the case for students because no i'll make it to i'm making this much money a week working over here that's that that's an issue and i understand that and i'm i mean you know here in a couple weeks then we'll be able to do it but and i've experienced this too yeah which is more important making eight dollars an hour getting education so uh you do i do i know there's a second and then we'll get rid of both i'm telling you we i know the list but because there's nothing we can do i'll tell you i believe we as a board need to lean on our uh health department just a little bit then got 21 days where we go about next year if the governor comes back tomorrow and says everybody goes back five days our local health department can say not randolph county y'all have to do this or i'm sorry you go back five days but you're gonna be quarantined if you're in someone your health department has the authority to quarantine so if the health department wants to quarantine everybody then they could they're not going to do that but we should challenge you know that is yeah i think you've made it clear okay all right we have a second i just smoke all those in favor with the motion show raise your hand okay so we're going back we're playing option b it's unanimous right uh okay wait hold on a minute let's spell it out i don't know that was his baby let me make was unanimous sure it was unanimous to go option two was keep pre-k five like they are 6 12 monday tuesday thursday friday is that what i'm hearing yes that's correct can i share something with the board about what next steps look like now okay so tomorrow night there will be a phone message and we'll go out and it will tell parents they have between now and in 3 30 on friday it's got to be a sport window we don't have a lot of time they're gonna have to um plan at one is face-to-face monday tuesday thursday friday remote wednesday plan two is 100 remote and we will send this message it will say if you don't tell us anything we will assume if child's already engaged in person they're going to plan one i also would say don't tell us anything in your kids 100 percent remote we will assume [Music] their kid is going to say and it also will say no changing after this wherever you are as of and this will be in effect mark april 6. we have three weeks to get this ready but there will be no changing after they have disappeared to to declare so again if they don't do anything and they're already doing in person two days a week they automatically go to four if they don't do anything and they're already 100 remote they automatically go remote the only people we have to hear from is that someone's doing different than what they're not taking advantage of in person they now want but once they once we set up for april 6 there'll be no changes so there's going to be no communication between the schools middle and high schools and students other than this fun message because that's exactly how we yeah this is what we did when we did the uh i was just thinking about the response if there's a poor response to that then all of a sudden april 6 comes around and you have 200 more kids there than you anticipate i mean i'm not following what you're saying we're first going to get we first they're gonna have to contact their school yes and tell their school so we can get the bus routes changed and this message will go out and it'll be shared with staff as well but um we have to get in the bud the first thing we have to do is find out who's chained but we can get mushrooms changed i just i just think again he has more more confidence and people reaching out to the schools bless their hearts that's how they've been having to contact others pre-k five kids they had to get a phone call so uh there's also i don't say little things but there are a lot of little things uh that uh as far as the way we uh do our uh our school day uh and now liz would you say we had our health department because one decides if someone's going to be quarantined or not um but i mean like i know from talking to different teachers at different schools around i know that like in a middle school or high school from one class to the next i have to change the class that some teachers that looked at it and they clean they wipe down and clean every desk is that something that's come from randolph county is that going to help requires that teacher to do that it's not being done at every in every school in our cabinet so i'm just where does that come from because now as far as in that middle school high school when i had 15 kids now maybe i've got 30 kids will take me longer to clean it up that's maybe a small thing the other thing which is not a small thing is what mike was saying about the cafeteria um is now our uh uh middle school is not in high school not eating they're eating in a classroom right yeah so now we have instead of you know instead of 10 15 kids in the classroom we've got 30 but where does that come from does that come from our randolph is that my health department that comes from us just the quarantine issues staying out of school issues are from the health department the actual cleaning protocols and social distancing masking all of that's coming from the state i don't know the toolkit by heart so i don't really remember what the requirements are for wiping this down but dr gainey might remember that that was part of our safety plan through dhdhs mr burgess i um that that rest in school level i mean uh i've not heard any any complaints about that this first time i've heard i haven't seen a long time i'm not saying there's a complaint i'm just saying i know that in some classrooms some teachers some schools that they they do that and some they do not and also for those who do all right well now there's another you know another uh and just to just double the number of kids they got to deal with on that some of the the classrooms that i have seen they don't have enough desks in there so i assume they've got to move new desk in and all that from wherever they're being stored or something like that or there's somewhere in school which is like i said these are that's those are small things but uh uh but you know we do have that the other thing is so we still do the uh temperature checks and the asking the questions that everybody lies to and all that kind of stuff when you come in we still do that yes i mean is that well said is that required i mean that's a state requirement how many people on a daily basis to be sent home because of a temperature yeah that's what's in now we got doubled and i'm going in and guys i want everybody there four days a week but i'm telling you you can't just we can't just sit four days a week and not change the way the day looks and i i mean i'm with brian all the way up so we just need to uh but we have to we as a board have to fight someone out to keep them in school and the only way we want to keep them in school is to change some of the restrictions that are throughout the day i mean we vote for them until five days a week but then next thing you know we got a quarantine and a half at school square team and did we accomplish anything so uh what's dr gainey i guess is are you are we looking at that how we're going to handle the more kids i'm sure we got a plan for that it's obviously going it's going to take more time to get kids in i think the big thing will be when we actually see what the numbers look like um with how many students do we how many students actually come four days remote i mean time will tell but it yeah it's the chance that it could take more time to get kids checked in but if you remember those multiple check-in stations schools they may have shut some of those down they may have to reopen some of those but um how many students a day do we send home or to the quarantine room and all that kind of stuff you need any idea yeah i mean we've been doing it for eight months now what's up whatever eight months seven months now how how many we've dealt with it quickly and many times when we've had a situation um if a whole classroom is going and there's no need to move along classroom down the hall if everybody's got to go uh why take them all the way down the hall when you can leave in one spot and uh as parents come pick them up uh so uh mr burgess i tell you the quarantine room i you know i i don't hear as much about that as i did early on um just because the same we're getting information sooner now we're getting information many times after hours uh which uh we're able to intercept it before we get to campus now yeah it impacts campus because um when we do look back period the 48 hour look back here from the day the symptoms started or if they didn't have symptoms from the day they were tested [Music] i understand i just think that i mean i've said it enough we have we can't we can't just vote so good everything's good this way we have to make some changes some will have some way to keep them in school we can vote for them go to school all day long we got to do something to keep them in school uh and i do have one other thing i do want to bring up it's in october or september i think when i was i was pushing this and uh you know i think even in my thinking well all of us we're all still thinking about oh it's going to be this way it turns out something went different but in september i was pushing hey let's get the and forgive me if i don't use right word don't say the containing classroom and you're still going to say it are you using the right word that right self-contained self-contained yes all right the self-contained students got i said hey let's send them back five days and i pushed hard for that and that was something i thought was great never my wildest dreams did i think we would have parents that of these 36 whatever the number of thousands uh 3600 uh students never did i think we'd have some that would not send their kids in for the self-contained classrooms i thought that they would we would not have anybody who would be 100 promote um so consequently i would say that we have created a lot more work for those teachers in those self-contained classrooms that they are there five days a week they're doing they don't get the wednesday to kind of catch up and help the ones that are remote and all that they're still having to do it while someone's in the classroom um and maybe we have to listen to a little bit more from the parents and teachers in this case but i think we really have michael considered on the 6th come back look at something like a those students those those teachers those classes are the same thing follow the same schedule four days a week and i'll begin shaking his nose and what's the question i would not advise that at this point in the school year i think you're you're i would not advise that uh for the school system this year now that we've had them there five days a week since way back self-contained uh [Music] that i'm be my advice i'll follow the board's lead there but i'll uh defer to the board attorney on that uh by taking the day away of in person from the self-contained students uh mrs troutman i refer to you yeah so all five days are inspirational days right um it was one being removed and the self-contained students many of them are not able to access instruction on the room a day i know we've got some that are 100 remote well every every you know student in iep is different i understand we can't use the excuses some of them don't have the technology when some of them are promotes we know that i mean and some of those that are remote do not have the technology but i'll say it is we we did this a lot of times we said all right we said we want to do this to help these students they need to be there five days a week and i was you know one many one said yes we need to do that but uh you know it's one of those things of unintended consequences that because i never thought we'd have students students and we have more students than uh uh certainly more than i ever thought we would that are end up being 100 remote therefore we're creating more for the teachers and that you can i don't get into this book you know we cannot deliver an iep commercial so but i think it depends on that well of course but all right um and i know that was kind of out of blue it is something that you know i've talked to you've been private about it over the last couple of months did this change anything is this also uh early college yes all right how does that how does that correlate with the uh early college our date would be the second uh because they've already had spring breaks so the 21st day after the governor signed this in was uh uh april 1 so they would be expected to start on april 2nd just to be clear because you're already in compliance you could have them start the following week i know that day is a friday just making sure you don't realize that [Music] option you say april 2nd is a friday you don't have to have them start that plan b that day for plan a that day because they're already on plan b you're saying we could start them all in six is that true that might be okay that would be better it would keep her from so yeah uh somebody else say monday to fifth from okay so we would do um everybody on six okay without that that makes it more aligned uh mr cook i will also be sending a phone message tomorrow night elementary school parents just letting them know that nothing has changed just so we wrap that up as well so there'll be a separate voicemail going to middle school and high school parents and then that will go that will be one and the other board members will be to the elementary parents just making them aware there have been no changes to pre-k five despite changes to 612 and i have those ready so i'll be getting those out tomorrow night okay i moved to okay randolph county board of education we're entering a closed session pursuing the north carolina general statute to preserve the internal client privilege to discuss confidential personnel matters protected by north carolina general statute and we have the motion and have a second all those in favor say hi we're in closed session you're good all right now in open session um brand new you want to do the classified circle okay this time i need a motion to uh approve the classified personnel report so have a second second all those papers say hi a motion to approve the certified personnel report have a second second all this will say i propose need a motion to approve the administrative transfer sound good second second all those in favor say ah photos wishing carries okay mr burgess all right and i know this is going to be uh and i'll be trying to be real briefly i know it's going to sound a little crazy um but you know we live in in crazy times and uh uh doc it's been my impression and maybe i'm wrong but i've always had the impression that you uh at least karen maybe carry a little bit of weight or at least are very well respected among superintendents around the state and i think that we and i know we can't do this before unless before you start telling me you can't do that i know we can't do it but i think we as a board uh as a superintendent this morning we need to do something as far as talking to dpi talking to the state about uh the end of uh in the great test here in the in the in the course in a great test you know it's like nothing has been normal about the school year except one thing still going testing exactly the way it's supposed to be and you know the business of education is testing and business is booming and why are we going to why we're going to take all these have them do these tests we're not going to do we're not going to adhere to what the test tells us if i took tests and i felt my in the grade class am i going to be retained if i failed my in the course you know my great english class [Music] we know that's not going to happen the we talk about coming back last whatever it is eight to ten weeks of school well we spend the last three and a half weeks testing because they got tests retests what is the retest remediation they test again why don't we why can't we do something with the sex say hey let's let our teachers do what they do best let's let them teach and teach right up to the last day i mean we're going to test and it's like man whatever it's going to be it's going to be it's going to be a it's a big fat nothing is what the whole test is going to be i don't know what the pursuit procedure is or anything like that but we need to look to change testing and it's got to start somewhere maybe in front of randolph county for the state of north carolina that still started here yeah so i i don't know i mean dr you understand what i'm saying as far as where i'm heading on that so yeah this this issue has been debated all year uh and the federal government has made a decision that he could not go away i think the the final word was the state may or may not use it in accountability measures but we have debated this as superintendents we got absolutely not it would it would testify will be in place this year uh george i think was the state that appealed it right immediately back in the fall and their appeal i think lasted d.c for about as long as it took back in the fall to land on someone's desk and get resent back um because the testing companies get paid big big money off these tests unless i mean let's let's be honest there's nobody in washington you know the rats behind over what anybody makes long grain out here they care about whether if someone's getting paid to produce those tests or not yeah and i know that's you know we are there the issue that's gonna um the issue that comes out is what does the state do with the test results this year that's going to probably be the only result we have or relief we have but yes um you know this is one can not just be real clear with you uh real real frank with the board uh this is one that's troubled me uh you know uh i can tell you the conversation went on for a while tonight about contact tracing um i know many of you know that i'm that's one of the things that i've questioned them will some of that change i don't have that authority to do that but we're going to continue to push we'll continue to push on that those two issues were probably the two biggest issues um i talked uh with angels about what i see in the contact tracing results we've seen as well um uh so these two issues have been heavy on my mind for a long time this year um i don't know that there'll be any resolution to it uh relief from it mr uh burgess but um the last i saw was the federal government said mentioned there would be the decision on how the accountability would be used probably useful accountability i want to say would be very could be variable by state um part of the issue is when we did our um [Music] our state plans a couple years ago i'm thinking what the acronym is now um there's not no child that finds his next when it came it's just leading my mind now every student succeeds act yeah yes every student's decision when we did our plan um part of that was a commitment to certain tests with the federal government and they're not backing off so you know it's it's unfortunate and um the horizon will be broadened tremendously with this issue uh information to our teachers in relation to our school staff that were brought tremendously with me because um i think there's a lot more has gone on this year that may be measured on the test this year and i'll just leave it at that i'm not i'm not minimizing the value of a test but um when this is over for me uh one day i'll probably look back to um 2021 to probably be in one that would definitely probably be the most difficult school year but probably the most special school year because what you're saying mr burgess a lot of people drop their guard and say we got to do whatever it takes for kids and i want to be real clear with the board i know the next uh six weeks could be increasingly difficult with what was decided tonight but i've also got my eyes on august 2021 and i'm not gonna let anybody all right i think what he said for us [Music] i'll give you some more information from the state board of education and criticize them go ahead you froze up on stuff okay he's okay go ahead dr gaines i just i've been criticized for comments i've made about what doing whatever it takes or and and making a run at it well i don't know anyway describe it we made a heck of a run at it this year from august 17 and we've done whatever it took and we'll do the best we can between now and june 2nd for kids and for staff i think those of us are on this board four years now and six or eight years now you know here you know whenever we get the uh you know we get the test results you know we have we have laid out in the spreadsheet it's going to be well they've gone up and then there's always a little bit of astrid right there about inside 2021 and then mean we won't talk about it forever and it's just we're not going to use it for anything it is absolutely not more than just the line of pockets of people and i understand that's not your decision but you know yeah what is what the state board of education did was uh request a federal waiver for their accountability requirements and they are waiting uh to get the results back from that and then they are going to request a state accountability measures waiver for the 20 20 21 school year to the general assembly so they and that's going to be a stroke that's going to be whatever the general assembly is right that's right it's going to be great and mr mr burgess to your boy to your point about the asterisk yeah uh years several years back in fall of 18 i was one that said in multiple meetings please don't lose sight of the people of the coast many which i know well because growing up there lost 50 days to school please tell me that come may and june we won't forget that they lost 50 days yeah and it quickly was mr purpose yeah we forgot sure and so todd is there can we i mean is there legislators that we can call about that then i mean it's first i mean sorry they're going to present the labor as long as yeah it's going to be a matter of it to be i think it's going to be a matter of the relationship between the state board and legislature all right see anything else [Music] on", "ef5uxmuPX0o": "[Music] what's up peeps my babes here today I have a 25 millimeter top airflow RTA to show you guys this one right here was sent to me for the purpose of this review from geek vape it is the Zeus X the zoosk I remember the zoo single coil then they made a Zeus dual coil now we got the Zeus ex top airflow our t8 has a bill deck that's how can I explain it to Poe spot with four terminals almost like the way the drop that that rabbit the equites us RDAs are it's got that same similar style bill deck inside here comes with the bubble glass comes with a straight glass packaging you guys gonna see in the up and close that packaging is strictly for reviewers the retail version will come in at different packaging all right so let's not waste any time let's dive down show you guys the RTA well do a coil placement tutorial patent tutorial come back vape it and I'll give you guys all my thoughts on the geek vape Zeus X RTA and here's the packaging the Zeus X or ta vie geek vape came in and just let you guys all know this packaging that you see here is reviewers packaging the retail packaging will not be this packaging that you see here and when I open up the flap there's a little message here from geek vape from mr. Justin you can see there then we have this little piece of paper thingy over at geek vape zeus x flip that over and there you have it you have the whole RT broken down and it basically lets you know what each thing is so you can see here the bubble glass is 4.5 in miles of liquid straight glass is gonna be 3.5 yes 3.5 then like the base your inner air full chamber basically everything is named out you gotta trip the beer inside the box you get some extras and those extras are an extra drip tip as you can see they're a regular ultimate end drip tip you get some cotton shoelace tile a couple of coils and the other bag is going to have all your extra o rings your tools extra pole screws and so forth and a 510 driptip adapter start off from the top is you could see there as you're opening at the o-ring inside for your 810 drip tip 810 drip tip that they provide one of them is this little stumpy style low-profile drip tip there you go now take off your top fill simply just unscrew half a turn and pull and you can see there there is your top fill now sometimes when I do remove the fill it all depends see right now I knew because I'm showing you guys but a lot of times I'll do this see that and the airflow control ring pops off Wow on screwing for your top fill so yeah kind of wish there was a little bit more meter somehow there's like very little meet here but then you have this whole piece going up on here so yeah you got to be careful with that it's happened to me lots of times now when everything is all together to adjust your air flow you're gonna simply turn you have your airflow adjustment it does have a stopper right so stops into place obviously it's a top air flow RTA nothing on the bottom the bottom there does say Zeus some geek fate branding you haven't gold-plated 510 you can see they're got the bubble glass on 4.5 a miles of e-liquid to unscrew this you simply just gonna unscrew it from the base and before we look at the build deck Dada one thing I want to show you guys this glass is very loose on here very loose especially this is clean no liquid when liquid gets on here you got to be careful if you're gonna pull out your bill deck whatever pull it out swap your cotton clean it whatever service it you have to be very careful with this glass doesn't just pop off on you especially if you're gonna try and do this and remove that you'd want to do one of these and just slides off so people in ask Mike what the hell do you just pull out of there so this is your airflow right here you can see that there's are all your little openings for your airflow and that lines up inside here let's say we could pull this off you're gonna see the opening you could see right there see if you look inside you can see my finger so the airflow comes in through there that's your opening and then it gets through this you could see that so it could smooth things it out and makes it a honeycomb airflow directional basically so it brings it there so there you go your quarters would be sitting right inside there and receiving the airflow that's right here interlocks inside here and the way this works again is when this goes in this piece will go in and it'll slide in see right now just slid inside those grooves that you see right there this groove here so it'll slide in and simply when it screws down it's gonna be aligned with that airflow there's the building so we have basically a two posts build like for terminals one two three four you can see that it does use flathead screws this is the section right here where your cotton will go inside on both sides coils I'm gonna use in this video some core allergy le inversion twos you could see that point for resistance for one coil so this will be around point two resistance three millimeter coils and with the coil a tool I like to cut it at four point five or five anywhere inside here will be perfect and as you can see there I have the first coil in position and what I like to do here is after I have it in I'm just gonna lift it just a tad you can see that right about there and I'm just gonna tie in a post with that height right there when I do put this on here you can see it does line up with everything just perfectly when it's gonna sit inside they're obviously gonna make sure you don't want to come out and hit this corner so you're gonna have it right around the way I have it right there and you could see cutting it at four point five millimeters you could actually see your lead down there that's is hanging down it's just perfectly it's like you don't have to worry about it touching the bottom of your building here's a nice up and close look at the coils and basically this is the way I want to have them set up so I'm just gonna straighten that out and you could see there where it's overlapping just a little bit over the bill deck this part right here and a little bit over here so there's like the perfect way to perfect actually area to have these coils in so this way when you do put this top piece on you see here this top piece it doesn't touch and thing on the inside or short out on you here's one more up close look at the bill deck and there we go got all the hot spots out one thing I do want to mention is this all ring here whatever you want to call it gasket where your glass sits on it's always pops off it's very annoying so when you guys here we talked about it during my cons this is the old ring I'm talking about alright now that we got the cotton in place I am using some cotton threads I'm gonna cut it right at the bill deck so I'm gonna put the scissor against this platform here just like that hold it level so though like this I'm gonna hold it level I simply just cut and what I like to do is before I do the other side I'm gonna set this side up and make sure that the cotton sits inside there perfectly so first thing I'll do is I'm gonna give it a coal mouth alright cuz it's pretty thick the kind this is gonna work on capillary action so you want to make sure it's nice we combed out then you're gonna grab your scissor give it a haircut all around to get all them fuzz balls out of the way next thing you want to do is grab your tweezers grab that cotton and put it right inside the hole alright so I'm gonna do that now if you see that it's not going in that means you cut it a little bit too short and that's what I was talking about to wear see it's for me it's going in fine but I could give it just a little bit more slack so that's why I was talking about when you see how much the judge it to cut it there that's all you want to leave this uncut do this side first so this way you know now where you'd have to give it a little bit more extra on this side and then cut it down comb it out and put it in and that's this way you don't cut it too short and there you go this is how your finished product should look like they have it that was the Zeus X RTA let's go back up on top let's vape on it and I give you guys my books and there you have it the up close zeus x RT a geek V Mike your thoughts please well start off with cons first cons gonna have to be the top fill section now a lot of times maybe 75% of the time when I go to fill this tank when I unscrew it pull it up airflow control ring comes out off with it together so annoying then you have to put it all back together it's a little bit on the annoying side that's gonna have to be a con and my second cons gonna have to be that old ring remember they're on the up and close I had pointed it out the O ring yes that o-ring where it's right over where the glass attaches to the bottom piece that ol ring pops out easily Wow especially if I want to unscrew this right now to get inside there that o-ring will pop out if you're not careful you go to put it back in you'll see the o-ring bunched up inside here so yeah it doesn't sit it would have been it sort of sat inside it should have been seated better in my opinion a little bit deeper now that's it that's the only contact are really fine but with this RTA other than that it's all pros straight a cloth straight across learn how to talk Mike okay so first Prague's and have to be obviously you get two tanks you're gonna get the 4 point 5 ml bubble tank and you get the 3.5 ml spray class they have to be a pro you get to drip tips pro all the extras you guys saw cotton coils 510 driptip adapter ultimate rib tip 810 drip tips pro 2 some people they might not like this short drip tip that's on here you have the other one that you could use or if you have your own drip tips in your arsenal other 810 drip tips they'll work on here the top fill it is easy to take off but like I said that con where the air flow control ring that's on there airflow control ring is perfect this I could get in there I could adjust my air flow no issues at all that's gonna have to be a pro looks on the tank I think it's a sexy looking tank give them a pro the build X super easy to build on to wake it everything pro all across their flat head screws that's more of a subject things some people are gonna like them some people are not gonna like them I personally like flathead screws I have no issues with flat heads but that's something with you guys yeah but other than that all we really have to talk about right now is the air flow and the flavor on SRT a so I have it right now fully open 90 watts my resistance now this build that I have inside this RTA is different from what you saw on the up and close the open close build is in here which I have no juice in here I just have it coils the kind this is gonna go to one of my patreon peeps but anyway this is a different build inside here and here I have aliens the see what is it the twisted messes and ATS inside here core ologies it comes out to a point 1 1 and I have it at 90 watts fully open let's have a vape you guys could hear the airflow I have my microphone right over here so you guys could get it good here at it let's do it fully open lots and lots of airflow a flavor is good but it's not like wow when it's fully open this thing when you decrease the airflow in this it just gets even better me personally I like it around halfway alright so halfway open right now let's have a baby could hear it halfway much better flavors a little bit more intense now another thing is when it's fully open and halfway for me it sounds the same the airflow so that's a pro right there to where you don't get obscene noises coming from the airflow while you're adjusting it now what else cut it down a quarter of the way you even add a quarter of the way it still got air flow so this thing is got tremendous air flow on this tremendous airflow for an RTA and it's a smooth airflow flavor on here that's the big thing people want to know what's the flavor on this art da Mike if I have a given a number between one to ten for flavor I'd have to give it a 88.5 for flavor so all in all I think that are pretty good with this RT it's a nice RTA it's the Zeus X and I think it's better than all the other Zeus's in my opinion well you can't really count the single coil 1 this is the dual coil 1 but I think this one here is better than the dual coil version that was put out maybe a year ago if I'm not mistaken something like that but anyway all in all nice RT would have been nice though that packaging there we go I got it right here this packaging here that they sent us for the reviewers would have been nice if this was also like the retail packaging it's nicely laid out but I understand this costs more money it would just drive the price up more for this RTA so where could you get into all that info everything you'd have to do a Google search I cannot give you guys links I cannot yeah it's due to policy all right so you gonna have to search it I don't know when it's releasing whatever yeah I can't give you none of that info the only fo I could give you is just my info stuff from me it's all down below check it out that's it I'm done thank you [Music] you [Music]", "38u8MImZmRs": "the delay you know it's amazing what actually goes into these streams when you uh when you uh when you basically just

you know what's kind of going on here uh so i said so aaron tell a little bit about like this pc because you're like you had some issues with it you were complaining last night tell me all about it what so tell them what you play and tell them a little bit about your pc so i play a game called rolling lines and it is such a fun game i really recommend it to people who are very creative but the thing is if you try and make a huge map or anything super big it just turns into a swipe ship um slideshow okay and it's just horrible it's sad and i i mean he is complaining he got this he got he got this pc for christmas right wasn't it christmas or is it birthday no october so it's for your birthday okay wow i i forgot so give him a pc for his birthday if you don't know this pc is semi-famous um it's our 1k intel build um that we built back in the day um i think the only thing i upgraded on it is i actually gave it like a one terabyte nvme so it's got an i5 10 400 and by the way thank you very much vega 585 for 25 subs dropping 25 so i appreciate that as well as firefly 24 for that um so anyway uh basically it's got an i5 10 400 and it's got an avga 2060 ko um all running uh on a z390m and i was like oh you know what you know as as roby tech right as as ruby tech i was like well you know he was complaining he's like dad my rolling lines land and he plays a lot of sin game so very cpu heavy she's like he's like oh my uh my my pc is is struggling like it's playing like slideshow and she runs at 1080p so i was like okay i was like well you know what you know dad you can't you can't have you can't have the robitech son like having a subpar pc gaming experience so i was like okay well let's uh let's see what we do so i was talking to my tech specialist this morning i was like hey you know what i thought i'd do a surprise stream today and surprise aaron my son with uh pc build and i was like hey you know we'll just upgrade it so first i was like you know what we'll put a 10-700 k in it oh dude vega 585 dropping another 25 gifted subs jeez man thank you very much appreciate it so uh there we are we're at 50 62 subs i'll update that here in a minute so uh he was like yeah i was like you know what let's do a 10-700 k in it and we'll throw like a 30-70 and so they were like yeah that's pretty cool and that you know i like the case the mb311 it's a nice case and then i was like i was like man you know what i'm a little worried how's airflow oh grandma gx ruby there's grandmas we got some we got some family and mom's mom's in the stream and we also blondie uh let's see who else we also have my nephew who's a twitch streamer as well i want to give a shout out to him if you guys want to if you're a big rocket league uh guy adno 80 you know 80 and 0 is hanging out in chat as well um so we're going from there um so yeah we're uh he was like i was like i was like yeah i know what about cooling and so we started looking at the cooling for the uh it's got a hyper 212 black in it and they were like yeah you know the 10-700 kind of struggles right like it'll draw like what 265 watts uh non-overclocked and he plays a lot of cpu heavy games i was like well then maybe we should get him an aio and he's like okay yeah we should get him an aio and i was like well i guess at that point in time we might as well just build on a completely new computer so fine with that the only thing that we're gonna save in this build is we're gonna save the one terabyte nvme and everything out everything else is uh everything else is being redone but um i do want to ask a question and blondie if he could text me i heard a rumor i heard a rumor that eternal we missed i missed eternal rage's birthday and if that is true can you text me and let me know if that if that actually happened because if that's true that's messed up i need to get that fixed um and so text me let me know and uh we're going we're gonna get that done um and so we'll get we'll get that thing um so anyway uh we're uh we're gonna we're gonna basically uh build him a completely different pc um so we're gonna uh we're gonna we're gonna i'll tell a little bit about what's in it because he doesn't he doesn't know yet what we basically are putting inside of this so um or weapon i don't know yeah so for the cpu we're going to start with uh we're going to start with the uh whoa the 10th gen 10 um 10th gen 10 700k uh this is equivalent of a ninten i-910 sorry i9 9900k um intel recently dropped the price of these cpus um they're really really great in terms of overall uh for uh the bargain right like right now they're really really good bargain in terms of overall price um you know it's basically you've got uh you've been it's got you know for what he needs um it's absolutely awesome and it's going to be a great upgrade from an i5 uh 10 400. um we are going to be upgrading his nvme storage we're going to instead of having only a single terabyte we're going to give them two one terabytes we're going to keep the one terabyte that's in there so we're going to be giving away uh we're basically going to be uh adding a second one terabyte and then we have another one just in case uh because he's now he's now joining the corsair family family i was like well we can't not have we can't not have rgb ram so we're going to add uh corsair vengeance 3200 uh 32 gigs he's got 16 gigs in there right now so we're gonna go to 32 gigs at 3200 megahertz in rgb vengeance right so we're gonna make sure he's got the rgb and all that sort of stuff as well so there is his uh his main core components right now he's running a z590 uh m prime from um from asus so we're gonna upgrade to the rog strix z490e gaming so he'll still have all the wi-fi stuff that he has we're going to give him a nicer motherboard um and at the same time rog works really well with iq so we're going to be upgrading his his overall so we're going from basically a micro atx all the way up to a full atx motherboard um and uh with the ram and everything else should look really really good so it should be awesome you're dead yeah should i be taking notes no you shouldn't be doing there's gonna be a test on this later son um and then uh the last thing uh that he kind of needs is uh he needs a new gpu so we're gonna be upgrading his 2060 ko to the evga geforce uh rtx 3070 so we're gonna be giving him an xc3 3070 this is actually the ultra not the black so it does have the back plate um so a nice little upgrade there um and should be uh should be absolutely awesome so we're going there and uh so we're gonna basically be building his entire pc so first thing we're going to do is we're going to uh take the one piece the one component we're saving from here um and uh that's the nvme so we're gonna take that out and then from there we're going to then completely build the other one so yeah it should be should be awesome should be good and should do him um a lot of good as well and then he's also gonna be just so you guys know uh power supply we're gonna be putting an evga 750 ga in there um and then uh for his case we're using the corsair 4000d airflow um which uh it was training i was trying to decide between the 220t airflow and the 4000d and you know that's one of the things it's like i don't get to do this a lot but um i had a lot of fun i went to my i went to my tech chat talking to my tech specialist and kind of did what uh any average person you guys can completely do which is head over to discord uh pop into our pop in a discord ask questions and then work with the community to kind of figure out the best build here which was a lot of fun so um it was cool to just go back and forth with people like tom and icy sniper and those guys and have you know made in america and finally figure out hey this is the actual um build um that i think is going to be ideal uh for this so um yeah it should be uh should be a lot of fun and should be uh pretty cool um now just so you guys know i do have two kids i think some people were actually surprised i was married which is bad right thanks for that um or you were just hoping yeah or you were just hoping that i was single um but i got uh my uh 13 year old daughter madeline yeah there you go pizza they actually gave you enough i got my 13 year old daughter madeline and then my my lovely wife brenda who's actually watching too uh high safe fortnite somebody was saying fortnite because you like fortnight right yeah he likes fortnite as well but he doesn't he doesn't play fortnite near as much as my daughter madeline who's a big fortnite fan uh but my uh he plays a lot of same games what's the other one the ragdoll fun with ragdolls that literally destroys my pc every time yeah that one is uh that one's a little intensive so one of the things we're going to do is once we get finished doing this we're going to boot up a rolling line see how his lan his world works and then we'll play some of his animations and see if it makes a big difference uh once he's done so we'll get a little bit we'll get a little bit of some uh benchmarking uh once we're finished from this so yeah that's it um what do you guys think what do you guys think is that sound pretty cool i mean any any questions uh where's the sparkle on ice today actually um aaron chose the drink so he wanted his fan time because i wanted i went ahead and draw it did a diet coke so cheers father there we go cheers we're not gonna make a mess though we're gonna keep the lids on so we don't ruin the pcs um i think he deserves a 30-90 wow you guys have a lot of faith in him i know i'm there her birthday was 2-6 okay so it was 14 days ago but i love eternal so as a special thank you to probably one of my favorite people on the planet eternal rage we're gonna sing her happy birthday so everybody here we go ready happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday happy birthday to you there you go so there we go from there singing this the song is copyright it's not anymore actually they it's now uh it's been it's not copyright anymore it's been ruined i'm sorry it's uh not ruined it's been free it's been considered free open now so you don't have to worry about it what resolution will he play his games he's staying at 1080p um and going from there he should have gone like a 3800 xt well i mean we have those too but we're at this point in time oh we hit the sub goal so i'll switch the goal to the next one um the ai oh that's a good question we're using the h-100 elite compellents uh and then we're also adding some ml 120 ml 120 fans to it as well let me update the goal here also blondie it's a-a-r-o-n not e-r-i-n oh okay there you go um let me hit sub goal all widgets even even then even they understand that if um you shaved your beard off you would look like me uh yeah i i look like i'm look like i'm five okay so we have 70 subs right now okay so this is for the 100 new a gift card need a hundred good seventy and we have zero two three twenty five okay there we go okay so let's go and get started first thing we're gonna do we're gonna go and pop this one open uh grab the nvme out of it and go from there but yeah this pc does work let's let's uh let's uh have a moment of silence uh what did did you ever name this pc i call it lag okay wow you know what honestly you should be like there are people who don't have pcs wow okay so we're gonna say we're gonna say uh we're gonna have a moment of silence for uh lag okay you've done well lag we're done wow that even the music stopped that was weird i don't even know that was weird that was weird like the music just stopped too so um yeah in the arms of an angel jesus take the wing okay you can't yeah yeah okay so here we go we're gonna pop this out so first thing we're gonna do is we're going to go to the front here and take let's do the top down here wow this thing is dirty dude yeah it's a dirty pc so we're going to grab i just drop okay good i didn't drop them too far so we're going to go to the top down here and we're gonna oh man i'm sorry okay wow this is like sorry do we have okay we need some cleaner yeah that was like this is not okay yeah man i'm gonna miss lag yeah i love the mb311 it's a great case uh one of my favorite it's a high airflow case from cooler master um i like again uh super inexpensive i think a lot of people like when they first did it they were like like when it first came out a lot of people used there was a different one that actually his older pc was in um so he's kind of done a lot of my budget builds have been his pcs but since then he's become a much more uh where he used to play used to play games pretty regularly on console yeah and then you pretty much upgraded almost exclusively pc at this point in time so that's it's once i got a pc i got hooked because a it wasn't humongous screen yeah screen and b it wasn't super loud no but there was something more of it right the other thing too that you really like about pc is the mod scene right because you do a lot of modding for the games that you do play right which is pretty like there are some console games that definitely have mod communities but it's still nowhere near as strong as what um the pc scene is like so yeah that looks much better and far less disturbing for the show okay just because it's dirtier and i'm an 11 year old doesn't mean that you can literally screen shame me i can't screenshape you you're my son you're not screenshaming me on livestream you can do it whenever you want just not online my son's making the rules okay so we got the screen we got this out what we're going to do is we're going to quickly get this popped open and grab our nvme drive that we basically need um we're taking out the appendix yeah not really the appendix we're just going to take out that essentially the brain no the link now the question i have aaron is like what is it what should we do with this pc like now that we have this other pc that's completely useless right like oh do we give it do we give it to okay well what's your idea let's give it away i don't know me and just here on the stream let's give it to somebody on the stream do we just give what do you guys think should we just give this pc away to somebody here on the stream who would like to win lag he's singing why don't we why don't we just give like so i mean still the 10 a 10 400 um and it's still got a 20 60 ko in it so yeah why don't we do that we'll do this so when we're done we get it all done we'll throw a new drive in it clean it up and we'll just give it away here on the stream someone walks lag yeah who wants yeah there we go what's lag wait lag is someone's closest friend well we'll do we'll do a giveaway at the end we'll so if you if we again we're hyping it up you guys are being super supportive we'll support you and we'll give we'll give this pc away at the end of the stream ever so yeah it's uh we're gonna be giving away aaron's old pc uh we'll put a new nvme in it and uh get it uh get it out to you one of you guys one lucky winner here lag is la lag needs service he can relax legs he needs to he

next one you're gonna do hd audio see there's a little look at that there's a little pin that's missing it goes in the bottom left right there you make sure the pin there's a missing pin you line that up just like that and then plug it in right there what do they use this kind of connector that's for the i don't know but they do i guess good question buddy okay next one is this one still do it like

[Music] bye guys thank you and have a great day so what is happening what holy i literally like just got on are you kidding me we got a raid holy [ __ ] i can't see", "XnzJnUvaLi8": "hi a very good morning to all and welcome to our maximizing your money webinar i'm kate and i'm going to be your host as well as moderator for today before we start i just want to introduce two very special guests with us today we have with us our deputy ceo mrs searching hey so really say hi to the audience we also have uh our cpm member as well as our cpm volunteer he's in his early thirties our mission jensen chen uh someone that is actually very passionate about financial education as well as financial literacy hi johnson thank you for being with us today say hi to the audience hello everybody all right so before we start i have this question for mrs so as well as jensen maybe you could share with us how a secure retirement looks like and what it means to you this is so first okay uh thanks kate first uh i'd like to reframe the question uh instead of a retirement or secure retirement i was i would rather use the word financial security okay because retirement uh means different things to different people uh financial security is a more precise law so financial security there are two words in it financial and security so obviously the first part is about finance the money parts making sure that your finances are in order then the security part then is about having i think the key word is uh assurance law having uh assurance a high degree of uh confidence that your your finances are in place uh for the rest of your life then uh then that will give you financial security okay thank you mr what about you jensen thanks for the question uh for me is actually a very simple answer uh i want to be able to work because i want to rather than because i need to so a financial uh so a secure retirement will help me achieve that so that i can maybe volunteer and help take care of my parents at the same time oh okay i think that's something that you know i think all of us over here you know can actually resonate with you know do not have to worry about your basic needs you know no matter how long you leave and that you have a basic foundation a basic financial security bank to take care of that okay now over to you the audience over here uh i just like to have two very simple posts just for us to understand you a little bit better uh the first poll question is how what age do you think you will leave to mr so have you actually asked yourself this question i have i don't know so it's option four for me for you what about jen said i know this question might be actually too far you know ahead because your retirement maybe it's about 30 years time or so but have you ever asked yourself this question what age do you think you'll leave to well for me i don't really need to because um i leave my parents still so i can see my dad here's my dad's 72 right now still quite healthy so i'm guessing i'll most likely be following his footsteps and probably live maybe between 80 to 90. okay probably uh answer two answer two okay let me see um the ground okay majority of them we actually have a blended mix uh 80 to 90 you know uh yeah quite a number same like this is so that you know i don't know i think the reality is that you know with medical advancements and then you know with technology you know improvements i think the reality is that you know we really do not know how long we will actually leave until so hold this thought here while we move into the next four question okay how much do you think you will need every month when you retire maybe i wouldn't ask mr sofa jen said uh i know this again you know it's actually a question that maybe it's too very far down the road but have you ever thought of you know how much do you think you will actually need every month when you retire okay i gotta clarify first is this inflation or non-inflation adjuster uh okay let's take it that you know it's future you know when you retire because of like inflation order i'm guessing most likely more than two thousand more than two thousand okay let us see you know um the results from the ground okay oh they're all like here more than two every month okay thank you so much everyone for participating and with our polls so with that you know i'll actually move on to uh mrs so uh uh this last question for you why should cpr be the foundation of your retirement yeah mr so over to you okay thanks i think those are two uh great the question that was asked and uh those are really the two most important questions that uh we should have some idea about when we think about how to plan for our retirement life so can i have the next slide okay so this is called the retirement game plan and you see on the two axis the x axis and the y axis really correspond to the two questions so how do you think about how to think about uh how to plan for retirement so start with the origin uh you got to see the word uh retirement there and retirement is in inverted commerce because i say retirement means different things to different people but from the financial perspective financial planning perspective with time the point the point of retirement actually is better better the point of a retireability like that means it's the point that you can you cannot retire if you wish to right so uh and you know that uh your finances are in order for the the rest of your life so that that is the starting point then the ending point is uh is stefan which is inevitable every one of us will die one day the only question is when so unless you're a god you don't know you don't know for sure and so the the duration from retirement to death that is an important planning parameter obviously if you are planning for a long duration then you need more money right and conversely if it's a shock then you don't need so much money so that's the first important parameter to be thinking about uh how long retirement period you should be planning for then the second parameter is uh the y-axis your standard of living essentially how much do you need per month uh when you're in retirement and again uh the more you need the more uh bigger nesting you should have at the start of the retirement and so when you think about the how much you need then is you useful to think in terms of uh needs and ones every one of us ever needs and wants is quite self-explanatory these are for the basic necessities of life ones are for the more discretionary items can hack and don't have so it's okay nothing but from the in terms of the planning then it's a is it's uh useful to make that distinction because for your needs you want a great uh assurance great certainty like that that your needs are met then you have a money for your needs because these are the basics right whereas for the ones in a sense you can you can take a chance on it if it comes it's good if it doesn't come or doesn't come as a much okay la you you go for a shorter holiday or you do with less of these uh luxuries right so in terms of how you fund your retirement how you fund your needs versus how you fund your ones it's useful to make the distinction and this is where when we come to the the needs part then the cpf plays a very important role in singaporeans retirement planning because the cpf has that this kind of characteristics which are very very uh assuring very good for funding of needs it is it is safe is guaranteed by the government it's a risk-free so you have a great assurance like that that they'll be there the money will be there or your needs uh well so if you come to your once then then this is where singaporeans can consider maybe taking some some risks some investment risk in the markets and you do so because uh you believe that over the long run if you invest wisely the returns will be better than safe investments like cpf or bonsai but any it doesn't pan out as well it's still okay because it's uh for once so i think this is a generally what i would advocate people think of in terms of the retirement game plan think about the duration of retirement you should be planning for think of the how much you need every month then differentiate between your your needs and your ones for your needs uh have an idea of how cpf can support you if you think that and then for your ones maybe you want to consider taking some some investment risk to meet what you want for your retirement okay yeah okay so uh come back to this issue of uh uh how long you leave and uh longevity right it is a very difficult issue so uh what we have is uh on this like some uh statistics from department of statistics so on the top part you see that tell you that there's a difference between the males and females venus that live longer than males and also how the life expectancy has a change i think these figures are for life expectancy and that means look at say babies born in the seven years in 2009 the life expectancy for males is for male babies is a 79 years old females is uh five years longer at 84. and in 2019 it become 81 and 86 respectively so the life expectancy has increased okay over over the years and the bottom part you are looking at not babies anymore but older singaporeans people who are 65 years old today right so uh one in two will leave until age 85 and whilst one in three would live until age 90. so life expectancy actually as a concept is also quite difficult for people to grasp and then people ask how come it's a different method for babies and for older people so for babies uh males 81 female 86 then on average it's probably around like 83-84 like that whereas if you look at older people it's uh average life expectancy is probably five so a bit longer so people cannot grasp the concept so maybe i just uh elaborate a bit life expectancy you always look at you always ask at which age at above or at the 65 and what and why do they differ so if you if you look at the life expectancy at birth so imagine so let's take the 2019 cohort right that means you look at all the babies who are born in the year 2019 two years ago and then uh when you say the life expectancy of male is 81 people is 86 what it means is that for this cohort of uh babies that were born in the year 2019 if you look at the male right on average they will live until 81 years old for the female babies they believe 86 years old now then the question is uh if you if you follow this group of uh babies born in 2019 follow them for 65 years old and for 65 years when this group of babies reached 65 what is the life expectancy then and what is the answer right 65 years ago in 2019 you say it's 81 and 86 respectively 65 years later when you look at people who are 65 years old late then the answer is actually not 81 and 86 anymore it's a it's more why is that so okay because of this group of babies born in 2019 by the time they are 65 years old somewhere died between 20 19 and 65 years later right so all things need being equal alive assuming that nothing else has changed just by the fact that it's a 65 years were passed and some were died when you look at this group again 65 years later you're looking at those who are who survive who survive 65 years old so on average they will be healthier than those who were babies at 20 19 because the group who passed away the group who are shorter lives would have been excluded from the group already when you're looking doing it at 65 right so then the life expectancy is uh longer okay so i just want to explain this it's a difficult concept but it's uh important to think about about this because life expectancy is a very important consideration maybe we'll move on okay so just now why is cpf important just i mentioned that it is very important for baking or basic needs in retirement and on the question of how long you leave we say this is very difficult to estimate nobody knows exactly how long we'll leave later on we'll explain why actually you don't need to know how long you live because with a cpf life you get a payment for life so you don't have to dig out the question yourself but in addition to that i think there are four very important reasons why cpa is very important for singaporeans in fact i call cpa our lifetime financial partner is your partner for life here as long as you're a singaporean so why so first cpf covers all singaporeans as long as you are a citizen or you're a permanent resident you have a cpf so we're talking about four billion people today right so it covers everybody so every every every singaporean should uh bear that in mind and think think about cpf especially as part of your financial planning secondly cpf covers you from birth to death in terms of the duration of your relationship with a cpf is very very long right it's from birth to love to death it used to be that uh a person become a cpa member when he first starts work and he gets his first paycheck first cpa contribution then he becomes a ctf member but now for newborns there are actually many stakeholders yeah yeah yeah that's right right that's right yeah so but now now as uh rightly say every singaporean baby is a member why so because the government gives a grant for every singaporean baby i think it's four thousand dollars so when the cpap receives this money we'll create the cpf accounts for the babies and then put the money into the baby's medisave account so he becomes a cpf he or she becomes a cpa member and you know you don't you don't stop being a cpa member until death so it's a very long duration and you have a long duration you've got to pay special attention to this relationship yeah okay thirdly every uh three dollars you earn from work about a dollar goes into the cpf so it's a lot of money right almost like 30 over percent so it's a lot of your money your hard-earned money that goes to cpa so you should take some effort to learn about cpf and how you can make it grow and how you can make good use of it and fourthly at every major life stage cpf has a role in your financial decisions buying a house for your medical needs for your retirement and many other uses cpf is involved all right so thank you for sharing um so you know i think for our cpm members right i mean retirement is actually quite far downstream and they will typically be working for you know maybe 20 30 years and you know there has been quite a bit of conversations about the very good interest rates that you know cpf is actually pay uh maybe you could just share with us how the cpf interest rates actually helped to build your retirement savings okay thanks before i talk about the cpf interest rate i thought about cpf contribution because i think two very important and basic things which every cpm members need to have some idea of is the contribution and the interest so most of us would actually know that when you work you have to make the cpa contribution actually it's your employer that makes a contribution for you and generally for most people the contribution rate is 37 official 20 comes from your own salary and then 17 percentage points come from the employer so the employer passes the cpf cpf will put this contribution into your cpf accounts and then the and each uh cpa members has three accounts or they don't account which most people will use it to fund their property purchases that's right special account is for retirement and medisave accounts is for healthcare and this accounts earns interest interest which are risk-free and guaranteed by the government the ordinary account uh earns 2.5 percent per annum minimally and this is what we call the base interest rate that means it applies that basically two interests uh one is uh on top of the other the first one is called the base interest rate so for ordinary account is a two point five percent or the other two account is uh four percent per annum so over and above this uh base interest the government has been giving extra interest and the extra interest is a one percentage point for the first sixty thousand dollars of a combined cpa balances that means looking across all three accounts as long as you have a 60 000 right then you earn that one extra percentage points so if you're looking at monies from the special account already save account then with the extra interest you will go up to five percent and that's actually interest rates for members below 55 years old correct yeah what about you know for members say it's actually above 55 yeah yeah so this is a for members of the 55 it is the same as a member below 55 except that there's more good news for older members remember above 55 there's yet another extra interest uh the first 30 thousand dollars the second the low second horizontal bar the first 30 000 earns an extra one percentage points right so for members above 55 then you add up everything you can you're earning up to six percent so all in the cpf interest rate pays uh depending on the account between 2.5 percent per annum to six percent per annum that's really very good you know i mean all of us know that you know the current market uh in terms of the the new that people are actually getting from savings account is actually very low so cpf is indeed you know paying very very good interest rates yeah yeah okay moving on so yeah it's a very good but you may ask what's the big deal no okay 2.5 or four percent what's the big deal so i now have a very wise man here okay to share with you talk about this uh compound interest being the eighth wonder of the world and einstein said that he who understands it and who he who doesn't pays it so what is this uh big thing about the compound interest introduce okay the next like this interesting this is a rule of thumb called rule of 72 which is a very useful and very simple tool to help you visualize how fast your money will grow and basically it's a is to give you an estimate of how many years it takes for your money to double okay depending on how much uh interest is earning so the rule is simply you take number 72 you divide by the interest that you can earn and the answer you get is the number of years to take for the amount to double so let's take an example so let's say we start with a hundred thousand dollars right and let's say this hundred thousand dollars can earn uh four percent per annum which is the current base interest rate for a special account or the medisave account so you apply that that formula 72 you divide by four you get the answer 18. that means in 18 years your hundred thousand dollars earning four percent per annum will grow to become 200 000 right double and then if you have another 18 years the 200 000 will double again to become 400 000. so that means in 36 years 100 000 growths will become 400 000 at four percent per annum okay in contrast if you start off with the same uh hundred thousand dollars but it's uh earning zero point one percent per annum let's say somewhat the kind of rate that you can get in a bank deposit currently so you'll find that after 36 years uh your 100 000 become about 104 000 so that's a big difference 400 000 versus uh 104 000. okay um are you moving on very quickly um so before we move into jensen maybe you know just allow me to share a little story of mine on this pal compounding interest so i have three kids you know primary school to secondary school so every time around this period after chinese new year then you know we'll count their upper monies right and then uh so we've habit of actually breaking up into three buckets you know they will just keep a bit because they say they want to buy presents for their gold poor maybe myself and then a portion you know majority of it you know we it in the bank and then but we have a habit of actually doing uh topping out a small little portion into the special account uh just a little uh a bit of money's inside there and i see a few benefits of actually doing that one is that you know you have a very early conversation about retirement because you're very young so it's actually very it's very far downstream but you know now these kids they're very purpose driven they'll tell you i just want to do whatever i want you know in future but you know i think it's very important to let them know that yes you can you can do whatever you want but you need to take care of your basic foundation and you need to plan for it it doesn't happen magically you know so you need to plan for it and so now you know when you're very young you already started doing that putting a little bit of money because when you talk to a special account it goes in it cannot come out so it becomes very disciplined they see the monies just keep growing yeah so one benefit the other benefit is that you know because they also have their statements you know so every time when they receive their secure statements i'll show them you know look at the monies i mean we don't have a lot of monies over there but look at the interest because of the very good interest you look at the money how it has compounded over the years and you just see you know it'll keep going up and then uh so what we do during my own times right there is still this bank book i mean now these four kids they don't have bank boys or e-statements right so they're bankrupt so you still update and then because there's substantially more monies over there that'll show them you know the interest that they earn is really very little and that's real life application learning i thought it's useful that you know they can see um the magic of power or compounding interest and how it actually happens in real life yeah so i hope this is actually useful for you know the audience out there that you know have kids you know their nieces and nephew you know you could actually consider doing that all right so good mommy so i'll move on very quickly to jensen so johnson thank you again you know for joining us uh today uh he's our secret member he's also a volunteer in his early 30s uh an individual that is very passionate about you know financial education as well as financial literacy uh i have this first question for you what actually motivates you to start your financial planning at such a young age maybe over to you jen said thanks for the question so if i could show that one picture of my family uh so there's something very unique about my family which is that all of us are gonna be ten years apart oh no it's actually telling us about decades apart so it's very easy to remember like how old we each uh so uh this was taken when i was thirty uh you can see my mom is sixty and my dad is seventy so uh they're actually quite a bit older than me um in fact not when i started working at 25 my dad that was the same year my dad retired 65 so that's why i already started thinking of retirement just seeing my dad um so for me i realized that by the time i hit 40 or so like my mom's gonna be 17. my legs going to be 80. i'll probably have to as the only child start taking care of them so i want to be rest assured that if i have to take part time work or work flexibly then my own retirement won't be affected yeah so my family is very much the motivation for uh me planning for my time with yeah that's nice okay moving on yeah so uh actually uh how i plan for my retirement is i use my own version of cpf oh you guys have the central forbidden fund i have my chair planning factors wow okay let me just share with us a little bit more on this planet this care planning like this sure so this actually started with um i think the first chair in the top left-hand corner you can see it's just one stick umbrella so it's actually a chair from kickstarter it's a very portable chair like a size of a slowdown cam that can just stick out and then sit on it anywhere like while waiting for a train but i found out it's very dangerous because it's just one leg i stay on it and then it broke and i fell to the floor chill away so i realized one leg not good okay uh second one is in the bottom left you can see it's the two leg kind so that's why we use an saf right i'm sure mr sew is familiar with this yep yeah but it's very bulky because it can only when it falls it's the size of a a3 paper so it's quite bulky my favorite chair is actually this one along wow you can see it's the size it's like a pole very easy to carry along and then when you just take this out this rubber band that comes with it comes into a three legs very convenient very easy to sit on right and this is actually my favorite chair the reason why i don't use the fourth chair uh by the way i saw one inject actually use this in a fuel camp so he took out the fourth track i'm sure that he just like sleeps like that it looks very very comfortable but when i was at the teflon trying to figure out i realized you actually need to watch an instructional video for five minutes to figure out how to keep that chair whereas this one i just opened this and tada is ready to sit very popular very convenient so that's why i chose to treat a three-legged chair to represent my retirement so what are these three legs i'm going to tell you about my strategies as well as my outcomes so in terms of strategies uh actually again talking about ns uh i started getting a budget on google spreadsheets since i was 18. wow very much again because of ns not because my inject or my sergeant taught me this but because there was nothing to do with ns back those days really i just created splash again this was you know you know ns and ness very carefully so that was what i used to do every month back then and that's with so much time and storytelling to spend uh second thing that i did this was a useful tip i learned which was the same before i spent so let's put aside some of my money before i start spending so i'm rest assured that i have this amount this amount save at the end of every month okay and finally uh i do a six child plan or review which means every six months i plan am i sticking to my financial goals or am i not and also what are my goals uh 35 at 40 even 50 what am i gonna do um the next couple of years long-term planning yeah long-term planning okay so these are my strategies let me show you my outcomes so um these are so the first three are cpf life so i hope that's when i retire at 65 uh that i'll be getting 2500 a month no matter how long you leave no matter how long apparently estimated by money hour which is uh at the price of ntuc they said i can actually be earning with inflation and everything as much as four thousand so i'm actually looking forward to that yeah for my uh second lick i've chosen is uh insurance uh which i do in my ss account uh which is also supposed to give me about 2 500. but unfortunately this is not lifelong so it's only 30 years okay all right and last but not least i hope to rely on my stocks dividends to also give me a certain portfolio every month yeah and the certain uh income every month and the reason why i have these three is because god forbid anything happen to them i mean insurance sorry investments are the riskiest like you don't know stock markets crash you get nothing for the year all right then i still have the other two to view which is still quite comfortable more than two thousand insurance uh some insurance companies go broke or maybe you don't hit the target you don't get it i see a cpa so no matter what i still have at least one of these three that will be working for me uh 30 years down the road uh the last thing i just want to mention is of course no one hopes to rely on their savings in the retirement because it's not a lot but uh one thing that helped enable these like how many and able to save so much for dollar trees uh i don't know about uk but have you ever been scolded by an insurance agent scored by entrance agencies maybe i'm the one who score so i was actually quite shocked though someone shows aj who's called me and said cancer you know you're not saving enough you're only saving 20 that's so little the government is saving about 35 for you and you should follow the government's guidelines no i was like okay i never received scoring before but after that i started saving a lot more uh in line if i think about mr associate just now one in every three dollars goes to our is in our savings so likewise i also try to save on my own uh one and every three dollars there but very good advice from the from the financial advisor i think that is very very important well uh they'll understand maybe i have a next question for you how do you actually leverage cpr then you know to actually achieve your financial outcomes oh sure let me share about it sure so uh actually uh this year i'm gonna reach 32 uh but i plan to hit my frs plus basic healthcare sum uh oh do i need to explain what sapphire is uh the full retirement stuff yeah go ahead yeah uh full time and some is the amount you need in order to have like your cpf life uh pay out the full amount right yeah um at 55 or something yeah so and my basic health care summit 33 actually i'm a bit sad do you know why no i was supposed to hit it this year oh 32 but because there was no bonus last year you missed the mark okay you're here yeah so i'm actually going to attribute next year i calculated somewhere around march or april uh but what i love about this is that once you hit f5s in your ssa account because essays four percent interest beats the if i'm calling if i'm wrong the inflation of srs which is f is which is three percent is that right yeah yeah so because of that i once i fulfill my ifrs account uh if i'm not i never have to worry about it again so that's one less goal uh so that's one less worry for me one more goal achieved yeah intense just to leave it there so that you know just let the power compounding interest and just compile and you don't have to worry about exactly like einstein and mr show okay for me all right what i'm doing right now is doing the oa to sa transfer yeah i'll share more about that later all right uh yeah another thing i i am considering is to do the cash or retirement sum uh talkback in order to achieve it a little faster yeah some people do mention uh am i am i worried about oa2 oa or hdb uh should i show that now or should i share that later maybe we can share it later okay i'll show that later okay all right so uh i mentioned that i tried to maintain a high savings rate so actually uh one of the goals that i tried to have is to reach 100k by 30. uh and it's but it was actually quite surprising when i shared with some of my friends that i achieved this goal um i shared with some of my older colleagues and actually they told me andrew 100k why do you even need 100k at most one month you spend about 510k so that's that's you don't need that that much uh i should have another senior colleague like most singer in rank and he actually told me 100k i've now seen that my bang uncomfortable right he earns like more than me right uh but last stop but last but not least that was actually a group of friends who along my age were actually quite interested in showing how i managed to achieve that much uh for financial security uh because once you achieve this amount whether it's wedding whether it's renovation or buying a house you don't have to worry so much about having enough in your way right so they were actually quite receptive and they actually invited me over christmas uh keeping in mind the six six person safe business right uh to actually just share with them about uh how i managed to achieve it so um i think if you're open-minded enough to hear from your friends discuss finance tips or even just come for this webinar no really help you achieve your retirement goals yeah thanks jensen for sharing maybe moving on you can actually share you know comparison of the returns on the investments oh yeah so earlier on i was sharing about uh the three links that i rely on for my retirement so as i said uh personally i don't think i'm that good at investor if you look on the left hand side my percentage is actually about three point six percent uh and if i actually want it up to the same amount as i have in my cpf i actually have less of my investments than cps so cpf actually invests better than i do i can see 6000 on my own versus cpf almost 8 000. yeah so i'm very grateful that cpf is there because otherwise i'd be doing a terrible job of managing my money and it provides you know the basic foundation of course yeah okay okay so uh yeah my thing on cpf yes cpf savings cannot be withdrawn until age 55 and 65 but dollar per dollar the interest rate is a lot more attractive and stable especially when economy is bad i mean last year you know everything went down the weeds went down the str went down everything that could go down just went down all right and yeah cps still maintained and he has been doing so for i think how many years has it been just weeks we've been there three years it hasn't changed is it even older than me [Laughter] i think that's fantastic and i really want to encourage everyone the audience i don't know how old you guys are but it's very achievable to hit in the 30s don't wait until you're 50 years old because when you're 50 you have kids you have uh i don't know a car a country club what what other things to manage your summer expenses but you know when you're still 20 30 you're still very mobile you're very light on assets and commitments save as much as you can hit your fs and never worry about it again right and one of the benefits i have uh saying that i'm almost reaching school is that just give me so much confidence in my workplace in fact they nominated me as like the most adventurous the most daring colleague and they asked me like what's the sequence it's a bit hard to say like hey everybody i'm so daring because i have fis but i mean it is true like knowing that you have that financial peace of mind you have the backing that you know your foundation is taken care of if anything happens if i stop work today i know that my time is safe right and that just that just gives me a solid foundation to just try and dare to do new things all right very interesting sharing yeah i think moving on next you would like to share with us you know what is what you're intending to plan for your future so in my future i plan to finish my cpf savings at the end of this year hopefully with the bonus um or to achieve the full retirement stuff right or if not uh this year which is 186 000 so you're looking at that as your goal yeah that's right okay uh otherwise i hope to shoot it later by next year and of course i'll finish my insurance uh annuities by age 40. uh and then once i hit my fis i hope to start looking towards a buying hdb flat uh between 25 to 40 all right and uh once i finish my cpf i finish my insurance around 40 onwards when i have less commitments maybe even start a company or second career that's not exciting for your future yeah thanks for sharing jensen yep moving on there so this is so you know jensen was actually sharing you know a few milestones and you know withdrawals at 55 and so so forth maybe you could just share with us what happens to our cpf at 55 okay before i do that they just say wow this is uh so inspiring this is like a modern cpm member no audience maybe if you can give him a round of applause you can't do that but it's a very encouraging very discipline is well thank you yeah okay so uh uh on this uh topic of uh what happens the cpm at 55 this is the the most commonly asked question of the cpa port so i'll take some time to uh like explain what happened because there are some changes to your accounts so as i explained earlier before 55 a person has a cpa member has three accounts ordinary accounts special account and a medisave account at the 55 the 50 55 will give you a fourth account for the retirement account okay so then uh we will be transferring some of the monies from your ordinary and special account to your retirement account so first you have um your medisave account that remains unchanged that is for your health care needs then uh looking at the monies you have in your ordinary account and your special account you add them up together that's what the left hand side is trying to show and basically you break up break up this amount the sum of your ordinary current special account into three parts the first one the first five thousand and the second layer is called the full retirement sum which for a person who is a 55 years old this year in the year 2021 it's a 186 000 okay so the yellow portion is a 186 000 and then if you have a more than this uh 5 000 plus 186 000 that forms the third part which you call access rate savings then at the 55th birthday your retirement account is created then we will move the second part okay the full retirement sum over to your retirement account so now you have a two part site the green and the yellow and the money in the retirement account the yellow part is meant to fund your retirement from the age of 65 whereas the green part is something that you can withdraw anytime after 55 if you want to if you don't want to you remain there and you continue to earn the cpf interest so i'll talk about the yellow part first can you move the next slide so this monies that is in the retirement account can be any amount up to the full retirement sum up to 186 000 dollars it will be in a retirement account and your retirement account earns the same interest rate as the special account so minimally four percent and with the extra interest can go up to six percent okay so an interest as long as there's money in the retirement account so you start to have the money at 55 and 10 years later at 65 this is when the cpf life starts for you uh if you have at least sixty thousand dollars into your in a retirement account at that time you can start your cpf life payouts and uh this cpf life essentially is an annuity which uh which is an insurance product which is like uh basically uh it pays you it pays you an amount uh every month for n is for life as long as you're alive you get the amount when you pass away then the mouse stops so you can start getting the payout at 65 or if you don't wish to right maybe because you're still working you don't need the money or you have a other money money in the bank account that you should use first that's okay so you don't need to start right at 65. basically you have a five year period to decide when you want to start okay between 65 to 70. uh so if you start later let's say at 69 or 70 the benefit is that because you delay the getting the payout the money is growing every year that you defer the payout when you start getting a payout your payout amount increases and every year you defer it will increase by around seven percent okay so that means uh when you start later you will get a bigger amount okay can we have the next slide so this is some examples of how the payout would look like for somebody who has 186 000 and 85 okay the one in green right the amount because it's earning interest right by the time you are 65 the amount will have grown to about 280 000 okay and if you decide at that point of time that you want to start your cpf like payout then the top third column shows uh how much you get a month between 1004 to 1005 okay so some some some members may not have the full retirement sum at 55 because the cpa essentially is a for saving is a you you get money when you work and you make contribution so some people maybe they didn't work long long enough or their income is lower so by the time they reach 55 they may not have much so they may have less than the full retirement sum in their retirement account so let's say you only have a 60 000 right at 55 then which is the last figure at the first column then the amount 10 years later at 65 would have grown to 97 000 and if you start your cpf like payout then you will get about 540 dollars to 570 okay so the if you have a smaller amount then of course your payout is a smaller and vice versa you see that there's a top figure above the 186 279 000. so as i said we we would transfer your money at 55 from the ordinary account to special account up to the full retirement sum okay however if you wish to right if you wish to voluntarily put in more the scheme allows you to do so up to another 50 more which which is then go up to 279 000. so you can do you can put this extra money uh voluntarily using cash or you can transfer uh from the ordinary special account you know remember that like that green porsche i mentioned left over in your auditory special account you can transfer that into your retirement account then your retirement card has more money and if you have a 279 000 and 55 you'll find that you have about 2000 to 2002 at the office of like payouts so there's a lot of uh flexibility for a person to to tailor his retirement according to his needs so in essence this is how the cpa applies and it's quite amazing that you know at 55 you know it's uh for someone that has full retirement 786 you know just without doing anything really because of the power compelling interest you can see the amounts that is actually there 65 is 280 000 that pays you the amount of money the amounts you can have like payouts right for life no matter how long you leave yeah yeah okay so maybe moving on uh next maybe i have this question for you then then how maybe you can just share with us some tips on you know how you can actually accumulate more savings for you know more and higher future payouts yeah okay so basically um there are only three ways uh just so i'll show you let's stop by the the base case if this is what will happen then uh if you want to have more right more of a cpf how what can you do so basically the only three ways uh in the earlier years you put in more right or rather you reduce your outflows or your before retirement you reduce the outflows of course if you reduce your outflows then you have more sitting in your account and uh and you earn more interest then later on when you want it then you have more and the second then the second way then is you you increase your inflows that means uh over and above what contribute compulsorily through work yeah there are avenues for you to voluntarily put in more i think jensen has mentioned some of these ways so you can put in more or you increase the what i call the effective interest rate basically the ordinary account earns a lower interest rate compared to the other accounts if you transfer some of your order account to your to the higher interest bearing accounts and overall you will get a higher interest rate so these are the broad ways so i'll elaborate okay so these are some ways which you can reduce your outflows first is uh use part cash cpf for your mortgage payments so this is referring to the monies in your digital account which most people use it to fund their property purchase the down payment or for the mortgage payment every month so it's very common that singaporeans do so uh and and it's a is it's not an issue at all especially at the early stage most people don't have much money by the time they need to make a property and property is quite a big expense so they need to rely on their ordinary account to for the down payment and mortgage payment that that's that's uh okay and having a property is a big thing having a group overhead right but uh over the years uh hopefully like the good case uh your salary increase you get the promotion bonuses and so on so you may find that your contribution increased and you are able to build up some some savings uh even outside of cpf or bank bank account all that so maybe that at that time you may have to consider right instead of relying fully on your ordinary account for the mortgage payment use some of your savings your bank savings for that for that mortgage payments so it's a part-time arrangement and the advantage of course is that you are by leaving some in the audience that amount is earning interest interest rate of 2.5 compared to your bank which is a low in low interest and um later on if you have more savings you can even consider paying fully your mortgage payments using cash instead of a cpf so this is an option for people to consider second is uh about using cpf for investments so cpf savings your ordinary and special account can be withdrawn for investment for certain investments so that's that's okay but if you have a cash some spare cash you may also consider using those spam cash instead of a cpf savings for the same reason now you look at the opportunity cost right and every any product that you any investment product that you are thinking of to use your cpf to invest in you can also use that use your cash to invest right and the third is uh do withdraw your cpf savings uh from 55 only when you need to so here i'm referring i refer back to the slide that blue portion right after the money had been somehow the money had been sent aside to the retirement account what is left over if there's some money in your ordinary account and a special account those monies can be withdrawn anytime you wish right from 55 you can withdraw the full amount you can withdraw partially you can withdraw immediately at 55 you can withdraw later there's no no restriction if it's effectively like a savings deposit that you have a full flexibility on plus is that what you're trying to say plus it is earning at least 2.5 which uh i don't think any bank account in singapore can uh place it so it's a to me it's a very good deal it's what i call the your best emergency savings in in town you know it's a very good place for you to put your emergency savings in and on the other hand you're still getting very high interest rate so like try not to withdraw this amount but if you have need for it then that's fine if not then leave it there what i wanted to say is that you know we're paying now right it's so convenient you can actually do the withdrawals any time anyway you don't even have to queue you know in the bank you know to withdraw we actually made it so seamless for them so you know yeah just like what mr said you know do not if you do not have immediate needs for it then just leave it there and you know the excess you can withdraw anytime anywhere we clean out instantaneously you receive the monies that's right that's a cpf atm okay so this is about uh reducing uh your outflows then uh yeah in terms of increasing your inflows and uh increasing the effective cpa interest rate there are a few ways you can do so so first is uh retirement pop-ups so this is referring to putting money into your special account if you are below 55 or the retirement account if you are above 55. you can there are two ways to do so you can put cash into the account or you can transfer from the ordinal account to the special account return account as a case a b now there's a limit to how much you can do so and the limit is the full retirement sum if you are below 55 and the enhanced retirement sum if you are above 55 meaning if you are somebody who is below 55 how much you can transfer from your audio account or how much cash you can put your your special account is that after the transfer it cannot be more than the full retirement sum 186 000. for somebody who is older above 55 it is the enhanced retirement sum 279 000 if you if you put in a cash there's a additional benefit of a tax relief up to the full retirement sum the cash the tax relief is uh up to seven thousand dollars a year that means the first seven thousand dollars you put in in cash into for retirement uh every year you get the tax relief so that may be a extra attraction especially for people who are paying taxes so this is the retirement top-ups then you have this the other ways of putting cash either into three accounts or into the maybe save account this is what we call the voluntary contribution so um every every year um the total contribution from work that you can put in is uh 37 740 dollars how does that come about there's a there's a limit of a six thousand dollars a month for contribution that means the first six thousand dollars of your salary attracts a cpf contribution salary above six thousand do not so so if you let's say your salary is six thousand five hundred dollars only the first six thousand attracts cpa the last five dollars doesn't attract cpf okay so there's a limit there your monday's uh salary limit which is the six thousand then in the course of a year you get salary every every month you also get a wholenesses at different times of year so we allow up to 17 months of a salary in a year right 12 months for your base pay january to december and up to five months for bonuses and so on so if you if your salary is more than six thousand and you have a more than 17 months of a pay in a year then in a sense you you max it like you you max what what the system provides for you'll find that you have a 37 740 uh going to your cpf for that year from work then if your salary is less than six thousand or you have less than 17 months of a pay then you find that there's a there's a gap right so that gap is what you can voluntarily put in on your own that's what you meant by voluntary contribution and you can put in so that it goes in three accounts the same way as uh your contribution from work does or you can uh specifically ask for it to go into maybe safe so that's more for healthcare needs okay and finally there's another uh way to do so to put the money volunteering to cpf which is called housing refunds so i think most people would be familiar that you use your ordinary account to fund your housing for your property should you sell your property one day you have to return whatever you have taken out plus accrued interest and the crude interest means uh interest that we have earned had you not been joined in the first place okay so so this is a standard rule but maybe if more people realize that actually you don't need to sell your property you can return it voluntarily earlier if you wish to do so and that's called housing refund right so the advantage of a doing housing refund is that of course the money that you earn you put it back in start to earn ordinary account interest and so you sell it subsequently then you need to refund back lesser that because you have already refunded some yourself like pre-prepaid impact already okay and so this is a housing refund and this is something which actually has gained quite a lot of popularity together with the diamond pop-up i think thanks a slide on the retirement pop-up so this is uh this shows how popular the scheme has been actually i think the cpap issue released a issue a press release recently uh last year it was a record uh three billion dollars of a retirement top-up that they made by singaporeans into for their retirement so it's very encouraging and even the housing refund has seemed a very dramatic increase i think it's more than a billion dollars last year people have been putting back whatever they have for housing so all in all in the board i think we're very happy to see see this behaviors of our members it shows that the members have confidence the cpa believe it's attractive and uh and are using it to plan actively for their retirement i also understand that you know in terms of the top parts that have increased you're on year we're also seeing a trend that you know more and more young members are actually doing the top-ups that's right yes very good yeah that's very encouraging like tensorflow intensive yeah that's actually doing that okay maybe just move on yeah yeah so this is just an example to to to make it more concrete and specific right so some people may be worried or i think a lot of money to plan for retirement actually they you don't necessarily need to have a lot of money so you just show this example that even if you're just talking about 50 per month that's probably something that's uh quite doable for a lot of people you'll find that it can go a long way right 50 a month can translate to about 18 000 you know over 30 so don't be little the little uh savings that you can can make along the way every bit uh helps okay and finally we have this uh uh new scheme called the mesh retirement savings scheme which is just a launch this year last last month and uh basically to help those who have not accumulated a lot uh to be able to start to plan for the retirement and uh the it has all the attractiveness of the retirement pop-ups mentioned earlier in addition there's a matching government country contribution for it every dollar that is uh contributed the government matches it so it is a further boost so people who are eligible for this uh mrsa scheme have been notified so encourage if you're one of those encourage you to participate in it the maximum amount that you can uh put in under this scheme is a is a 600 per year and it's a for five years and then then the government will match this top up right and if uh let's say your parents for instance is eligible for it then i encourage you to uh and talk to them encourage them to to take advantage of it maybe you can uh stop up for them and then the government's help your parents can have a very better retirement okay thank you very much mr so um so before we move into the q a segment um i have this question for johnson um maybe you could just share with us what do you what is it that you actually like about cpf and maybe uh also want to get you know some some feedback from you you know on what is it that you know we can actually do better do more to make cpf more engaging sure um i should have some slides prepared so if you could show them so actually one thing i love about cpf and again uh i think you'll hear me think about ns car lot because i'm still doing my ns cycle um i love the ns uh milestone contribution so i was quite happy it's not a small figure it's quite big actually it's about three three thousand each time uh plus two thousand four i mean so about 5k in total right for your cpf that's quite a big sum when you look at it uh at your your year-end contribution so that's something i really appreciate if government could give it more often than another thing is i'm not sure if many people in the audience know there's this new website called are you ready uh kid do you know who designed this new interface uh that's actually from our communication school in fact you know it's actually a uh it's a tool that we introduced late last year and it's a personalized uh retirement guide so you just answer a few questions and then you know we will actually you know provide you with creative tips articles so you have actually used this uh planner yeah i have uh in fact if i'm not sure if they're still offered by the effect they offer me five dollar grad foot voucher to use the calculator so is this too ongoing so the plan is you're ongoing but you know in terms of the redemption of the of the of the e-vouchers we have actually ended because yeah we just recently ended that again for these special people yeah it's very colorful very attractive very easy to use uh compared to the other cpf website which is a bit more complicated so uh i really encourage you to just give it a try uh so many things that you can find from over from there which might not be so obvious in the traditional cpf website oh i do have one more thing which i just remembered though uh kate do you know that actually in the last two weeks you could have gotten ample for putting money into your cpf do you know that using google pay yes using google google pay and actually another company youtube was offering uh cash back or offering uh um piles for making payments and most people expect him to pay uh like 711 restaurants stuff like that but someone pointed out actually and i hope i'm not spoiling this hack like you can actually pay cps and that counts as a merchant so you can actually get cash back if you pay cpf and i think that's when i found out i just started washing the page if i give you a pay yourself and then you get alpha as well and you get interest as well so like it's win-win win right there's no nose at all and oh everyone in my community just started sharing this and we started like uh paying the amount every day so i think that's another hack that people might not be aware of that i was talking to you know some colleagues from the retirement scheme and they were saying that you know they're seeing a lot of pop-ups from this particular campaign yeah so to the audience out there my colleagues i will be actually pasting the url of the cpr planner so uh if maybe after the webinar or you know over the weekends if you're free you know you just feel free to to play with that you know to see your channel thank you jensen uh maybe some suggestions for us you know how we can actually do better and some of the things that we could consider to make it more engaging for our members yeah sure another question i have is are you guys are you guys aware of when cpf uh interest celebration day is getting out the year [Laughter] uh some people stay awake to like look at the new year fireworks other people still like to look at the cpf interest really so yeah there's a group of us to actually stay up to like wait until the cpf interest is like put in and then like we start start sharing but this year we actually achieved how much more last year i say my goal uh is so i can see over there my goal right now i'm getting about 7 000 or so my goal is to quickly hit uh five digit interest yeah all right um another so perhaps cpr could encourage this or i don't know have some lucky draw or something not too sure um another thing is some people are interested in looking at cpf interest calculator not just on a year-end basis but monthly basis so i include a picture of this friend called quanyu who's actually like creating a complicated formula trying to uh figure it out yeah um as well as maybe automated oa to sa transfer right now you have to click it manually each time which is actually quite uh troublesome for me it's only do it once a year but have another friend who's even more displayed he actually does it like every single month the day it comes in the course is afraid of like losing on any extra interest yeah um i don't you mentioned the 50 dollar uh top up every month is is there a is that october can there be a function automated or gyro yeah yeah you can actually apply for gyro yeah and then you know it just becomes automatic that you know uh okay that okay i wasn't aware that was dry or maybe i'll try that cash yeah yeah maybe i'll try that okay yeah and last but not least so um i know that cpf has like housing calculators like how much loans you can take and all that but they don't really have like um based on your current contribution history uh you'll reach this goal in like in like one year or in two years so like for me for my first i have to calculate myself when am i going to hit it where am i not going to if it was small uh sure more like automatically calculated i think more people like me are inclined to try and achieve their goals as quickly as possible yeah so sister what do you think about you know the suggestions from jensen from the very good idea i think it would be very interesting you know the interest rate celebration you know where maybe even you're guessing how much severe interest you know you will actually receive in that year and everybody celebrate you know seeing the five figure inches coming into your accounts yeah thank you so much jensen", "TPENNE0AdNM": "[Music] [Applause] food [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] no not you", "8oIRiAXCBxI": "[Music] all right cool let's do it what's up guys i'm stellas williams aka the wolf faster education on health fitness social well-being i'm here with my fellow youtubers coaches friends shawn noriega and johnny candido and today we're going to be doing a roundtable discussion q a pretty much both sean and i got our stories asked you guys to ask us some questions and we're gonna answer those questions i'm really looking forward to this i love talking with these guys just about fitness and not fitness related things as well but um yeah we're just gonna dive right into it sean do you want to start with some of the ones that you got absolutely let's get to it all right ladies and gentlemen our first question of the day is what is the first variable you change for lifter when a lift is not progressing do you guys want to take charge i can take charge yeah go start flaw man all right starts off so the answer that i have for this is and it depends but i'm going to expand upon this so when it comes to whether or not a lifter is progressing there are a couple things that i'm going to look at and i have what i would kind of call like a fatigue fitness flow chart um basically a lifter could be not progressing for a multitude of reasons right and ultimately if we group them into very vague categories it could be a result of doing too little or doing too much um and what i'm going to do in conjunction with actually looking at the program is get feedback from the lifter so there are there are multitude of variables that we can change here right we can change the amount of total volume a lifter is doing the frequency a lifter is is doing um the variations that they're doing or even the rep ranges that they're working in so there are a couple different scenarios that we could see here where if a lifter is experiencing um decreased performance as as evidenced by the question saying that you're not progressing anymore uh in conjunction with feelings of like soreness general fatigue uh trouble sleeping losing weight you know things associated with being over stressed then for me that would tell me okay this lifter is performing too much volume now the metrics or the variables that we can change to address volume could be you know the per set uh or per day you know set count for a given lift um if we have gone to a point in frequency that we believe to maybe be too aggressive for example if a lifter has squatted two days a week and we've upped it to three days a week we might realize that this could be a frequency that is outside of their their realm of management at that point in time where we can pull back frequency as a mean and reduce volume now on the flip side of things if we are experiencing a reduction in performance or lack of progression and the lifter is feeling overly fresh but the movement pattern is feeling clunky or foreign that might be a sign to us that the frequency or the volume is too low if a lifter is performing a frequency that is feasible for example if you're squatting three days a week and you're experiencing this i'm probably not going to bump you up to four days a week of squatting but it is probable that if you are experiencing that while being a three time a week squatter you might need to do more overall work right the the volume uh dose response relationship of volume is definitely very um linear up into a point so if if we're experiencing the feeling of oh i'm recovering i'm crushing things but like performance isn't going up it might need to increase more there um i'm getting a little rambly here so the things that i have not addressed yet i would love to hear from both of these guys because i know that they have uh different systematic approaches uh in terms of and maybe the order in addressing some of these things so i'll pass down the line to marcellus here yeah so first of all i mean i completely agree with sean is saying in terms of like you know you have to look at the total volume dosage across the board as well as get that feedback from the lifter right because sometimes it it may not have maybe anything necessarily related to the program it could just be outside stressors right so it's like okay are we eating enough are we sleeping enough and if we aren't on top of those things first i always like to address those outside factors before changing the programming especially if it seems like the program was working well up to a point until suddenly oh my my work low went up my hours at work change things of that nature and of course if it's a situation where hey you can't help it you have to work this many hours then you start adjusting the programming um and my mentality is always to try to make the smallest changes first so like with what sean said where let's say you have someone who's squatting um you know maybe two times a week right before i would even go to three times a week i would maybe just increase the volume a little bit on those two days first if i think it's the fact that they're not doing enough um before going into a third day then of course if it gets the point where okay we do need more volume but we are kind of pushing the threshold of what we can do on these two days that's when i probably introduced that third day coming in from there um so i'm very much big on the idea of like okay make the smallest changes first as well as make one change at a time i absolutely hate when like you know um i see like literally like oh hey this isn't working so i'm gonna take this out i'm gonna add this in i'm gonna switch this variation because then even if you do get things clicking again you don't know why so i think making the smallest possible changes that you can first when it comes to like you know the volume the frequency and then even looking at things like rep ranges right like changing up how the volume is broken down maybe instead of doing like you know uh three by five maybe try like a five by three i know for myself and you know other clients that's something that's that makes a big difference like i just respond better to doing like you know a five by three even with the low being the same versus three by five just the quality of my sets and reps is better and i get much better progress from that so in conjunction with everything sean saying it's like you know even though there is a lot right that he went into you don't have to try to change all those things at once start with the simplest measure first adjust that give it a couple weeks see how you respond and then keep going from there scientific method brother that's it yeah that's it yeah yeah so extending off of that i completely agree with everything marcellus just said i would say my specific hierarchy is first barbell variance if you like we said with volume equated yeah which is the smallest change in my opinion um and specifically for myself usually i have a rotation of three exercises that are kind of the primary barbell variant and i think that helps avoid just programming random things for the sake of it yeah so if every third cycle and ultimately that's a very big space of time in between each um and then if one is you know not working out so well change that first then if it becomes a trend more broadly i think that's when i go from barbell variant to rep range to volume to frequency so the absolute last thing that would change is frequency because i think that changes so much of someone's schedule yeah he said that's really fundamental um and the reason why i think it is important not to go to volume too quickly is we know it works and sometimes when you know something works you're not really finding out exactly what is the problem and as narrow of uh of really of um identification as possible and if you have many problems going on once and like i said you solved the problem with volume you might not really know the problem and then it you're basically masking it yeah right yeah so i definitely completely agree with um with what all of them are saying and i would say um yeah like i said it's it's really tricky as a coach and as a lifter yourself to say maybe i could solve this quicker but if i can get this person to add five to ten pounds their max uh just by swapping out a high bar squat with a low bar paw squat because especially we'll give a specific example someone has it really low on their back a lot of times especially lighter females for example they're more likely not going to see the same carryover from high bar sure and if you could switch that over immediately and get a positive effect then you can save going from you know three by five to four by five on their peak volume and now you have that in your back pocket yeah yeah and there's there's so many different ways you can address volume too like you said the the barbara variance the con specific work maybe you just add in an extra day of belt squats or something like that just to get that extra workings i've even had times where i haven't changed many variables with the kind of specific lifts i'll just play okay let's add a little bit more bell squad volume here and that gives us that stimulus we need or hey let's actually pull back a little bit on the accessories and then we don't have to change any of this at all yeah and and that works out well too one thing i want to add is when we talk about rep ranges i think it is especially with you kind more my audience side of things i think a lot of people would interpret that as changing volume in and of itself yeah i think it is really critical to say like you can really train with adequate volume for hypertrophy on the comp lift with five by four type days absolutely six by four ten by three yeah so first if you find eights do not help your squat at all go from a three bite to five by four don't go from a three by eight to a three by four or four by three yeah and i do think a lot of people make that mistake they see a positive effect but that's just from the artificial taper yeah yeah exactly like i said myself for example like i just changed it from a three by five to a five by two still saying total workload being done yeah and on the flip side of that as somebody who is is very biased toward because of my own personal experience toward high reps um i think that especially you know obviously this is marcellus's channel but for a lot of the people watching this from johnny's audience i think that a lot of the uh like the textbook knowledge of strength training would lead you to believe that like if we want to get stronger at the 1rm like specificity is the most important thing yeah but on the you know on the other side of the spectrum of what johnny just said there really are people who have rep range sensitivities on certain lifts you know for a period of time maybe longer than would be deemed acceptable in like the you know triphasic model of training yeah um you know those high reps might actually move your top end strength like for me personally you know my deadlift is a lift that i really tolerate very very little intensity and most of my volume is like in the sevens you know rep range of seven and higher and that's something i'll carry all the way through to the meat and i see the best results with that so you know you say through the meat how close to the meat so i literally my last deadlift session aside from so the week of i'll usually just take like a couple singles with like a last warm-up but literally the week before the meet i am doing like eights on one day for example and tens or nines on the second day so it is literally like not even you know an undulating periodization it is literally like high reps all the way to the meat and i would say most people don't fall into that category most people cluster you know toward the middle of the bell curve but you know that is something to consider because a hypothetical scenario that we could have here is you might have a lifter who is feeling like actual signs of being beat up but when you look at their historical training it doesn't really seem like they're doing more than what they have in the past and in fact maybe you're doing less and that's an experience that i had during periods of time where i was training lower rep on deadlift even if i counted the total number of weekly reps and the tonnage it was lower than when i was training high rep but physically i felt as if i was over training so it's really like a you know when you're training on on one side of the spectrum where the percentage is really low you're moving so much differently even though you're doing the same movement moving so much differently than you might be doing doubles or triples where like the fatigue per rep is is a little bit different because the movement does change yeah so and i mean that's why i mean kind of to close that question off that's why we i think all of us on our channels encourage like hey keep track of your past sheets your data follow those trends like at the end of the day regardless of what might be good on paper or textbook if you notice a certain trend with yourself regardless if 10 other people are doing it or no one else is doing it it would be very wise of you to follow that because it's giving you the results you want and if you've noticed that anytime you shift or change this even a little bit that your performance goes down just stop screwing with it like it like it really is that simple yeah cool awesome so i actually have a question that i think segways you know we segway nicely into this question as a result of the last one because somebody asked us on each of your lists so on your squat on your bench press on your deadlift can you recall your best taper and meet performance on each of those lifts and i think each of us have very unique situations where you know everybody has an idea in their head who maybe has competed before or as self-coached um of like a formulaic way you're supposed to taper but oftentimes that's you know not always gonna be what you do so um i guess i'll start yeah so i actually on i'll try to do this very simply i already alluded to this with deadlift this meet that i did with my coach steve dinovi it was our first prep together um i have seen in especially in my past me that sticking to my guns and really believing that high rep deadlifting would work uh that it turned out really favorably the last meet i did in july 2020 i pulled 716 pounds which was a seven and a half kilometer for me um and during this prep that i did with steve uh he he you know trusted that that was a real experience that i had and in the same way we really kept volume pretty uh pretty static even in that last week before the meet where you know you would be thinking you'd be doing doubles triples just lower rep ranges in general and maybe even bringing the total weekly volume down uh it stayed pretty static where i literally had you know a single a set of five three sets of eight on day one and then like literally pause sets of ten on day two and then the week of the meet i kind of slashed it all off took my last warm-up for a couple singles on that day one which was a wednesday competed on a saturday and pulled a very very comfortable uh 727 pounds on deadlift so that is definitely a strategy that we are going to implement going forward now with bench press i would definitely say that this meet despite not making my third attempt was also probably the best bench performance that i've had in terms of just strength output and the reason for that is with my bench press when you know historically i've benched five days a week even sometimes six days a week the more frequently you bench the more difficult it is to break the fatigue patterns that arise meaning what days are your strong days what days are your weekdays if you're a deadlifter who deadlifts once a week you could probably you know not even have to deadlift on the day of the week you compete and be fine with a taper but with something like a bench press where you're doing five days a week even six times a week you're doing it so frequently that your recovery pattern like your you know recovery week essentially gets condensed where now you're seeing multiple patterns within one week so it really was important for me to line up my training in such a way that saturday always felt like the strongest day and what we did was followed kind of like an emerging strategies time to peak model with my bench press where we reset the training block at a six week out mark because we realized that if we kept a micro cycle for x number of weeks and just progressed the rpe that my bench press would peak on that sixth week so we didn't taper at all the week of the meet we literally kept every variable exactly the same the variations the rep ranges the total set count everything was exactly the same and just trusted that okay we see a great performance on the saturday this sixth one is going to be the best one and i and i truly felt that way given that there were some days even on a rogue fat pad where 220 felt like a difficult bench and 218 and a half was you know obviously i didn't hit it but uh to do it on a non-fat pad and actually have the potential to hit it you know clearly indicates that there was not a significant strength disparity which to me tells me that we did a good job with bench um be really quick with squat here um i have definitely experienced um this passed me a not great squat peak and i believe that's because we pulled volume too early um if you kind of get the gist of how things go for me here i'm definitely like a late peeker where i can't resp at least on meat day i don't respond well to a stepwise taper or even a linear one where you know i'm gradually pulling away stress i do really well with kind of riding out with a certain amount of stress and just slashing it you know as last minute as possible my best meet that i've ever done on squat was the 2019 arnold where i squatted 650 pounds and uh my rep ranges stayed pretty high all block um i think a week out i had like five sets of seven on my day one squat and like six or seven sets of four after a top single on my day two um where the week before i think that was actually my peak volume for the block if you're doing both tonnage and number of working sets and then the week of the meet it was a very very similar to deadlift it's just a drastic slash and that's where i squatted 650. this time around we reduced volume two weeks out um and then i think by the time i got to meet day i was i was pretty flat and only hit 628 despite hitting you know a very sub-maximal 639 in training so a lot of different ways to to skin a cat and uh for me i've noticed you know even though we do things differently for each lift there's kind of this like you know um you know uh pervading trend for me that i have to really kind of keep things in longer than than most people would yeah that makes sense uh so i'm like the exact opposite of sean when it comes to a lot of it but especially with the deadlift those who have been killed the channel know that for me in my entire last prep i drastically got rid of a lot of deadlift volume i pretty much on my primary day of day only worked up to my top set like my top single and had no back down volume at all whatsoever like you know i would make up for with bell squats and stuff like that but did not have any type of a deadly volume um from the floor except for my top set and then on my secondary day was running just rdl's all the way up until about three weeks out from the meat then went from rdl's to some very light percentage-based pulls from the floor on that secondary day really just to get a little bit more uh refinement with the movement and it literally started around like sixty percent at about like four weeks out it'd be like a five by three then two weeks out be about 62 percent it would turn to like a four by three then a three by two and then a three by one and that's just something that i've always done on my deadlifts in general um and even with the huge reduction in deadlift volume it worked out great for me the heaviest i pulled in the entire prep was 589 and i pulled 617 uh at the meet so i know that for me just and we kept intensity pretty high like usually like the final like you know block going into a meet i might either work out to about like an rpe 8 or an rp9 like so usually if i'm going up to an rp8 that would be about the heaviest i hit or if i hit a nine it's because i hit like a seven to seven half the week before but we did something a little bit different this time where brad had me hit an eight at the three week out mark and then a nine at the two week out mark and then of course when we're one week out i end up hitting like um like uh six to seven on both squat deadlifts and like about seven to eight on bench but what we found just because i've always known i had a really good response to intensity um was that i actually got just a really huge boost from doing that compared to only hitting it like once and i won't like i was a little worried about it first because usually after hitting that rpa i'm thinking man if i come in here i think i'm going to feel kind of wrecked but my rp9 felt fantastic and that the one week out mark of course since i'm recovering from two weeks of pushing the intensity more the sevens didn't feel fantastic but they moved in the way that i know like okay my deadlift is good to go so for me my deadlift pretty much just thrives on keeping my intensity at a certain level like throughout and then when i get closer to me just getting in a little bit of that additional practice and technically get adding in a little bit more volume pulling from the floor and then of course when we're one week out pulling that away and then just letting that look really show up and shine uh as for my bench press so in the past what we've done with my bench is very slight reductions um kind of similar what we've talked about showing very slight changes as far as like overall volume stuff like that i'm still constantly touching like heavy lows even at that one week out mark i'll touch like an rp8 on bench just because keeping those heavy loads in my hand especially that long range of motion is good for me and then we might get a little bit of tapering throughout the week but this time around we actually reduced things a little bit more drastically and part of it was due to kind of like just trying to make sure my shoulders stayed healthy because i was dealing with stuff as far as that so uh at the one week out mark my bench volume was the same as as always his banks i don't really reduce anything at the one week out mark um and i bench four times a week and then on the secondary day same thing um i had like a long like a long pause single to get because that secondary volume day becomes more like a secondary intensity day getting closer to the meat but then on days three and four we drastically cut back intensity and volume so instead of having like you know a usual three by seven on that third day it was like a three by four and then on the fourth day i literally just did like two sets of five like an rp5 and my bench felt freaking fantastic on on on the meat day even though i did the same thing shawn even though i didn't get my third bench it was easily the strongest that it had felt in months and i think for me it's just the fact that because i have such a long range of motion that i drive through um that's that reducing the volume and kind of just getting more of that fatigue off but also kind of taking a little bit of a break from the heavier load those last videos going into it just makes me feel really strong and powerful the day of when it comes to my bench press and that's something that i've noticed like with a lot of my clients as well where they when they have the closer grip and they push that longer range of motion being a little bit more aggressive with the taper compared to what a lot of codes would recommend with bench actually has a bench feeling really good the day of and then as for my squat um squat was a little bit different this time around too as far as usually the way i go about is i'll have two like comp squat days and then one variation whether it's ssb or high bar and we ran that all the way into the meet until we were one week out then it was like three comp squad days but funnily enough this was like the least reduction i ever had in my squad volume so one week out i was still squatting the same way that i was two weeks out the secondary day what i would usually do for ssb volume we just changed it to comp squat specific volume and then my tertiary day was just the same percentage work that it always had been so i actually made funnily enough compared to what i usually do the least amount of vault volume changes to my squat going into the me and i finally finally squatted 500 uh out of me so that's something that we found for me too is that because at this point my squat volume never gets crazy high anyway and i mix up so much of it with like you know belt squats and accessories stuff like that we make more slight adjustments to that keep the cop squat specificity pretty consistent and it everything showed up really well for me at this past meet and just and just to interject just to give a little uh more insight that i'm sure marcellus would agree with here since he mentioned his squat while we like johnny said earlier don't want to just have you know variations cycled through just for the sake of it yeah um on the flip side of that as marcellus mentioned like the ssb squatting was very favorable and transferred over very well to his squat and i think that what a lot a lot of times happens going back to that idea of like following the book of periodization like people get cold feet when it comes to like keeping a variation in or a movement in that's not comp specific but if we see transference that's continued to lead to progress like in the same way that we don't want to put variations in just for the sake of it it's like if something is really driving the top end on your actual competition movement like if you've got to keep it in you know maybe maybe the last couple weeks like marcellus had mentioned um you know you reintroduced the squat just for the the sake of specificity in a way that you know there's not enough time for it to really change exactly you know how fatigue enters um but i mean that's that's a you know a super valuable strategy to to consider i've had i've literally had lifters where i've kept you know a variation all the way through to the meat yeah particularly like a female lifter where i've literally had her doing like a beltless pause deadlift on like the session that's three days before her meet and then just pr ridiculously so yeah i do think it's kind of crazy how people will so drastically change what they do in training for meat prep when it's like if you're hitting these big numbers in training with this style and with these variations there's no need to drastically change that for me because you want the same result yeah yeah so i'd say for my peaks i'd say the the biggest thing is with the squat i peak best tapering five days out having my last heavy day be five days out so i've done many times where i've tried to use uh seven day out strategy and at least with the way i do it i could probably adjust percentage of volume drop because i i'd volume drop by fifty percent i basically have typically a six by three turn to three by three um and that works really well basically being like 11 days out or actually probably uh sorry like eight days out then five days out and then like a three by one three days out and then compete uh i find that works extremely well and like when i squat at 625 pounds in the gym i actually remember it's actually kind of funny that my hamstring was sore i do i yeah it is a tricky line because i think one of the things is as you get stronger in powerlifting you start to have a bigger difference with how maybe how you feel recovery wise and with your performance and then it becomes really a matter of towing that line yeah like you can feel fantastic and just perform horribly like if sean dropped his volume like i'm sure his shoulders and elbows and even ours would probably feel really good just actually no i i definitely agree with you where it's like the swings are huge when you're really strong yeah where it's like for a newbie you know you get them feeling fresh and they have the best part so quick quick uh little thing i don't do anything to make my arch bigger i literally do nothing so when people ask me for tips like i just get on the bench like it is just naturally there so yeah my arch would probably feel better yeah okay yeah i'm perfect yeah so i'd say that is definitely the biggest trait with the squat and one thing that i will say i do actually very similar to marcel's with the heaviest single for me is week and five days out just like how he said you know his is two weeks out one thing that i do think people need to understand is that you can push projective one right max in slightly different ways and still push it in a way that's going to be less stressful mentally yeah like for myself i'll go for like i said week and five days out maybe i'm squatting like 590 575 something like that then five days out even i'm just now starting to taper but you still do need to push intensity in my opinion when you are taper or at least for my case when you're tapering you know fairly dramatically you know six by three turn into a three by three yeah so i'll still go for a lighter single but then a lot of times my triple my peak triple be like rp8 and a half and it'll be only five to ten pounds lighter than that single yeah so the projective one of our max will still rise in different ways yeah and i do think especially nowadays i think that's something sometimes people are scared of doing it's kind of similar to sean's like pause deadlifts being super strong or his rep out work being super strong like it's okay to just keep pushing this really high projected one right max and counting that it will convert over and in my experience when you are fatigued it is the singles that get affected the most from that flatness yeah um so yeah so as far as the deadlift that's definitely the one where i'm the most unique in because i do almost always a 2x4 with around 90 of my target one red max with straps it was just definitely not normal yeah it is because i do get a lot out of straps um and i've i have had many times where i typically do it three by one three days out or four days out and i've just failed it's actually funny because a lot of times these things happen i'm sure you guys have similar experiences where sometimes things just happen and then they end up being really effective and you find out after the fact like yeah that was interesting yeah so like the first time i pulled 300 kilograms i remember i just skipped that three by one day so i just had a but a really hard five days out uh deadlift and then just skipped that and then it was the first year pull in five days which to me was pretty foreign and it works super well so then i just kept doing that and then for the arnold uh when i pulled uh you know three seventeen and a half kilos that's exactly what i did so i for i did not pull at all three or four days out um and i just trusted that and to your guys's point like you just have to trust it if you've seen it enough that it's going to be true and there are a lot of times there are really small things that that end up being the reason so it's like for me personally i think the biggest reason is hand skin condition is i think if i pull even three days out for myself especially when i pulled mixed grip now hopefully with hook grip this will change when i pull mixed grip i do rely on tension on the hands so even three by one with 585 or 570 or something or 550 it still taxes the hands it still gets a little bit of that callus just a little bit looser and then the reason why i found this is a huge deal for me is one time i didn't deadlift for a very long time then i'd do a single and grip was not the limiting factor at all and i was like wow that's weird because i i didn't do any form work whatsoever yeah so i figured it was it was just the condition of my hands so ever since then i've been far more careful with that and i'd actually say grip was like the limiting factor with 683 and it was 700 it wasn't yeah because just because i had skin condition it really took me a long time to figure that out um so yeah as far as bench i would say it's just basically what you guys said honestly like i would say you know keeping feet up bench really long is the key actually after listening to you guys i probably will especially with sean i probably will entertain not cutting volume at all more because i have been the type where i feel required to come volume by at least like one set or 20 percent and i definitely will consider just not at all but um yeah certainly pushing like i'm pushing to like a four rep max four days out something like that for pr not max yeah uh four days out on comp bench was you know correlated i believe to my me pr of like um so it's exactly what you guys are saying and feed up bench seven days out but yeah overall i'd just say a sample workout i remember it was like 10 or 12 days out from the arnold and i did one single on bench at like uh 90 percent-ish maybe 93 percent-ish um and then i did three by 11 feet up bench then i did a single with 575 on squat 6x3 with 505 or 510 on on low bar squat that did three by five super dead left and two by six wide stance wide stance snatcher deadlift so did that all in the same day and i remember the person uh who's in the gym is like oh so you're not doing the arnold literally i mean that was by far my best peek because yeah that's why i told 16.75 and yeah i believe i had more in the tank on that day and it is amazing just how much pushing that edge um really becomes an advantage and eventually becomes necessary yeah yeah was great um this one is this one's a quick one to get out of the way and then i think let's go ahead and knock it out yeah so this one has been on a couple people's minds as a result of today with today being uh what is today saturday march 6th i guess sunday march 7th at the time we're filming this but anyway ashton and i are doing the showdown the wrpf showdown in september and people are wondering why are you doing this so marcellus will be able to speak to ashton since they are obviously coach client and they've spoken about this a ton i will speak on myself in this situation um i don't have any ipf loyalty i'm not anti-ipf per se but um i personally don't really have any crazy aspirations of competing in the ipf uh because the main competition in the 83 kilo weight class is in the us where i really feel like i am you know con if i if i were to win nationals i am conquering the pinnacle of the 83 kilo weight class and and to go to worlds and maybe not get that same level of competition i i don't really have that burning desire to go to a world championship and you know you know tout winning it if if the competition was stiffer in the united states so for me that that is that is the the thing there and the reason i bring that up is if you are to compete in one of these meets like the showdown or the current or whatever you do receive a one-year suspension from the ipf so that is not something that's looming over me that doesn't bother me at all and another big reason for it is you know i think that the great thing about usapl nationals is that the atmosphere is very like well done it is like meant to be promotional it's meant to be exciting and the untested side has been doing that really well especially in the in these bigger money meets and um in conjunction with that you know jawan garrison the 104th avenger if you're watching this juwan what's up dude uh you know he is a hot you know the highest level 181 at this point in time and i want to compete against the strongest people in my weight class i have not done a 24-hour weigh-in meet since my first ever meet which was back in 2014 um and i have not pulled on the deadlift bar since then so i would really be curious to see uh where i can push my total to especially since that concept of potentially hitting you know a 900 kilo total at 181 is is very you know it's in the conversation so that's my reasoning there um i know marcella can probably speak to ashton here yeah i mean it's very similar to sean as far as ashton as as far as ash and i are concerned ashton's biggest goal is always you know pushing his own limits and then going where the competition is that's it that's the whole reason why he moved up a weight class in the first place was because he's like you know what this weight class is as competitive let me go up and compete with the big boys and for ashton his whole thing with you know he wants to go to nationals and of course with nationals but his whole purpose really with going to worlds was to go up against rondell because that is his main competition that's it actions actually like in a slightly different situation than sean where if he were to go to worlds he actually would be able to have a good head-to-head battle and have some competition but with the way things are looking right now we have no guarantee that worlds is even going to happen or the sheffield so the way ashley's looking at it is like okay well the showdown is a way where i can you know go and be in a slightly different environment you know being on a squat bar deadlift bar and compete with the best of the best as well as the fact that rondelle may possibly be considering doing the showdown as well and that's what it comes down to like ashton has the most fun enjoyment when he's lifting when he feels like he's really challenging himself and the showdown is just like the next step after nationals for this year anyway in order to do that that's that's really all it comes down to um once again same thing as sean you know ashley's not anti-ipf or anything like that but some of the fact that it's like okay well if i can't go to this meet to compete against the best i'm going to go wherever i can to do that and right now that is a showdown and you can win money yeah oh yeah that's another big thing yeah yeah yeah like like that's that's another huge thing like it's a money meet it's like why not you get to do what you enjoy doing go against if you want to go against and equally money there's there's no losses i have a question do you guys think if you win meaningful money that you'll just be done with ipf once you get a taste of that um probably not i mean from my from my perspective right you know i have as my competition rusts in the 83s you know that is certainly a a rivalry and a battle that i'll always want to compete in um from what i know now uh nationals will go back to being in october after this year so scheduling wise you know i do want to continue to compete um in the usa pl it just kind of works out nicely that there is this gap where nothing's really going on in the usapl in you know the end of september um so i i don't think so um i mean i'm obviously in a different scenario than ashton where you know i think having a great meet i could be top five despite being a tested lifter uh but ashton literally is in the situation where like he literally can be and you guys will be getting tested at the meet right yeah so that's actually a good point that people probably don't know um because i'm sure some of you watching this are like oh they're going to this untested meme maybe they're hopping so actually um we are going to be getting drug tested on the day of the meet uh the directors of the showdown have been very kind and very like we didn't even ask for this just very open-minded and even making like the right assumptions like oh we'll make sure that we can get somebody there to drug test both of you immediately post meet so that like this looks clean as a whistle you know you guys are are clearly still drug-free lifters and we want to make sure that that's an own and i think that's really cool that they're like truly willing to not just merge both worlds but like actually make accommodations for the people that they really have no obligation to be making accommodations to so it's almost like this is the effect of competition when you don't have monopolies when you don't just have one way of doing things for everyone yeah to answer your question johnny as far as ashton i can't say for certain that he would be done because i do know that he still does want to do the sheffield like even if he has to like you know take the year off from it from doing the show i know that he does still eventually want to do that that can always change as of right now i know that he does want to do that eventually yeah so yeah okay hell yeah brother all right since since johnny got omitted from that one we do have a question for johnny which is this is a very uh this is one of my favorite questions honestly because i definitely can uh can empathize with this uh perspective or this experience because the question is lots of lifters got into lifting by seeing candida i definitely was one who joined the usapl because of johnny who was that person from mr hq himself well so if we're talking about we're talking about usapl specifically or lifting generally so the question wording is got into lifting okay because with lifting is very clearly my dad like that that is definitely just cut and dry what it is like i was running six week cycles you know back then as far as um you know like russian periodization style it's probably probably would have been better off with linear progression uh than like percentages but i was in a way it benefited me because i was used to looking at things analytically um yeah so i'd actually say that this connects to something i have thought before it's like i for me it really was nobody in particular outside of my family and outside of culturally just being like yeah of course we lived yeah like my mom my mom's met dorian yates and she doesn't even lift at all anymore it's just like a normal thing she knows who dorian's is ronnie coleman is all these people and yeah my dad's been lifting for like like 40 years or whatever it is you know since the beginning of time really and my brother also lifted so for myself lifting wise it was definitely for sports just to lift weights and i think it really did help that i never it was always something i did automatically so like i remember there was a time i was playing basketball when i was like uh freshman year i was pretty young for my class so i was probably like what 12 is that possible 12 what year yeah freshman year if you're young yeah because like yeah that's like probably like 14 or eight yeah what am i that would be thirteen it'd be thirteen because no it's definitely seventeen as a senior so thirteen then you're maybe thirty yeah because fourteen fifteen for freshers if you were young then but thirty two would be thirteen okay that was definitely thirteen like i was definitely on the young yeah because i was barely 18 in high school at any point so okay yeah um so it's 13. well you you act like sixth grade or something i was in one euro yeah but okay no yeah i was 13. i remember like at that point actually was pretty funny it was like uh our our basketball coach said like all right we're gonna you know lift weights and uh any he's like some of you guys you know may be able to only handle the bar or less you know maybe candido and he literally like by that point i was literally i know for sure i was the second strongest by a point because i i began lifting at 12. so yeah that was 13 then so i've been lifted for like a year and a half then and it was kind of cool to i liked the fact there's just something that i did for my own self and i knew i didn't interject well no actually my bench was pretty good i didn't say anything i i guess i always did kind of just not care what people thought i just did what i wanted and i was like if anything the tension that i had was i was a long jumper on like a d3 school who's like training smarter on every facet in my opinion like i would do a lot of explosive work and then they would excuse it going oh but you're training like a power lifter we're not trying to be powerlifters yeah so powerlifting actually had a negative association for me my entire collegiate life and it wasn't until uh you know everything really started taking off where it does feel cool that's like people want to be powerlifters it's not just something that louis simmons and these other crusty dinosaurs do so overall honestly like i found out about proud thing literally just googling parroting and as far as getting into a meet yeah and i thought the single ply numbers were raw qualification standards and had i not had that mistake there's no chance i would have done it if i knew everybody gets into running ashley's i would not have done it because i was too competitive yeah um and luckily i thought that then i got like second in 2011 um and then in a t3 division or whatever i got second out three which you know not too remarkable but then i remember like over and over again like people kept giving me respect for that i was like okay you know like to me it was nothing and then i gradually realized like i'm a lot better at lifting than long jumping and then from there i would say then it just really took off step by step but yeah i would say there really was nobody like because there were guys like vashawn perryman do you guys remember at all for sean perryman you know that is okay i'm old for our time at one point he had the 165 deadlift record at 7 16. then nassan off to ellenton 717 then national office yeah so yeah there was like perryman and some a few guys like that and that that alex toretsky or whatever his name is yeah who got busted for steroids and uh yeah so there's some of those yeah hi yeah josh hyde like there are some of those guys but um yeah overall i would say i didn't really have an idol and i think that helped like i was not like a historian with the sport or anything like that and i i think that really helps because then you just go with the flow yeah but what i will say quickly though is as far as youtube goes pat mendes is definitely an inspiration to me because pat mendes and eric's photo to me proved that lifting could be popular the moment i saw the his atg 880 pound squad yeah it was a 400 kilo it wasn't that was 800. oh yeah yeah it was 800. the moment i saw that belt with sleeveless atg squat be super popular i was like i do not believe that this sport can't be popular i know it can you just saw it and nobody has good quality with this yeah and so with that eric's photo and then just google search results being in the millions i'm like this can take off and i don't need anyone to show me honestly that's how i feel um yeah that's how it came into that pre-ipo evaluation there yeah yeah like that's why when i have a view like i'm i am extremely passionate by the time i'm like really committed to something and it's one of those things where i'm like i see everything aligning uh and then obviously a lot of external effects like uh like factors like crossfit and stuff help well yeah big time yeah yeah yeah awesome favorite or most underrated accessories and why and then conversely most overrated exercises accessory wise okay um we'll do this per body part so i think for me and and and well let me let me make this clear because johnny and i had a conversation about this earlier i'm going to to make the delineation between accessory and variation here to me accessory is going to be anything that's a non-barbell movement because i think we do track volume on variations kind of more one-to-one with the competition movements than we would for an accessory so for something like a squat um a belt squat to me is probably the best um as long as you have a good one i would say a good belt squat is probably the best squat variation that you can do so for example like a rogue rhino a pitch shark those are kind of my two favorites like i've used every belt squat i'm probably going to make a belt squat video at some point kind of detailing how to use it and and which ones i think are the best um you know obviously if you don't have a great belt squat like a leg press or a hack squat could work well but i really do feel like you're eliminating the you know axial loading of a barbell for this movement and especially for some people built like me or built like marcellus who are not necessarily you know don't have necessarily favorable leverages for something like a squat it eliminates that axial loading but the pattern really is like so similar to the squat that i think it out competes like a hack squat uh or a leg press for that reasoning um for something like a bench press i think probably um i think i think a lot of different answers here honestly yeah cause for me for bench press it's like i don't know how to explain this other than it's like the most like obvious that if you just have more muscle you'll lift more weight so uh a feed up variation whether it's larson or just a genuine feet up variation or just varying grip like if you are like a really wide grip bench presser um i think that within reason a closer grip could work better um but for someone who's more of a bench technician i've really seen a lot of success with a larson press um if you're kind of underdeveloped then i think that like there are benefits to um you know just like i said building more muscle where like transference of a very or a ver well i guess i said that we're not doing variations here let me backtrack a little bit and say uh accessory wise i don't know if i have a great answer for that um because i do really think that like the best supplemental stuff are the variations um so i will say the most i guess for upper body any sort of um i guess like chest press machine i will say yeah actually is pretty solid here because i think that when you eliminate um trying to think how to word this here but like with a dumbbell press i've seen very poor carry over some people and yeah very high carryover for others yeah um i'm just i'm just i'm not even gonna expand upon this i'm kind of well i'll pick up where you left off as far as that because i i actually agree i think the chess press is very underrated for this upper body um when it comes to the bench press because you know like you say a lot of people we know the barber variations larson close grip things like that dumbbell press incline barbell press but like you said just getting in good easy additional volume on the chest and the triceps which is very easy to do like with the chest press machine i've even like you know the same way we just do like banded belt squats i've seen people do like banded chest press just for the for the same reason um so yeah for the bench press i i think you know of course i do i do i get a lot out of dumbbell pressing for my bench press but in general if you're doing any type of upper body pressing motion i just for additional volume that's going to like at least in the aspect of gaining muscle mass more often than not going to help i know johnny you're kind of exception to that because you said you don't really get as much with uh with like you know doing anything outside of really bench work well you know what the one thing i would say i have gotten a decent amount out of but it's more movement related probably is loaded push-ups loaded push-ups actually i have seen some positive effects from that and i think it's also really easy to just load up a 45 or or a little bit more or weighted backpack just go to rp7 just yeah yeah yeah monolith yeah yeah and i do think because you know a little bit more of open chain movement things like that i do think you can get a little bit of a different training effect range while still having a wide grip yeah yeah personally i think the fixed grip of a chest press makes it to where it either works or just it just doesn't yeah i think that's the key is like like kind of a side attention but kind of finding what works best from the standpoint of like for me i know that even if i'm doing like you know larson press close grip long pause i can if i'm trying to get more volume in once again do my range of motion i can only do so much extra bench press work so for me doing like dumbbell press chest press or even like weighted dips just something that allows me to get movement variability while still working on the pecs and the triceps yeah that that that's that's out of every lift that's probably done the most for my bench is the way to ditch i know one especially building my base get as my weight diff went up my bench definitely went up along with it and even now like when i push that more i see the benefits of that so yeah for this is for all three lifts yeah or just just in general i'm like our most over our most underrated movements or accessory movements accessories yeah um has anyone said hamstring curl because i would say yeah yeah that's good i would say just due to the fact that none of the pilot movements train knee flexion yeah and hypertrophy just generally is useful yeah um i think a lift like that makes a lot of sense now personally myself i really found the benefit from seated hip adduction and hip abduction now i know um there definitely are a lot of specifics around that yeah um yeah i think you've mentioned before sean to me that you know especially with seated abduction you know you can have potentially overuse issues if you are someone who already has a lot of external rotation things like that well um well what i was going to say was that you know i guess if we're talking you know diving down a little bit of the movement science stuff is just that with something like the abduction um you know i think that a lot of times people try to train the glutes with something like an abduction where you know the primary function of the glutes is going to be hip extension and i don't know necessarily how much transference i really see in a movement like that even the hip adduction really is something that i don't see necessarily transference it's just that when we're talking like you said with overuse it's like power lifters tend to leverage abduction far more frequently than you would ever leverage adduction right like when you're when you're squatting you're never thinking knees in um you know when you're dead lifting you're never thinking knees in um you know your adductors do play the role in hip extension coming out of the bottom of the squat which is why i think that a lot of lifters probably could benefit from like a you know i don't know what you'd call it movement variability i'd hate to say the word preventative because it can't ever be preventative but just like you know insurance work if you would want to call it like yeah you know just just doing something extra this is like expanding your controllable range of motion yeah do you think i definitely think the start of a hip adduction lift even just on a regular normie machine i think just being able to control that tissue resiliency yeah yeah i do think it's that because you really need something that's under load to have a really meaningful effect yeah yeah the fact that you can load that for even 420s i do think there's definitely some utility to it and in my experience if you when i did that fairly early on in my sumo pulling i definitely saw a decrease in i would say adductor fatigue after the fact because i was just over prepared and then and and sumo is a unique lift where it's in a way it's unlike the squat and obviously the bench because there's since there is no eccentric and you are getting into the starting position you're not necessarily forced in the proper position whereas on the squat like let's say you you sit back too much like that will over time in my opinion be corrected by where your shin angle drifts and then slowly becomes a lot easier to be like okay now i get it now i'm going to load my quads a little bit sooner on the sumo you see it where some people who especially who just have a really close off hit position especially people who don't believe in movement variability or any like or anything a little bit more nuanced yeah as far as other just like one view of like form doesn't matter anything like that yeah a lot of times those people just have god-awful sumo deadlifts because they just read a study and they go well it has the same yo emg in terms of erector attacks you know and yeah it's no different other than a slight amount of quad use which on paper is the case but in practice it's not really and yeah so i do think some of that just like just being a little bit more expansive helps you at least entertain different positions and then you can find it maybe you'll be more like sean where he's more reaching and um protracting whereas i'm you know probably a little bit more extended than even i should be but i'm definitely just a i have a different pattern and in that day you won't really find that naturally on the sumo like i think that's why a lot of people give up on it i think you really do need to try a lot different things out yeah i think that's the thing it's the importance of training your muscles the muscle involved in the big three through various range of motion and strengthening those various range of motion i think it only benefits you i don't think there's any harm to it and i i don't like you know we're all obviously big on being evidence but i don't even need a study to tell me that like we see it we know it we and to go one layer deeper too i think you could also look in relation to daily activities where you say yes how many people are just used to moving their hips through free range of motion yeah not many like not many at all i've had clients who literally like you know especially if they're sitting at a desk all day right i'll just have them be like hey let's do more just throughout your day getting up abduction abduction right like just farms resistance moving around and they feel better they feel better when they squat when they dead versus only being in these very specific positions all day long and to me it's the same thing if you are going working out if you're only in the same positions all the time over and over and over i think you're just going to deal with more issues than if you have more you know like i said movement variability strengthening the muscles connective tissue through various range of motion and then you can always sort out the [ __ ] from this is if you set up really on with an on paper good looking sumo your your hips are externally rotated your hips are close to the bar yeah all of that and then you start shifting around a lot have instability during the lift yeah then you can scale back yeah you really can't find that point until you enable that range you're going to play with it exactly yeah i want to uh give my my last underrated which is going to be the opposite of what johnny said not that i don't agree with what he said but i do also think that despite powerlifting having a deadlift which is technically a hinge many power lifters actually suck at hinging um so i really do like having some sort of hinge accessory like a dumbbell rdl yeah or you know obviously we're talking you know non-barbell but really anything that is a pure hinge because the thing that when it comes to maximizing you know leverage and being able to maximize load on the bar like we hinge our squats and we squat our hinges like that's how we end up lifting more weight on both of them so there i can't tell you how many people i've met especially like even high level lifters who like you get them to do an rdl and it just looks like pure garbage um yeah that's totally true yeah yeah i i think even i think there is a lot of credence to some movement logic into this and not because i do think it's dangerous when we get too compartmentalized because a great example is on paper it would make complete sense for sean to do uh weighted hip thrusts but it's like how many people do loaded hip thrusts and then they go yeah that's why they lifted seven twenty eight yeah and like like other than you know brexit saying that who i do love by the way it's like other than that it's you you don't really see a lot of lifters attribute that to their success i think it is because of the pattern issue because in many ways that makes sense like as far as training the glutes maximally your your mag you're matching the direction of the force it makes sense on paper completely yeah but that movement pattern just being super extended and with the load in front of your heads just it's not the same as staying tight in more of an rdl position like you said well what i was going to say with something like a glute bridge why i actually i agree with you that i don't think it works but the reason here is that with something like a glute bridge you are you are overcoming hip extension parallel to the direction of the resistance whereas when you are dead lifting hip extension is perpendicular to the resistance right if you're standing up doing an rdl the weight is going down in the direction of gravity and hip extension is horizontal but with a glute bridge you know those are that's the advantage but that that's what they're playing that's advantage like that's why it trains the glutes better yeah but then it just doesn't really yeah yeah it's just like non-specific strength and hypertrophy yeah definitely oh and then i guess conversely uh overrated most overrated exercise so with with squatting i feel like it's hard to find an overrated i guess like if we're talking you know obviously we all have different audiences so i guess i'll speak with mine where there's a lot more people who are into like movement-based stuff when it comes to actual transference to the big three since this is a power lifting q a i would say anything that's like zercher because i think that's great for movement variability but like you can't load it significantly number one number two um the limiting factor is never going to be your legs so it's kind of a shitty answer because i don't really have like a a true overrated but in my in my world uh i would say search or anything um yeah there's there's a place for it but it's definitely not in getting your squat to go up uh with bench press overhead press sucks yeah it's just not it's just a waste of time if you're worried about getting your bench to go up yeah and with deadlifting um you know i would i would say that for some people maybe more notably like untrained individuals something like a hyper extension or a good morning might be okay but i think for for many of us who have especially been lifting long enough gotten stronger who already do leverage like so much extension um i think you're kind of you're you know you're go you're you're taking water out of the same well by doing an exercise that is going to continue to potentially feed like the overuse patterns that we don't want with minimal carryover right like i think if we're looking to to use an accessory to enhance our strength we would like it to carry over in a way that it builds more tissue in a way that it is going to increase strength while removing our you know i'll use the term compensatory strategy related stress um and i just think that that doesn't it doesn't do either like i don't think it carries over that well and i think it just feeds like the same exact you know patterns that we're you know not necessarily trying to avoid on squat but it's something that you know is related to to overuse yeah no i mean it's funny because you were thinking about the squat desert squad was going to be my immediate answer just because especially like and i get it because like you know during the shutdowns that was something that a lot of people were doing to get some extra work in but my thing was when gyms were opening back up i'm seeing people in gyms still doing it like instead of belt squat and i'm like that just doesn't make sense to me because once again like you said the legs aren't going to be a limiting factor um i think overhead press for bench is garbage it just doesn't it doesn't make sense like you're going to get bigger shoulders and get better well i don't think it's necessarily the best for that but but you're going to you know grow your delts and get better overhead pressing but it has very little carry over i think and i think i think you know with maybe like beginners right or weaker lifters just because they're growing muscle as a whole from doing all these movements and they might seem like oh my overhead press goes up my bench goes up but i think that's not going to last at all uh and then for the deadlift i mean since he did since this was movement i think like if we're not talking well if we're just talking accessories then i think we said since we haven't talked about like movements in general i think overweight are supposed to help the devlid i think like block pools i think those are a little bit uh trap bar overrate oh yeah yeah trap bar yeah it's over 82 yeah i was going to say yes i guess for my spirit i don't really see people promoting that quite as much for the day so yeah so i agree but i guess that's why i didn't come to my house it's something that i i think shawn might totally disagree with ooh let's hear it i think lunges are super overrated i think one i think lunges as far as difficulty now if you're doing maybe for a movement reason i could see it being different but if you're talking about difficulty in relation to hypertrophy i feel like the ratio is just god awful like a lot of people hate doing lunges especially hate doing it to true rp7 it's super hard yeah and i personally am a big fan of single leg press for that same purpose hypertrophy wise like i said like if it's especially with the opposite leg down to avoid you know the pelvic tucking too yeah uh yeah so first of all what do you think about it so i don't i don't program lunges not to get into too much um movement sign stuff but i don't ever prescribe a split squat stepping forward it's usually going to be back but i don't even i rarely will do a reverse lunge either like i'll usually just have it be stationary in a split squat form i think there really are few people who can really like first of all have the balance to do it in a way that is like appropriately loadable i think there really are some people who can like load up a really heavy bulgarian split squat like i can do like in each hand like 120 pound dumbbells for like sets of 10 on bulgarian split squats that's not everybody um but i do general generally agree with you yeah absolutely like when i program something that is you know a split squat whether it's rear foot elevated front foot elevated that usually is for a movement reason you know to give some some quick little tips here i guess um without going into too much detail but if i do find somebody is lacking in you know hip internal rotation in that what i'll call mid propulsive stage um or phase rather something like a front foot elevated split squat might be useful whereas if somebody's lacking in either early or late propulsion meaning that they're missing some er measurements or external rotation something like a rear foot elevated would be useful um but yes as general hypertrophy builders um they're hard to lower yeah they're hard to load heavy uh they're hard for people to balance and a lot of people just do them wrong so yeah yeah yeah so i i agree completely with their bread press especially since i can barely ever present i really try to be not dogmatic about like good and bad exercises especially as i've aged but yeah press is really the one where i'm just like no i just don't see any use for it whatsoever yeah and one that i'll say is that that i think it's teetering on the edge is deficit deadlifts i do yeah one that have been kind of phased out more and more lately and i think it's because people become more mindful of fatigue management yeah yeah i think it's just one is where it's like ah it's just so rough to fit in what sean has said as far as you know you're really fighting for extension you're really you also are adding in like drive when you don't really need a ton of leg drive by that point um and i do think more of a pure hip hinge is just often more effective like a stiff leg deadlift from the floor um i think is almost always more effective a lot easier to gauge rpe than a deficit deadlift yeah changing your starting position yeah yeah i will say i have a couple of clients where like the way we'll go about them will be like um maybe like on a secondary day like a top set of like deficit deadlifts but then their back downs will be something like like rdl's like in place events like that but that like when i say a couple i literally mean like a couple yeah because with many others it's just like most of stuff there's always like the exceptions right but for most people i would actually like very much agree with that yeah because especially when it's pounding with volume like if you do three sets of eight on it yes you know yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i've said this in a q a before like when it comes to and i know this wasn't an accessory but it's a variation but this is a good topic to to bring up it's like if i'm choosing a variation like it it better be addressing a problem positionally related which if you're on a deficit you are genuinely like you are literally outside of the range of motion that the lift is on like you're not you're not within it right it's not even like a block pull where you can like try to make it more similar to the competition lift at that phase of the lift like you're literally outside of the range so position wise it's not at all comparable you know comp specificity wise it's less specific right so if i'm going to choose something less specific i would at least like for it if it doesn't achieve what i just said position wise at least like it to be less taxing which it is not just more taxing to be doing a deficit deadlift so i'm just like why would i do this if i could just do the competition movement or if my goal is some sort of variation that's addressing something positionally like a pure hinge right or you know not necessarily a block pull but like at least i'm saying like a block pull even if you did do that it's within the actual range of motion you're completely extrapolating you know outside of it though i still don't understand why people do like sumo block pools though to be honest like or i've had some success with sumo bars in the right context yeah because i really genuinely miss that locker everyone's like oh it's starting position off the floor it's like it's really not it's literally my hamstrings were too weak at that point in the lift okay all right guys so we uh camera cut off for a second but we are back um johnny was saying some nonsense about why sumo block pools are good even though they're not so we're just gonna like don't know um so we're gonna just uh move on to the next point but yeah pretty much we know we're overrated exercises underrated exercises so next question being um so what are some fads uh in the same way that there are fads among athletes what are some fads that you guys see when it comes to coaching uh for example things such as obsessing over pelvic positioning or adductors at the same time uh i'll go first i would say see i have the exact opposite experience i think the biggest fad is being overly reductionist and i it's tough to call this a fad but i would say there's definitely a trend of saying things that you know everyone agrees with yeah for the sake of that yeah so it's like how many times you see someone post about like rp is important because you know on some days it just feels really heavy and blah blah and then like they just leave it there where it's like and it's not technically wrong but then that'll be it and then even in deeper discussion it's like always defending all rpe all the time because you know that's the in thing to use rp all the time yeah and i think that's just i think the difference is you can see when some coaches give public opinions from the perspective of they actually you want to help people they're working with people and they're critical about their own style yeah and then they're like okay so i've actually done this differently on this you know hook grip this way uh pete's a different way and it's just different than giving kind of the generic answer so like if i had to say a specific thing it probably would be using rpe just with no other context would be like just a you know 3x8 an rp8 and that's it in just no other context yeah i think that that's a bit of a fad because i just don't think it's that helpful beyond a certain point um and then yeah like i said i would i to give a specific you know label now this is not an insult to them at all but i would say some people just kind of parrot the barbell medicine and rts views and then just kind of parrot it and then that's it and then just add nothing to that and i think that a lot of times people know that that's like the quote unquote right thing to say and then don't really go into like okay how does this actually help people yeah and put in that for anything yeah i think for me a fed that i see in coaching is like um because now it's like it's really popular to be informative right like they put out information and i think it's almost like pseudo in the sense if it's a fad to like sound really intellectual sound like you're trying to help people but then use a bunch of rhetoric nobody understands or be very dogmatic with your informative content so for example they'll they'll take one thing that might actually be true like for example we are talking about like you know a stacked pelvic position or whatever and they'll make that the end-all be-all and if you bring up anything else like no none of that matters this is the only thing that matters and that's something that i find that a lot of people do and i think it's because people feel like this will make me stand apart like if i focus on this one thing and make this kind of like my thing that i care about and focus on but i actually think it's very limiting because the only people who are going to be drawn to you or clients are going to be drawn to your clients where they already have a bias towards that type of stuff so you limit who all you can work with and then even with the people who do come to you you limit how much you can help them because you're limiting the amount of tools you have available to you and mind you i'm all about having like you know a specific structure style that you like that's fine but when it's just like hey this is it there's nothing else that matters i think that's a problem yeah yeah yeah i would say the biggest for me the biggest fad in coaching is that there are too many of you and a lot of people shouldn't be coaching but with the expansion to expand more upon that i think that there really is so much information out there and one of the biggest problems that i see and it's and it's when you've been coaching long enough you can tell when people are doing it is that people will see something promoted on social media and it just immediately becomes part of their toolbox yeah it's like oh how did you you you accidentally started doing this when yes you know a week ago you didn't and i think that the biggest issue with that is when you truly don't know why you're doing things yeah recency becomes relevancy for you it's like you've seen something recently and then now this becomes the most important thing for people to be doing and you just miss apply it like you know with the example and the question of like stacked pelvis and yeah and adam it's like i see people use the phrase like ribs down like that became very quickly like a [ __ ] buzzword yeah and and people either just like misapply it or just like i've seen people say like oh i'm doing a good job keeping my ribs down and then they like crunch over and then it's like as soon as they initiate their squat they just do this and i'm like you don't know what you're saying just like please admit that you just don't know what you're talking about yeah and just leave it there um like that is that is easily the biggest problem that i see it's like people have an abundance of information yeah and in order to like marcela said set themselves apart it's like they'll just pick and and and you know try to integrate it into their model but it's not really an integration to their model it's just like i don't have a bottle so i'm just yeah you know whatever i can pick and choose from this this marketplace of information i'm just gonna you know put forward it's not it's not there's anything wrong with like new information or like finding something that you found hey this i'm gonna try this out and it works out for you or your athletes but it's like you have to have a base like of something like you have to have some type of consistency if you're constantly changing what you're doing just based on what's popular then you you were letting like basically the realm of social media have way more control over your athletes than what you do yeah and that's just ridiculous at that point yeah i've i'm sorry to cut you off now no the the you know on the on the opposite side of what johnny said about being overly dogmatic and reductionist it's like definitely in my circle i see people like misapplying a lot of like the movement science yeah where it's just like you know oh this person has this the 90-90 hemi bridge and just like why are you doing that yeah or like just not understanding that certain things need to be loaded or just like completely misunderstanding things in general where it's like i'll see someone doing something for somebody that is meant to promote you know more hip internal rotation and they're lacking external rotation or they just never even evaluated that person like most people i'll see programming certain restorative movements if you will or um just accessories and they don't even have like table test measurements it's like how do you know someone was even missing that in the first place like why are you even wasting their time with this they might not even need it yeah um so yeah that's just a specific example there but the general problem is it's too easy for people to pretend like they know what they're talking about yeah i think that's what it comes down to too is like do you really care about learning and if you do they're just so that you should always feel like there's so much information to learn that we literally don't have the time to yeah because i remember even when hurting my hamstring it's like just the fact that the the type of hamstring injury and in the location and you know like ballerinas hamstring injuries have just a drastically different recovery time yeah i found than someone who's more in mid-range yes yours was distal huh yours was distal was it by the knee yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so i think that you know contributes to being fascinated coveting right would you say versus if it was higher i really i actually really don't know yet yeah so there's a researcher in his father like he's from norway and he's posting things like that it's just very fascinating it's like because there are some things where it's like this is why you can't just say like okay i saw barbell medicine and this is not even their view i'm sure you know they have a lot of specific information it really isn't you don't smile yeah but like there are certain cases where it's like if you don't get a hamstring um hamstring surgery it's like you actually do have worse outcomes like there are there are points obviously yeah that should be obvious where that's the case but just realistically it's very unlikely and most people need to hear just don't do it just don't get the surgery like shawn and i talked to a guy who showed us his l5 video there are pictures of it like taken out whereas like you gave that a week you know you need to give that more time yeah but they're just there's so many individual pieces of information like even with beltless work where it's like even when greg knuckles posted about beltless uh yo squats you know like what we all know now that it just has decreased intra-abdominal pressure um and he basically made a very compelling argument that you know even for general strength you should basically always wear a belt but for bedless deadlifts that wasn't necessarily the case for bella cellos in that same um you know set of studies he was listening there actually were some notable differences and there wasn't a clear downside in terms of you know quote core activation yeah yeah so if you're training for a dell it's like that is something to keep in mind in the back your mind and you have to actually read those studies and i think that the weakness is when people just actually don't read the studies just give the blanket answer because those blanket answers are generally true true yeah and if you have no way of assessing it you won't know how wrong you are you won't know what you're missing yeah no it's it's pretending to care instead of actually caring yeah that's really what it comes down to is like i'm sorry like if you actually if you care about you know powerlifting fitness training if you actually care about your clients you're going to want to learn more you're going to take the time to make sure that you're not just putting stuff out there just to be fancy or for a bad you're going to actually you know put in the time and put into work and i think the problem is a lot of people get into coaching for like you know they want the benefits of what they think comes with being a coach but they don't actually care yeah i really do think it's that simple and i do think one thing that is a trademark to coaches who are not on to fads is like we'll learn a lot of things that we don't talk about yeah like well yeah like i'm sure we've all read like a caffeine meta-analysis that we just never post about or or what i've talked off-camera about is like when we talked about tapering is like central nervous system fatigue is kind of a meme at this point at least in the way that people used to think about it as far as singles you know being more taxing since there's actually higher rep sets and more endurance training is harder on your central nervous system and then you can just have that back your mind maybe you don't even do anything with it like you just don't do anything with it but then all of a sudden it starts making sense mechanistically why later peaks work better yeah combined with muscle protein synthesis being 24 to 72 hours yeah so it just all comes together and then you're like okay now it starts to make sense and then you can kind of piece it together obviously within reason you don't want the post hoc fallacy to get too crazy but it's just stuff like that where it's like you're just constantly in it and then you have layers that don't necessarily need to be right away pushed out and just sold yeah and it's and it's really tough because there are people you know obviously there are levels to how much you care but sure uh there are people who do care about you know coaching and wanting to be a coach but like with the abundance of information it is so easy to get half the answer to anything yeah where it's like you know in a time with less information to get anything any knowledge about anything you would have to go all in in the way that johnny's describing that people who really care do but it is really just so easy to like open your instagram and find half the answer to anything and you can just run with that and be like oh this is good enough right like i don't have to do much more yeah right like i have the general premise but you know it's like it's like if you look at an answer key for an exam you know if you're studying for an exam you look at an answer key to a past exam you're using as a practice and after the fact you're like oh yeah i could have rationalized that and then you go into the exam and you just get destroyed yeah it's the same thing it's like you can't actually synthesize you're just able to to backwards rationalize yeah and i really think the key to emphasize this like if you're listening to this and you're not sure if that's you know what's up and what's down or where to go because i think a lot of people just don't really know where to go since experts by definition no more than us i think it just comes down to the assessment you have to have a way of finding out if that's not true yeah so someone's constantly saying it's like brace 360 degrees and brace harder and brace harder your coach is always saying brace harder and you never feel like you're bracing hard enough that's [ __ ] because then there's no end metric like there's no and not everything needs to be numbers but there's no end point to see like is this working is this not working is this working is it's not and uh yeah like i said with sean like his his devil of being a little bit more protracted and all that it's like if he tried that and he just kept missing at lockout then he wouldn't do it it would be that simple so there has to be some some sort of end point not just a principle all the time yeah yeah yeah it has to you have to be able to apply what you're learning and test if it's wrong because there are some things that we try and we're like huh okay you know something more specific does need to be done there like sean with his movement prep like he could just say like hey you know pain science says i don't need to do this but it's like if it consistently feels worse and reflects in performance and you guys trends long term then you can do it and then like we we talked about off camera then pull back you know when it's not needed yeah but it needs to be reactive to something yeah yeah you good on that point yeah man all right uh next question do you guys have different philosophies in programming if so what are they so johnny you wanna you wanna take this one because i know i know you differ from shawn and i would say one yeah yeah i like two two main points so the first one that i know i'm not gonna convince anyone on here is that the fact that i have deadlift variations where i just straight up linear load that variation like kind of very kind of old school like uh like probably something i would imagine like taylor williams done before where it's like you just have a deadlift wave where you're doing conventional deadlifts and you have three by five linearly loaded at starting at your very fast bar speed and just push up to five rep max in between cycles um with myself it'd traditionally be with the white sand snatch script deadlift aka the candida deadlift okay but um and so that one is definitely just like my style as far as i would say the way i train deadlifts is definitely very momentum based as far as like really aggressive waves so you know like a three to four week wave of that then a three to four week wave of you know maybe positive lifts then a three to four week wave of a competition peak so almost somewhat conjugate-ish while the squad is definitely always you know traditionally trained in my perspective on like singles and all that year round but then as far as uh specifics with uh percentage backups versus rpe this is something where to me i've just never done percentage back offs after an rp top set i've always found it very intuitive to start with rpe on both the top set and the back offs i actually find it's easier to judge rp on those back offs since it is lower hype um and so start with let's say rp eight and a half top set of seven let's say a single at rp6 top set seven rp eight and a half and then two by seven with the second set of rp7 and then in future cycles add weight in relation to those slots so let's say plus 10 pounds if i overshot that then on the back off work only plus five pounds with rp7 and a half cap and if i have to move down from there whereas you know these guys use percentage drops which uh i think is stupid so to give some context to this i guess not necessarily dichotomy because i wouldn't say they're on opposite ends of the spectrum but that's the difference um i think the one not the one reason but i think the reason it works really well for johnny is that johnny has always been johnny johnny is always self-coached very objective just personally yeah right so it it's very easy for someone like him to judge rpe across all rep ranges one out of objectivity two out of just tons of historical data yes and you know being able to make these like across block decisions yeah it's just relying on you know predictability yeah right like he has the lifestyle too like i definitely think if i had like a more hectic job that definitely would exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah no i mean it definitely makes sense and like i i don't think there's anything wrong with that strategy at all i think i think it's basically what i'm gonna say here is that like with johnny's knowledge of himself i think that even though he doesn't go after a certain percentage i think that he's probably very close to or rather the numbers that he ends up picking line up with probably you know plus or minus two percent two and a half percent of what like a percentage back off would end up being yeah somebody programming a percentage back off with the goal in mind of it being within a certain rp range like it's yeah it's like one is going in in the opposite order of the other i think yeah um so yeah i mean i don't neces i don't exclusively program percentage back downs like i think there are certain lifters who do better with ascending sets i think there are certain lifters yeah who do really well with like more rpe strictly yeah um some lifters who really do better with percentage back offs who are either just like overzealous lifters um who tend to overshoot a lot where just like you can give them that hard cap of all right like i'm not leaving any room for interpretation for you you're just doing what's written yeah it's very clear when you you know rebel against that um or there are some lifters who really like need a significant drop off after a a top set where it's like it does get more muddy telling somebody to be like oh yeah i want you to do an rp three or four especially as the rep ranges start to climb where it's like do i really know how to judge a set of seven at rp three or four probably not yeah right so it's like if you do give them a more aggressive percentage back down that really fixes them to a number that they might not come upon as quickly and then it's like if you if you scale that across weeks if they made the wrong decision early it's like maybe we could be missing out on some progress if they're continuing to maybe they're making the right incremental choices but they just started from such a bad initial point um yeah yeah experience level goes along with it a lot too because it's like one i feel way more comfortable with like you know let's say a less experienced lifter giving them percentage drops or giving like okay we're gonna work off percent you know hit rp based top seven percent of your one rep max because i know that if i'm between say anywhere from like 78 percent of the warmer max i can pretty much predict what type of fatigue we're gonna get with that whereas if it's somebody like ashton or it's like hey we're gonna just do this top set and then like seven to eight percent of your max right that's objective load is going to impact him differently than somebody say like a 400 pound max water so i feel more comfortable giving somebody more of that like rpe based type back down work as i know they're more experienced they come to know their body and i'm seeing that they're making the right mature decisions with those top sets so i can then trust it with the back downs as well and then a lot of it just depends on what i'm trying to control variable wise right like i said it's if on there let's say you have a top set and then we start around 70 and we end around 76 percent at the end of the block then going to the next block we scale back a little bit start around 72 so i know we're going to end at 78 so that way if there's fluctuations with their top sets based upon how they're feeling i'm ensuring that we're getting that progression week to week and then if i'm doing a percentage drop same thing as long as they're being relatively true to that rp and like you said johnny for you you pretty much know your schedule you have full control over that whereas me like you know if i have clients who are like officers nurses in the military things like that it just allows me to control those variables of recovery a lot better and it also ensures that you know because sometimes you can feel more beat up than you actually are right so if i give you like this rpe range you might scale it back more than what you actually need to when hey we could actually get a little bit more workload so i'm going to give you an assign percentage drop to ensure that we get that but it's still within the rpe that we need yeah i will emphasize here in closing on this point is that i do think honestly probably the biggest factor with this is how much someone rounds to yeah most convenient yeah wait yeah it's very intuitive to me for if i'm doing like you know like when i was even training with sean where i get you know how to range it's like just adding going from 415 to 425 on sets of 7. yeah where it's like that is a decision i know there are a lot of lifters who will literally never do that it might be 405 or 455. yeah that's it yeah and sometimes lifters are much better me still do not make you know nuanced decisions and i think that does affect their programming a lot yeah yeah absolutely no i've definitely seen some some of um so i have for those of you watching i have coaches who work under me and um one of my coaches jaren is working with this lifter who like young lifter probably less likely to make a decision like this like made it a point to like at any at any juncture where it made sense to make decision this decision would load like those odd plate numbers where it's just like gross when you're training with pounds or kilos and you're putting on like a white black silver and it's just like oh this is like a weird a weird weight but it's like i've seen so many lifters where they either are getting you know worse results out of their program because they are you know let's say if it's like just straight rpe they end up just truly doing something too heavy when the intention is not to like you know if you had a three by eight at like eight right it's like if you try to repeat that weight for the next two sets a lifter who is not understanding that they can drop the weight might just be overdoing it on those back downs yeah and conversely you might see the lifters who just purely get prescribed rpe and they're in a situation like johnny said where it's like oh i have eights today i'm doing four or five like yeah that's just the eight's weight like i remember i made a youtube video on not even my current channel i started like a youtube channel like years ago and i remember saying in the video i was like yeah i kind of have this mental thing where like five fives i have eights doesn't matter what it is i'm loading 405. and it's just like i recognized that back then and there are a ton of people who will do that the jesse norris syndrome he's like oh i'm doing 585 on a big day 4.95 i don't like that yeah but i think we all acknowledge is that you know a mixture of these things you know he's got no time to be an hour and 15 minutes but if so jesse welcome to the channel now okay if so jesse prove us wrong come back we think you can't do it but yeah i mean ultimately you know i think we all agree like a mixture of like you know rp percentage percentage drops and then you know communicating with their client as far as their circumstances and what you expect for them with the programming is going to be the best obviously all right last question last question yeah let's go do you believe powerlifting has evolved for the best or taken a step back these last years last year this last year how many years it just says he's last year you pick how many years how many years you're talking oh let's go let's go with the past three years three yeah yeah recent yeah keep it kind of recent yeah when was the camera band yeah no no no but honestly for me whether i say the past three five ten years i think it's gotten better as a whole like collectively i really do i think yeah there's certain things that we might have issues with you know maybe with specific federations in johnny's case no no but no but seriously i feel like as a whole you know kind of you know not so much contradicting but in contrast to the point we're making before that there's this saturation of information i do think it's good that there is just generally way more information now there is way more informative coaches out there there is a higher standard i would say even though it needs to still you know be raised a higher standard for what a coach is now compared to what a coach was back then where it's just this dude who coached football and is also now a powerlifting coach um and just like the resources we have me you know my channel your guys's channel all these things that add into it and just the amount of people that are getting involved in powerlifting the diversity of it i i think yeah yeah yeah no i really do think i i just i can't see how you can feel like it's getting worse and i understand certain trends of like oh social media is doing this and people are clout chasing and i get all that but i feel like a lot of people hyper focus on those negative things so often to where they just completely overlook all the progress that we've made like like you know yeah social media what are we going to say to you no what i was going to say is that like marcella said like we can pick individual things with regards to powerlifting in the most recent years that we just hate about it but i'm gonna think about this very systematically and i'm gonna think okay how do we categorize qualities of powerlifting yeah how they've changed over the years and then just net gain or net loss and like off the top of my head you i have level of competition amount of money to be made membership promotion and reach uh and quality of information and like in my mind no matter how many little things i could pick out literally every single one of those and i'm sure there are many more categories you could come up with if you think about it they've all gone up yeah it's just indisputable that all of those facets of the sport have just grown tremendously in a positive direction so i yeah that's i mean i mean this year alone dude you you've got now prime time sessions at local meets yeah i think that alone is awesome like that's that's something that we that wasn't we were not really doing that even just a year two years ago like how it's been being done in the past you know 2020 and now yeah i think anytime talent rises and there are more people it's like that is has to fundamentally be the goal like that's the point of what we're doing and it's like ultimately i do think people who imply it's gotten worse are really just trying to hold on in control and it's like that's the thing it's it's like maybe it's gotten worse for you yeah yeah social media is making you know powerlifting definitely better you know maybe the world a little bit worse but yeah i i would also say even to my point about reductionism it's like in the end of the day you know we used to be in the era where like kelly stratt was like the thing and uh he's [ __ ] so so it's like if someone's a little bit too much into like nothing matters and let's say generalizing pain science it's still better than like remembering it's like you have to squat their knees forward you have to just force those knees out no matter what and i remember even one of his recommendations was like to stand on a bar stool so one leg's up one leg's down like really oddly yeah really like controlling and posture all the time like i told jeff nippard personally that his video on posture is like unbelievably helpful and i know i'm drifting a little bit away from piloting here but to bring it back it's very similar because it's like all of these rules that were imposed it's easy to take for granted just the freedom it gives people and it's like no you can control a lot of these variables this way it's not it's not marcellus training systems behind a paywall yeah it's like yeah here's how you do it here's how it's not even you know with sean being a super high level lifter uh maybe the only thing but like that's a little hidden is his weight cutting strategies which you know i yeah so it's like a lot of these specifics uh are really getting out there and yeah i just think it's incredibly helpful and um i do think the one reason why people feel this is because i do think there's going to be a struggle for regional tribal uh belonging yeah i think i think that is something that powerlifting has yet to address yeah i do think people should feel strong if you're the strongest in your state you should feel strong and right now i do think a lot of people who are the strongest in the entire state that they live in feel weak because they see just how strong the game's getting yeah and i think that needs to be addressed a little bit yeah or at least there are more clearer levels like track and field you know what i said before yeah i guess we cut off again uh but john's pretty much down this point but yeah so as a whole we collectively agree that powerlifting has definitely just gotten better despite a few things that we may want to improve or think we can work on as a whole we think it's collectively just gotten a lot better you guys have any more thoughts on that or is that about yeah i think i agree we didn't mention that lifetime memberships are stupid just to reiterate it but um yeah i do think there's going to be the only thing we really didn't emphasize is i think there's going to be more competition yeah for the future of parroting and i do think that's going to be very interesting i think it will be good for the sport as long as it's not tied to just one or two sponsors that didn't get to dictate things yeah i think that is the main thing with piloting is as long as it's what's best for the lifter and the only way you're going to get what's best for lifter is for more companies than just sbd yeah that's just flat out the reality yeah um and you know hopefully that happens and i do think we're headed towards a great direction and i'm excited to see sean at showdown make some money yeah oh you'll do well and i'll make a nice 500 dollars coming to flight yeah any closing thoughts sean on that no i mean on the showdown i mean no well no just just this topic yeah lifetime membership sean have you ever even said anything on that uh bad idea don't buy it yeah that's about it no no that's that's it man um first of all thank you we appreciate all of you for asking questions that you did this is easily the longest video that i've ever done on my channel so

a drill how to use a cordless drill how to drill class and then they get a little bit less relevant as you go down another one you can do is what is so again these are different things like what is an impact driver this is definitely something that you could put in in your content so uh the other and the other one i like to use is one too there's probably others but um you know when to use a hammer drill when to use an impact drill these are all things that you could put um within your within your content right so basically you're the thing that i'm trying to get at is um you know tools like

content and referral traffic can help with your rankings it gives us a pinterest hack to help us drive referral traffic let's check it out so similar to google what we've seen a lot of success with on pinterest is by publishing more um and so you know the way that we got those 65 million pinterest impressions was by posting thousands and thousands and thousands of of pins um every single month uh and so what you want to figure out is a way uh basically some sort of library that consistently updates images in your niche and then you want to set up a zap that grabs them and pushes it to pinterest um and you know 65 million impressions 70 000 link clicks uh and i think you know i think it could have been you know a lot better if we put more time into it i'm curious to know if you guys have any zapier hacks with that you can do with seo um put them in the comments below and let's take a look at them okay over at the ignite visibility channel john lincoln shows us how to prove the value of seo let's check it out when it comes to proving the value of search engine optimization it really comes down to at the end of the day branded versus non-branded the sections of the website that you're actually working on so that you can prove the work that you've done showing the work behind the sections that you worked on what did you actually do and then mapping that all to micro conversions macro conversions and of course the businesses overall goals it's very important to have clear dashboards clear reporting and to go a little bit above and beyond so that you can show extra data from things like google trends and anything that might be happening in the industry or changing in the option or changing in the economic political general environmental landscape of that business by looking at all these things together you can actually create an incredibly clear picture that's data driven for any type of organization that in some cases can help inform their business decisions as far as market entry into new markets uh putting out resources in different areas resource allocation and other exciting things like can you continue the conversation aaron sparks and kevin indeed gives us their insight on seo microconversions let's check this one out let go of the thought that there's just a single goal for every visitor of the website and to also respect that a visit is just an event or an interaction out there and so that's where micro conversions can be things like uh newsletter signups but can also be things like clicking on related articles at the bottom of the block or clicking through your site and the you know um the the beauty of that model is that when you you lay the interactions of say thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of visitors on top of each other you see patterns when you optimize for these patterns you increase your heart and soft conversion rate right microconversions and macro conversions because you create better paths for people and a better understanding no matter where they come from the technical seo has to be able to get into the mindset of the of the sales initiatives and understand how they can bridge that gap with micro conversions be able to see behavior well well beyond what they see on a performance level of ranking and and inbound organic traffic they got to see the behavior otherwise you could be pointing the entire wrong direction of attracting the uh the visits that uh aren't ready to engage with me around the corner what's your approach to core what vitals this is our strategy for crow vitals um we should always strive to be at the very least be beat the the pages that are you're competing with in the keyword space and search results right that's your first objective with corporate vitals because i think google is very much very transparent about the fact that vitals is a tie breaker right it's not you're not going to be penalized because you're slow you're just not going to get um the the competitive advantage um because you know supposedly all things equal to two pages your you and your competitors you have the same um amount of content your quality is your your content is the same quality or it serves the same value um and you have the same amount of links like authority expertise and trust right your backlinks are the same hypothetically i know it's impossible but all things equal the faster the better experience page is gonna win right it's gonna get that ranking advantage shameless plug join me uh with broadway's team with over 1 000 already registered next week on the webinar on how enterprise seo are preparing for core web vitals so be sure to check that out does seo take six months my guest today released a video released on this subject let's check it out and so what takes six months is your organization getting on board with seo even if you're an in-house seo let's say you come in on day one you're not going to have the internal credibility in order to get those things pushed through with the variety of different teams in fact you won't even know the lay of the land at that point so really what happens is you have to come in get that credibility figure out what the issues are and then figure out the right people actually execute on those things that takes six months it's not the crawling it's not you know the time it takes to do an audit it's really this brings me to my favorite part of the show be sure to uh let's ask our guests today how we can create credibility please be sure to ask questions during a conversation as it's an excellent way for a list to learn socially let me get this sentence set up here all right michael's ranked by using both sides of his brain to develop creative strategic solutions he loves having a messy desk and doing whatever it takes to make things happen he was ranked for with 14 years of experience in digital marketing 25 years of web development he has worked with dozens of enterprise companies and has helped drive more than one billion in incremental revenue since iphone workbench was found in 2014. he's the founder and managing director of ipo rank he is the search engine land 2020 search market of the year please welcome the guy who loves to do hard things michael king um hey hey what's up michael king how are you doing today yo dre i'm feeling great but this is a lot this is all this is all all for love but for the love of seo you know hey you know congrats on winning the search engine land search and your market of the year that's that's a great accomplishment thank you love it okay i want to go ahead and get real quick right to it you know that last video that we actually just watched with you just released a couple weeks ago you talk about credibility i'm curious like how would you build inc internal credibility uh inside a company as an seo yeah i mean it's not one of those things that just happens overnight like you have to really go in and understand what people are doing why they're doing it and being able to speak to seo in terms of what the company is already doing so like you can walk into a company and know like hey we've got all these problems with real canonical tags and 301 redirects and blah blah but there may be reasons why they have those problems so you can't just walk in and be like yo you got to fix these things right away you got to understand the lay of the land like i said in the video as to like why things are that way who are the people that made them that way and then just do some smaller things to gain their trust so that when they actually do start doing your stuff they're like okay i believe this guy or this woman who came in here and told us like re-architect how we're doing our business love it love it dropping these knowledge bombs already michael that's so good okay you know what i got to rewind this [Music] let's turn back the clock to see when did michael king actually get into seo and how did you get into it yeah yeah yeah i got i got an seo in 2006 um it was it was literally an accident i got into a bike accident and i was making music at this time and um you know i needed to get a job to pay my medical bills because i was a rapper with no insurance and so you know first place to hire me was an seo agency um and i i had just i was going to keep the job uh i started in august of 06. i was going to keep the job until november because i knew i was going to go on my first european tour and i was like cool well this'll just be enough to make the money to pay the medical bills and then i can be out but uh then i gave notice to my boss i was like yo you know i'm about to go out on the road um thanks for everything and he was like no no you can work from home it's fine and i was like what so like i had this really big dell laptop that i was carrying with me on tour in europe like on trains and planes and all this and i was just working from the road and like ever since then i was like yeah i really like this space um and then you know it just kind of progressed to working in bigger agencies and then eventually started my own agency and yeah that's where i'm at so actually so then how did you learn it were you like reading books i mean youtube wasn't around at that time i mean how were you actually like learning how to do this stuff yeah the thing is like a lot of people didn't really know what they were doing and including the first place that i worked so and and also it just wasn't all that sophisticated at that point it was like oh make the words bold on the page and you know search for your keyword plus ad url and drop a link on some form or some message board and you know there's some technical items to it as well but they hired me because of my background in web development and they were like all right well i'm sure you can figure out this seo thing and you know they taught me what they knew at the time and i was able to do that very well but i just always have this thirst for knowledge you know like when you're a little kid and you're like yo i want to know everything i never grew out of that like i want to know everything and so when they put this puzzle of seo in front of me i was like yo i want to learn this like i really want to get this in ways that people aren't really getting it and again that hasn't ended and so like i'm still on that quest to like really understand it as much as you can without actually working at google nice okay let's see here i want to talk about like okay you've um learned it and and now you actually started your own company but you know you actually started speaking a lot i mean i had from as early as i can remember you're already speaking at conferences back like 10 years ago over over 10 years ago and i'm curious i mean like you said you're a rapper i mean like what's i mean were you doing public speaking beforehand or is it just like a performance that just got you into this public speaking it's the performance thing yeah like i never took any courses in public speaking or anything like that it's just if you've done as many shows as i have especially when like you don't speak the same language as the people in front of you you learn very quickly like how to be a showman and so um it's actually been 10 years of me doing thought leadership as of you know this this year like in july will be the first time um or the 10-year anniversary where i first like started blogging and all that other stuff and so what the way it happened was you know i was blogging uh i went out to moz con because like i had been blogging for them and i'm like yo i just want to meet these people because like this community seems really cool and i was sitting there on like day three or whichever day will reynolds spoke and i was like oh wow they let black people do this so like as i was sitting there i pitched for smx east and i got it and you know i did really well and you know like i get off stage i get an email like yo do you want to speak at this and then it just snowballs nice nice so if you had one tip for someone that wants to get into speaking into the game especially maybe not doesn't have to be seo but like you mentioned like hey just go ahead and pitch yourself what's that one tip you can give to someone to get into the speaking game yeah i mean just have something to show and it doesn't necessarily need to be like you know a blog post or anything like that like if you do a webinar or you do something like this having something that people can see when you pitch means everything because they want to know like oh is this someone my audience is going to connect with are they engaging are they interesting uh it's to some degree it's like knowing whatever it is you're talking about is kind of secondary they just want to make sure that you can present well so you know make something go on a show like this i don't i don't think there's any other shows like this but um you know like do something that they can see so that they can be like all right i see where i can connect with this person there you have it get on the seo video show if you want to start your speaking career right there by michael gigg okay we actually had something come in right here he was riding a high on a very close to the two third round victory in street fighter he had to help with this smx pitch what is this about that's my guy that's my guy dave manchala fantastic consultant if you need seo help i would recommend you talk to him um yeah that was my first mozcon it's also where i met dave davis from staten island i live in brooklyn and uh we first met there and you know they had like a game night in the arcade or whatever and he was like yo let's play some street fighter too washed all right all right okay let's see here okay so once once you're speaking of moz i mean like you were actually you did a whiteboard friday like that you know that's like that's historic and so did you have to like fly there when you do the whiteboard friday or is this something that you actually just filmed on your own you sent it to them how does that actually work yeah i've actually done a lot of whiteboard fridays one of my the first one i did um or the first one that aired so to speak was one that i did with rand we were talking about um query deserves freshness or something like that but anyway the way those came about i just happened to be in seattle in seattle at the time um whether it was like out there for a client or for some conference or something and whenever i've done moz con they've invited me to do it so you know they've always been really good to me as a company and like whenever i've had something that i've wanted to share they've been open to it um as i understand it i could film some whiteboard fridays and mail them to them but i've been more trying to focus on making our site like a place that people go for content so i have i've been doing a lot less like guest content as of late mm-hmm so what are some things that you're actually doing on your site right now this is like i know you actually have that one you've been putting a lot more videos i saw that on on your youtube um i mean i saw some blogs coming out and actually you know what actually i let me answer this for you because i mean i watched this like 10 at least 10 times there's just one animation you got got out there it's called like a run time right and guys i put the link in the description if you haven't seen this seo animation it's legit it's it's it's about almost 30 minutes and it's has a bunch of nuggets in there um there's this one nugget you talked about um about ebay interlinking um page two when when they know that um they see that their their keyword goes on page two or anything like that i mean is this something that you're implementing for your clients where you're doing custom scripts look like that i mean that's some crazy stuff yeah absolutely so that idea came from a post that a gentleman by the name of dennis g put out i think it's called like second page poaching or something like that um and it's on site the next corner and he talked about this thing that they built that ebay where they basically use rankings as the input and so if something ranks on page two they programmatically build more internal links to that page within the site and then that ends up distributing the link equity better and those pages rank better in google as well and so it's an idea that we've deployed for clients a number of times at this point and you know it's like how you can create a step function of growth yeah for rankings and so i always talk about it because it's so powerful it's not easy to do by any means like it's not like hey get a plug-in no no no yeah you gotta build this yeah but once you do it's very much a game changer but see your original question like what are we doing as far as content yes run time was a movie um and the reason why we did that is because i was speaking at mozcon last year and they're like hey it's going to be a completely remote thing obviously because of cloven 19. i was like all right well i'm not trying to do just a fancy webinar like let's make a movie yeah let's maximize this pre-recorded situation like kind of like how you think about this you're like yo i don't want to just do another you know random podcast video thing like i want this to be super well produced i want a rap song like like that's how i looked at it i was like yo let's go in with this and so our uh office manager nefa she plays two of the characters like the other two characters that are not me in the movie and she also sings the song that starts the movie so we were like yo let's let's do something that no one else has done and we're trying to figure out more opportunities for doing things like that because you know like we we've been harping on like we are very much a right-hand left-brained company we're really good at the technical stuff we're really good at being creative and you know obviously there's situations where we have a lot of creative things we want to do for our clients and they get shot down because of brand because of you know someone just doesn't like it so we're like cool let's put some of that energy into us so that we can attract more people that want to do stuff like that there you have it both use both left and right side of your brain and create some awesome content guys okay let's see here with me around the corner i know you work with a lot of enterprise seos enterprise companies uh i'm curious like what are you telling your enterprise clients like about core water files i mean i would think it's a huge task as an agency to get this big buy-in because usually agencies work with like the marketing departments right not necessarily the dev team so how are you like doing like getting this across companies yeah we actually do interface with engineering teams a lot um and i think it's just a function of like when we're brought in people like yo these guys are super technical so let's get them you know talking to the engineers um but before the core web vitals we're actually harping on the fact that google is going to mobile only indexing and i made a post about that on monday i actually made a tool it's called pareto where you can compare how things look in the eight contexts that need to be considered to determine whether or not things are showing for google and so i'm i'm more telling people like yo we got to get this fixed because it's a big problem that nobody's really talking about none of the existing tools out there really like showcase or surface this information for you natively so we're more talking about that but on the page experience and core web vital stuff what i'm mostly harping on is the cumulative layout shift because that's new the other metrics not so much right like they've been they've been trying to push us to do speed related things for a while now and the cumulative layout shift is going to be a very big deal especially for publishers because it's targeting publishers it's targeting those websites where you know it loads and you click on something but when you clicked on it especially on your phone the ad appears and now you've clicked on the ad and nobody really wants that experience so every publisher has that problem and um as a result we're gonna have to like account for that before we account for any of those other things like you know fid and things like that like those are things that you should have been accounting for anyway because they'd be giving you those those indications but to your to your core question here is we're getting more people that are on board with it because google is explicitly saying these are the metrics we look at and this is the time frame that we need to get it done with it and so it's not really just an seo problem all engineers are hearing about this already and they're like cool how do we fix this so it's just allowing us to get more buy-in for getting the thing done that we've been trying to get people to do for years anyway love it love it you know that's that's good to hear about with being cool with the dev team because i mean i can like you know when i talk to other bunch of people it's just always just the marketing side and and having that relationship with the dev team is gold for any agency i mean you can get to do certain things there i mean okay uh with with working with even like you know these fortune 500 companies there's got to be some challenges i mean there's got to be some things like how do you get things implemented like fast enough i mean what challenges oh wow i mean i mean like even in my own company i mean i mean i'm an enterprise seo too and it takes time to get things done i mean get things implemented you got to be part of sprints right i mean so how are you um it's more than that it's it's more than just being a part of the sprints you know it's it's top level buy-in like it's building business cases it's getting the right people to be like yo this is a priority because even if you're in the sprints you can be like yo we got to do these things and these things priorities are going to come top down that are going to shift you off the board anyway and so what we'd spend a lot of time doing is like presenting those business cases like you know even if it's like a simple business case where it's like all right as compared to other things that we can do this thing will be valuable because of x y and z then it's like cool whoever our point of contact is may be the champion to run that up the chain but there may also be situations where it's like all right we got to meet with the cmo or you know whoever this uh man or woman in the high castle that you rarely see is and then you got to be like look you know this is important because of these things and they're like cool you know it'd be like a three to five slide deck or something they'll be like all right cool i get it yes let's do it you're going to make us all the money so go ahead and do it but then on the tactical side of things it does come down to making it as easy as possible for the teams that you're working with you know when you're when you're doing things like technical implementations and so on it's very common for seos to just be like hey here's a problem your rel canonical tags are broken fix them that's not enough you got to tell them precisely why that matters how to fix it and give it doubt to like the user story level where they can just copy and paste things into jira and then they'll be like all right that's exactly what we need to do in order to make this happen otherwise if you leave it to them to like do more investigation and things like that again it comes down to what their priorities are if they have to like dig into the site find the data and figure it out when are they going to have time for that so you got to be the one to do that and then make it so it's easy for them to you know do the work you want them to do there you go make it easy for the guys you're dropping bombs you're dropping buzz okay all right so i mean i want to go back to that one tool you're talking about because you said it really quickly i want to see like tell me more about this tool again because and what was the name of it and where can we find it was it you said it's on your website right now yeah yeah it's called pareto and what it does yeah it's like in the tools section i don't think we have a landing page for it but if you look at the latest blog on iphonerank.com uh thinking something like you know why why mobile will be like the biggest shakeup of 2021 it's linked to in there but what it does is so there's eight user contacts that you need to consider whether or not google is seeing you know what you want them to see right so there's uh is googlebot mobile this is googlebot mobile javascript rendering there's google by html excuse me it's google by desktop with html google about desktop javascript and then you gotta look at all four of those as not googlebot because you might be showing something different to the user than you are to google so there's no tool none of the crawling tools will do this because it's computationally expensive for them to crawl the same url eight times and then you know determine if their differences and so on and there may not be any differences so they would effectively be spending eight times the money to you know surface or not surface anything right and so we've made the tool that you can just put in the url it'll crawl it eight times and it'll give you back details on the differences it'll tell you what the status code is tell you the number of internal links the number of work or with the word count and whether or not the page is indexable and in the blog post i talk talk about why this is important because i did this work with uh with jamie indigo and elena solis uh for the web albin act for the seo portion and one of the key things that we notice is that there's a material difference in the content that's being served on mobile versus desktop for a lot of sites it was something like we looked at over 5 million sites for the specific subset of the analysis and it was something like there's only 16 of sites showed the same word count on both desktop and mobile and so with google going mobile only that means they're not going to see a lot of people's content and so this tool is showing you what the differences are between the different contacts and then it also gives you a diff view so you can see side by side what is different in the code and then below that you can also see how the http headers differ as well so you can get a clear sense like these are the things that are different based on how google might see this website got it and that's some great tools i mean so how much does this cost 3.99 oh there you go we got a free 99 for this tool it's it's proprietary stuff check it out on the ipole rank blog okay so i want to um go back to the the animation runtime there's just one uh slide i pulled up here uh i want to take a look at this this right here like when i was when i listened to you this this animation all the time like i catch these nuggets and you actually have a certain formula for a lot of things and you have a formula on on picking the right pages for the right keyword right because i mean for me i just maybe will sometimes just go to like let's say my bright edge or my sm rush and just say okay this one's matching it and i'll you know tie those in together but you have a certain formula on how the best page could match a keyword right so that can you tell me more about this concept of how you're actually mapping your the right pages to keywords yeah and this is this is primarily for situations where you have multiple pages that rank for a given keyword okay and this is very very you know um happens a lot with e-commerce sites big publisher sites things like that right and so ultimately what we're doing is we're pulling a series of metrics together to say you know based on how it's currently performing and based on the features of the page itself um which of these pages is the best fit for a given keyword so then that way it doesn't have to be a manual process you just use the metrics to drive it and so when we talk about something like uh a programmatic internal linking structure again you can't really manually do that for a site that has millions of pages ranks for millions of keywords so you've got to have a programmatic determination to say okay you know this page ranks for 500 keywords but there's an overlap with a bunch of other pages throughout the site so which of these should be the owner of that given keyword and so that's what this equation helps us get to the bottom got it got it okay so i'm curious like with these formulas because there's more than just that formula i mean you have a bunch of you kind of drop them in the video like a bunch of times is this something that you have like in your own excel or something and you just drop all these metrics and then it spits it out i mean how are you like like applying this is like how can someone apply this yeah so for those specifically we've got jupiter notebooks and collab notebooks for it um you know we we we've got analysts on our team that run uh this stuff through like python and so on so ideally the ideal state will be that we have a series of internal tools for everything that we we you know have built but the reality of it is that we're moving so fast through clients and uh coming up with solutions like in the short term that it's easier to just have something that's like partially built and then you know use it as needed but i'm looking forward to like building out this ventures team that we can just be like yo you guys do all the r d stuff you guys take some of these ideas that we have and turn them into products and you know like burrito is a good example of that that's something i did mostly myself but colt uh one of the seo engineers on our team contributed and so on so what i want to be able to do is be like yo this is somebody's project now like make this a more fully featured tool uh that people can use got it got it all right all right guys so i'm coming close to the end make sure if you have any questions to ask it in the chat but i do have this question over here that i've actually wanted to ask like for those actually that have uh in the audience who actually have their own seo agencies um what are some advice that you can give them to land their first 500 clients i mean i think that uh i thought leadership is so key you know the only reason that we started off with such a bang was that you know i spent so many years speaking and blogging and so on so once i stood up a company people were like yes i've been waiting to work with you because they're like yeah i didn't like the people you worked for before and things like that um so thought leadership is is very key in that way and then everything is all about process you know my team's going to hate to hear me say this but that's the reality of it process is one of the key things that inhibited our growth in the earlier years of the company because you know i always just thought like hey hire really smart people put a problem in front of them and then we'll just like figure it out all together and like everyone will always be oriented around doing the best thing that's not really what works you know what what actually works is having a core framework that everybody's working within and then there can be people that can be outliers that are the people that have that initiative and will like you know go the extra mile to figure out the new stuff but most people don't do that most people just you know want to have a job come in work go home like do their whole paint by numbers thing and that's it and and the reality of it is you've got to account for that because again that's most people and then you hope for people that you know really like exemplify that idea of being like really proactive and coming up with the best solution and then those people kind of like power the company to go forward but your foundation is largely just the people that are going to do things the way that you lay them out and so when you don't lay them out and you just expect performance it doesn't really work in that way got it so i'm curious how did uh the name come about like i pull rank i mean that's a dope ass name i mean how how did i pull rank the agency just come about like you know i i mean it makes sense in seo i pull rank yeah i mean you know i'm really into double entendres and when i first started at razorfish which is one of the like bigger agencies that i worked at i was like i need i need to separate like my rap persona online from like my business persona and i was like all right let me just come up with a cool name and the first thing that hit me that um what first thing that hit me was race condition because that is a double entendre in that in in development a race condition is when like let's say you write some code and you have like a function that fires before another function does and then it finishes before it's supposed to and then your code is broken even though syntactically it's correct um that's a race condition but also just from like you know the the racial part of it like i have a race condition by being a black person so that was my first one and i was like ah that was too risque and then i was like i pull rank that's perfect yeah and so so it's my personal brand first and then when i started the agency i couldn't come up with a good name fast enough and i was like let's just go with that we'll figure out a new name later yeah that's that's dope name dope name love it and you're speaking a personal brand i mean how important do you think it is uh having a personal brand when starting a company like you know it actually became your company right i mean so how like how how important do you think it is nowadays it's so important like you know the the beauty of a personal brand even if you work in house is that goes beyond where you work right like if you work in a place and you don't have a personal brand you your your options are always you know just a function of like all right can i prove to someone who doesn't know me that i'm good at what i do like that's what an interview process is right yeah whereas when you have a personal brand people are looking at you and saying like no you're good at what you do and so you're creating a lot of opportunities just by being out there and telling people what you're good at effectively all the time so i definitely believe a personal brand is incredibly important for anyone like period if you want to like progress in your career but it's incredibly important if you're looking to start a business because it does it's like you're doing marketing before you even started your business there you have it you're doing marketing before you start your business with a personal brand so make sure you get that going all right we had a question coming in here it's a big one how do you see seo evolving in the next five years yeah i mean i think google is still just trying to get more and more predictive they're trying to figure out you know what users want before they explicitly indicate it so i see a world you know in the next five years where it's like you have 50 tabs open like everyone else does you probably have something in your cart for some store or whatever and then you you know forgot about it it's again amongst those 50 tabs i see a world where in the future google is like hey you're walking by a store that has something in it that you had in your cart why don't you go in there right now you see what i'm saying like yeah more implicitly understanding what you want based on your activity across the web ecosystem um but from a practitioner perspective things are going to get more complicated you know i mean like just because machine learning is such a huge component of everything on both sides one how google is understanding everything and how they're ranking it but also in the sophistication that our seo tools can have you know we're moving into a point where generated content is very difficult to determine you can have really good generated content and so if everyone can get to a point where not only is it generated but it's perfectly optimized using tools like phrase and surfer and click flow and market muse and all those types of things what's going to be the differentiator between your content and someone else's and so i think it's going to then become a lot more about rarities and things and i think dawn anderson talked about this in one of those clips that you showed um but you know that is going to be more difficult for seos to do because they're not so creatively minded they're very much minded around like how do we mimic things and so i think it's just going to be it's going to separate between the people that are like you know it's able to replicate versus the people that can create in the future dropping them knowledge bombs all right all right we got one more in here before i ask my last question uh it goes okay it's kind of related goes what do you think about ai in seo i mean like i think it's great i think it's wonderful like it goes back to exactly what i was just saying you know i think that there's gonna come a point where people are going to be like look um here's the keyword i'm targeting cool learn from the serp extract the features and then use that to plug into a language model that generates exactly the content that you want and so i think that's great because it eliminates the need and the cost around that content that no one actually wants that they're creating just for seo like those blocks of copy that go on the bottom of category pages for e-commerce no one should have to write that it should be you know made as valuable as it can be so that whoever reads it you know it's it's useful to them but what people what human capital should be used for as far as content is things that are creative and editorial and valuable to people that a computer can't make and then on the other side of it as far as like the analysis you know all that the ai stuff that we can do now will be able to do in the near future is just amazing like just the scale of understanding that we can get at seos as seo is going to be so fantastic in the next couple years like the way that we've historically done these like rank factor studies and so on i i'm imagining you know sem rush and i think they're like the best suited for this doing something where and i'm sorry they're semrush now i know they reset yeah um i hope you got that eye roll um so i i see them having a product where it's like they can in real time like day over day learn what changed about um the scoring functions in google based on what changed about what ranked better so they could extract features they could run a bunch of models and they could say with reasonable confidence like for this query set you know this is more important based on google scoring functions so here's how you might want to optimize i feel like that right there is a potential game changer for seo and especially with sem rush going public soon like i think that would be a really good way for them to be unassailable as a company in this space love it love it all right michael i have to ask my last question that i ask all my seo professionals that come on the show okay so like i guess and if anyone else has any questions going to ask it but i mean here's my last question for me as like i always ask this to all my super professionals come on it's like if someone wants to get into seo or get into the seo game like what is that one piece of advice that you can get them tell them i'd say build something and you know i think it's it's such a differentiator in this space to understand like how the internet works and understand like what it takes to actually make something rank because it's very easy to be a consultant having read all the books took all the courses and things and knowing things like from a you know theoretical level but actually being able to commit code on a website mess around with analysis and and try things out and see what the what the response is you just understand nuances of things in ways that you can't just by being like you know the seo manager who writes documents about seo so build something and make it rank there you go there you go that's what you gotta do build something and write about it okay all right so michael i wanted to um how can someone get a hold of you how like what's any upcoming project that everyone can look forward to like uh please the the stage is yours yeah um so you get a hold of me at ipool rank uh on twitter on everything iporank.com for the website um you can reach out to me directly mike pullrink.com i also have another website called polymaththesis.com it's like my personal site where i just talk about things i'm working on in general like entrepreneurial things because i'm writing a book called the science of seo for wiley publishing so um i'll be talking about all that stuff as it comes as well and yeah just watch all those spaces we got a lot of things that we're cooking up that i'm excited to share excellent all right all right mike it looks like we're coming and if you can just hold on for one quick second i'm gonna go ahead and sign off

[Music] [Music] [Music] magical unicorn cave wait unicorn whoa jesus get that out of my face welcome back to crown's crypto cave it's time for a little bit more productions and we actually have plenty to talk about today is bitcoin does take the short-term medium-term downside trajectory hitting our targets to about 55 000 a little bit of a bouncy bounce there and then continuation down almost to our next 52 and a half thousand dollar target and that leads us into today of which that has plenty of implications with the short and medium term time frames higher term time frame still more or less unchanged kind of spoiled that surprise i suppose a little bit of a clickbait title today for some good fun fake selling and it's never fake selling hey if it if it's an actual cell if you see the red thing over here in the market mover tab that's real that matters and guess what the liquidation engine doesn't give a who the hell thinks what is real what is fake because all the things that come through over here assuming that they actually are you know connected to the actual right data feed which they are in this case then it is indeed real and you can count on that so with that said i would like to wish you the best best and the haps of the happiest of course i also do want to say another heartfelt thank you uh for being a part of this community because it is the three year and one day anniversary it's a very special day today and of course we do have a sale going on uh to celebrate that fact i won't go through the full ring rule with that but i will just say hey make sure you watch the videos that accompany any one of the programs any one of the indicators any one of the stuff so that you can see if it's if it's you know going to be a good fit for you or not spoiler yes if you don't have enough time to put into these sorts of things you're probably not going to get much out of it they're not magic pills at the end of the day and it will require a ton of work from your behalf of course but with that said i do want to also well i just want to scare this out of people so they so that people who aren't too sure you know don't don't obviously get into that in jesus christ man the uh war of typing over there is already getting started in the early morning hours so with that in mind let's get through the crown shade application which by the way is 100 free so take advantage of it or well don't but we do have uh plenty of uh we actually have plenty of integrations coming in relatively soon a big one that i'm really excited about is integrations with cme data so we'll actually be able to show you direct cme data um not just for bitcoin but for actually all markets really uh whatever the we want to throw on there as it seems like they're completely cool with that which is pretty damn awesome so you know obviously it will cost us money but we are more than happy to do that because it's well because i want to use it and so everyone else can benefit from that so there you go anyways uh what did we see on the dashboard today yeah we see a lot of things actually so first and foremost open interest coming down about almost 2 billion over the last couple days we did see it get a little bit above 11.5 billion i believe coming into uh sunday monday after bitcoin hit that 61 62 000 target to the upside so with that in mind we actually do still see that this is longs taking profits here so if you are looking at this you know it's like driven from uh well with the whole do i even want to do i even want to get into that whole  explanation with why people think like xyz is selling on xyz exchange jesus christ man it's it's such silly it's such silliness in my opinion man it's a good story it's great for the media it's great for the crypto news channels as as actual trading goes doesn't matter i mean doesn't matter if it doesn't matter who the selling just matters that cells actually do happen anyways more importantly let's get back onto it right and over here before i get on to another uh bogus thread and let's see fear ingredients all is coming down a little bit from yesterday to today mark is still a little bit more in the optimistic zone as you would imagine so haven't seen any like major massive structural changes and bitcoin dominance more importantly coming down pretty significantly from yesterday to today and this is actually gonna play into the analysis that bitcoin is more less ranging right now if bitcoin was really breaking down in breaking structure and you know had significant downside i would expect to see that the bitcoin dominance actually shot up alongside bitcoin coming back down but the way that i interpret this right now at least within the current context of price action is that bitcoin is more or less ranging at least as long as a few conditions are met which we'll get into in the video uh soon enough but with that said i do want to come back to this number here so uh so we will come back and recall that but generally you know they are sorry the general market knowledge still does essentially apply meaning that you know whenever bitcoins ranging all coins are going to more or less have good times whenever bitcoin's trending all coins are gonna more or less have bad times versus their satoshi parent versus us dollar pairing gonna follow whatever direction that bitcoin chooses more or less as we do see from last night or yesterday i guess as uh bitcoin has another what like uh i don't know five thousand six thousand dollar down day which is a nice little clean 10 move on a nice monday um but more importantly bitcoin coming bitcoin dominance coming down rather than actually going up is a little bit more indicative that bitcoin is still more or less on a high term timeframe range which we will discuss uh in more depth here again that combined with the open interest coming down alongside that does suggest that longs are essentially or bullas are essentially in control this market right now and a little bit of profit taking after a bit of a swing failure powder right there well fair enough anyways on top of that we do see or actually no we don't see anything else let's go down to the top 10 coins top 10 worst coins this is very interesting here we're actually seeing the 2017 chick coins get uh get their time in the sun now cya coin nem reserve i don't know what the reserve right says but ravencoin i remember all those one for 2017. uh even what is this nexo i think that one was there aunt yeah i remember that one as well hey what's up ray ray i would like to uh can you check out the god indice it is a global index ticker z's bra if you can't find it then you're not worthy love you babes no problem chess bra i'll have that coming right up for you served on a silver platter bunghole dish anyways what the does that even mean doesn't matter man just keep on talking anyways looking at this right over here okay on the on the market data tab we actually see a couple of a couple of very interesting things here too most importantly we do see that the funny rate has had a complete reset coming all the way down so we did identify that this was a little bit of a short-term uh problematic thing coming in from yesterday of course that was when bitcoin was trading somewhere around uh jesus christmas sorry i need to focus down right now that was when bitcoin was trading a little bit around 60 000 bucks yesterday when we were doing our video now coming all the way down we do say this does have a reset so remember we actually did see about 40 uh yeah about 48 hours consistently above that not 0.1 threshold with multiple exchanges and that actually did play out but seeing a reset this this fast does still bode well i do believe for the higher term timeframes now again higher term timeframes is going to naturally incur a massive range so with that said you know i'm not necessarily saying that this is you know the low right here in fact i'd go as far as saying it's probably not at least at least for right now um but you know everything everything in moderation and we do need to incorporate the whole view of this in order to in order to get like an actual good read on the markets right now i also want to pull in this one as well remember yesterday we were sorry the last couple days especially over the weekend saturday sunday and a little bit into monday we were looking at the premium of futures over spot price action and it was it was just straight up  massive right there uh more so than what we saw on the last rally to 50 000 bucks which was a very very aggressive one and you know those sorts of things were being priced in and that was a damn good indication yes as well that bitcoin was going to come back down into range so with all that said we do see a good reset on these but i do still think that it probably comes down a little bit more if these can come into parity especially that's going to be a damn good signal that we probably do go into another likely accumulation range anyways uh looking at the individualistic ones do we see anything out of the ordinary no in fact uh the the the chart here is very deceptive once again in this presentation but as you can see the highest one is is just barely above 0.04 which is not in any way shape or form uh consequential for at least in the way that i look at things uh let's see a uh sjprop says just watch your opening video straight through for the first time it was badass though the video didn't show your hair last shot should be your hair that's best when you're chugging water like the old days yeah man fun times for sure glad that you did enjoy that and uh that that video is very special to me very  special to me just because a good old friend made it a late old friend make it made it unfortunately he's no longer with us but uh but god damn man it is uh it is it is a damn good relic a damn good memory of that relationship so jesus christ man i don't want to get into that explanation right now because that is a little bit too depressing for the early morning hours and i'm a sensitive person here so let's uh let's see is there anything else that we want to check out as of the current moment in time uh bitcoin dominance taking a little bit of a downturn right there yes uh that again will play into the analysis a little bit later and anything else that's uh sticking out like a sore thumb no not really actually no not really all right so with that in mind let's go to the actual price target charts um let's start off with our secondary charts once again today i do want to do a perusal of the higher term timeframes and i want to be very direct and clear here because there's going to be once again similar to yesterday a differential between different timeframe analysis as you know is typical usually it's you know somewhat aware that you see everything line up with each other but high term timeframes i'm still not enable share perform bearish on uh there's no reason for me to be bearish on anything that looks like this and especially anything that looks like uh this as well long term i'd even go as far as saying that i wouldn't i would i not that i wouldn't be surprised but i'd actually be looking for bitcoin over the next couple weeks to very likely make new all-time highs um uh very likely you know somewhere around april uh beginning of april that is or april fools there you go just have a little bit of a rug pull in your life anyways more importantly with this you know i i still really do favor this in a more sincere tone long term i am still bullish long term i would still be looking for bitcoin to you know likely make a stab up into the deeper 6 000 territory towards the next target our next major target about 69 000 bucks uh also for the mimi number there too uh looking out of momentum also this year yeah a little bit of a uh you know a little bit of a lack of or sorry a little bit of a loss momentum which is completely fine and to be uh and to be um what's it called uh expected when you are in a pretty damn aggressive rally like this and you know at some point yes this will come this will come to fruition and we will see a massive massive downturn but i don't think that we're there just yet believe me i uh i would absolutely love to get bearish on bitcoin this channel was born in 2018 this channel was born in the bear market and uh and and you know as a trader that's really where you actually do have to use your skills right now everyone's making money except for the over leveraged uh schlongs who are getting shish kebabs right now so with that said i do want to start off with this but let's just suppose that against a short-term timeframe analysis just a second let me see congrats on three years hey thanks brother i appreciate that man and uh and much love man uh fox and hound says can you give a brief description of how you use shorter term time frames versus higher thanks babe i'd really like to get through the analysis first and then we can get to like more directed questions i just feel like you know it's got to flow a little bit so if it's okay with you i'd like to save this one for after we get through all this i promise it won't be too damn long today but uh but we'll get back to it i promise i promise i promise all right cool so with that in mind uh yes you know all higher term timeframes at least in the way that i look at them are still very much bullish to myself uh looking at the monthly right here i'm not bearish on anything that looks like this and uh and ultimately actually uh i would be looking for bitcoin to pull through here the question is where does bitcoin try to put in one of these next higher lows as this is still all well and good and at least in the way that i look at it at least in the way that things are right now well let's go down to our lower term timeframes right now and let's follow from yesterday's short term time frame analysis and also our and also our what's it called our forex video from last night so what what was the conditions yesterday set up if bitcoin breaks below 58 000 bucks right here also the two spot 61.85 extension then very likely we would see a move down about 55 000 bucks likely a little bit of a bouncy bounce there that's what we got right here and then we came back later on the forex video saying yeah bounce is you know okay right now but very likely it does get sold into next target would be 52 and a half thousand bucks of which i do believe that we're kind of in line with right now as you can see back down around here now what i would like to do is actually like like to make this one massive zone right here because this actually will start to change around more i wouldn't say higher turn timeframe biases but this one's going to have another implication this area right here is going to have another implication with another multi-thousand dollar move so first and foremost i would like to see this area tested well it's not necessarily that i'd like to see this area tested i'm essentially looking for price action to test around this region and very likely try to put in a uh very likely try to put in a low here again when we recall back to our underlying market dynamics we have seen a bullish reset or i wouldn't say a bullish reset but we have seen a reset on the funny rate and also the bitcoin dominance coming down back in a range would suggest that bitcoin uh is playing out a range rather than a reversal at least for right now at least for right now load conditions for reversal b here however perhaps we'll go back to well maybe not just the shark did yes although um caretaker said six caretaker says fifty one and a half thousand bucks yeah he's probably gonna be right on that one fair enough um but more importantly uh would my would my conditions be for you know a major reversal here like a macro reversal in this case uh anywhere below 45 000 bucks is uh is is no bueno for bitcoin that's your last little higher low right here if you can't even consider that a higher load that would obviously undo the current hidden bullsh divergence on the weekly uh weekly as well and we can start to look for moves you know another ten thousand bucks down and that's the next big one that would actually be your weekly 21x mentoring average or 20 simple mood average test right there which everyone's you know everyone's aware about now because we've been beating that horse to death for like the last two three years anyways fair enough on that one i do think that bitcoin's gonna have a chance to uh to at least try to put in a little bit of a low here on the short and medium term time frames first and foremost so i would still respect essentially the fifty one and a half thousand to fifty two and a half thousand dollars level yes i do think that bitcoin very likely does test it and mobile do you see all lower term time for momentum sort of still pointed uh more or less southwards i do think that you know it really wouldn't take too much to get them uh to get them uh you know not you know what a nice uh on a nice up uh or at least an up try there as we do see the four hour getting all the way down to the edge of the critical zone in the bearish territory same thing on the 3r right here still angled to the downside though i should i should denote same thing on the by early a little bit of a flippy floppy and then down that's usually going to be that's usually going to be your continuation signal and same thing on the hourly here as well so with all that in line or sorry with all of that uh in mind we do see essentially the quad feta of all lower term timeframes kind of aligning up with each other and so i would still favor a little bit more short-term downside continuation and then at this level right here probably does grind it out a little bit again 51.5 000 to 52 and a half thousand bucks i know it's a you know rather large area but you know if i did i you know if i did have to kind of bring it down a little bit i'd say it's more like 51 and a half thousand to 52 and a half thousand i would err on the downside actually rather than the upside there i don't think right now is the time to be like super aggressive but i would be looking for bottoming action within this region what would that look like a bunch of wicks probably into the edge of the boat into the edge of the bluish box right here the blue box of priests and peace and prosperities we used to call them and uh and then and also the two spot extension right here on the fibs by the way and uh and then if that's what's happened then we talk about balanced targets likely back up somewhere around about fifty five thousand bucks fifty maybe even fifty six thousand bucks at which point i might even be interested in playing a position uh at least for a little bit of a scalpy scalp so as it stands right now looking at our looking at our lower term time for momentum sliders uh i also do wanted to note that four hour rsi is doing what it's actually breaking this trend line that we had in from our last few major lows coming out of a um uh late february uh that was actually way the back on over here that was actually uh yeah around yesterday's video so funnily enough or not not funnily enough there's nothing funny about this but uh but i certainly missed that one um that would have been a damn good early indication that bitcoin was going to break down as well so i'd be looking for some sort of some sort of hidden divergences on the other side now i want to bring up this concept um that i i think i think i first learned from maybe jackie in the discord or at least he's the first person who kind of brought it up and then i started testing it myself with caretakers indicator here and it's this uh divergence plays on the rsi we've seen or a lot of time what we see is as we see regular divergences lead into continuation divergences and you don't really see any sort of um we don't really see any sort of reversals until that actually does happen or sorry no you don't see any continuations until that actually does happen what do i mean by this okay so on this side we obviously do have bearish evidence confirmed right that means that on the other side when you're looking for a low we at least need to have the possibility the potential of hidden diverted and in this case with rsi making uh well it's not making any low right now but with this with with this posturing where it's not even making a lower low than our last low then we obviously cannot be having hidden bullish evidence at this point so in that case that would imply that bitcoin very likely does test further downside here whether you're bullish or bearish you're looking for likely that hit and bullish divergence on the other side if you're looking for a continuation you really want to see that i've seen that plenty of times happen now and caretakers are so just makes this really simple so a little bit of a cheat code for myself it's actually made me a little bit lazy as well i would suggest i would suggest if you are you know if you are interested in something like that learn learn to learn how to read divergences first because it will only serve you well and it can be a little bit of a crutch which i don't know man you know it's it's like one of those things do you need to learn math uh if you have a calculator well yes but also no but mostly yes you know you kind of do need to learn it because you want to understand you know what's going on uh beneath the hood there um because there will be you know more delicate situations and in this case right here um we can see that that's you know not even going to be potential even if we go down to a 12 hour i wonder if that's going to be a potential uh could be a potential here yes we do have our last low coming in where that was right around here at about 50 500 and we actually are making lower lows on rsi right now so if you do see some bottoming action around fifty one and a half thousand fifty two thousand bucks that cancer transfer into our higher term time frames and i would start to look for you know a little bit of uh you know a little bit of uh uh well a little bit of about at the very least a bounce there but very likely uh continuation on top of that too to you know back up towards 60 000 bucks if that would have happened but for right now it's still you know it's still kind of far away and we don't even have a local low confirmed to begin with and this is you know not gonna this is this is not gonna uh work like that anyways in its current posturing at least take another like half day to a day at the very uh earliest so with all of that in mind lower term timeframes again dew point a little bit further south um i would be looking for bounces again between about 51.5 thousand to fifty two thousand bucks god damn it turn off the sink you're banned why are you not responding [Music] you're can't you think it's funny to rape 90 year olds so you're canceled how about that she she was laughing about that last night mark mark mr plums that is disgusting absolutely disgusting elsa's a very bad oh it's funny you don't have a grandma obviously anyways anyways we all we also do see the 200 simple on the four-hour down around the 200 uh uh sorry we do see the two yes so 200 simple down around that 50 and a half thousand dollar uh territory as well so i do like that area essentially at least for some wicking action and a potential local low action at least on the short term time frames very likely does transfer onto the medium from time frames and i would be looking for bounces maybe over the next like couple days back towards 55 56 thousand bucks so that is you know multi thousand dollar move forty five thousand bucks uh off that territory and uh and i do and i do rather like that to be fair let's go to the medium term timeframes here uh actually before we do that let's go through all the short-term timeframes uh short-term time from right here three hours basically the same thing as a four-hour even has the same moving averages and the exact same ball screen wow how does that work sir uh by early same thing literally the same thing actually that is that is uncanny um and hourly yeah very very similar portion here as well and all of them do look a little bit more poised for uh for for a little bit more downside continuation so on the same territory here what would be the more um what would be a good signal of of of inherent short-term medium-term long-term bullishness well of course as we did say you know higher term timeframes nothing's really changed there as long as bitcoin's about 45 thousand bucks that's not very helpful though because that's literally almost 10 000 bucks away from current price action and i'm sure that you know over leveraged on binance doing 125x which is just absurd uh it's probably it's probably not going to survive a death drop like that so what would change things around here uh for myself on the shorter medium from time frames well 58 50 000 bucks was a pivot to the downside on the short and medium term time frames it will still be the pivot to the upside as well so as long as we're low there i'm not looking for any sort of you know continuation of trend here on the higher term time frames to those next macro targets at about 69 000 bucks uh with the areas of interest around 66 or yeah i think it was about six six thousand bucks um and by the short term right and by and by the same token we were looking at the very very short term i'd use 55 000 bucks again as a short term pivot to the upside which can be mediated by a two or four hour closure so with that said again you know short term still uh still still very much down but i'd use those two pivots basically the same pivots that we saw on the way down on the same way up and they have essentially the same implications just yeah just inverted i suppose so with all that said let's go to the medium term timeframe see what they're looking like right right around here oh what do you know the same 55 exponential moving average coming in right around that goddamn 52 000 target or sorry 51.5 thousand dollar target same basically and uh and we do see moment monsters also pointed southwards as well and coming all the way down actually to the edge of the bulls control zone so it could be that we actually if we do start to see some batting action within that region that'd be a damn good signal here also daily uh daily so is coming down to test the critical zone that is usually going to bounce on first pass as well and we are also kind of hitting the 21x benchmark average here so it you know could it be that bitcoin does try to bounce from its current posturing could be um what would be the early indication of that well i i'll still use 55 thousand bucks i i don't i don't think right now is the time to be aggressive uh on the short term i i i really don't um you know letting this one kind of unfuck itself for a little bit is uh is well is it at least the way that i kind of look at it as of the current moment uh by daily what are we looking at right here a little bit of lost momentum right now uh but technically not crossing the downside just yet i didn't see anything on rsi no not really two-day uh two-day two-day joule is gonna maybe be a little bit problematic there but not quite just yet i want to see that actually turned down so before someone asks that question because i know i know it's coming man i know it's coming um i wouldn't say so just yet and the three day over here as well is actually you know all but confirming uh one two three drives of bearish evernote is coming off the highs uh now the three day is a little more concerning to me as well i mean this could very easily turn into a sell signal here i would like to see them all have one more continuation drop down and i believe we actually do have a new open tonight yes we do have a new open tonight so that would actually be really really really really really important to actually keep an eye on because your natural target if that does get ticked off is going to be the 20 minutes between average down here which is somewhere around about uh it's it's probably gonna rise up to like 47 000 bucks if i had to guess anyways that should also bring up the next topic of conversation well i don't necessarily think it's that it's gonna happen like today uh or or it might not even happen at all but uh if it were to happen probably just happened you know maybe a little bit later this week uh what would be the next sort of um uh major level to be aware of to the downside well fifty one and a half thousand bucks right here any sort of a two hour or four hour closure below there and i would extend targets down to the next major level which is gonna be around forty seven and a half thousand to forty eight thousand bucks as uh as we can just well we can just thrust in a nice little horizontal right here in this accumulation zone and that actually is where i would really love to get potentially even long-term trade if it were to happen uh no promises on that one though i do think that bitcoin could potentially put in a low at 51.5 000 first and i would give that one a chance uh first and foremost of course anyways i think i've gone through most of the things that i want to talk about here maybe we take a quick look at traditional markets and then we'll get back to that earlier question i haven't forgotten about you sir let me just see if i can still pull it up i can't so that's good all right awesome mr fox and hound uh but yes i do want to check i do want to check out traditional marks because again they all do move together and what do we see nasdaq following through we did say yesterday on the uh on the late day wrap-up video very likely to follow through with yes with the rest of the markets very likely a target up to about 13 300. i mean that's that's what we're seeing right now whenever you see something like this a little bit of um what's it called a little bit of drama around especially two major moving averages that were actually have gonna have a bearish uh collision right there um that is usually damn good signal when you see something like this very specifically like this that it's gonna run the other way uh at least at least a good amount in this case i would still be uh sticking with that 13 300 target and that does bode well because guess what spy features and dow jones all making new all-time highs as we said was likely yesterday and guess what dow jones right here leading the party and i would still be having that 13 that 33 150 target right here um uh but that's that's not a big one the big one is 33 750ish region so i'd be looking for maybe a short-term pullback off this region right here but again this does bode well for basically all markets so i do find it very very very very inherently difficult to get bearish on bitcoin when we see world markets or the world major indices you know essentially in blue sky breakouts price discovery what the you want to call it it's the same thing it's bullish man it's bullish so uh picking that picking that up uh on chief spy features as well guess what new all-time highs i mean what did we say yesterday very likely a retest to priority high and then very likely new ultimates that's kind of exactly what we've got in fact don't mean to say i don't mean to come off as like arrogant or something like we predicted it no it's just look it just an easy play right there okay and i would still be sticking with a little bit of our fourth uh 4 000 target anywhere between about 40 uh 40 10 to 40 30ish region it's where we're looking towards and probably short term pullback from there so again you know uh running with the assumption that these marks are still a very much quarterly which they are i know that cryptocurrency moon boys or cryptocultists as peter brandt uh lovingly calls him which i think is hilarious uh hate that fact but that is that is the history of these marks i mean everything's kind of connected with each other we're all we're all one sirs we're all just floating through this through this through the space on a rock man or whatever the that saying is doesn't matter you know what the i mean rising tide lifts all ships and actually do truly believe that you know i guess in some ways i'm a hip here in some in some cases but i actually do actually do believe that and in this case not only can we just show that we actually we actually have like another 11 year history of all these markets being very correlated bitcoin that being with with with uh with with major indices especially nasdaq and by the way nasdaq is the laggard of all these and nasdaq obviously you know holds the financials and the text which bitcoin could maybe even fit into both those slots i think it fits more with the tech sector as it seems to trade better with that but more importantly this one was a laggard of them all and so i'd be looking for bitcoin to do something somewhat similar you can see it kind of be brought down to those major moving averages bitcoin same thing over here as well and very likely does try to put in a low after that and uh and i would be looking forward to to join the rest of the markets because we're seeing rotations right now nasdaq was leading pretty much like pretty much the whole time for the last few years now dow jones is leading a little bit um how long does that go on for don't know but more importantly you know we're going to see that rotation likely just lift all the ships up and bitcoin likely likely trades with nasdaq here so a little bit of a little bit on the laggard side but ultimately i do look for kind of follow through as well anyways all right that's that's that's all that i want to talk about let's get to fox and howard's question i haven't forgot that one can you give a brief description of how you use shorter term time frames versus higher okay how do i use shorter term time frames versus higher well first off i need more context on that question because i don't know like use them versus i just use them like what do you mean uh what exactly do you mean by that would be my would be my first question but if i if i if i had to interpret your question in the way that my brain works i guess what i would be thinking is like what sort of actually no i have no idea what the you mean by that to be honest with you what okay how would you how would you use shorter term time frames versus higher well shorter term like i don't use them any differently if that's what you're asking uh the same sort of like uh technical knowledge on short-term time frames typically uh generally applies to high-term timeframes as well it's just it's gonna have a less it's gonna have a less typical chance to actually uh play out those signals that you're getting on short-term time frames versus higher term timeframes higher trim timeframes collecting more data less less variance within that versus lower term time frame so if you're so to kind of put it another way if you're looking at a five minute for example and you get like uh let's say just for example a bullish diverting signal down a five minute and you then get a bullish diverting signal on or a bearish divergence signal on a daily which one's more likely to play out the daily the daily is more likely to play out higher term timeframes do have a higher hit rate is essentially what i'm saying anyways uh we'll move on through it now because i think i think that's what you mean i'm not so sure anyways uh we're all on the human tribe we are all on the human tribe man that's something that we've that's something that we uh forget a lot of the time you know you have to you have to wish you have to wish even your enemies well because you have to also understand you know if they're uh if things were better for them they probably wouldn't be your enemy huh anyways uh let's see trading with me says they say roughly 25 to 40 billion dollars will be put in the crypto market on wednesday who's they and how the do they know why are these terms never goddamn to find whenever someone says they i always want to just say hey man give me a name here you can't just say they it's the boogeyman they is the boogeyman look if you don't say if you say they without an operative term you're talking about the goddamn boogie man i i can't i can't i hate that i'm sorry i really do hate that i'm not saying that i hate you you sound like a very lovely person but god damn it man drop the goddamn they if you can't define they then it does not matter it's a story leave that to the crypto media and crypto news channels because that's you know fun fun night time stories to tell you're you're scared little traitors but at the end of the day man what matters most is what happens on here this is a very easy to read well i wouldn't say necessarily very easy to read but this is the most streamlined way to read at least in my opinion what people actually doing this is showing actual buys themselves here it's just conglomerating it into a chart format uh versus you know we could also just look at the the market mover tab over here too these things actually matter who the  are they doesn't matter it doesn't does these don't come with names here it doesn't come with names and do you think that they are broadcasting their their position bless you sir uh broadcasting their positions to like the world so that the world can counter trade them and know exactly what they're doing no it would be the same thing as like a  president during world war ii saying look we're gonna do xyz we're gonna invade on this date we're gonna come in through normandy we're gonna we're gonna bomb the out of you and we're gonna your mothers like no you wouldn't do that because it's not very uh wise in fact if anything it's probably like someone somebody referred to as psyops now someone actually made a really good twitter post on this yesterday i want to bring it up and i want to give him credit i think his name was cl um where was it i retweeted it here somewhere let me bring it up really quick uh where's this guy yeah there it is all right so i retweeted it on twitter here uh i'll bring it up really really quick uh cl207 so shout out to him i think he's also replying to lex moscaus lex he replied to life there we go yeah so you know a lot of people are making a big deal about this uh if you know oh the whales are gonna sell it's like we saw a major transfer look here's a deal with miners and he and this and this applies to a lot of things and people don't even understand why the futures were brought in to begin with by the way futures were brought on to begin with so that people could use them to hedge just so you know anyways miners can sell and hedge in countless ways yes 100 true they literally get paid money to sell on futures not always true but in this case yes uh they can hedge on options absolutely they can also go to trading and otc desks which will never show up in even this chart over here by the way although it will tangentially because you know it is all kind of related and someone does need to you know take the other side of that trade obviously it has to come from somewhere yes but the thing is is that his next point is really profound imagine thinking monizers are actively broadcasting it to you on a public ledger public ledger by the way i mean this that's that's what bitcoin is a public immutable or an immutable public ledger whatever the hell um so you can short before they sell that's i mean he just nailed it right there nailed it right there man if anything i agree i agree with both these guys you know it's probably it's maybe a little bit of manipulation in a way to make people who think like they're doing the chain analysis right um uh are are are going to be able to like front run these sorts of cells no you wouldn't do that man you wouldn't do that obviously anyways uh let me pull up these uh let me pull these other chatties over here i see you filson i see you mr filson he's here  yeah man all right uh let's see nero uh nero strutin says broseph hello nero broseph can we look at bat basic attention token uh most of these coins basically follow bitcoin's price action thanks bruh bro um okay yeah sure uh let's see that i don't you didn't give a base parent on it so i'm just gonna go with the us dollar here i'm curious to see how this one's done this one is a 2017-2016 coin so i imagine it's gonna have a lot of history and let's see what if the history is good or not uh yep making new all-time highs closing on fresh new all-time highs by the way last week i'm bullish on this thing man i'd be bullish on this thing for a while probably going to hit the same sort of moves that we've seen most these ones that have been going under long form accumulation for we could just make a quick little measure move on this and uh still i'd be having a target somewhere around a buck and a quarter to a buck 20 cents region uh very likely in a markup phase right here you see a bit of a change in volume although this is you know this is this is binance of course um but uh but yes you know this thing more or less i'm bullish on especially as long as it remains above about 60 cents or so i'd be having that 120 125 target looks you know looks more or less good after uh what is this like three years long yeah three years long of accumulation so fair enough on that one jeremy schallman says crown you know you know how i know you're gay i don't know maybe because i'm gay for ta your girlfriend is a sir also avex yes my girlfriend is my girlfriend calls me sir and i call her sir and her friends are like we had a party uh i don't know oh we didn't have a party we had like a uh a get-together uh like last or no was the last weekend no so we can before that and we talk like that to each other and like my girlfriend's friends don't understand they don't understand because they're  finished for what and they also just they're they just don't understand why do you call each other sir i don't know sir also avax btc daily binance gotcha uh avex uh what is this uh is this this is this like an anti-vaxxer corn or some uh afex for your for your for your vaccinations on the blockchain uh oh yeah i just said the magical words there uh not much history here to be fair i'm a little bit hesitant to give an opinion on this one um just because you know there's not a whole hell of a lot here and the information that we do have is i mean the inversion the information that we do have leads me to believe that this is a long-term pump and dump yes uh but short-term is it likely to rally off this level probably yeah you know it you know look it looks like it is putting a base above that last sort of uh what is this like an ico ipo dump region as long as it's right in this trend line right here i look for it to kind of level out and probably give another try back up towards 64 000 uh 64 000 satoshi's if it does break this level though i'd look for a big retracement all the way down to this past prior level right here which is thirty two and a half thousand satoshi's region uh alrighty moving on let's see what else we got uh oh we say uh al masari says appreciate post all good man uh cwrk stock oh we got a stock yeah goddamn finally man cwrk uh let's see currency work what the this isn't a goddamn stock hey man what the this trades otc this is no better than crypto uh let's see what we have over here though all jokes aside um you know same same thing as the chart that we just looked at very very similar here we don't have a whole hell of a lot of history uh obviously someone knows something that we or perhaps or or perhaps just i don't know in the sense that this thing doesn't trade for like months on end years on end actually i mean you literally see like multiple days of just no trading pretty much uh and then all of a sudden out of nowhere ah let's just mark this up um now clear reaccumulation yes you know this this very likely does trade higher uh in this case um short term probably a little bit of downside movements i wouldn't i wouldn't be surprised to see another move back down a little bit below two bucks but ultimately uh i'd be looking for this one to continue its uptrend i mean you don't really see anything that's too shaky here just yet a little bit of bearish actually looks pretty damn similar to bitcoin's chart to be fair as far as the weekly goes but you know i'd be looking for a little bit of short term down long term up here uh at least for the information that we have i don't i don't feel too confident on something that has this amount that trades on otc this this is kind of like inside of it looks like to me uh bnt long-term medium term okay what's bnt that is a crypto bancor bank derp where did that one come from all right bancor usd bank derp um so i feel about a lot of these all coins the derp coin over here huh um let's see probably probably a little bit of a short-term bounce off this level however is this versus u.s dollar yeah so it probably does still have a little bit of downside in line with bitcoin how far down can we go i'd be looking at a retest of the last prior height about six and a half bucks and probably try some other higher low somewhere around there similar to bitcoin uh i'd imagine um now on the weekly does it look toppy to be fair it does look a little bit toppy there actually are more topping signals here than there are on bitcoin uh to put it bluntly um so you know i'd i'd first be looking for next move down essentially i'd be looking for next move down probably somewhere around that six dollar to six and a half dollar high region right here and then give it a chance to bounce and come back to it after that i don't really have a strong opinion on it uh more than that again you know this is i mean you know it's yeah it's it's still a pretty shitty cryptocurrency chart to be fair i mean look i don't like anything that does this for a long period of time and then out of nowhere you know when the market when the rest market's strong just just decides go up with everything else it's not like it's not strong on its own that's my point um it's kind of like in the middle of the pack in terms of relative strength hey what's up jr hey crown uh enj usd sure man finally correcting yeah i mean i saw that one like multiple times on the top 10 best coins on the app uh like consistently for maybe like a week or so it's just you know multi uh like double digit percent uh gains every  day yeah that's that's this rally right here apparently um what are we looking at right here so you're saying a little bit of a pullback yep uh we do see oh my god this is this is quite the rally this is really impressive right here really impressive now this one exceeded pretty much all my targets to the upside so a little bit of a pullback here would certainly be in order you know we i believe that we did look at this one the last couple days it's like yeah you know his you know could have another drive to the upside here yes but ultimately this is this is really the time to be more um uh what's it called uh concer at least in my opinion conservative and be looking for you know greater pullbacks i do think that it pulls back more on top of this very likely does make a run down somewhere um somewhere right around two bucks at the very least maybe even a little bit lower than that that's what i'd be looking for next sort of bounce ranges here uh lower term time frames lower term timeframes actually not as bad but we do have a four hour dual cell signal and i do favor that so i'd be looking for further accommodation to the downside here somewhere like between about one 190 to two bucks is where i'd be looking for on the next leg um and then probably and then probably just try and bounce from there and then we'll come back and analyze the balance but we see all kind of divergences here we even see jewel cell signals and we see daily you know looking a little more choppy here too although no bearish evidence to be fair on this one so yeah sometimes these all coins they just they they they they just do weird things uh but but i do uh but i do look for the short term medium term to be downside there alrighty let's see what else do we got here uh see new 510 says crown bro new bro me and my girlfriend broke up today what bro are you telling me you're not gay for ta and you're having girlfriends what the is this you're out get them out not gay for ta can you look at lmy usd yeah we can actually apparently it's on finex so uh toppy toppy as toppy as toppy as uh toppy sloppy i'd be looking for this one to cut to trade back down to like low four cent region for uh four and a half to four thirty ish four and a half to four thirty ish uh long term could be okay still could be okay long term but i do look for next move down uh weekly same thing a little bit of downside if it was test back down somewhere around low four cent i'd be looking for bounces around there uh long term it's it's it's okay it's okay um and in my sincere apologies for your loss of love there uh earth is earth is flat like an ostrich nest earth is flat like an ostrich nest um a little thank you from from uh from stinky linky hey man yeah i haven't heard link called out in like a few days so it might be time to go look at it um you know me as buy the dip ah nice one hey there there it is and happy anniversary happy anniversary too as well so i'm guessing that's a clever way of looking for an uh for a link analysis um link i still like here uh still a just very long-term uh uptrend this one's been up pretty much throughout all phases of the market cycle where the bitcoin's down where the bitcoins up this one just goes up over the long period of time now short term medium term does this one have more downside here i could look for another run somewhere down around 24 24 and a half bucks but i'd be looking for bounces there i do i do happen to think that this one is likely being re-accumulated within this region but does have some short-term downside long-term i don't really have any real reason to look for this to stop just yet uh but i do uh but i do favor a move down actually maybe even to the weekly 21 more medium term so 24 bucks probably bounce there continuation of 22 bucks possible but i would be looking for potential lows within that region i don't think that this i don't really have a reason to believe that this one's stopping long term here's what the monkey looks like as well um a little bit more toppy there to be for to be fair but but but moment tomorrow starts turning back up here too looks more or less good over the long period of time so yeah i i do still like it long term at least at least for now uh but short-term medium term probably some downside included there uh yes can i help you taro taro would like the sound effects to go away good morning tara tara is that a girl is that a girl in this cave no girls allowed sean r says chili's us i'm just kidding tara you can stay it's 20 21 you know we have to be inclusive i read a story last night from the los angeles times by the way i read a story last night i need to share this with everyone all right look i read a story last night from the los angeles times that hiking is now racist and i'll tell you why i'll tell you why it's right here long time oppression and historical barriers have kept many people of color from being comfortable in the american outdoors i feel uncomfortable there too there's bears and the what the i showed that to elson she thought it was like a satire um i don't know okay look [Music] i think it's i think it's more racist to like refer to people as like the black community like what the we're just a community man we're all the same hey let's maybe not draw artificial berries around each other so weird so weird all right chili's usdt uh four hour and daily all right let's check it out uh chz usd uh binance uh four hour and daily new problem sire uh daily down be looking for a move to about 44 cents four hour down four hour down i'd be looking for a bounce maybe in between there somewhere around about 45 and a half cents first and then continuation probably down to 44 cents and then probably try a daily bounce somewhere around there uh short term medium term down long term uh a lot long term i mean this is i don't hate this chart long term this is a pretty damn good chart long term i mean this is continuation volume here on the whole so so fair long term still bush but short term medium term maybe a little bit of downside there hiking is racist man god damn it so there's like asians for hiking like what the like what i mean look i'm not trying to be insensitive here it's just uh i feel like that's more racist like drawing these boundaries between people like why can't we just be all the same why can't we just be all the same the man is that maybe that's racist to say i don't know i don't know all right let's see let's see uh did i miss anything there um okay all right uh i think i did miss something no okay uh that okay we got that one yes we got that one nice nice nice okay where's the last one yep chili's okay we just got that one dr bitcoin says greetings crown dreams doctor we have a doctor in the house any of the recommended uh readings beside the two listed in your video descriptions happy anniversary sir happy university tutu yeah so um as far as reading goes i actually really don't do too much reading uh like specifically towards uh trading because i don't think that like you can learn a whole hell of a lot from reading like trading books at least i didn't really have too much success with that uh because first and foremost like any strategy that's that's like plastered in a book that costs you know no more than 100 bucks that's going to be nullified by the time that it's printed and second off um well you can learn the the fundamentals there and and some good you know baseline stuff uh that's good obviously but you know anything more complicated than that is gonna require a lot more hands-on type stuff so when i made the ta program for example i actually initially was gonna write it out and then i figured this is gonna be impossible to do because there's just so many nuanced situations that you can't address um you know in in in very dry text with just pictures because it's changing it's evolving it's morphing so for the most part i don't read books on trading there is one other book that i would um suggest with regards to trading psychology and slight uh slight sort of um uh what's called uh strategies although not really and that would be trading in the zone by mark douglas he has a couple books um uh he has a discipline trader as well i found all of his work really really useful he also has several um seminars on youtube which you can view at any time i believe he's also dead so he uh so he's the late the laden great really great guy and uh and very consistent with what i've experienced myself and very consistent with what i've found to work for myself as well so um so i'd strongly suggest that other than that man i actually read a lot of books on like uh on like evolutionary psychology and stuff to like try to understand my up brain and why you know sometimes i have issues with uh with like accepting why i might be wrong on a trade for example like that's very helpful to me but that's all specific so it might be relevant might not be relevant to you but i can suggest that that book is really really really really really helpful and um and i and i think that a lot of people have found that book incredibly uh useful as well uh opa simpson says great stream sir could you look at chc we just did so i'm guessing i'm guessing this is just a little bit of a later one but if you want to look at it again again we can we can check it out i guess uh kenan brynn says i remember tezos yeah tezos looked pretty strong long term can you look at it uh long term as dead as it looks happy that else is feeling better me too man xtz usd let's see we have here god damn it not the dishes again um let's see you will not be able to do anything because you are a woman um and sorry let me explain that the reason why you wouldn't be able to do that is because you're weak and well i am strong and you would not be able to hurt me and that's how i talk to my girlfriend when she threatens me any comments just kidding guys it's the way that we joke around that's all that's okay whoa she's like throwing at me now okay all right so maybe i take that back uh instantly regret saying instantly red saying that all right let's see what we've got going on over here uh tesla's um nope i still i still do like it long term i still like a long term i mean you still you still see a long-term uptrend here going back from 2019 for all the data that we do have uh short term however i imagine it's with the rest of the market short term sideways and down i wouldn't be surprised to see it make another stab towards like 340 345 region and probably trying to bounce from there so long term i do like it yes short term short term very similar to other things a little bit of sideways a little bit of downside um so it depends what time frame that you're looking at here you didn't you get you said long term i actually still like it long term yes let's see what else do we got baby what else do we got god okay seriously those  forks are goddamn annoying what [Music] i don't hate woman i love women all right there we go uh thanks for that alex but uh feel free to leave a message man uh okay there we go there's the message can you please take a look at maddox sure uh i don't remember the specific ticket for this but i i figure if i just type in matic it'll plop on up there matic versus tether yeah by nance we can check this one out uh short term a little bit of downside daily a little bit of downside i'd be looking for a short-term bounce at around 33 and a half cent uh probably continuation lower though uh daily target after a little bit of a bounce likely going to be down to about 28 and a half cent uh long term though i don't hate it uh yeah long term i'd be looking for continuation you know these are very similar to bitcoin here short-term medium term a little bit of sideways a little bit of downside long-term i'm still looking for a continuation here i wouldn't be surprised to see this one make new all-time highs uh sometime in the next month actually similar to bitcoin um maybe the next couple weeks what's up yosek i see over there how you doing man uh mark thai says h-v-h sorry h-y-l-n uh please mr crown this technology truck sales company uh okay all right h-y-l-n is that is that popular now it is h-y-l-n hillian okay uh what the hey man i think you're i think your trucks have an issue uh this is not good this is not good at all trades on seatbelts so it can't be like too shitty but uh but the truck would say otherwise yeah pretty pretty damn bad here uh long term i'd look for the downtrend to continue does it have short-term rallies in between there uh perhaps yes perhaps you know short term back up to like 15 and a half bucks but uh long term i'd love for attenuation to the downside here more importantly um maybe maybe look for some bottoming action somewhere around like 10 and a half to 11 bucks uh yeah i i don't like this one man no not at all uh short term probably does play a bit more of a bounce so however uh infinity ambiance is nearly 90 000 usd tied to neo usd uh short midterm um is that your position you have nearly 90 000 usd or is that like uh or is that like uh i read this on twitter there's nearly 90 000 units like man that's neo sounds like it's then i'm guessing i'm guessing that's maybe your position very respectable uh let's see neo usd short term medium term man i've been people even trade this thing still uh short term downside uh medium term i'd be looking at it daily here downside uh i'd be looking for some potential bottoming action somewhere around 35 and a half bucks uh weeklies okay maybe i don't i don't really favor this one uh i i don't i don't favor this one in the plot hello are you why are you giving me the mean look sir yeah i am saving that for later could you not throw it away actually um anyways uh okay so now that now that she's gone alright so her um let's see uh we do have i mean do we have anything that's oh you oh you heard that okay well i meant someone else uh all right so now that we can move on from that i would be looking for a little bit a little bit of short-term downside a little bit a little bit of medium-term downside but i do think you know long term is it likely to join the rest of the market yes it is likely to join the rest of the market um whoa hey look at this i found a shirt thank you for handing that to me um anyways uh you know long term does this one deserve respect in the plethora of coins uh out there no i don't think so it's not relatively strong maybe not necessarily relatively weak as well but it's relatively on the medium side as far as that goes kind of like the goldilocks of coins uh here long term does it continue to the upside probably uh short term medium term do we have some downside also probably yes i'd be somewhat bullish again back above about forty four and a half bucks so uh so i'd still be waiting for that short term i must be i'll i'll be looking for a little bit of downside momentum also just pointed down across the board here uh daily i think weekly as well yeah weekly weekly is kind of flip-flopping around there actually doesn't even like to stay above that region pretty much ever in its history as you can see just one small stint here in august september of 2020. all right uh thanks for that mr rubio but um do you have a do you have a a message there let's see uh harmony one okay what the is harmony one all right uh harmony what the is this thing harmony one one us oh this is gonna be real good real good uh toffee as short term short term and medium term downside i'd be looking i'd be looking for a move down to like five uh five and three quarters somewhere down around here maybe maybe even continuation possible lower as well big volume climax on the high yesterday i i think you've seen the highs for a little bit of time this is going to be accompanied very likely by bearish evidence um if today if you see today's closure below yesterday's low extremely likely you're going to see a big big big big pullback down to about just below five cents at the very least and maybe even lower than that but i i'd wait for today's closure uh long term is it okay it could be okay long term i mean this thing this thing is you know would be relatively strong like juxtaposed this against uh let's say what was that was that last little coin that we just looked at neo right well neo is is nowhere near making its uh you know making uh making new all-time highs this one's this one's obviously in blue sky breakout territory so it does deserve a little more respect it is certainly on the relatively strong side of the equation here but short-term medium term i do think that it comes down alongside most other things too uh let's see uh vk says bitcoin daily rsi triangle actionable if breakout um okay so you're looking at a daily you're looking at daily r sign you're and you're looking at a triangle there okay first things first do we actually have a triangle on the daily rsi i'd say no we don't i'm guessing you're doing something like this i'm guessing you're doing something like this uh you're probably you're probably going like this okay fair enough and then you're going something like this right well could that work as a triangle it could it could work as a triangle but you usually want to see your extremes first on the top side of the trend or sorry on the side of the trend so in this case that would be the top and that would mean that you'd want to see this actually be the first one so maybe you're pulling it back from here but that actually wouldn't work so that's your 42 000 high yes that's not that's not the same sort of drive right here so i'd have to respectfully disagree with that to begin with um i'd i'd have to respectfully disagree with that i i don't think that there is one in here what i do look here or sorry what i would be looking for is actually hidden bullsh diverting is to denote the next major local low and that would actually naturally break your triangle to the downside so you'd literally be getting short as it likely does bounce uh which is probably probably not what you want to do i'm guessing so fair enough on that one i i i wouldn't look at it as such to put it bluntly i i wouldn't look at it as such um stay hairy and fluffy my friend hairy and fluffy as man harry and fluffy as that's what you could say all right what else we got dan henderson what's up dan uh crowns are hello dancer uh and this nasdaq alright we got some real stocks here and this okay what what could this be microvision all right on nasdaq uh yep bouncy bounce time and this is kind of what i'm talking about uh right here hidden bullshever is coming off the low i'll be looking for this one to continue the bounce overall next targeted region would be about 21 21 and a quarter uh long term would i be looking for continuation you're goddamn right i would uh this is a clear changing behavior right here long term now to be fair what the is going on away the help uh obviously obviously something happened here like we we had we had a major fundamental shift but this is generational volume this is uh this this is changing behavior volume so you know the reversal is real getting getting back above you know critical areas as well more importantly um so short term you know do we see a little bit of downside i actually didn't give a time frame on that i don't think uh short term maybe a little bit of downside if it came back down to like 15 15 and a half sorry 15 and a half to like 15 75 i think that'd be okay doesn't really change anything for me uh long term though i'd be looking for attenuation it looks good it looks good uh and if it came it came down to like 12 and a half that actually be a gift i do believe but is this one ready to do something like that uh no lower term timeframe is looking good to me i wouldn't be surprised to see it actually continue from here in fact um okay cool all right uh okay john johnson has a really good uh question here if you could only use three indicators to trade with forever which three would you pick huh bruh um okay which which indicators would i what would be the three indicators that i'd pick first and foremost okay so this would be excluding price action because look you can trade straight up price action there are plenty people who can do that ict is a really good uh guy for that i would strongly just checking him out which would mean you need no indicators you just literally need the price action on your screen uh that's that's you know that that can definitely be done we have a couple guys in the discord who are definitely on that uh penav to give him a shout out he's really good with that and uh and and there's definitely a lot of validity to it so technically speaking do you need any indicators no you don't but if i personally had to three or pick three indicators um to uh to use for the rest of my life uh assuming that i had to use them i'd use moving averages i just have the most experience with that so i feel the most comfortable with it i can do a lot with that um i'd probably pick stokes and i'd probably pick rsi maybe i'd include volatility in there if i'm trading options but if i'm just trading spot price action which is which i'm guessing you're probably uh you're you know you're probably uh talking about then uh then it'd be that you know those three if i was trading options and it'd have to be something volatility-based as well i don't know maybe maybe throw some trolling bands in there maybe uh maybe may you know maybe come up with some sort of um maybe come up with some sort of indicator that essentially plots like momentum versus versus volatility so you can kind of come up with that if i was trading options but it depends what i'm trading first uh so for myself you know it'd be probably it'd probably be uh moving averages rsi and stokes i just have the most experience with those i'm not saying that they're the best indicators of all time you know if i was going to go back and learn indicators right now and knowing what i know instead of learning the rsi i actually go and learn the dmi i think the dmi has more potential here it's just i don't have as much experience with that i have you know more than 10 experience 10 years of experience with rsi versus like i don't know three or four with with uh with with adxdmi but i do think that there's more potential with adxdmi to do and if i could go back in time would i would i learn the macd more no probably not i do like the macd though the more and more that i look at it however anyways uh octay uh baba yev says sir cake usd on binance please i love cake man i  love cake i love chocolate cake i love anything that's chocolate actually so let's see you don't give a about that though let's talk about some goddamn cake over here cake cake token for holy we have a winner we have a winner for shittiest chart of the day award shittiest chart of the day award goes to cake us dollar on finance where do you what do you get for your award you get listed in the shitcoin jail of march 16th in the year 2021 yeah worst chart that we've seen all day in fact um so while everything else is bound is is continuing on to either uh prowl time highs or making new ultimates this thing is re-testing for all-time lows in fact this thing's never even known what a rally is to be fair you see a clear downtrend over a long period of time you could probably even plot in some sort of ascending triangle in here i wouldn't be surprised to see this one uh continue on to the downside long term that this this is this is very very concerning here does it bounce off this level first and foremost yeah probably another bounce off this level does it does it gets sold back into around 11 11 and a half bucks probably yes does it continue downside long term also probably yes i don't like it very very bad very very like in a more sincere tone i mean this this is very problematic here this is a this is the chart this is by definition a chart you know compare that with a lot of the other charts that we've seen today um it's it's not even in the same category very bad very very concerning when you see something like that uh not joining the rest of the market especially when pretty much everything in their mother is allowed to rally that's really a bad sign a lombardi says uh dpw on arca nice that's actually where i used to work uh dpw okay dpw on arca right here and you said got this around 130 based on weekly bottoming powder in march any uh upside targets uh obvious to you on this ridiculous chart oh baby man you killed it oh wait hold on hold on hold on no hold on maybe you don't kill it let's see did you kill it uh yeah you did it you did wait hold on um yeah you did yeah you did really really well here man uh extremely well done extremely well don't see you bought in somewhere right around here you got you you got into this rally a little bit uh but is this one problematic long term look man whenever you see something like this i don't know maybe they had some sort of like a rev uh you know some sort of a splitter reverse split but uh do i think that it continues to the upside though it probably does yes i mean you do see a slew of higher lows here you have a very obvious area to be kind of managing things off of but you really have to be holding on to this as your last sort of higher low if you want to if you want to play the trend here and that would be right around three bucks so a very easy way to kind of manage below three bucks of course um where to be targeting towards i mean you're i mean like you're all your natural target on something like this if you are looking for the reversal is going to be right here if you are looking for the actual breakout play well you're probably playing this as a re-accumulation and in that case it's probably going to be somewhere you're just kind of visualizing it somewhere somewhere back around here at about 90 bucks but look man when this thing goes from  he okay here's a real chart first and foremost this is your real chart this is this is like not a good sign you know just like that cake chart that we looked at it's like any time you see something like this man it's look it just goes down it just goes down very very bad chart long term extremely bad chart long term i don't know the underlying dynamics of what's going on in this one like i don't i'm sure there's like some sort of story some sort of history obviously but uh you know i would i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't look for i wouldn't look for this one to like have some sort of generational pull through uh change because it just has never done that for it the entirety of its history going all the way back to 1997. look if it's been if if if it's been a  coin chart since 1997 there's no reason to believe that it's changing around right here right now could it do it yes would prove that it's actually doing it well first and foremost this level right here at about 11 and 11 and 75 if that if that condition was to be met yeah you can look for a move to about 50 bucks maybe extend that 100 bucks over time but uh i'm just i mean you do see a bit of change of behavior down here yes how much do i trust it i just don't trust someone that does this man that's obviously something else is going on there some someone knows something that everyone else now knows too and that is red dildo party has begun uh looks pretty bad man uh but you know short term medium term doesn't have another try to the upside yeah i suppose i could be on that same side using three bucks as a bit of a pivot there for uh for changing my bias on that when i i suppose um crowd remember the time you did 60 minute not a 69 minute uh bitcoin ta let's go i mean we can check it out man it's basically an hourly so probably could be too much different than an hour but uh where's my time frames here i guess i probably still have it on here there we go 69 minutes uh looks looks down looks a little bit of downside here resting on the 377 but we've already we've already kind of bounced off this and testing this one uh plenty of times i mean you see this bounce over here for about a thousand bucks or yeah about a thousand bucks a base going like an hourly signal uh in hidden bearish divergence population on the other side and not the best not the best uh but there you go man there you go jazz mazu says uh cya coin yeah cya coin was was shown up on the uh on the top 10 gainer uh list right there today let's see what this one's up to again a very very uh long running coin here so i'm curious to see how this one's done versus us dollar um yeah this one's pulling through as well so you know again in the context of the general market you know this one this one's kind of following through in like the secondary category so i guess it's like in the middle of the pack so to speak do you have a weekly golden cross going on yes good we have a lot of history here technically speaking higher lows on the macro good um and i would be looking for this this run to actually continue up towards uh just under three cents and f and find the next major pullback somewhere around about three cents maybe a little yeah a little bit under three cents perhaps uh but uh but i do i do actually do favorite um long term uh uh what about what about like a daily dailies continuation right here i actually favor this one uh medium term as well and what about short term uh shorts are my favorite as well yeah you have breakout volume right here bullish on all time frames very likely to continue uh actually one of one of one of the more easy ones today uh jr says uh some sort of a stock yes it is arca imma imagine imagine i've never seen this one i've never seen this one uh yep a little bit man what the is up with people finding these charts is this is this okay yeah that is your chrono device dump time um okay so this is actually a very interesting one to me because long term obviously it is down and this would be where you'd expect things to like kind of turn around if it was to continue the long term downtrend so what does that mean well let's first go to a monthly just to see where it's kind of postured right now okay yeah yeah i i i would be looking for some toppy behavior anywhere between about six and a quarter to sevenish region um you know does this one come back down ultimately i you know i i think it kind of rides a general strength in the market you know short term does have a little bit of downside yes but what uh you're looking at daily yeah short term i'll be looking for another move back down to like four bucks even long term i'd actually be looking for another try to the upside somewhere around that next sort of major area that's going to be just around six bucks just around six bucks you said lac as well okay let's see we got here l8 symbol lic lithium america's corporation all right it's trades on your stock change um long term up again hey we have a good hey we have a good stock chart hey nice one all right sweet that's cool uh weekly i'd be looking forward to probably retest back back above about 20 bucks region or so uh daily um daily same thing uh yeah daily actually actually good here as well short term probably probably back up towards like 19 bucks or so um so overall overall okay i i mean again just just like ones that only go down this one only goes up so i don't really have any reason to change my opinion on this one for the time being at least as long as you have that information but uh for now i'd i'd be looking for medium term uh upside there and then maybe a little bit of drama right around that uh i don't know 22 and a half to 23 dollar marker but first things first you know look for those targets and then come back to it all right um let's see all right uh natalie edwards says oh it's a lady hey crown i've been watching you since 2017-2018 and i'm sorry everyone act cool all right i don't want to scare away the girls sorry natalie natalie white okay natalie has a avatar of a guy oh this is 2021 after all so elsa says i'm a creep you wanna you wanna you wanna you wanna come over here and give daddy a little smack on the lips elsa she really likes that i am thirsty this is the wrong time to be talking about that and natalie uh check out cardani usd on binance four hour daily all right all jokes aside let's uh let's get ser let's get respectful and serious on this one i don't want to be disrespectful to natalie over here uh four hour daily okay uh a little bit of short-term downside four hour i mean we did hit our target from yesterday right that was just around one buck i'd probably be looking for this one to try a bounce here short term but is this the long term bounce that you're looking for i i don't believe so no no i i don't believe so i do think that this one ultimately will come will come further down so short term four hour probably does bounce back up how high does that bounce get i mean you have your downtrend coming in anywhere around about a buck ten um and then i'd be looking for you know you know any sort of a lower high signature right around there i'll be looking for that to get sold into and then probably does get marked down a little bit long term i'm not bearish on this one though i'm not bearing anything that's making new all-time highs i wouldn't be surprised to see it come down a little bit more though towards about nine 90 cents maybe a little bit below 90 cents and then try and then try a low structure there uh but for you know long-term still good i don't have any major so it's this one short term well short term probably does try to bounce uh medium term mean term a little bit a little bit of downside here uh a7a7 says oh man that is hey that's actually a really clever way of doing that a7 a7 ubt um unibrite all right ubt all right unibrow oh this okay i got excited it's pro shares no it's unibrite the cryptocurrency on bittrex and hitbtc two debt exchanges that i even know that they're still kind of rocking and rolling to be honest with you uh actually okay here uh actually okay getting re-accumulated right now uh i'd be looking for daley to try back up uh maybe let's see what the weekly looks like for now maybe the next couple weeks back up to like what is this uh what is this level here about about a buck 30 sorry buck 35 to a buck 40ish region um above a buck 60 i'm sorry bug above a buck 55 i'd actually be looking for continuation in new orleans though uh okay okay chart you know obvious obviously or sorry obvious accumulation over here and then just getting marked up so i you know i favored the uptrend i respect the trend on this one and i'd be looking forward to essentially continue um you know maybe maybe short-termed a little bit of downside yeah short term could easily easily have another uh move back down to like 112 but ultimately i i would favor this one to the upside um more medium and long term apha a short medium term for than a four hour okay so uh well fair enough okay hey we got a stock nice one uh short term uh four hour yep i'll be looking i'd be favoring the upside here i'd be looking for a move back up to about 25 and a half 20 uh 25 and three quarters um you didn't ask for a long term but i'll give you my stupid opinion on long term anyways continuation of new all-time highs actually this is very good on the daily uh hidden versus on this side this is kind of was talking about earlier at the beginning of the stream you have your bearish evidence on this side gets resolved by hitting evidence that's your continuation signal right there um i'd be looking for this one to not just test like 20 what was it basically like 26 bucks i'd be looking for this one to like re-test probably highs and maybe make me optimize um okay all right what else do we got baby what else do we got john johnson says does bitcoin volatility have to signal uh significantly reduce uh before a true institutional adoption happens and do you think it will um that's kind of like a chick in the in the egg question right it's uh what's going to decrease the volatility is essentially a function of like how many people are involved in the market because it's essentially just going to build up the or sorry uh thicken the order books which is going to make it so that you know price actually has just less less whippy whippy whappy action to put it in like colloquial terms i guess um so would i say that that requires institutional adoption it requires aid option doesn't need to be from institutions it could be for i mean a billion bucks is a billion bucks now who's more likely to have a billion bucks an institution yes so it you know is is is is it does it need to happen that way no is it likely to happen that way yeah and practically in practical terms yes um so yeah uh you know you just you you you just want those order books to get a little more thick because i mean right now like you look at um i don't know by bit for example or or or anyone any one of these uh 100x markets and uh and you'll notice that like the you know the bid and the ask are barely like they're barely related to each other and more importantly there's barely any size there and it's like if you're really looking to unload you know let's say like 10 bitcoin you can you know you can if you market that you're probably gonna have like i don't know 20 to 50 slippage which is kind of big um to be fair anyways dan says magical unicorns please a uni usd okay all right this is elsa's coin right here there's a unicorn coin by the way in case you didn't know yeah it's a unicorn so is that do you like that better than the ethereum now all right all right okay fair enough short term down to be looking for this one to test back down to like 26 and a quarter 26 and a half uh yeah no time frame involved in this one uh short short term down maybe even extend that down to like 23 and a half uh but first things first i'd look for that short term down bounce around there and then and then reassess after that uh then grt man people this this one keeps on popping up it's uh often uh grossens or the graph yeah the graph that's right the graph hippie c bittrex goddamn short term down short uh short term down i'd be looking for this one to pop back down to like 145 region this one is putting a bit of a descending triangle with the highs which actually can be reversal formation um but first things first i'd give it a chance to bounce off that level uh back above uh two bucks in about 10 cents i'd be bullish on this one and just based off the general market i'd probably be favoring the upside long term so short term a little bit of downside give it a chance to bounce there and then come back to it after that um is is is kind of what i'll be looking at uh let's see okay so actually you just got through everything and we're we're an hour and 20 minutes in this nice that's actually perfect uh perfect timing because it is almost my scheduled gym time it's funny actually nowadays in finland i actually have to schedule in my gym time because there cannot be more than 10 people in the gym at one singular time otherwise uh someone will definitely die um i also think that's funny that's disgusting you think death is disgusting you think that's funny anyways um some nifty analysis all right we'll look at nifty this is gonna be the last of the last one hey is that is that is that satan right there is that satan um i have longed rip nip ripped oh jesus a ripple um where where is nifty what do you say did you say is that yeah that's uh loose for satan at least for a second yeah from twitch um nifty i'd actually uh this this is continuation right here to me uh this continuation i'd be looking for this one to retest the highs at like 15 400 and probably continue uh i actually like this one actually like this one quite a fair bit you're even having a bullish reset here on adxdmi and price action is just an uptrend i mean that's actually pretty damn good um long term all right long drip nip all right we'll we'll take a quick look at uh at ripple for mrs elizabeth or miss elizabeth who knows um let's see uh where is it uh ripple usd actually versus usc looks good here i'd be i'd be looking for i'd be looking for a nice up uh up move towards 62 63 cents actually uh based off the weekly what about the daily yeah daily looks good yeah i'd be looking for tuition 63 to 64 cents region um versus bitcoin downtrend all right um are we done okay not today say not today satan all right so let's uh let's wrap this  up gonna be a short one today actually so good on that one okay uh falling from this today's short-term time frame analysis we did see the 50 000 level broken which did initiate that first target to 55 000 bucks right here bouncing up and gets sold into about a thousand fifteen hundred bucks higher than that and that is continuation very much applied to our next downside target somewhere around about fifty one thousand fifty one and a half thousand bucks to fifty two thousand bucks uh which i do think that we're kind of looking at in motion right now we still all lower term time for momentum so still pointed southwards four round stokes right here three hour stokes right here by early stokes right here and hourly stokes flip-flopping a bit to the upside but still following a downtrend as you can see in the short-term timeframe so i'd be looking for maybe one more one more drive to the downside and very likely a bounce somewhere within this blue box territory and bounce targets could be anywhere up to about 55 000 bucks however here's the thing i cannot be short-term bullish on bitcoin uh you know essentially looking for continuation of trend here to those deeper six thousand targets which actually i am still looking at over the next probably like two weeks to a month um until bitcoin gets back above the two spot six one eight extension which is also synonymous with that fifty thousand dollar level to the upside and still the same levels that were relevant to the downside will be relevant to the upside at least in the way that i look at things so fifty five thousand bucks uh still does matter right here and then fifty eight thousand bucks right here so short term medium term essentially and i would still be like i said  on the long term uh make no mistake about it the bi-weekly and the weekly all higher term timeframes still very much bullish here i abs i really like this chart in fact uh i would not be surprised to see new all-time highs uh in the next two to four weeks essentially uh just based off this right here you know we could see that this week this uh this section is a bit of a consolidation then tries you know over the next two weeks so that would be you know still i don't know within the next three four weeks but overall i do still favor the upside long term short term medium term though sideways and downside implied uh fifty one and a half thousand fifty two thousand bucks look for a bounce there at least at least in the way that i look at things of course it's not finished fast i'm not a finished advisor blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that also does imply well i'm not necessarily looking for it at least on first pass if bitcoin does break below the 51.5 000 level right here on a two hour or four hour dildo i would look for extension to the next major level right around about 48 000 bucks uh that's where i'd be looking for another major major major major major low but for right now a little bit about actually a little bit of bouncy bounce on the extremely short term time sleep with the hour it looks like uh back up to the 10th simple i don't know just try to put in a low right here i probably wouldn't be on the same side of that just yet we do have some regular bullish divergence however which could be playing out right now yep credit to caretaker on this one one two three and we that would have a natural target right around about fifty five thousand five hundred dish region but still does that get does that actually close above fifty five thousand bucks on a four hour as long as that condition's not met i'm just i'm i'm still looking for a little bit more downside and then try a bit of a low you see that all lower trim time from uh time frame momentum monsters are still essentially angled to the downside in our medium term timeframes like a 12-hour daily uh while they are while they're starting to show a little bit of bottoming action here i would still give it some time i don't think that there's any like major rush into position at least for myself of course it's not finished i'm not a french advisor i'm a financial derper and in this case uh we are starting to potentially potentially show a little bit of hidden bullish divergence potential on the 12 hour still not there on the daily so i i really would like to see that before potentially calling uh for a you know the next like confirmed low so to speak um but it it is in play and of course above fifty thousand bucks i would certainly get very bullish again but fifty five thousand bucks i'd be a short-term bullish we could call it uh but for now i do favor short-term downside medium term and long-term a little bit of bonding action and uh and and long-term obviously continuation of the upside still looking at about a 69 000 target with a stop along the way at about 66 i think it was maybe 65 000 bucks whatever whatever extensions are coming out right here let's see yep that would be about 69 000 bucks um at the three spot six uh 618 there so fair enough on that one anyway it's been an absolute pleasure i want to say massive thank you once again i know that there's a lot of jokes today hopefully didn't offend anyone too much i understand just having a good time here just having a silly goose time because well that's the way that you should be on a tuesday on this on this middle of march it also says i hate women i would never hate woman i only hate uh i only hate well i don't there's no there's no really pointed like hating all right anyways besides this philosophical topics let's get on with it and i want to wish you well once again um uh do i want to talk about sale uh you already know that you know you know about the sale 20 off on all programs make sure to watch the videos make sure that's applicable to you know they're not match pills yes it will take a ton of work on your behalf but yes at the end of the day you can do it and we have seen a lot you know a lot of a lot of really cool stories um especially over the last couple years which uh which make me really really really really really really really happy for other people um and so i do want to offer that up to you as well if you are the type of person who's so interested in things anyways with that said wish you well once again take care i salute you and", "lW1Qw8_Rc9A": "uh an update for you on nanox today i watched the oppenheimer nanox presentation earlier this morning so i wanted to share with you what uh mr polyakin their ceo had to say and my take on it all right the first thing rand did was just give an overview of the company just quickly the nanox is trying to meet a need in areas where medical imaging capability is underserved they have a new tube that they have developed an x-ray tube that makes this much cheaper and they're putting that into this nanox arc which is sort of like a ct scan but actually much different and they're using a business model to disrupt the way that medical imaging goes he touched upon their progress since their ipo back in august of course they raised 190 million dollars back then through that in september they signed some agreements with a company in mexico to deploy in mexico and guatemala these units uh again pending uh regulatory approval uh october they made a deal with ambra health to enable image access in the united states that is on the i.t end in december of course at rsna they demonstrated their product i did a video about that the images were less than i expected initially but my really my further thought press says that this is a company that is a work in progress and so will allow them to have some images that are not quite up to par for what most radiologists are going to want to read right now in january they made a deal with usa rad to provide a second opinion of course the head of usa rad was one of those radiologists at the rsna demonstration in israel he's closely associated with his company you'll see him on some of the videos on nanak's website so that was seemed like a natural extension that they would make a deal with usa rad for that in january they made some leadership additions uh to their company and then in february uh they did complete a secondary offering that was not money that went to nanox there were some early on investors uh who wanted to sell their shares and essentially those got converted over to institutional investors buying up the shares so just a change of hands but no additional money went to nanox he talked about their tube their nanox tube and what makes that innovative and really kind of revolutionary in medical imaging i'm not going to talk about that today because i've covered that on previous videos so you can watch those he also talked about their nanox arc this is what they will deploy those x-ray tubes in this little arc here will fit five to up to 11 i've seen tubes within this it's not going to be as good as a ct scanner but it can produce images near that quality using some computer work he touched upon their rsna demonstration of course at that demonstration that he took a picture of his hand that they then compared to william renkin's wife's hand a kind of a classic picture in radiology he talked about the 2d images versus 3d images there's our tomosynthesis images what they're producing now and quite honestly in my opinion radiologists are not going to want to read tomosynthesis images of a chest all right on to the new stuff so uh the nanox arc is in production uh so he has some pictures of it in production so that confirms the previous picture that i put out from twitter that somebody had sent out uh showing at least one of these in production now we see at least multiple he said they're doing a thousand a thousand of these now they're going to put them together in a factory in israel because of the pandemic it's a little difficult to get to other countries you know the people who go to travel have to be in quarantine so getting there to see this these uh things in production is difficult so they're having all the parts shipped in to israel and and building them in a factory there now we're looking again at a thousand of these being produced uh he said 900 of them are going to be shipped around the world for actual use and it sounded like the other 100 were going to be more for regulatory clearance all right i said we'd touch upon the medical screening as a service model this is a different way of doing business in the radiology world essentially the places who acquire these imaging devices will not need to put up the capital expenditure nanox will be providing the capital to fund these devices in place in turn the centers will agree to a minimum number of scans currently that's going to be seven and nanox is expecting that they'll do twenty now he did talk about the total fee being forty dollars for this nanox will be getting 14 of that and uh that forty dollars is supposed to include the radiologist fee for reading the images that is a bargain for medical imaging he touched upon their nanox cloud i don't see this so much as anything more than what's already being done essentially the imaging devices will not be in the same location as the radiologist those images will go over the internet to where radiologists will read them and send them back a report i do that every day all right what everyone really wants to know about is regulatory clearance when is that going to happen okay just to recap they submitted their initial 510k clearance in january of 2020. of course that goes to a third-party reviewer if you're not familiar with that process watch one of my previous videos and i explain that that took a long time to get through but at the end of 2020 the third party reviewer was recommending that the device be cleared that then goes on to the fda who makes the final decision the fda asked for more information in january and the company has provided that information on march 2nd so we're still waiting for the clearance but in the question and answer session mr poliaking felt like they had completely answered all of the questions to a very professional level and he expects the device to be cleared when that will happen is really not known coven 19 really has caused a wrench in the works for fda clearances and nanox is not the only company that is suffering from this i know that there were people who are concerned that this process was taking so long when usually in the past it has gone through much quicker but other companies are dealing with this as well indra was one that i've done a video on they're dealing with delays and uh even the one that i did a video on yesterday transmedics uh has had some issues trying to get fda uh approvals and and committee meetings done etc now he did talk about um that the multi-source device the 510k clearance application has not even been submitted yet still he expected though that once that does get submitted that they would have clearance within four months after the submission they're still waiting on this single source fda clearance he touched upon the contracts that they already have now many of these are done deals of course pending regulatory clearance but but these are firm contracts so in australia new zealand norway brazil mexico guatemala italy russia south africa taiwan singapore spain and belarus pending clearance these are done deals to put these units in there so they already have 550 of those units where they have signed contracts of course they're only making a thousand initially right now so you can see they're still going to have to ramp up they have less than set in stone agreements for the united states korea and vietnam finally before the question and answer session he just talked about what the 2021 outlook looks like they're really concentrating on trying to ramp up so that when they have clearance they are ready to get these devices shipped and that includes building out the supply chain that includes still getting regulatory approvals that includes infrastructure that includes training so that the clients who will be using these devices will understand how to use them and be ready to go that includes developing new pipelines and expanding partnership network and essentially all he said on that is we're talking to everybody in the business i've already covered much of what was discussed in the question and answer session one additional thing that i haven't talked about is the factory that they're building in korea he said that they've put 40 million dollars into this to acquire the land and develop clean rooms and the equipment to procure the equipment and that factory is being built now he expects it to be done in november of 2021 he talked about they already do have capacity for thousands of units in japan but the need for much higher capacity uh you know we already showed that they have 5 000 contract units he expects that as this device gains in popularity that they're going to need far more far more and so they're ramping up uh to be able to meet that demand all right that's it for nanox what did we get out of it we know that fda clearance is still pending we know that they're ramping up we've actually seen more units now in production love to continue to see more of those and we know that they have a factory going uh being built in korea that can be able to supply uh demand for the parts uh for their nanox arc i'm still excited about it i'm still on board with it i still think though ultimately their cash cow is going to be their x-ray tube at least initially if they will license that tube they can make a killing all right that's it if you enjoyed the video please give us a thumbs up and we'd love to have you

around to doing it I'm going to show you how to make a homemade essential oil diffuser that will diffuse for over 12 hours and has the potential to diffuse a high volume of oil if desired these are the parts I used a mason jar an ultrasonic fog maker a small 12-volt PC fan some basic mounting hardware and a bunch of straws the mason jar used was about one quart though you could easily use a small one if that's preferred the important thing to make sure is that it has a wide mouth to accommodate mounting everything onto the lid the PC fan I used was a basic 12 volt 25 millimeter fan that was originally sold as a cooling fan for 3d printers you can see the specs for the fan here and note that it doesn't have a third wire for rpm feedback and that's not necessary the fan will either be on or off the mounting hardware should be long threaded studs or screws that will fit in the PC fan mounting holes and extend below the lid I'll explain why later the ultrasonic fog maker uses 24 volts and outputs about 400 milliliters per hour the output of the diffuser won't be quite that high as some of that fog will condense in the mason jar you'll notice that the cord has a rubber stopper attached to it and that will help seal the fog maker inside the mason jar you'll also notice it has a sensor for the water level which automatically turns off the fog maker when the water level gets too low these are very important features another thing to note is that the output of the power supply is 24 volts and the PC fan runs on 12 volts and I'll explain how to overcome this later all right time to start constructing this thing I started by letting out the components on the mason jar lid and marking their location I put the PC fan on the opposite side of the lid from the Holidazzle hole to try and maximize the air flow inside the mason jar I also made the hole for the fog maker cord near the PC fan since the PC fan will be tapping off the fog maker for power I marked the location of each component with a permanent ink marker and didn't worry that much about trying to be precise the next thing to do was to drill the holes in the lid I started by drilling the hole for the rubber stopper then the outlet nozzle and finally the mounting holes for the PC fan since I didn't have a drill big enough for the rubber stopper I had to enlarge the hole using a dremel with the stopper hole completed I test fitted the stopper in the lid to make sure I didn't make the hole too big next I drilled where the PC fan would be mounted and enlarged that hole with the dremel again [Music] with all the holes drilled the PC fan I could now test fit the fan to the mason jar lid as well next thing to do is to cut off the connector for the PC fan split the wires apart and strip the ends of each wire after that was done I zip-tied the PC fan to the fog maker wire and adjusted the wire links so the fan would sit neatly on the lid to tap off the fog maker power the insulation needs to be shaved off so we can attach the wires for the PC fan I use a sharp hobby knife to slowly shave off the insulation to expose the internal wires I then separated the wires from each other and shaved off the insulation of each wire to reveal the bare copper wire inside I then wrap the red or positive wire of the PC fan around the positive wire for the fog maker with this setup I'll show you how I adapted the 24 volt output for the fog maker to the 12 volts needed for the PC fan I used a potentiometer also known as a variable resistor in series with the PC fan in order to find out what resistance was needed to limit the voltage across the PC fan essentially I used a voltage divider to create two voltage drops across the positive and negative fires on the fog maker the first voltage drop is the 12 volts for the PC fan the second voltage drop is across the potential meter since I started the potentiometers added some maximum resistance of 5 kilo ohms there was essentially no voltage drop across the PC fan as you can see here and as I lowered the resistance on the potential meter the voltage drop across the PC fan went up until it first reached a voltage high enough to start spinning the fan and then I continued to lower the resistance until the voltage drop across the PC fan got to 12 volts once the resistance of the potential meter was properly set I unplugged the fog machine and disconnected the potential meter from the circuit then without messing with the potential meter setting I measure the resistance and read just a little under 300 ohms add a quarter watt a 300 ohm resistor on hand and since increasing the resistance slightly would only lower the voltage across the PC fan slightly I knew I wouldn't cause the voltage across the PC fan to be too high I installed the 300 ohm resistor into the circuit and double check that the voltage drop across the fan was sufficient it was a little below 12 volts but the fans still spawned plenty fast so I decided that was okay this is the final circuit it's simple enough that you could easily just electrical tape all the components without soldering anything but I do have a soldering iron so I soldered everything together and wrapped it in electrical tape make sure the way you wrap the electrical tape isolates each electrical connection from each other so that there are no short circuits finally I trimmed the zip tie and mounted the PC fan to the mason jar lid i mounted the PC fan so that the excess length from the threaded studs extended below the mason jar lid the extra length in the studs is to mount and hair straightener below to PC fan [Music] since the fan creates a rotating airflow the outlet of the fan tends to send airflow outward instead of downward this will create excess turbulence and not allow much of any flow out of the nozzle for the diffuser the air straightener will correct this by during an airflow downward to the water stirring up the fog and sending it out the nozzle to make the air straightener I cut about one-inch long lengths from the straws you'll need about 15 or so of these you can bunch them together and tape them with something that will withstand getting wet electrical tape actually works pretty well for this here you can see the assembled air strainer and here you can see a mounted PC fan by putting the excess length from the studs through the straw and fascinating the air strainer with a nut it's also a good idea to put a bead of hot glue between the air strainer and the mason jar lid to make sure all the air gets directed through the straws if you don't have long screws to mount the PC fan you can use a few post and screw combos like this one to mount the hair straightener to the mason jar lid that'll let nozzle was cut from a thick plastic tubing I used the lengths between one and one and a half inches which seemed to work pretty well the hole in the mason jar lid should be just slightly smaller than the diameter of the tube so that the tube can be screwed into the lid like this next is something that wasn't necessary but helps if you have a mason jar with a domed bottom like mine I made a holder out of some thick copper wire to hold the fog maker upright and slightly offset from the center of the mason jar here you can see it holding the fog maker just slightly to the side so that the water that splashes up while making fog doesn't hit the PC fan or the outlet nozzle now to determine the position of the full line put water in the diffuser until fog production goes down oops probably helps if you plug the diffuser in let's undo that and try again this time with power applied check to see when foreign goes down and Mark a water level slightly below that with a permanent marker there's no need for a minimum level because of the auto shutoff feature on the fog maker the diffuser is almost done if you were to leave the diffuser running for a few minutes at this point you would notice that eventually that fog stops coming out of the nozzle as if it were clogged if you were to blow into the nozzle it done clogged it and fog production continues this is from condensation in the nozzle which eventually formed droplets that collect at the bottom of the nozzle and don't weigh enough to fall out of the nozzle these droplets clog the nozzle and prevent the fog from leaving the nozzle to fix this phenomenon you just have to cut an angle on the end the outlet nozzle like this now the diffuser will happily diffuse water any essential oils until the level gets too low the homemade essential oil diffuser is now complete and to speaking of essential oils it's time to add some oils to this new high volume diffuser me and my wife used Young Living Essential Oils and really enjoy them I'm a bit partial to lavender and cedar wood so I'm going to add those now you only need about 5 to 10 total drops of oil depending on how strong you want the aroma to be it also takes about 12 hours to diffuse all the water in here when it's full so take that into account when choosing how much oil to add Young Living Essential Oil is by far the highest quality essential oil brand

"WGl7agJdyCY": "hey what's going on everybody my name is mike toledo thanks for joining me on another podcast hey listen if you are a pdr tech and you watch this video and you want to see me sport some of your gear send it over to me 2120 west mission road suite 240 escondido 92029 meanwhile we have a pretty cool podcast as usual we're talking about some new tools a stretched oil can dent we're going to talk about the lca the leverage control adapter attachment and with eric patton because he is the person who created it and again joe from dent evo joe garcia that is the one and only he's not really my guest anymore he's more of a co-host so we're gonna take a deep dive into some dealer accounts again the oil can and introduce you to another tool for your slide hammer it is great so stay tuned let's get right into it all right everybody welcome welcome welcome eric patton eric patton is with dent express is that correct up in uh like the northern california area are you near san francisco or where are you at eric i'm right in between san francisco and sacramento on 80 there how far is that from san francisco like how many miles or minutes 45 miles wow about an hour and a half of traffic though yeah exactly okay yeah yeah so uh so it looks like you had a pretty cool shop back there man uh yeah i didn't even know you had a shop man yeah man two years now how do you like it how is it being a shop owner now man uh well i'm still i love it because i'm here like three to four days a week but i still get out mobile when my tech brian can't handle everything so it's it's nice to get out once in a while you know what i mean yeah i love being here man because i got everything i need right here yeah well dude that's what i like about it man i like the freedom of you know maybe a train wreck comes in right i don't have to get it done like right then and there i don't have to you know exhaust my energy all in one shot i can hey leave it for a couple days do a couple quickies in between and come back even when it gets frustrating right you know you get time to you know to relax again and gather your thoughts and jump back on it so i oh the luxuries of having a shop yeah i love when people drop it off the night before and i can get in here at like six in the morning get on it for two hours before the phone rings you know what i mean yeah yeah yeah that's right yeah you have the freedom to come in and out whatever you want uh you don't get a wild hair up your butt you can come back at night and i've done that come back at 11 o'clock at night and go man hell i'm just gonna get it done you know and yeah so i can relax and quiet yeah exactly well eric i brought you on the show and um you know you and i have been friends a while and we've been you you've had a couple tools that you've um sent over to me before but i think this one you really really knocked it out of the park and we're talking about the lca and uh we're actually well i'll bring it up here we're talking about this this tool right here and not the handle but the the attachment that goes on the dent dial and it connects the gorilla grip and it creates huge amount of leverage like i was using on this motorcycle tank right here actually i'm going to add you right here i can't even believe i did that dude so what is your thoughts on this how did you come up with this with this eric so flat bars can be uncomfortable on your hand when you're really cranking on them you know what i mean yeah they're wide and i think i think it was you had even mentioned you wish a flat bar they'd come out with a flat bar handle right yeah i think it was a long time ago so i had my buddy weld an ultra adapter onto uh just a little plate actually the plate that the uh hub sits on yeah but it just wasn't you couldn't adjust it it was one direction only and then i happened to have an extra hub sitting around and i had my buddy i was like hey man can you weld me like a right angle and then weld this hub on it he's like yeah no problem so we just kind of jerry rigged it up in the garage and that the next day is when i sent you that photo yeah and i kind of let the cat out of the bag a little bit dude no no you know i got shafted from that all over the place dude just a little quick photo of it man but here's here's here it is like here you've got a nice little attachment right there you you you basically gosh you made that dent dial like another tool you know like uh like a huge huge huge amount so what does sal think about it man because you were mentioning a little bit about it but what's his thoughts on it dude so sal posted about it the day i think the day after he got it and he said he loved it he said that it's comfortable and he said he was using it all day he uh he used it on this big smash but i don't know he gave me props gave me kudos yeah so so some of these people who never had this kind of you know a flat bar like explain how you got this set up here what what what is this right here so the top you're you're you're uh putting that up against the wall of the truck bed yep and then you're using the uh the tip and you're pulling towards you you know what i mean yeah and it it well first of all you get extra length out of the tool so you got what another 12 inches of blank on that tool yeah and then it's got nothing but power that's my favorite tool for bedsides yeah and this so the i used this particular setup for tacomas you know those oh yeah those super open rear quarter panels right those box trucks what are you using this on uh an old ford pickup 93 yeah with a super open open there's nothing to leverage off of yeah there's nothing i remember i remember back in the day just like gosh i remember like tapping where i saw the dent and just trying to see if i can get some of it to move or or what not here now i'm actually using extensions dude i'm going to show you i'm going to show you now this this this repair is actually going to be on dent trainer it's done i just got to upload it and i did a little video on like what do you call it a um look at the leverage i'm getting right here i'm just going to play it here i put it on youtube just a time lapse of it and but i'm setting it up right i'm getting the right leverage here i'm talking then once i get my leverage here i am able to just really crank and we all know that these these gas tanks these harley gas tanks you need a ton of leverage and there's my leverage right there i'm i'm actually not pulling i'm pulling but not pushing nearly as i would as hard if i was using a rod you know yeah and then we all know how how it can get really uncomfortable uh when you are doing these type of repairs and it digs into your hand this is super comfortable man boy you just thinking outside the box there eric right on yeah i don't know man it just came to me i was like oh this would be perfect i always wanted something that would rotate similar to the uh steve has the ultra the udt whatever what's you know the one looks like an ice pick yes yeah the big fender tool yeah i was just hoping for something that would rotate all the way yeah yeah exactly because well you just quickly put it up put it on now are you gonna have any attachments that go like that on on other flat bars so yeah i mean i'm trying to figure something out right now but the problem is you're gonna have to cut off your uh you know they're all plasti-dipped or they all got the handles yeah so i have to cut that off but i'm thinking of well right now you could actually drill and tap your care point bar just all you gotta do is drill one more hole and it'll fit right in there oh that's right that's right well what about let me ask you this what about what about a um an attachment for all chess what about that yeah he could just do the same thing are you have you talked to steve at all about that or not i have not i talked to him a long time ago when i made that first one but i just couldn't figure out how to use his handles because they they're actually so you know the the gorilla grip is is thin right it's not real you're talking about around the housing like you're talking yeah like i got one right here too so if i can get it focused here right how thin it is whereas the ultra comes out a little further let's see which way oh yeah i mean i see what you see so it wouldn't be centered it wouldn't be centered dead center of the the tool yeah here is i've got you got you've probably got one too as well but this is is this one of the latest ones right here is it more polished see the back side no that's so that's the first one i don't even have the new one look at we don't even have the new ones man no i don't have the new one here here's the uh here's the original one that we did in the garage yeah those welds yeah look at that welds man let's see if i can get over there yeah yeah check that out so what's this going for is this is being sold on anson right on ansible tdr the website so right now it's 69 i think 69.99 yeah but it's going to go i don't know how long they're doing that for but i know it's a sale dude i tell my students if you guys like anybody who's going to get it who has it owns a dent dial this dude you you're missing out man this is like changes it just adds it's almost like adding a two-for-one it's like this bar up man right if you have the dent dial and the gorilla grip i mean it's a no-brainer honestly it's comfortable it's more comfortable than that the you know big wide flat bar i don't know to me it's a no-brainer so let's let's let's picture this for people who are listening and people who are watching you can you can use this for what we just showed like the truck beds right you can pull it right yep so you have your attachment here right quickly jumps on there right and you can use it for the front fenders right get a huge amount of leverage see personally nothing against you sal if you're watching this but this there's almost like you don't need the 30 inch anymore because now you got you got the yeah you know the lca right but i mean not saying that it wasn't but the 22 light or 22 heavy is perfect for for this for this setup yeah it really is that's that's the one i use the most yeah yeah um now i'm i'm really impressed eric i think this is it's a home run man it's you you did a good job when you send it to me i was like oh yeah it's over like rover dude so that's funny yes everybody i sent it to likes it so they're telling me they grabbed their dentist more than they ever did not and they always use it they use it a lot anyway you know what i mean but it's just it's little no no knock on d on sal hell no we know we use it you know i've had my dental for probably seven or eight years i know i go get a tetanus shot every year dude so i'm just i'm just kidding just kidding i polish it i polish it up right that's due for a polish man do for a pause yeah mine's mods fast and fyi it is just to give you guys a shout out it is one of the best and shall we probably say no it is the best but it is one of the best flat bars i've ever used it is it is it is a dynamic flat bar that is a macgyver tool so you know the more ideas you could think about using it uh the the better it works and what a great marriage it's like your adapter or attachment marries the dent dial to the gorilla grip right and it's like it's like it's almost like a piece that was born for the dent dial in both of those you know i agree yeah i'm i mean i'm not just saying i'm i'm really happy with how it came out i i think it's great i didn't think i was talking to craig right and he was trying to picture what i was saying and i was like hey craig he probably thinks i'm a weird guy craig this is a great it's a great tool man you know i really like it you know and uh i wasn't sure if him and christina and i talked to christina too i'm sorry i'm i'm hitting both then they christina might get upset me because i it was it was both i was talking to both of them and and um they were silent for a while so i didn't know if if they were gonna you know take it and by all means you know i just thought it was a great great uh accessory man and i'm glad it's taken off for you and i know many people are going to enjoy it and feel the same way once they have it in their hands yeah i hope so i hope so i think they will too but how's it how's people responding to it right now do you have you got any feedback on that so nobody that's bought well just sal and then corey kleinfeld he got one of the prototypes he absolutely loves it he sent me a couple photos of him using it um big ant loves it who's began premium dent repair 510 oh yeah okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh but honestly other than that i don't know anyone who anyone else who has one oh grom daniel graham loves it yeah yeah so yeah well if you know daniel did he give you i'm sure he's giving you some well if you take it to the bench grinder and you could probably we actually did i bet you he did dude let me just uh loosen it you know we can find ticket to the bench grinder you know i'll i'll do this but yeah he's he's he's a great guy to get feedback yeah he gave me some good ideas for other flat bars to add it to other flat bars so yeah well it yeah if you can you know what if you can come up with more attachments like that for other flat bars i mean it is going to be a knockout win which i'm sure you you're doing you got your you know your ideas spinning and whatnot but this is a this is a hit dude it's a win yeah i appreciate it i'm happy to bring you on the show and and and really talk about it and you know it's it's a great tool no matter what part of these tools you have i'm sure if you get you know if you already have the gorilla grip like you're saying and you got the dent dial i mean there's just why even not get the the attachment here so we called it the lca right and what's that stand for leverage control adapter that's right yeah get some serious control with that so oh yeah well eric i just want to say thanks again dude for uh coming to get it let me come in give me that hammer i can re i can edit that part well eric i just want to say thanks again for coming on um i wish you the best of luck on this on this product here and uh where can they find your handle give me some handles where they can find you at uh den express pdr on instagram and then just dent express on facebook cool good deal eric stay on first a little bit but i just want to say thanks thanks everybody for listening with eric go out there and purchase that product you won't regret it talk to you guys later on that one thanks mike all right what's going on everybody we're back with another episode mr garcia joe dent evo garcia is joining me again hey welcome joe how you doing thank you mike i'm doing well man how about yourself man i can't i can't uh i can't complain man well i can but it wouldn't help let's put it that way so sometimes it helps you always have something to help something to complain about right so you can complain to a friend brother i'll listen i know you would too man that's a crazy thing man so i appreciate that man appreciate that so yeah we're gonna have a joe dent evil hotline here dude so yeah no kidding um hey what's the difference dude that's kind of like my life anyway right now yeah you're the pdr yeah pdr is like like having kids man people ask you hey does it get any better and you just say no it just gets different so you know i can see the parallels yeah so we what our topics are going to be uh this evening or day whatever time you guys are listening to this again if you are listening to this and you don't realize that this podcast is actually a videocast if you're on itunes or the podcast app you can just click on it make sure you double click on it you'll see the video pop up and you can watch what we're talking about or you can go to youtube and check that out or go to dentime dentimepdr.com and check out the video from there as well so meanwhile we're going to be talking about dealerships right like how would you engage with them how do you try to keep your accounts notice i said the word try and for trying can be years okay meaning that you are doing that and you've been having those accounts for

is crazy so we're going to talk about dealerships too i just want to make sure we're staying on track dealerships and we're going to talk about stretch dents okay and before we we're just going to give you a little preview in case you want to hang in here and watch what we're talking about we're talking about this dent right here in particular um joe and i are going to kind of he's going to kind of give me some what he thinks because this thing started the oil can we'll talk about that a little bit later um by no means i it's not ruined or anything like that it's still pretty good at where it's at right now but we're going to get into the details we got a action packed within the next 40 45 minutes right here and then fellas and ladies and we're going to talk about this new accessory from cam auto all right it's actually pretty cool i i thought it was pretty cool joe you ordered one too sir i already ordered one yeah it's uh it's pretty awesome kind of revolutionary in my opinion yeah i i and that's why you gotta you gotta watch this video cast everybody if you're listening to us it's but anyways we get visual as well when we talk about it so joe dealerships wholesale accounts bottom feeders whatever you want to call them uh you know and i'm not disrespecting you know i'm very thankful for for the accounts i i have i currently have and and i don't mean to sound like it's just what's the worst thing you can have it's not i think it's what our experience joe that and i know you you you want to chime in on this is it's our experience that we've had with them over the years in general most of them don't treat you with the same respect that you and i would treat someone else on a daily basis let's just put it that way that is true yeah and and just like that song that neil put is like you know you bend over backwards and they don't care you know for most for the most part but there are a good accounts out there the mom-and-pop places the ones who who do like you know you as a person as an individual you can probably keep that account for as long as you'd like but the main chain people yeah it's it you're just another person on the lot so yeah that's that's my take that's what we've based on our experience yeah i was gonna say that's been a lot of our experiences uh just the the dealer animal it prefers profit over people even with their own employees how do you think they're going to treat a vendor an outsider and so do you you have any any input on how to for those who who want to go and attack that part of the industry you know and get that type of you know experience uh income whatever whatever their motivation is you know you have any sound advice on on how to get those accounts or or you know obtain it special favors bribery uh general ass kissing yeah well you know that's gonna go a long way that's your framework yes okay well what about you can you tell i'm at the end of my wholesale pdr journey mike by my words please go ahead oh no honestly um i've i i really am kind of at the end of the road with with dealers i have a i have like one dealer group that i still service on a regular basis and these are long time clients of mine like you you mentioned yours um and you know my contacts quite frankly are are in the used car department my main contacts my friends basically and uh once they're gone uh i you know i haven't exactly made relationships with anybody above them you know i mean i know the gm um but i don't have a like a friendship with them i don't have uh relationships with the with the owners you know and and i think that if i really wanted to pursue wholesale on a on a more serious level i think i would have to figure out a way to to uh nurture a relationship with the owners and i mean people do it all the time we know we both know dent guys who who have those relationships they go golfing with owners and and you know all kinds of stuff but i just i don't i don't invest my time in that kind of stuff because i kind of already see the writing on the wall in my particular case i i feel like um i have a better chance of of of being successful dealing with a different market than the wholesale but i still use their their uh the relationships you know to some degree yeah joe i think um i think you're absolutely right i mean uh for for us guys who who see the writing on the wall like as you mentioned it's it's shall i say uh we've been there done that and there's a certain point it's not that we we are not capable of wanting to go get those accounts i think it's the whole again the experience that we've had with them consistently hey you walk in you get your card now this isn't like to discourage you guys from getting accounts but this is this is the experience that we've have and i don't think it's changed you walk in hey i'm mike toledo with den time oh just leave your card here or they won't even give you a chance to walk in right i've got five guys behind you you know they'll say something how much you charge you know it's everything but hey thanks a lot nice meeting you you'll never probably get that but i think the the the main reasons that you can get an account and people still land accounts is you know like you said butt kissing and it's timing too as well but i but to i don't know to kind of i guess agree with you i'm the same way i i don't get go out and get new accounts based on what you just said yeah well that being said mike you know i i kid about you know the the bitterness that uh has resulted from my relationships in wholesale but realistically i have to take accountability for what i have power over and i really uh i have to look back at those relationships and i have to think how could i have have kept that account or how could i have uh had a better more of a rapport with the with the dec the real decision makers wow man you know what joe you you that's a good interesting thought not very many people would probably say hey i'm going to take responsibility some of that i do that too as well you know i i looked back at at some of the things that i've done joe that lost my i lost the counts you know one was not trying you know when you get into accounts and you're new you try no matter what i mean i don't care if you think that you don't think it's can be can be done i guarantee you more than half the time you try you'll surprise yourself and you will be able to do things that you thought you weren't capable of doing and that's generally one of the big criterias for you to keep accounts is to try they just want to see you try it's something that that they want to don't know that all right he tried you know but if you just say no well it's kind of like getting a little mark on your report card man oh yeah absolutely yeah you're only as good as the last job you did for them that's right that's right right that's right i think that uh you know we can talk here i mean we can go on and on about this whole thing and and whether your listeners want to hear about like um securing new dealer business which i'm probably not the guy to talk to except that i can tell you what not to do or what i wish i had done um well i think that's what we could also talk about that's what they want to know i mean of course okay let's just spill it out here give it give us the all man you know yeah okay and then we can talk about uh maintaining uh wholesale accounts and and a lot of it has to do with what we're just talking about uh you know nurturing those relationships and the right relationships and with everybody and i that was something i was always really good at as far as like the people on the ground floor you know uh the everyone from the lot porters to on up to you know managers and but like i'll give you an experience that i had with a a very much corporate uh automotive group you know dealership that we were doing i mean like 30 or 40 cars a week which was a lot for for my partner kelly and i and we had everything mapped out we had great relationships with the people there um we had uh even we had a system down where we categorized the damage where we figured out that over a year's time every every month an average of 81 percent of the cars that we did were what we considered category one cars all right this was general pdr basically one to four panels on each car with one to four dents on each panel okay anything beyond that and these again these were like quarter-sized dings basic stuff anything beyond that in size or uh amount of dings uh was going to be a go into the category two and those were uh i think it was 12 percent of the cars we did so cali would do all the 81 cars the the cat one cars and he would overlap into the cat two cars to some degree and then i would take over on the harder category two cars and then above that we had an extra i think it was like seven percent that was category three cars which these were big smashes this is stuff that would have gone to the bodies that being said we were dialed in on almost every level almost and where i missed the mark was i lost the account to a company a personnel company who had a relationship up above the all the management with the with the corporation with the corporate owners are you saying these guys are you saying that they brought other people in or they just had like a all-in-one thing uh both okay they were a personnel company so they did all the recon they kept trying to get they were in there already and they were trying to get the pdr also but you know as you could imagine they were using they were pricing everything really low so they were using uh low-end services all around including pdr and and the dealership itself the management there they didn't like the work they were doing years ago so we we were doing the work for many years there so uh but they made a deal with the the corporate with the corporate side of the business where they were going to be bringing in personnel into the business office uh and throughout the dealership everything from you know admin assistants to floor sweepers lot porters as long as they could get all of the recon and you know we knew the writing we saw the writing on the wall when when my contacts told me about that to which i offered to have my partner kelly clean the bathrooms at the at the dealership but you know that was like a hail mary no way i'm kidding i was here we'll clean the toilets too man yeah we'll do anything you know and that's where you get with these guys man you get like desperate you think that you have no other option wow wow i mean you know that's i think the biggest thing that happens right now for the accounts is that there's always it feels like every two years at least with my accounts there's the next all-in-one big company you know we'll do everything for this one low price and it seems like they at least might my two accounts i have left like or maybe three i'll just about fall for it you know and it's almost like a tactic for them too they'll come in oh mike you know we had this company over here what can you do for us man because we might think you know we're thinking it's a little bit of hot you know it's a little bit high i'm like do you realize i i don't even raise my prices barely two percent a year right come on guys and so we have to make sure we talk sense into these guys too listen guys and ladies when you have accounts the best way to to keep your account is know the lingo understand you have to talk their language though so they when you can go into a price battle with them you understand their lingo um you know like for instance here's an example so do you mind if am i going off topic joe on yours so nope nope go ahead i i hear you okay so you go in you ride up like 10 cars and they're like oh man you got this is too expensive for this car you want 110 for this car i you know that i'm too much into it you know i got too much money into that car well you know this is for the guys who don't know most of you guys do if you are dealer accounts where you go all right john well i tell you what i i understand you might be 110 into that but how about if i put like how about if i put like 11 on each other car on every other car and that way you still get that one car done but it doesn't show that you put more money in so it would just add a little bit more on the other cars oh yeah that makes sense yeah sure that's just an example of the lingo that you have and you need to know there there their numbers like how many cars they sell how many things so you can prepare yourself maybe they're not selling as many cars so maybe you might need to lay back on how many cars you write up even though it's there so you need to kind of like adjust and i'm talking about this is for how to keep your account you know you don't go in there and bill for like like you're trying to hit a home run every time you know you don't need to do that um and my other things is is give them some insurance so if you write up a car you fixed it it's been there for a week or two and it's got another dent you never ever write up another car that car again if you did it already you just take care of it and you let them know that you take care of it but you never would double bill that's another strike if not the number one reason why you get fired real quick is you double bill the same car so those are just some like small things that i would say on the top yeah for sure man they they love the word free they love the word discount uh the the double bill thing whenever if we miss a dent or or if the dent happened after we fixed the car we will put it on the uh the invoice as a what we call lot damage and no charge and you know like you said you want to remind them that you know you're taking good care of them yeah they have short-term memory in hindsight you know since you say it i think the mistake i have made in in trying to keep wholesale accounts was the same was the thing that i do when i'm trying to market to a car owner which is that i'm the best dent guy there is you know they don't necessarily want the best thing guy it's safe to say we have to understand the problem that we're providing the solution for and in my opinion with with wholesale they don't want the best dent guy they want that they want to keep their profit margin at a point where it's good for them and that means that they're okay with settling for mediocrity and and i think that's where i had a lot of conflict because i had a hard time you know just being a production line guy you know and and you know you want to partner up with somebody who's okay with that and with all due respect to my my partner kelly he's he he's a general pdr guy you know he he only wants to do basic stuff and that's his comfort zone and he's good at it he's good at doing it fast and they were happy with the work you know and that led a lot of pressure off of me but even still i think i was always just too focused on where you know you have the you know telling the dealership that you have the best dent removal company around and they knew they did but i think that it's all a matter of numbers perceived value and if they're perceiving that they got the guy that's the best their mentality is that well i want what if i don't need the best so if i get the guy who's just under the best how much less am i going to be paying and how much is my profit margin going going to increase that's the problem that's the problem that you're serving or the need that you're serving and the problem you're providing the solution for and that was the mistakes that i made dealing with dealerships one hundo and good point joe because you do and that's where i say here's the great thing about you joe and techs like like us abroad you know we want to be the best tech we can be but we get the emotion of that involved in the dealerships right and does it and it's but you can't help it right because you're a passionate pediatric but the smartest pdr tag and not saying we weren't smart and you're not smart joe i'm not saying that but if you want to be get smarter you have to understand how to play the game in the in the pdr industry because again as joe mentioned they're looking for the best tech right there however it can bite you in the butt what i mean by that for the new techs when you get into this business it's almost like you're conditioned to do eighty percent of the work like eighty percent of repair and you think well i can get away with that you know and then all of a sudden it becomes a habit of you becoming like that so either you stay in the it's like it's like being in the stripping business man or being in vegas you end up being like them you know uh and you can't get out because then you're conditioned to well well now i got to do dents 100 in the retail market but again going back to staying on track to your point yeah if you if you want to survive in that game you have to understand that where their expectations are compared to yours and yours are generally higher than theirs but they're not paying you for those high expectations and at the same time you have to realize to be careful about that because you don't want that to be a conditioned quality that you can turn into you can be an 80 tech that and that's that's the good and bad about being in the accounts and that's why there's such a big difference between wholesale pdr tax and retail pdr attacks can you do both absolutely if you play the game well enough so that's basically my take on that yeah i i think uh our mutual friend chris brown from den patrol out in uh san fernando valley yeah uh he balances that fine line really well he does and i i listen to him talk and i'm like taking notes because i think man i should have done this or that you know with with that wholesale relationship or whatever and you know we talk about when chris and i will talk a lot about shifting gears and the ability to you know knock out 10 used cars and then you go and do a a retail job and it's two different worlds man i mean talk about a gear shift and it's it's you're changing your your mindset right there and and you know guys who are successful at that i think can really uh run a very lucrative pdr business yeah i'm actually going to have chris on in a couple weeks because i have a uh i we did a pdr with dent masters and um that's right i went out and did a ride along with him and that's going to be coming out on the new series but i would like to bring him on talk about the wholesale accounts and like exactly how you just said it because and and i don't think it'd be i'm not going to say which dealerships he was doing because you know he he's going to be on and i'm not sure i'm not going to mention any of that unless he wants to but it's very interesting like you said joe i mean this guy is a i mean he is on fire him in his tech like they they have 30 40 cars in one lot and they're doing and there might they could possibly 250 to 80 cars in a day it's just ridiculous so yeah right probably the busiest yeah they're machines man yeah yeah probably the busiest uh person i've ever seen dude so you know what my smartphone is i put this on vibration and this thing's still freaking like ring anyways so yeah man you're you're a wanted man anything you should want to add to the uh to the dealership stuff like uh you know this you said i i would like to touch base on one more time kind of like getting into the account i mean what's your strategy besides giving them donuts and you know and hey you know kissing ass basically like you said is there anything else yeah well in in i said that in jest you know about kissing ass i mean it's true though you know it you know well look i've seen guys do it and they were successful at it and it was something i was never comfortable with myself and that's why i worked so hard at trying to do great pdr i'm not saying i'm perfect but i'm just saying that i focus more on the craft than i did on nurturing relationships quite frankly i've gotten better at it as i as i've matured and stuff but and then learned the game like you said but you know it's a really high supply uh you know market there's a real high supply of pdr guys that are in companies that are willing to to to play hard quite frankly and so i think you know going back to like what you're saying about like securing new business like i it's not in my future you know there's been a few times where i've had to you know use some muscle to uh kind of knock on doors that that were already there like relationships that that i've had for years and and that's been fruitful but for your listeners if they're if they've never done work for dealers one thing to consider is the very thing that kind of put me out of that big client that big account that i told you about and that was that personnel company they're playing a different game you know and where they're dealing again with the owners and the corporate side of the business so they're they're nurturing a relationship with on that level and they're um they're providing other services too so that's that's one way in you know um another way to get into dealers if if i had to do it again um i think i would try getting in as just the guy for their new cars for their super pig for the super picky customers really sorry sorry you cut out you said super picky cut am i cutting out you know you're fine i gotta apologize i think i think my wi-fi is uh not my best you're good we can hear you dude so okay okay cool so you know um i have some uh dealerships that call me and and i've tried getting into their used car department as far as like their regular service guy but they only call me for the tough jobs or for uh picky customers or or new cars you know like high and good cars and but the price is uh you know uh accordingly you know it's uh basically we we what i do there is i'll price them at price a dent minus 20 and and really i'm getting to the point where i'm thinking do i even need to discount any of it because it's it's like you know they they call me when they call me and i've tried nurturing a relationship with them and and i'm not bitter about it it's business you know i i quite frankly prefer to go in there and do it you know a smash or whatever and make decent money even at you know with a discount you know the discounts to uh incentivize them to call me again or refer me business you know because they let's face it they do have that ability to provide you with more work down the line um but that's another option for your listeners if they want to get into uh doing wholesale and basically so basically a specialty pdr tech right kind of like a specialized pdr attack yeah yeah that's good that's a good avenue that's thinking outside the box there joe so well and then here's my take and then we'll move on to the next subject here okay my my take is is i don't like i'm just like you joe i don't i i think i can count how many times i've given donuts or pizza or whatever uh maybe three times you know because i want to be appreciated for my service for my spontaneous punctuation my effort um my consistency and doing my job right i mean that it's that's like the the top 10 you can do i mean you you don't practice that first of all how do you get an account will you be consistent you if you really want to get an account you let that manager know hey is there anything i can do i'm just checking in hey i don't hey boss i don't mean to value him but i'm i'm here be funny about it like like really get in him you know have him give you a shot one day he's going to give you a shot or her and and then if he can if he let you speak to him or or her this is listen bob i'm i'm very anxious i'm i'm i'm hungry because i do my job right i'm punctuation punk away punctuation all i show up on time i do quality work and i even can travel to the to the person's house in a pinch so i'm just stopping by just let me know and and then i'll be by next week to give you some donuts what kind of donuts you like you know what i mean so you know you gotta kind of break the ice but more importantly that they they kind of get your personality and they and they kind of go you know that guy's pretty pretty cool you know um so yeah but be yourself don't be a ding dong and don't be somebody you're not but be funny and be yourself at the most part because if you're more real to them they'll be more real to you and and um that's how you're going to be able to break the ice between what joe says and i say and it's always about timing ladies and gentlemen you're probably going to get 90 no's and that but that 110 percent yes could be the bank for all those ones that said no you know yeah i i think you know it was well said mike and the moral of the story is that we need to understand no matter where whether we're trying to market to wholesale or body shops or retail business or hail we need to understand the problem that we're providing a solution for and and what what these needs are that we're serving because when we wrap our head around that i think then it makes sense what what the road map is you know we can decide what what we're gonna need to do to get past that so you and i you know we're we kind of you know we're we have some bitterness towards the wholesale accounts and but you know there's a way there's a way we've made a lot you know i know you can you can vouch for that you know but i really think that you know if we understand the needs that we're serving then we can start breaking through barriers and then those barriers become like an obstacle for our competitors so if we can figure out you know how to get past that barrier we have to visualize what's on the other side of it because that other side is the promised land where not many of our competitors uh understand or can see or envision right that's true i mean honestly you know like you say joe you you've said it before on this podcast but we our biggest enemy is ourselves you know the biggest obstacle is what we create in our own head and it's a lot of head trash um of course this podcast wasn't very motivating for you to go get an account i i don't want it i don't want you to get feel discouraged but if you are going to go get those accounts be prepared to work for it i mean be prepared to have some some spit game and uh and that go drive personality you can't teach that in a way to a certain point um all you can do is just do your best and believe in yourself if you can believe in yourself and you heard me say this a lot doing no matter if it's your pdr repairs or if it's your the way you approach dealerships or whatever remember believe in yourself because if you don't nobody else will and that goes for people's services your business all that stuff so um really get yourself motivated and get behind and really show the value that you have so we're moving to the next topic joe okay all right sounds good next topic is oil can and so i kind of showed this to you a little bit you're you're just spitting some suggestions like oh wait wait hold on a second and hold on i i'm in the middle of as we speak this is wednesday here uh by the time you guys hear or watch this video you're looking we're looking at this all right this is this is uh wow man the project that i was working on and it's pretty crunched right against that edge of the body line and it does have some paint issues on the corner edge of where the tail light's at so far it has not gotten worse okay now that's a good sign here's the problem okay look at this poink oil canning people are listening it looks really good there it actually looks worse than it really is i mean it's it looks worse and i see that pinch right there on the on the top joe you know right right about there actually get this right there right you know right here where it bows that's the weak point all right all right right in that area right here so i tried tighten this up but i didn't want to knot it up and yeah so and i pulled more i pushed more metal on the right side so maybe i can cheat and get some metal coming out but you know it's and it's it's weird down there too as well on the bottom so there's the oil can but you push down here so that tells me something right there joe so i'm pushing down you know three inches below it four inches below it and it pops the dent that's oil canning four inches above it so that is um what i'm dealing with and this is at the stage i got it currently this is where i left it at this evening okay when i left okay it's it's i would say it's what it's at it's cleanup stage right eighty percent seventy percent some around that 70 let's just call it 70 sure okay so yeah especially considering what was there before so yeah so what's your take on that dude would you mind showing the before once more yeah mike yeah want to play it or do you want me to just just just no no no it's good like that okay because i was trying to picture where the where the deepest part of the dent was and where any of that pressure might be trapped um the area at the top of the tail of the tail lamp like just before it goes into that point and meets the body line right here was there a pretty good gap there yeah there's a little twist between the edge of the tail lamp yeah there's about a quarter inch gap yeah a quarter inch gap we can we can play this a little bit see if i if it'll pick it up i don't think i got enough i didn't go to the other side very well but i was just trying to capture the reflection so yeah there you can see it's a little see how the gap is on the bottom see that gap yeah yeah i figured it would excuse me so you know what i would do if i were you what's up i would i would align that i would just uh install that tail lamp back without the nuts you know and just see where everything lines up and see if your edge is still a little bit low okay perhaps it's holding in some pressure there yeah and if so then you know you know you got to move that and that might tighten up that oil can if that doesn't work i might look into removing the the bumper the bumper cover yeah that was that was going to be that was going to be probably the thing i was going to do tomorrow because you see this bottom edge work where it goes into the bumper that day okay that's actually giving me a little bit of a hard time i i i fix it and then i work up here and it comes back a little bit of a dent you know what i mean and then this part over here we're over the top corner of the shadow area on the right side that's that's pretty much gone but there's still something going on and uh below the body line right there so this dent is a lot worse than it is of course right joe it's always worse when you get into it right when you throw a light on it that looks like a gnarly one though man i mean you got a lot going on there and you got those that kink right right above the body line and you got another contour where it goes into the sail yeah yeah that's that's all everything you see is true there's no false advertising on this repair right here so you know what when i see stuff like this and i i find myself in a kind of in a bind and like start losing hope a rabbit hole yeah yeah you start losing hope and stuff and you start feeling like i mean think you mean it's nice you got the shop and you can take a refresher dude when you're mobile well you know you were mobile and that's exactly four hours in in the driveway of some somebody's driving away and you're like oh my god what have i done so uh so it's it's oil canyon so my my option was is like you suggested is take down the bumper cover all right see if i can get it to move like give a different point of view from looking underneath it um right if that doesn't work i've got the power pr box but i do have a like a brace that goes across a little bit but i still think oh really yeah i still think i can i can like get a grinder underneath it so is that a uh acura honda accord honda accord okay um before i i'd i mean before you go to the to that extent um what i was gonna say about like when i find myself in a bind like that um i try and find the hidden advantage like what's the hidden advantage here and to me what i see is that you're close to some edges there and you've got a body line working with you for you so there's some rigidity to the to the body line yeah that you might be able to restore a little bit like okay continue to continue to push push yourself and like continue to restore maybe i mean i'd like to look at the body line like exactly like how you're doing it right there like and even if you can eyeball it like in person to see if there's any waiver in there because that little waiver in there could be holding some of that in uh but also again going back to the edges you know what's nice about edges is that they you know if you can find where they're trapping the pressure you can relieve some of that and and like what we're talking about removing the bumper cover you know you get one of those doll dent dollies or a block and you take a heavy dead blow or uh sledgehammer even yeah and just you shock the the heck out of that metal and you can at the very least well you might be releasing the pressure there but at the very least you can kind of see what it's doing you can kind of get a feel that's a good idea that's a good idea joe i didn't think you know what i have a dolly and i can just tap on a little bit with one of my hammers right there my rubber hammers i can just do that heat it up that's a good idea i'm gonna try that that's it's actually a real good suggestion on there okay all right yeah and like if you push in that oil can right and then you try striking it on that edge you're gonna see that oil can pop back out right mm-hmm and you might that might give you some uh now you're talking about that are you saying put the dolly like like right across the body line like you're talking about that or down below down below okay down below remove the bumper cover okay okay underneath that uh you would only be able to access if you remove the bumper cover it makes sense like where the bottom of the of the quarter panel goes down into a 90 yeah and you might want to heat up the paint too you know so so you don't crack anything but you know you're not really uh you're not getting too aggressive with it but you're just striking it and and letting it put some shock waves into that metal you it might be holding in and particularly where you see in the before you can see where that dent does go into that edge there mike yeah it does you know where you can see that yeah you can see the reflection like it bows right into it yeah yeah your leds bend right there so that might be the point where it's holding in yeah good suggestions good suggestions like this is why we have this this is why john i mean john joe and i take we do these deep deep uh deep dives yeah it is but you know i didn't realize that look i panned right there let's do that again i want to play that again so um yeah you're right you're right joe yeah it bows way out so i did release some of this dress i didn't realize it was that pinched in there so i bet you if i take that bumper cover off there may be some fractures of paint uh underneath that yeah yeah i think you might be right you're gonna get in there tomorrow and with a cup of coffee and you're going to just figure it out i'm going to rewatch this all right joe said joe said joe said this all right well we're doing remote control dent guy yeah joe thanks for the suggestions man like uh so listen guys if you guys find value in this uh in these podcasts you like what joe says let us know you know okay give show some love uh give us a review um tell what you know say what joe you don't have to say what i say you know who cares but joe takes the time and come on this podcast and uh i what i want to say publicly thanks a lot joe for coming on man i really do appreciate you taking your time and uh and putting it in here but but yeah thanks let us know and and write a review if you get a chance okay or if you're watching on youtube let us know what you think here too so joe let's talk about uh let's talk about the newest tool that you ordered all right yes where did you see that tool at okay because i i well of course i'm not on facebook as much as i used to be but where did you see it well nobody sends me free stuff so i gotta buy it i still gotta buy all my tools mike i'll i'll try i'll try to get you hooked up dude all right i'll try to get you hooked up i'm just messing um yeah i saw and uh gosh i think it was instagram where uh cam otto was i forgive me i don't i don't know the gentleman's name from cam auto but uh arun or a roan right i i okay it's hard to pronounce his name on he's he's just a very wise dude man i i enjoy watching his videos that he puts up and it's like really out of the box thinking and um he's really i think he's starting a bit of a rebirth of the body man dude because i i see a lot of uh you know old school or conventional body repair guys yeah using the keiko and and cam auto stuff now and it's really cool to watch man because they're putting their take on it you know we're we come from more of a finesse side of things and they're using more of like the science of of metal release and uh anyway i see this guy this gentleman from cam auto showing demonstrating the attachment to a slide hammer where basically the gist of it is you don't have to worry now about your tabs going flying across the room or directly under the car where they always seem to land dead center underneath the vehicle you're working on right that's right so let's let's talk about let's show it to them visually okay um when i first saw it i was like well actually let me just take this off so you guys can see i'm gonna just go full screen if you don't mind joe and you can still still still talk um so here is the mechanism so what it does is it attaches to the slide hammer but watch this dude so you pull this and you've got a horseshoe tap attachment and you just put your tab there right and boom and now it ain't coming off so when you slam your your glue and your tab off it is not going to let go now how easy is it to hook up well here's my slide hammer right i guess i could have shot a little video of this too as well but you just actually it's got a little rubber grommet on the end too joe so it really locks in can you hear me joe yeah yep i can hear you all right i'm just sitting oh dude so there you go i mean of course mine's not lined up i'm just giving you guys a nice little look i'm on how how it how it works okay yes and somehow he demonstrated how it can lock into the uh the centipede tabs too you know where the the head of it is really long and that thing will will lock into one of those as well yeah yeah so i mean it's good it's it's really good and and it doesn't matter if you have a pass through or not because what it does is it it'll just lock down between the the forks you know the prongs of you of your slide hammer attachment but this is really cool and you know you just pull it and it locks in so this is from cam auto i'll put the link down below what'd you buy it for how much was it uh i want to say it was like 100 bucks so which yeah but you know considering all the chasing down tabs that fell out of my slide hammer i don't have to do that anymore it ain't it don't feel cheap it doesn't feel cheap i'll tell you that you guys it's it's got some weight to it it's actually gonna i think help your your your snaps too as well uh when you pull how much play does it have i don't know it's a good idea actually good barely any okay so yeah but this part's cool it obviously tightens up when you pull back right like like how you would oh yeah yeah engage it yeah yeah it's it's gonna do that um yeah and then this right here i mean this is just makes it easy to spin like he's got knurls on it on each one so it's gonna it's you're not gonna slip and nice it's really cool it's got a nice spring to it horseshoe adapter already built into it and beautiful you're good to go oh man i love it enjoy it joe it's a shoe outside of the box thinking man by the way it's cool right now yeah i'm using it you ever had this you ever tried the slide hammer you tried the shop i think i did yes it's got a nice weight to it man and it's uh it's magnetic it's from fast pdr i just wish no sharp edges no i just wish i i think every pdr company should just make a horseshoe like just forget it because the tabs hang over a little bit sometimes you know but you you manufacture you know if you come out with a slide hammer or at least have an adapter or a one that slides around so you know yeah but i'm sure it's a matter of preference you know yeah i bet some guys really like to pass through yeah i i use nothing but the pass-through it's just way easier and you know here's the thing too when you have a pass-through is like i would just put my finger right across you know and just and just snap it like this sometimes depending on how hard you're snapping that can bite you in the butt because you can get that that what do you call that stinger you know yeah but i think this is going to take care of that so you'll never like you said never have to worry about your tabs flying off and losing i say i tell my students i say hey listen don't leave your tabs on the ground i go that's three dollars so would you drop three dollars and not pick it up they're like oh no i'd pick it up i said well pick up you make sure your tabs don't fall on the ground at least if you do pick them up but you want that problem now so you know man at one point i was thinking like i remember doing like the bottom of a ford raptor the bottom of the door how it kind of comes in at a 90 degree underneath and it was dented i was trying to slide hammer that thing out and and i got it eventually but my tabs kept flying you know across the shop that i was working in and i even at one point thought if i had a piece of string i could hot glue the string to the show here you could tie it to the tab so the tab would just hang you know a little pop what do you call those little poppers dude like you know yeah exactly i could have i was getting ready to market uh pdr stream yeah there you go yeah i bet you would dude i bet you would well everybody we just want to say thanks a lot thanks for tuning in uh let us know what your thoughts are on this podcast joe i want to let you go man we you know i gotta i gotta go take the wifey out and we'll see what happens you know so all right man enjoy do you enjoy you guys have a great evening and and

tuesdays keeping the 420 growers club moving through all the [ __ ] the payment processor and everything so huge shout out to them check them out link below in the description get your discount on that king crab but yeah it's a nice show speaking of that's the topic for tonight's show is getting it from the store or buying it or diying it you know these are things that a lot of people i feel like are are probably trying to do a little bit more buying right now if they got that young stemming you know what i'm saying but if you're trying to make it stretch you're going to want to make it you know diy in a lot of cases not in all cases and i think that's where this is a good conversation to talk about that absolutely because in some cases you'll actually save money and other cases you'll pay around the same and have to spend more time facts fact facts well before we jump into that let's check out a little garden updates he's goblets right now he's edited his [ __ ] up all smooth for me i appreciate you boss at the veg area cleaned up looking real nice so you put a different difference i got some mile air up there yep nice got the mother tent going good beautiful would you kill off uh one of the moms in there yep that old blue grape that was in there damn those perked up quick too it looks nice the back tent or bcc tent yeah black cherry cheesecake oh there you go longer name so i just kind of abbreviated it like that i like that a lot better looking good man looking good try i don't really got to update on yours man but this is what it's looking like recently i thought we weren't doing them every other day so i decided to you decided to change your mind i changed my mind yeah now the ladies here finishing down i know you've been in trim jail just [ __ ] putting in work and not hitting me up so good looking out i appreciate you well well if you do think about the terminator because that's where a good majority of that's going but here's my little fetal hat that i'm going on right now i've got a couple of headbangers the biggest couple wifi's the mix but no 11's here those over at the other grove right now it's the scooby-doo has this big monster right here shot on my phone so it's unfortunately a little bit of the white balance is off but i get it down it looks [ __ ] awesome for my phone i'm very impressed samsung shout out to them but then over on the left side here that that's all one plant that big beach you saw there over the left side here there's a few uh headbangers you see this sparseness of the colas aka just buds they're not really goalless in comparison over here full stackage you know what i'm saying it's just insane the difference between the two big difference but yeah so the diy side of things you see tents you see it's a commonality we all got tents here now it's not mandatory it's not mandatory it's preference and with that you're going to be spending a lot more money putting together a tent i guess it really depends it compares into a really large room maybe multiple tents or how you go about it could be a little bit more unique to your situation i recently was seeing we're talking about the homie half big man i believe he's got a diy thrown together pvc chance so to speak using poly so plastic on there instead of using the uh your mylar you know no signal no signal rob tomorrow it's over got the new camera in tomorrow and pigeons back also if you guys don't know p is back the boy pigeons back over the video yeah you know youtube is what it is but so you could you could go about the diy or you could pre-buy your nowadays a lot of these tents are really affordable they're really affordable it's insane so i i may lean more towards the tent just because of ease of use and set it up and everything but then if you've got a whole big room some people say oh well you got to go buy your grow room stuff you got to be getting your poly together you got to be doing everything the basic whole whole system but you can really just paint your [ __ ] walls white uh you can go and get your cheaper hood if you need to go and get not even a full led style just getting going of course it'd be preferable i mean i would personally prefer if you would get a led just for electricity usage you don't want everybody using this [ __ ] electricity whatever but uh there's some things you can get away with just diying it you know gobbling like in your area there i see what you put the poly up you got rid of the poly and now you got mine i got rid of the poly and i got some mylar up there and literally that wall right there it's not like a structural wall or anything it's like four two by fours stretch it cost 14 feet it's just to hold the poly up oh yeah yeah see i think that that's where again you saved a lot of money in comparison to having a big giant you probably have an eight by eight in that space like that's what you're rocking right trade is the eight by eight yeah you could grow store discounts it's a little different for you but for the others well i'm saying right even if you you can get a cheap 10 online and i even have like my 4x4 is a cheap offline 10. it's a grow den it's not a bad brand but like i have a gorilla right next to it and like this little features that the gorilla has for me make a difference in the sense of like usability and then when you're talking about us then you know maximizing that's doubling my space from four by four to eight by eight um you know i think it's worth paying up in quality i was just talking to the rep over there you know shout out to shayna it's it's it's been around a long time you know i've heard of guerrilla tents that i've grown out of that 2x2 for how long at least as long as you've known me so um you know it it and just make sure you're getting a quality tent it doesn't have to be gorilla obviously i'm going to be a little biased in that but infinity's got new ones out too they've uh pretty solid some people are saying they're garbage some people saying it's solid it's seemingly hit or miss everybody has a [ __ ] opinion right for sure so like i say just make sure you're getting a quality 10 if you're going to pay for a tent especially if it is locked you know even your 5x8 was a little you know 100 bucks or more so it's like you want to make sure that you're getting your bang for your buck and like that everything's gonna like fit together well and everything like that because once you pull the tent together it's usually good but um sometimes if those like poles that come to stabilize the whole thing aren't milled well it can um leave you with like a weak spot in your tent which you obviously don't want when you're talking about putting plants in there absolutely absolutely you know like even uh people talk [ __ ] about this 10 that tent i see mars 10 over at your spot mars is in a lot of people's eyes a cheap company like the 10 ain't cheap their light ain't cheap we're in 2021 these companies can't put out too much garbage like they're they're not gonna last look at the reviews before you buy anything because that's just this is what it comes down to you see that just said mars hydro and the material because i have a tear in my tent and that can lead to problems if you're flowering obviously so yeah and see this is the other option as well like aluminum insulation panels and the only downside of that would be in the summer time potentially for heat i have seen people say that uh restricting that heating a little bit more using that and the the reflectivity could be a little too intense but we're using leds nowadays uh most of us are at least and i don't think that's too big of an issue for a lot of people i think what i'm just going sorry you you go ahead i was gonna cut you off i was just gonna say that i feel like regardless of if you're gonna build out your space or use a tent or even if you're talking just in tonight's topic like diy or do you buy like how technically sound are you at what it is you're diy and not that you can't go out there and watch a youtube video or two and obviously know figure out what to do if there's some steps you're not clear on but when it comes down to it i think it's either time or convenience versus cost you know so oh yeah that's that's the ultimatum all the time so you um have to kind it's situational me and mr gross said that word a lot uh the other day so yeah you weren't right that's right yeah shout out to him for that episode so i would say like you just have to kind of know what best is gonna serve you i think growing in both spaces like tents have their benefit 100 between conveniency and then just you know having it all in one but then you also having to control that space it can be a pain in the ass um and i think you and i have talked about this long time ago on the channel rob it's like when you have like a closet or a basement or whatever that you're growing in it wasn't meant to be grown in versus when you build out a room to grow in i don't know if there's much that competes with that but it's not the most cost efficient thing in the world especially right now yeah yeah like if you plan on growing staying at the house you live in for the sophie like for the future and you plan on growing for the future building out of dedicated growth space is definitely what you want to do agreed but other than that like the convenience and cheapness of a tent especially for a lot of home cultivators go for it absolutely you can have it in a little apartment you can have it you know depending on the your local laws and whatnot but you can fit a tent in many places absolutely holy [ __ ] throwback clip i know throwback wi-fi yeah i mean that that room ran beautifully so it's it's it's tough but you know what i mean that farmer you don't obviously don't know [ __ ] about [ __ ] dog but anyways um so the next thing you know the room is one thing but inside of the room so you got things like your cloner so now you can go ahead and do aeroponic cloning uh that's what i personally like or goblin i've seen like your homemade bubble cleaner essentially your deep water like the deep water culture clown area pretty much yeah before now initially how i had my thing set up my aeroponic cloner it was all diy i just had a pump i had my manifold and i had a little garbage bin that actually had a square like office style garbage bin with a top on there and it worked pretty good but it wasn't uh ideal it just wasn't sizable it was too small where my temperature would warm up within like two days at the most and then i'd often times be having sludge or issues in there so what i ended up doing is switching up in water cloner just because it was easier for me some of these companies have done some proprietary things like easy cloning for example that do make it a little bit better you know as where you can i personally think the diy bubble cloner that you've made is just as good as the oxycloners or any of these ones i've seen for 100 or 60 online it's the same exact [ __ ] thing they've got a little bit of a dip so your puck doesn't fall away through but there's all sorts of things you can do to make sure that doesn't happen even if you do a little net i've seen like well that's the thing is that's why i made one in three quarter inch holes and i bought two inch pucks yeah see then they just stick in there a little bit there's like a compression fit yep yeah i think that's where you know you can go cheap with it or you can uh if you know what you're doing in your case like it's it can be really cheap it can be really affordable because it's not there's not much to it aeroponic cloner the cost of your bump in your your manifold is mature it's the bulk of what you're spending on you know what i'm saying and i know trey you guys got little parts and replacement things at the shop but when i was trying to just piece the [ __ ] together i was still spending about 65 dollars to be able to do well yeah i was gonna say cheap and again affordable performance when you're talking about all right i'm gonna not spend you know what is at least a minimum of a hundred dollars on any kind of aeroponic cloner i mean you might be able to find some that are a little cheaper than that but say you don't want to spend whatever the the the price is right and you want to go and compartmentalize it you know macgyver style you can do that and you can very much come out with a aeroponic cloner but how well does it work i just had somebody the other day talk about oh i tried that i i'm not you know he was buying a bag of root riots and i was like oh well what you know what brand did you get he's like oh i built it myself and i'm like okay well you know he's like it leaks all over the place like well yeah see like that's that's not going to be efficient for what you're doing you know so that it's like some people don't got the diy touch yeah that's right i'm one of those guys i like to buy my [ __ ] just really depends you know i've never been one to to be very macgyvery with stuff but sometimes you got to do it you know especially if you're balling on a budget you can't really you just worked for years though and that was worth it it worked it just i i knew it could be better and i wanted to be more efficient with it so i was like you know what i'm switching the game if i'm just going to invest in it look i didn't have to because you're the [ __ ] man and don't ever let me buy anything but i but i think again it's it's situational because you have now your veg space that's built out you know what i mean to a degree where like but a tent is nice and like again like goblin mentioned if you're uh in a space where you're gonna be for the foreseeable future then you know do your thing but you even then i'd say all the time you got to crawl before you walk so i think like a tent provides you with that perfect testing space even though goblin has a dedicated growth space he's got a tent why because he needs some testing same thing for you know our situation so you know it provides a perfect lab experiment and then if you want to go and build and grow from that then i think it gives you the perfect training to do that appreciate you jay shout out always showing love yeah um you know i think again situational 20 you say that situational things like knowing how to put together things like lights that's my next one on my list here would be diy lights it's really hot for a lot of people i know chill tech shout out to them austin and team over there they do the uh diy setups that's very affordable it's usually like two or three dollars less than what their main like x6 or the other girl craft options are so you can go in that aspect i know other people who've literally like built they've bought diodes and assembled and like really went [ __ ] hard i'm not an electrician nor do i recommend doing any of that [ __ ] but if you're that guy or gal do you boo boo personally i think the diy kits are the best way to go about it i mean think about the fact if you've ever assembled a grill i know i brought a grill not too long ago and i was like what the [ __ ] who they think i am tim allen in this [ __ ] what is this these directions that make no sense or like you get something for your kid and it's always ridiculous you're like you don't need these directions really you think i'm gonna put this together it's all diy so lights are the same a lot of these companies are putting them out i haven't seen a ton of companies mainly chill tech's the one i've seen but um i know there's chilled uh hlg obviously there's a diy option um timber i always get their name wrong it's like timberwolf or something like that but they do a diy kits too yeah it's just a nice affordable option you know what i'm saying instead of having to spend all the additional extra money for the same exact light you can follow their directions you can watch a video i know goblin's got a you got a video about assembling light don't you yep right over on this channel you find that in the link of this video here hey red smoke appreciate you man good looking out good looking out and everybody just so you know any of these super chats any money that's sent to us given to us like this it literally goes back to y'all anytime we do giveaways the shipping is [ __ ] so expensive i can't even emphasize it's so expensive so yeah appreciate all y'all you really help out and then uh you know for for lights some people remember cobbs was a big thing a lot of people were doing too and i mean it's still it's still a big still a big thing but i know a lot more people before we're getting these diy kits for cobs and i'm like oh that's interesting i've just seen it more pivoting into the led realm where it's like you can get that same high quality light but you don't have to spend nearly as much because you could just assemble it it's not really that's the thing yourself you can uh you can still get cops cops are still very efficient and still put out lots of light and you'll start getting them a little bit cheaper i guess technology advances you know usually things go down financially so it's great next thing about this would be irrigation systems man i don't know about you trey but i'm getting you this [ __ ] system i see you struggling over there with how many [ __ ] plants you got i'm looking over at my system here and like watering sucks sucks when you got a lot of plants it's great when you only got a few when you got like 12 even 24 it's not so bad when you get to like 56 to 99 you need a system definitely not 99. i'm just saying if you get to that point for anyone to get to that point you know medical card holders who are caregivers or you get in the the small micro grow space you get to the point where you may want to do an automatic watering system now you can pre-buy your system blue mat's a great option i'm loving the drip right hydra lock sound point but other people will try to go a little bit cheaper out if you know irrigation itself you know how to deal with stuff like that but by the time you pay for that pump and you do all the [ __ ] on your own it's in the ballpark of what you're going to pay for a pre-assembled system and god we have a great argument and why you talk first no i was just going to say there's also four flex and auto power systems are like uh pretty popular becoming as well and like floor flex i think was one of the first to kind of use influencers pretty heavily to show off their product you know i think their tops are really smart um but any kind of like preparation you can get on irrigation is is going to be helpful for sure um i'm working on getting my [ __ ] water in one [ __ ] leave me alone that's diy right there just like you know moose stock in there with the pump and the wand that's diy enough even right there where you're not going just from the bucket and doing it there you can literally assemble a lot of things to make it a lot easier on yourself and very affordable absolutely like and the thing is is what like you nailed it on the head with the a lot of the irrigation system stuff you might as well get a system because before you put in all the time and effort to piece and part out everything and factor that in and along with the assemble time and like actually coming up with the plan it's you might as well just buy the system because it's going to cost the same amount and you spent more time than you needed to yeah see that's the key thing too is is the time and effort and energy put in to appreciate you jason i think people really underestimate what your time is worth the value of your time is valuable you know and if you're spending all this time trying to do stuff if you know how to do these things it's a little bit different if you're into uh the irrigation world already it's probably nothing if i already have a lot of the stuff that's totally different but if you're not trust me it gets expensive just the pumps alone man and then you get like pvc is not even the conversation it's manifolds and pumps and all these extra little things that some of them are going to be more proprietary you know what i'm saying when it looks like with the hydraulic system or floor flex their manifold the whole watering system is a little bit more unique it's not just a drip system like you'd see chocolate milk i was just gonna say the only issue i found over the years with like through other gardens or ones i've been in is getting the automatic watering or irrigation when you're talking about introducing nutrient content as well can be a little bit finicky to dial in oh absolutely like one garden depending gardener depending and cultivar depending um you know i think the benefit of what like you got going rob is that all your food's in the soil so you can just have water and water and water and water so i mean if that's an option that's you know you know good i think it's not impossible to achieve but it's just a very it's not like okay i'm gonna go up to the store and i'm gonna buy this system and put it in and that's just gonna be it what exactly what i need all in one you're gonna have to probably compartmental even if you get something like a fluoroflex you're gonna have to figure out that regulation or that dialing in oh you're gonna have to tweak it in and monitor it make sure everything's going well before you completely call it it's automated right right appreciate you twisted yeah and that's the thing automation you know it's that's one area of automation goblin and i were just talking how [ __ ] mind-blowing it is how many of you grow me's manually turn your lights on and off what the [ __ ] going on it's twenty-four yes i thought i mean we're freaking amazing i'm breaking through to these next level automation things i had no idea that i'm leaving out this form of automation it's just a timer for your lights man a lot of people aren't doing that like dude shout out to the dedicated ones out there with the getting up and making sure you know i mean i guess it's a commit like a forced commitment but yeah yeah extremely hard my plans would be on trade time that wouldn't be good no no yeah yeah get a timer get a timer but uh you know for the automation side of things you can go ahead and get something like the nemo grow hub which is a great option or your goblin or maybe uh or if your goblin if you're gobbling you will if zack's watching this where's trace bro no [ __ ] i opened up a package i'm just gonna put it out there that i like was actually from a family member for my birthday coming up because i you asked me if like that came and i was like and i didn't open it because the family member was like yeah i'm sending you something like well let me just peek and see if it is you know thinking there'd be some rapping or something no it was like their present and [ __ ] it wasn't the new grow up there zach so yo ash the payment processor is down right now for a minute but uh we'll be back soon i got amex approved us but i don't know i don't think amex but yeah you know josh i know josh uh stone second blunt and a little hard would call it a hard chalky milk but uh yeah so you can go automation with news you can go automation with titan controllers there's a lot of different things or you can go ahead and just get smart plugs basic simple smart plugs or you can go even further and do something like goblin has done with uh he's got what is it the raspberry pi with this yeah i got a raspberry pi with a couple of esp32s that are wirelessly reporting sensor data back to it i like it what are the the ink birds too oh yeah another form of controller and then uh you know shout out to the homie wink not here with us tonight but he was just here um putting together some kind of contraption with nutrient straws and stuff to have some automation while he was uh gonna be you know away from the garden type thing and it sounded you know he's telling me this like i know what the hell he talking about i'm like bro i don't know you're right like he's like yeah i'm like no a light skin depression i like that yeah i think that should be a video you do real soon there boss get that [ __ ] together grow me raspberry pie set up to be a great video for myself even where i'm like how did he do it what did he do i get the basic idea but i want to see it just for a warning it will be a longer video oh i expect it to be i expect it to be extremely long that's a dedicated ass video but i'll watch it i'll be your first viewer trey has two volumes it should be automated man i got this [ __ ] so it's automated i don't know sorry speaking of automated so yeah you can go ahead and you can automate that entire process and that's that's where i see the future of gardening going everybody's like i'm going to be hands on this and then like you should be hands on with training the plant and checking all these things not just walking away from the garden not being involved but essentially just easing up some of your process focusing on other things in the garden that are going to be more beneficial for you overall because hand watering is going to get you more of a yield or better tasty butt just not i mean doing these things manually are are more processed and it could be a methodical meditative process to you in the garden and they do your thing that's all you but me personally i'm very very limited on time i can't just be spending this extra hour and a half mixing and watering this and that if i've already got my system set up i'm not going to play games and that's where you get to the next side of things like nutrients or ipm that's another thing you could diy or buy now when you get to the organic side of things that's a lot of diying it whether you're going and buying a pre-mix something like i got with build a soil or you're doing it piece by piece by piece like goblin's doing and you do a lot of stuff and build the soil as well but you're piecing more your stuff together and i think that's where you're not necessarily having to rely on no offense tray but to grow stores or places like that you can get your stuff and reuse it and continuously have it and find other things that are used in agriculture regularly you know i was just down at the grocery they had all the down-to-earth amendments there yeah at least most of them yeah i mean with it we have neem seed meal and we have stuff like sns that is like natural like just rosemary and soy oils that like you would otherwise can you could go get that stuff yourself but again conveniency factor you know and um so yeah i mean you can definitely the things we can't readily as far as in the shop get in my shop but you can get them i'm sure maybe other places are like nematodes or um i don't know of any shop shows like predator uh bugs at all some shops will get them in if you if you have them call it in but there's not a lot of distributors like um that place that used to be in my drug counseling store or drug counseling place uh where d shop is now yeah that dude would order stuff so he'd get it and it's like i don't know if i trust it i can probably get it myself but it worked it worked but yeah and then also so with the ipm so that's where you can get a lot of stuff that's not necessarily uh you need to get for things for just cannabis i mean most of this stuff is for plants it's botany this is all agricultural stuff you don't want to be putting harmful things of course in your mix but you know early in veg you can use neem you can use different essential oils there's a lot of different options to be able to fight and combat these things also using ladybugs or predator pests like you're saying so you don't have to necessarily use a pre-made bottle that's going to cost you every time that you spray and you're done with it you know even goblin with that jadeim you blew that [ __ ] up man how much you said that was uh in comparison yeah it was like i mean it's like a hundred bucks for making uh like a few hundred gallons and like if you were to buy a natural ecosafe surfactant emulsifier at like 20 to 50 dollars a liter so you're saving quite a bit of money when you can make it yourself i tried that rolling but not many people want to go on here i don't want to show their faces and [ __ ] here's what it is um i was going to say we do ladybugs i've used for years i mentioned that in my course too like uh and we we used to sell them at the shop but then california fires and displacement because like the where we were sourcing them from they don't like farm them they collect them and so the fires like displaced a lot of where they were collecting them from i'm sure you can still get them um there might even be like local sources near you and that's like another thing like that uh the homie i can't remember his name but uh he touched on it's like making sure you're like sourcing locally to oh absolutely uh where you're at to try and like combat whatever you might have like the things that are rampant here in michigan thrips powdery mildew you know like those things are probably going to be best especially naturally combated by the things that already naturally combat them in the nature well we actually have a special guest just dropped in one of the grommies actually snapped i didn't really snap i was dog [ __ ] last night but i tried to snap at the same gym last night and somehow call of duty welcome to grow tent what up brother hey what's up man what's up have you here dude what's up everybody good seeing you man that was last night was an embarrassment for me i just could not get my [ __ ] together i don't know the aim was off dude i have those nights all the freaking time man like sometimes you have a good night sometimes it's you know sometimes it's not so good sometimes it doesn't nothing works so i have those kind of nights all the time i usually stream warzone on friday and sunday nights every weekend some days it's awesome and then other times we can't make it past first circle so yeah unfortunately it's the way she [ __ ] goes man i think last night you were talking about uh that beautiful plant you had going man that faded out rainbow one what was that the lemon early lemon berry yeah they are lemon berry you know the crazy part was i didn't i didn't do anything i didn't do any ice no cold no nothing just it just did it all bite man i think if you just stay out of the plant's way if the the less you stress them the less you hurt them i think you allow the plant to express itself fully you're not over feeding anything you let it naturally come about with that kind of stuff you know if you guys ever watch my channel i'm about doing less the less i can do you know it's a plant i want to stay out of its way you gotta give it enough attention to where it survives but i just i want to do this i'm a minimalist approach whenever it comes to these things you know i do my training i do my shaping you know that i just want to let it be i don't want to be in there all the time that's not the kind of grow style i like yeah i switched up to automation and organic to really alleviate a lot of that and and i think like you can that's the thing it's just like i was saying to goblin before is you can go ahead and get almost all these kind of results you do from damn near any cultivar with a [ __ ] little extra effort with a bunch of potential stress to your plant and risk of hermiting or losing terps or hinder i mean literally damaging the plant but it'll look cool on instagram so some people they'll they'll do that just for that purpose they'll want to get their plant as purple as it can get and it's like yeah but then now it doesn't smoke good at all you notice your trichome heads all of a sudden look like they're gone like you scraped your bud like what the [ __ ] going on here and i think that's where the approach of being a minimalist like the good balance obviously and having the right cultivars i mean it's so important i just got off a call earlier today with somebody in the fortunate growers club and he was just wondering how do you get a fade on some of those b-roll shots you're showing like how do you get that and i was like i just stopped feeding these particular cultivars two weeks before man i'm just kind of leeching them just water and uh they turned out pretty [ __ ] good it's i'm not doing anything that's special to me you're not doing the ice on these like nah i've done it in the past and it's it's shown a little bit here and there but it wasn't anything significant for me to care as the smoker because as for me i really don't care what it looks like so much like yeah that's cool to show it off but i'm really really big on dank smoke so i'm not going to hinder that that's the key thing is i want that flavor and smell to be on point i'm not going to enter that in any sort of way yeah the smell this one man it was the craziest thing i never had a one smell like this like i opened up the tent one time then i turned around to start doing something else in one of the other tents and i was like what the [ __ ] is that smell is that antifreeze i was like what the [ __ ] is that sweet ass smell in here and i turned around and i i went back over to the early lemon berry tent it smells not kind of like a hint of pink lemonade it smells like somebody dumped out a two liter bottle of lemonade on a hot summer day you know it was like the floor is like all sticky the next day that smell is what's coming up out of that tent and i sat in there for like 10 minutes just just i never know i never experienced anything like it i just sat there i brought the wife down i was like you gotta come down here and smell this i was like check it out she's like you can grow this as much as you want yeah yes that one and she likes the bubble gum smelling plants too like i grew some uh uh hubba bubba smelloscope from mephisto back in the day she loved that one that was probably her other favorite if this was a solid one you know see trey's got what was the one that you just had faded out tray that we were looking at i was gonna say i think it's still on my instagram story that uh kobe fade man that was uh straight up like purple and it like you were there two days ago and i took that video that's on the story like yesterday and she faded even more you know so she had even more golden brown golden brown not brown leaves but golden leaves and then like purple purple purple centers to her leaves and then just bright crystally green buds it's just a crazy like technicolor rainbow explosion but it just you know that's one of the coolest things about the plant to me is like that the actual flower when you're talking about just aesthetics can be really beautiful too that's the key thing man is is if you find one that has the funk to it that also has that look they fix that beautiful fade like almost everything about that is a keeper in my book man i just really really like if i have the aestheticness to it as well as the consumer side if it's not even a huge yielder i mean that would be great of course but if i've got both of those things then i'm really into it because of course as a content creator i want good b-roll and if you got some pretty plants and they got that that hue to it it's like oh this is great and then even in my own mind as i'm looking at i'm like damn this [ __ ] right here it was the only good one out of the whole mix that we got tray of the cookies the ice cream cake because it was i think the look is the only reason why we could say yeah this one's all right the other hand but it's like if you've got plus you got the dank man wow shout out it's just it's hard you know it's you got to kind of try a lot of different cultivars to be able to find the one that works best for you did you were talking last night too uh grow 10 about you got new ones you were popping uh yeah i just popped uh a bunch of a bunch of master cushes and then i uh popped some skywalker og and i want to cross those together to make to make my new ones called jedi council kush uh if you've been watching any of the videos before i've got uh granddaddy purples that's what i got that big 555 i put up on the instagram where it's just packed wall-to-wall in there and then i'm crossing that with my old strange giant purple monster and uh that new that new line is going to be called uh purple frost giants no [ __ ] nice man i know doggo was appreciating some of the uh the references that the homage to star wars there and the one dude yeah i went and checked out ocean groans website today they got some really cool freaking names on their streams like i was feeling very jealous today while i was checking out i was feeling it i was like oh i was like some of these names are just so perfect yeah dude they definitely uh for one i'm clear fans of it but being consumers cultivators and like the whole package they're a solid ass team out there man i've never heard of anybody growing anything that they have with bad experiences they may not be a huge fan of the particular terp but there's very noticeable terp there's very noticeable flavonoids good growers like everything about it even mg1 my grower one seeds he was hit with them for a little bit and his primal punch i know goblins got one going a couple of them the ones i grew also very solid like everything about it man team og huge shout out to them they definitely know their thing man yeah i'm hoping to uh uh pick up some of that primal punch this weekend i'm going up to some uh genetic show or something up in wisconsin this weekend oh [ __ ] nice yeah but i know he's gonna be there so yeah i figured he's all over the midwest yeah yeah awesome man yeah about a nine hour drive about a nine hour drive for me to get there but i saw it and i was like oh that sounds cool cool af i'm going to hear about that [ __ ] holy [ __ ] man right yeah i know at least you got somebody to trade off driving no no no i'll drive 17 20 hours in a row no problem hey about that [ __ ] trucker lifestyle yeah [ __ ] um did you buy out to paint now we ain't talking no bean talk cultivars is different um now see i think yeah java pie there's a lot of people right now who got some of their uh their different beans we'll say i just popped some java kush and then i've got uh from people in the stairs genetics i just popped a few more of those a 40d cross with ghost doji the scooby doos is what they're called and then i've got what the [ __ ] was the other one sawa i think so i believe it is it's sour diesel bx3 from karma genetics supposed to be a super gassy dank one so i'm really looking forward to that i just i've had a lot of finickiness with a lot of karma's genetics and i don't want to have to deal with too much more of that and so i'm like i'm gonna eventually replace my headbanger that i'm growing it's just lanky it's stressful it's dank as [ __ ] like it's amazing smoke i wish someone else i knew grew it and i could trade them all the time like [ __ ] i'm so sick of growing it did you pop those boston roots no those are next on my list i'm just ordered two four by fours i'm moving this over to the veg area this tent back here and then i'm doing two four by fours i'm gonna document a whole seed harvest or bean to harvest sorry susan i'm looking forward to that man there's a lot of new stuff in the mix when it comes to the gold cards that are coming out and i'm always skeptical when there's the names that i've never heard of and i can't find even a hashtag search on instagram or i mean nothing you know i'm going to be the test dummy i'm going to see what this is like and i've been there done that i've like we literally but on the other hand of that you can find some stuff that nobody is going to say and then with the headbanger there's a flip side to that coin even with primal med sent those out initially for a test like when he first popped him and i was very happy with my results of course was a dumb ass and didn't clone it because i was like oh this isn't my turf but i would have kept it around just based on yield and having noticeable terps in general again like i can't stress enough how much i don't like basic [ __ ] like if i don't care how pretty it is like if it's covered in trichomes beautiful color everything like they even produce is great but there's zero flavor to it or very mild it's like it has a slight it's very smooth when someone starts out saying it's smooth i'm like i'm all set i don't know maybe i'm just spoiled but that's just me well to me i would consider the black cherry i got smooth because it's not really like very long expand though but it still packs a punch yeah see smooth in that sense but like when someone's like it's very smooth flavor when it's that kind of smooth it's okay yeah but when it's like smooth in the harshness area where it's like it does it's not that expando [ __ ] that make you know my chokey owlettes but when they're saying like yeah it's got a nice mild they're undertones of like uh so not much i'm good just preference you know and i've been growing too long now to to fall in the area of settling for something you know so there's there's too many cultivars out there i could literally just get some tomorrow and be like no [ __ ] this restart there's no reason to settle but there's also no reason to jump the gun and think the grass is always green on the other side because i've lost some great cultivars by thinking that and been like [ __ ] dude why did i get rid of these clones before when i just popping these beans when i clearly didn't know what i was popping yet it's unfortunate gotta track your hunt man try it right that's what i was doing is why somebody was talking [ __ ] like i was gonna be late and i was on time but um taking clones of these phenos of these grim bastard ogs that i popped god knows [ __ ] how long ago so um you know just now getting to like a good run over you know so it takes time well growth man i appreciate you hopping in here man where can people find you uh they can find me on youtube at welcome to the grow tent just like the name here uh if you're on instagram a lot of times i let my upload my videos on the weekends during the week i tend to generally hang out on instagram same name just an underscore in between each word uh what else we got well i got a we tube channel i don't post a ton on the weedtube channel i i dislike the there's no autofill for the keyword yeah i'm just like it would not be hard to put an import like a list on here do i have to type out 40 freaking words every time it aggravates me so much i don't upload a lot of videos to it because i'll do like two or three in a row and then i'm like done for like two or three weeks it's like i got 140 videos it's going to take me a freaking year yeah i hear that man that's been the issue about putting it on the website on our own website and having it on youtube and then we got vimeo on the back end we've got doing stuff on twitch now it's just yeah it gets overwhelming man dude they did not like uh youtube man they started like super hardcore deleting a bunch of my videos for uh dangerous content uh and there were a lot of veg videos yeah i know pigeons have been putting out super harmful like crazy [ __ ] so he's just finally back now all that dangerous plant talk [ __ ] no but uh they really went after my uh my how not to grow series which was just a fun grow series i did just to get clicks so it was you know it's great title got people a lot of angry people in there but it still it was still quick so that's kind of the point of the series if you went into the series there was i didn't there was nothing really controversial in it but i know you guys like some of my clickbaity titles oh i do i love them no but that's the thing is i actually will watch the video and i'm like this is great yeah information i'm yeah the point of it is just to get you in there like kind of like my cannabis nutrients or useless video or whatever like that's just the point to just to get you to click it and then generally once you get in it you're like oh you know this is all this is all pretty good info is it's generally this guy's got some some pretty plants so it's like here's something going on exactly exactly well yeah man i appreciate you [ __ ] joining in dude and we're gonna have to game out uh friday you said fridays and sundays yeah yeah fridays and sundays i probably won't be on this sunday i'll be on friday uh but sunday you know i'm going to be up in wisconsin so oh yeah brother yeah i appreciate you joining in and we'll definitely link it up again soon man all right buddy great hanging out with you guys oh yeah man everybody make sure you follow him we'll put it in the the replay video you'll be able to see in the description or pin at the top comment there all right good night man have a good one see you later man all right grommies we got some time for some questions got a little bit of time for some questions a little bit little beauty orange yeah that's wink [ __ ] right there smoking on that orange egg baby baby how's florida wink better than michigan living it up put like ja rule down there that [ __ ] was with a big ass gator a couple hours ago i said yep see [ __ ] that's exactly what i'm talking about bro i seen one of their [ __ ] on the road like do you think they big in the water see them on like beefed up on the road it's different it's different i actually got my black cherry cheesecake from a bag seed it was a very lucky find young backseat back bean uh you could join on the free side cosmic stoner there's no openings at the moment on the premium side until the end of the month so how about you boy live from milwaukee tips for main lining sour diesel don't do it i wouldn't suggest mainlining unless you just want to have fun with a test i don't i personally don't think that's going to do anywhere near better than low stress training i don't and the aspect of the extended time of vegging for that training i just don't see it doing better what do you guys think well if you're trying to fill a whole tent with one plant go for it i would still scrog yeah but you can you can get those main branches out and still get the scrog and it'll be nice man but the amount of time that it's going to take to fill up that canopy between main lining and low stress training like hey some people got to do what they got to do to pull out a good single tent yeah so people can buy apparel soon yes people can buy apparel soon i have by the end of the week i will have um at least american express up there and then maybe we'll have a crypto option we'll see but right now unfortunately can't take any payments at least visa master you guys leave your du or fans running during your lights off sorry i'm sorry yeah my demonifier doesn't go on unless it needs to it kicks on automatically fans stay on there what you guys and my my exhaust fans are constantly running what about you i manually plugged them in like a lot of people with their lights apparently i was laughing because this [ __ ] asked you some [ __ ] about basketball and i was like somebody's asking rob a basketball question so shut the [ __ ] up [Laughter] i watch mma boxing kickboxing some muay thai uh [ __ ] bare knuckle boxing i want street beefs has the stream topic been discussed yes it has i hate your name i'm not even clicking you waffle tell you what's your shop at we've talked about a few times that we can't even be telling too many people now it's out of control right it's exclusive i appreciate you what's your username what do you play xbox or playstation uh neither now i'm on the pc just rob cltv you should be able to find it bro but the thing is is check this out you do that right and i'm not able to trace it properly well conspiracy for some [ __ ] [ __ ] because as soon as you're related to the leaf and you're selling things trust me i already talked to two different attorneys and i'm not risking it so we're waiting until we're good i'm not worried about it i apologize grow means we will be doing a giveaway here real soon at 125 000 subs so uh pay attention to that we're almost there i think maybe we might be there i don't know let me know speaking of loving this one press the like if you haven't already because that's just like the solid way to get us you know amped up and and ready to do it see that one it did y'all accepting videos still absolutely absolutely uh either in the discord or else on our website you can go to the contact area and shoot me a message with the link does anyone use terpinator or other boosters i don't you guys i don't either i know you don't god but i'm playing with you no none of us do i just got the fc 4800 you think we could get it let's get it how is it way better than the ts3500 they don't youtube doesn't [ __ ] with us sorry i wish i appreciate you though uh neem seed meal and karanja cake are very close those are pretty much the same product that come from a slightly different plant he had two questions right there like right above one another oh bye green goblin show um i would go for a 15 gallon i'd go for a 15 gallon for an auto and outdoors yeah you wanted a hoodie it's already hot as [ __ ] in texas i thought it was cold in texas early going on over there oh no best cocoa for organic grow uh i would use royal gold is clean quality sourced cocoa you're gonna have to amend that obviously because it's a nerd there's just basically nothing in it how's the nemo working on you so the discount for report yes in the video description check below i think it's cltv or lifestyle or one of those things i don't know in the description it is below but yeah discount there get 30 off it's pretty cool pretty cool i don't think it's a verse caliber molasses my man they're both good yeah they're both really good for different reasons facts we got time for just one more rob's trying this show disrespectful [ __ ] what i don't know what i don't know what you're talking about though organic oils for ipm uh you can use rosemary oil um lavender lavender peppermint oil um neem is organic i wouldn't use it ever don't use any of these things in flour people would be like don't use that [ __ ] in flour just don't don't spray in flour there's a really good essential oil plan to build the soil or maybe at your local hydro shop that uh you can get how do you like license check out cannabis legalization news over on youtube great channel dude knows his [ __ ] state to state definitely the channel to check out for that information so unfortunately we need that it depends on what medium you're in about how like light you get or you know how dry you let your plants get but you know not too dry would be a good rule of thumb fox verbs farms and ocean together i don't know what you're talking about tim dawg i think it's an ocean forest which are the same company but just different like amendments in the medium one coming from ocean derived other coming from like compost you would find in woodsy type areas i would suggest if you blend them don't add any food to it because there's quite a bit of food in that already at least for the first couple weeks um other than that usually start in happy frog and then if you go to transition into flower people will finish off in ocean forest because it has quite a bit of food in there that's true that is true uh so yeah i think we got i think we got it down babe guru what does ella do for your place you pretty much are like our channel's guru you kind of look like him too you could be his cousin well there's a celebic acid in it and a lot of different hormones and auxins that help your plant go into a mode in which it helps protect itself and it's also a really good wetting agent to help water your plants and it's really great for cloning those are bars those are bars how about cultivation nation soil never heard of it scotty j skodij i'd have to check it out i would definitely say adding co2 is a benefit uh just do it safely so yeah do it and always get a co2 meter before you do that yeah meter and then like there's different ranges of co2 that your plant needs at certain times so like if you're going to add it do it efficiently you can use fresh aloe yeah fresh i was just going to say you took it from me fresh aloe what's your favorite genetics uh favorite to smoke headbanger favorite to grow um but honestly one that i let go that i should have kept randomly it was amherst sour diesel from humble secret seat organization and vortex from uh what the [ __ ] was sub cool so cool tj sub cool solid very solid how about you boys i mean that's just so that's kind of hard honestly but um the blue grapes have been one of my favorites for a very long time the black cherry is one of my newer favorites there's a a lot of the older strains that i like that nobody really knew the names of it's like oh i always wanted that you know drape you got it well somebody asked earlier like oh i want that gas like all the [ __ ] all the terp that you really like and i'm like well head banger but at the same time would that be the one you know what i mean like there's others out there i'm sure that like can have something to be leave the head banger with something to be desired you know that might be a little bit easier to grow but i don't know what the hell they are and that's what rob's hunting for and for me i'm gonna be uh starting a new phenom hunt my damn self so we'll see where it leads yeah as far as suggestions know i don't know i mean wi-fi yes but she's kind of phasing out so me and rob are kind of under other things from wi-fi and had beggar we just don't know where they are yet what they are yet i don't know where we are we don't know where we are somebody's saying about gaming hostile we actually i've been snapping doing [ __ ] slim jim over on twitch lately actually on call of duty uh twitch.tv slash cannabis lifestyle tv i let you boy how about your boy um goblin the guy who was gonna mix the ocean forest and happy frog he said so you shouldn't add oyster meal or in bone meal so no right that's like a lot i mean i mean i guess your meal is just gonna help do ph adjustment and do a little calcium but i probably wouldn't add the bone meal now yeah well i think before we dip i think if we get the grubbies a little little sneak peek of our next strain review actually it's three different strains three cultivars we didn't grow them we would i felt like that would have done them a lot better but style tv.com check it out yo yo what up it's robin trey here and we have heard a lot of hype about the strains that are around so we decided to make a new show and this one is actually dank dece or boof does it meet the hype is it decent or is it both we're gonna find out for y'all and today we're checking out cookies from gage and grand rapids michigan stay tuned [Music] all right so unfortunately with the pandemic we weren't able to actually go into the place we had some curbside [ __ ] so it's like to go at a good restaurant you can't actually go in and enjoy the ambiance a little weird but well it's just an experiential thing when you're talking about going into any kind of cannabis store uh dispensary what have you but so you're not able or even just the the transaction of getting flour that you haven't grown yourself is uh something you want to kind of touch and feel as much as you can which you know it's just shaking in a jar in front of you these days but really just had to go from an online menu which was cool because we were kind of seeking out certain brands to kind of you know give this first chopping block uh situation to um so gage was able to provide that so shout out to them and um yeah we're gonna test out some of these cookies uh cultivars that we picked up um one being the cush mints the lemon cello and the ice cream cake the cushman's sitting at 24.9 thc which says if you watch cannabis lifestyle tv you know we don't really give a [ __ ] about all that but they say it zero cbd as where the ice cream cake has 20.5 percent thc in 0.10 cbd and then the limoncello number 10 is 20.1 cbd or 20.1 thc excuse me already pre-high and uh nada on the cbd so we'll see these are produced by a capital llc is that what i'm reading here free reign and sozo health so i don't know why they don't get the plug but we'll give them the plug so i think let's check them out let's start with the this [ __ ] cushmits check it out i had to stop him from uh doing this earlier yes i was gonna pre-open it in the vehicle i couldn't help myself i wasn't excited we want like the the the judgment to be fair like some you know like a newscaster supposed to be unbiased all of that you know just go for what you would want we would want in a flower right yeah and also you know we're gonna clearly smoke some blunts but we're also going to smoke a bowl we've got a little chilli to try it out just a little flavor without any of the tobacco leaf around it so for you bowlers who get upset jesus put his nose deep in there the fact that his nose is so deep and he didn't slap his head back just tells me that i'm like ah what now hold on hold on sometimes like we just talked about those flavonoids those turpies don't come through all the way or the turkeys gonna come through on the nose right yeah nathan you go ahead and put that in the bowl man let's just let's just take it for what it is we're gonna have a minute well let's see let's see let's see sometimes you know certain cookies you know the ones that we've had with the cultivars not necessarily cookie brand but they don't necessarily have the terp that are that emphasized it's more in the flavonoid apartment where it comes through i don't want to say like we'll like bowl piece these out and the ones that make the cut will actually roll a boy because i'm not going to dedicate a whole lot to smoking this even you know what i mean it's going to be like like right off wrist right off rip yeah i'm very disappointed yeah like i'm just gonna say right off let me just be blunt with you yeah um christmas ain't got it no for for fifty dollars it's like pillows that's that's probably more accurate i don't know man it's a fire door heavy burp straight real bad like i don't give a [ __ ] so i think this is seed beezy you know see junkie genetics i believe is the originator of cushman's this is the fourth time i've had cushman's this is cookies cushman's boof so yeah we'll be dropping that here next month chromies there's this little sampler that's part one of three burner burner burner well i appreciate all the grummies were here tune in for that it'll be over on watch cltv first it'll be and watch our channel on youtube next so [ __ ] disappointing guys but yeah great episode appreciate all the grumbies who are here to our guests you know i've already been saying trying to [ __ ] with him finally got him here welcome to the grow tent tried to snap to a slim jim last night didn't happen but we will soon we will soon oh yeah so yeah for uh cannabis lifestyle tv you should boy rob trey strong's still appreciate all the [ __ ] growing up on sunday turned up", "USH-IBLzBJU": "here are some instructions for the DC dry

hydrosyn aqua is an advanced and comprehensive wound management product designed and manufactured under the proprietary new water technology hydrosyn aqua is made of ultra purified water and pure dry vacuumized sodium chloride which goes through an electrolysis and super oxidation process developed by vigilance new water technology hydrazine aqua after going through a very controlled and stabilized processing will finally yield hypochlorous acid sodium hypochlorite sodium chloride and water when there is a wound foreign contaminants or particles enter the wound the natural body defense mechanism detects this breach and delivers red blood cells and neutrophils to the wounded area to combat against the invading pathogens the neutrophils engulf the pathogens through a process known as phagocytosis hypochlorous acid or hocl is a potent oxidant produced by activated neutrophils this hypochlorous acid is electrically neutral whereas the pathogenic cell walls are negatively charged therefore the hypochlorous acid can penetrate the pathogens cell wall and slime layer creating an osmolarity difference in the cell the pathogenic cell then swells and ruptures leading to cell lysis this is known as osmotic shock hypochlorous acid supports in the natural wound healing process with no toxicity to patients hydrosyn aqua is indicated for stage one to four ulcers venous status

touching the patient carefully clean the area to avoid any hairs textile fibers or other particles to enter with a new catheter anesthetize the urethra by completely filling it with anesthetic catheter gel use one gram gel per centimeter urethra meaning that for a man you need approximately 20 to 30 gram after filling approximately half of the amount of gel wait for one minute so the external sphincter muscle is relaxed then fill the remaining amount of gel and let it work a little while before inserting the catheter using your sterile hand insert the catheter gently it shouldn't hurt [Music] when you feel some resistance the catheter has likely reached the external sphincter muscle be extra careful at this point insert the catheter all the way until the funnel junction get some urine in exchange before you fill the catheter balloon with a fluid and precise amount that the catheter producer recommends remember to constantly observe the patient also this step shouldn't hurt after you have completed this procedure make sure that the catheter is positioned correctly and can move freely finally attach a urinary bag or a valve [Music] change of a suprapubic catheter to facilitate the procedure it is preferred that the bladder is filled as much as possible as the line from the entrance on the abdomen to the bladder itself becomes straight fill the bladder using sterile sodium chloride maximum three deciliter or until the patient feels the urge to urinate complete this stage by closing the catheter with a plug to prevent the fluid to back out carefully clean around the insertion hole to avoid loose particles or textile fibers to enter with a new catheter deflate the balloon that normally is filled with 10 milliliters of fluid which is enough for most catheters when the balloon is empty take a note of how much has been withdrawn for later documentation the next step is to remove the catheter which sometimes can be a little challenging hold one hand against the patient's abdomen and gently pull the catheter with the other hand a small cramp in the abdominal muscle might force you to take a little break in the process small talking to the patient to get them to relax can help at this stage it is important that the patient feels as relaxed as possible when the whole catheter has been removed a little urine can appear so it is advisable to put a cotton pad to keep the patient clean all right now it is time to place the new catheter as with urethral catheterization there are different ways to enter the catheter itself in a sterile way [Music] remove the cotton pad and place the hand on the patient's abdomen we advise to use catheter gel in this case it both prevents pain and lubricates for easier catheter insertion let it work a little while observe the patient while you're placing the new catheter to make sure he or she doesn't experience any pain get some urine in exchange before you inflate the catheter balloon to avoid that the balloon is inflated in the abdominal wall instead of the bladder make sure to enter it far enough [Music] if you don't have a tray as in this case close the catheter with a valve immediately fill the balloon with 10 milliliter of the fluid that the catheter producer recommends remember to constantly observe the patient this shouldn't hurt finally pull the catheter slightly towards you so it has the right position feel that it can move freely to protect the patient's clothes you can put some protection around the catheter itself [Music] uh the inaugural military safe surgery safe life seminar

oversight and aviation medicine malaysia airline system otago new zealand health administration from eastern michigan university and yoga diploma and average medicine from king's college london and thank you ministry of health sorry director general of our forces health services when you're going to the civilian you think of ministry fellow speakers dr aisha as well as dr anwa and the organizing committee thank you for having me here for this session and it's been uh it's an honor and a pleasure to be invited back among fellow friends in the system okay i've been given the task to talk about the swiss cheese model in patient care as much as possible i will try to attend this life yeah next slide peace okay um so uh is is really uh is my personal opinion uh not a malaysia airlines policy i will just share you i have to put in disclaimer in this next slide please my scope of presentation is with regards to an introduction of the overall safety culture as well as the how aviation safety management is as well as the swiss gis and hopefully we can come to a conclusion yeah next slide please liana yeah that's the scope of presentation i like this picture of the airbus 380 along with our sukhoi it reflects my practice as an innovation medicine practitioner all this one yes next next slide please jana so um why do the aviation when do the healthcare sector behave differently towards safety compared to aviation sector in in my view is it's just that it is a cultural thing and organizational thing how we are brought up how we are taught and how we practice in our day-to-day but i find that the healthcare system has realized this and are moving in the right direction okay one of it is having this surgery save lives and the policies that's been said and so on and so forth so in aviation when things go wrong it goes horribly wrong yeah and it's not only the passenger who demise but also the crew themselves so that's why the pilots and the cabin crew are very safety conscious because every time the flight takes off it is their lives as well it's not only about the passenger's lifestyle and in terms of practice again aviation pilots are about bringing person a to b from one point to the other yeah a lot of preventive measures safe measures and so on in the healthcare system most of us yeah a consequence manager somebody who has alarms somebody fractured a food somebody who you know had a heart attack and so on so a lot of us are sort of mechanics to repair all this rather than mechanics to prevent the body from being damaged yeah so when when you talk about health management economics health economics and so on and so forth it's actually probably a location of preventive measures should also be considered and finally is about education partly creating awareness but also about formal education of safety in the organization in in our case in the health care system uh i know some moves been made stimulation has started some safety training for the undergrads yeah i'm sure you will cascade down through the whole system the nursing school the ancillary school and it also should be in the postgraduate school it doesn't have to take many hours but just basics so how is aviation government in in uh in the whole evasion world we are governed by the chicago convention 1944 and with that we have an access and standards and recommended practices yeah in short it's called subs and uh because of that we are signatory to the chicago convention uh we have uh cb revision act 1969 and it cuts cascades down as the malaysian civil aviation regulation 216. and with that because of acts and regulation all airlines and operators are bounded by this requirement yeah the accountable manager my group ceo can be taken to jail if he is neglecting the safety aspects of operations okay and like i mentioned it can be catastrophic for an aviation industry one a380 carries four pilots 20 cabin crew and you can fill up almost 500 passengers the other aspect is from from the health as a point of view yeah it's about patient care and most times is one to one yeah and the governing body is world health organization but world health organization is more of a just like ik always is a technical body which advises countries and member states on the best practice who introduced the safety surgery uh safety checklist surgery checklist in uh as recent as 2000 and last year two years ago they introduced the world patient safety day on 17 september 2019. at malaysia level maybe dr aisha can correct me what we have at present is a cabinet directive 2003 on the formation of patient safety council and the question is whether we are enforced to have a patient safety management system unlike aviation it is already there we have to have a safety management system but in the healthcare system do we have a patient safety management system most catastrophic probably a pregnant lady with six babies in in her and a gynecology procedure obstetric procedure gone wrong one one mother and potentially six babies lost that's that's what i can think of yeah and from the workers perspective we are governed by occupational safety health act 1994 the factory machinery act 1967 as well as the some some organizations have adopted the occupational safety health management system which are audited and accredited and so on and this is more to cater for workplace all right so um again why safety yeah easy way of putting it is about accident injury or death prevention while at work or anywhere and in terms of the health aspect of occupational safety health is monitoring of the hazards exposed to prevent worker from getting illness due to the hazard exposure the present one is a biological hazard which gives us scope 19. it's not only at workplace is a community at large so as an organization or as a system we are obliged to our people to our environment and sustainability to our asset as well as to our reputation so those those are the general broad principles why we do this okay right okay uh just to introduce about safety culture yeah what is safety culture it's basically set of values beliefs perceptions behavior of the organization towards safety the challenge is when nobody is looking yeah so used to have a advertisement years ago during just before the world cup and so one of the you know soda pop company came up with makan bola tidobola you know minombola lakwan bola and things like that so how we think how we talk how we act how we behave on safety on ourselves as a culture even without thinking we go into a car we put on the seat belt we ride a motorbike we put on the helmet we go anywhere we wash our hands you know and if we see a trip wire we we we may sort of raise a report and put a tape across it so that nobody trips and so on and so forth yeah so in terms of components of safety culture it needs strong leadership no doubt about that there's strong leadership leadership commitment leadership presence leadership examples and most importantly leadership accountability you know because the leaders have the authority have the resources to pump in money create new organizations and create programs or whatsoever towards safety but it's not only leaders it must have some workforce commitment as well not some will force commitment as well which is the followers need to be in sync with what the leaders want in terms of safety not only safety everything business and whatsoever so to guide and manage the safety you should have a safety management system which i will share a bit more and the five elements of safety culture james reason not only talked about swiss g's model he also talked about the five elements of safety culture which is an informed culture a reporting culture a learning culture a just culture and a flexible culture right and to do this you will introduce the five east of engage educate enable empower and to a lesser extent and force the system just to share with you a bit more on the let's see if i can go my slides yeah what is an informed culture yeah informed culture is an uh evidence-based and actively disseminating safety information we do that in our medical world no doubt about that yeah we write papers we you know study analyze data come to a conclusion and we publish our reports and share it uh worldwide it's easier now this probably the everyday you get the news of kovid nineteen numbers whether you can use either mac pin or not whether jensen and jensen vaccine is a single dose and has its efficacy and so on and so forth yeah we also have the reporting culture where everybody can report a hazard identification something they find not right or an incident without fear of being punished yeah in my organization this is very much sought after it's a kpi for us and you know on average a year there's about 6 000 safety reports even without operations even with operations at only 30 percent yeah so these safety reports are analyzed and is a closed loop system at the end of it the person who reports gets back the feedback of what has been taken on the safety report yeah it's also about learning culture yeah healthcare system is a learning culture no doubt about it you know we share with each other but sometimes our learning culture can be very in silo the surgeons talked about surgery the urologist talked about urology i'm taking on mr new here yeah um you know the ophthalmologists talk about hi but sometimes there's no common platform so but this this is a common platform safe surgery safe lives it's not really about surgery it should be about the healthcare system yeah just culture this is something that's uh very difficult even in the aviation industry where a line is drawn between what is error which is acceptable and what is violation which is not acceptable and will have consequence management if needed yeah so people who make error are not punished but people who violate are punished to simply put it that way and finally a flexible culture a culture that adapts to the changes but goes through the proper risk assessment proper management of change proper risk assessment and risk management you see it in the evasion industry now even in healthcare system now of the changes due to covet 19. yeah every you know there will be organizational changes there will be equipment introduction changes there will be procedure changes and every introduction of a new thing will have to go through management of change and risk assessment and risk management okay can we go to the next slide yeah so where do we wish to go with this safety and safety culture okay uh the uh proponents of aviation safety patrick here introduced the five steps of five levels of safety pathological is the organization doesn't care at all about safety you know incidents or accidents or or anything going wrong inside the swept under the cupboard or is not is neglected or not looking to reactive is yeah when something happens we look into it and we make the corrective action not necessary the corrective action measures and so on and so on calculative we use evidence and data yeah to prevent things from happening we're seeing that in most organizations now we are becoming less reactive but more calculative and preventive proactive is like i said where everybody knows their role in safety and reports in things before things happen yeah and the ultimate one is generative where without even saying anything the first business of the morning is safety yeah all the safety checks are in before we start our day next please okay coming to the actual swiss cheese yeah uh reason and orlando his partner introduced this way back in 1990 is called also the cumulative act effect and its model for accident causation in the aviation industry for for those who are not aware james reason is a psychologist and practice in manchester yeah so he talks about layers of defense preventing accident and when there are gaps in this layer of defense normally there is a bent aid solution to it you know we are seeing a drip wire or uh let's let's let's talk about a good example of it is uh um a porthole yeah a porthole in on the road in front of the ame what's the hazard there is the pothole what is the risk there is a bicycle going into the pothole and somebody falling and breaking their neck yeah and what do we do we patch up the pothole but do we actually analyze why this pothole happens maybe not yeah is it the materials of the road surface is there budget is there a preventive program to look into portholes where we resurface every six months or every year and so on and so forth you know so um so when those are aligned yeah an accident happen okay the accident itself needs to be investigated and also needs to find the root cause and corrective action preventive action and to be shared and it should be a closed loop to prevent future recurrence and it is a system approach is not a individual approach it's the why is not the who next please i've got 10 minutes to go bear with me i've got maybe another five or six likes yeah i'll give you an example of an aviation accident in my industry uh or incident okay uh from the bottom yeah an incident or accident occur the root cause is the b enters and blocks the pitot tube the pitot tube is something in front of the aircraft there you see is having its pitot cover there to measure the speed of the aircraft when it travels yeah the aircraft needs to be traveled the wind goes into the pitot tube the sensor picks up and will tell the pilot what is the speed of the aircraft for the pilot to take off safely the v rotate yeah and if this pitot tube is not functioning because of a block tube because of the b it can give spurious inaccurate results the pilot cannot decide the v rotate to take off the pilot will abort the takeoff and if it's a high speed abort takeoff you cannot you can end up with skidding off the runway causing an excursion and it's just like you breaking on the road on a rainy day and you might spin over and possibly break your necks and fracture your arms or trigger the um or what you call it the uh airbags in your car right depends what car you use so we go along the accident investigation why did this happen when we find that the technician did not put on the pitot cover and why did this happen we find out that the technician is not aware of the requirement of the new sop to put a pitot cover at a particular aerodrome because there's a lot of b activity and why did this happen because the sop was not fully circulated to the aircraft technicians by the line managers and why did this happen the new sop due to kovit 19 aircraft long-term parking was rushed for release so as we go along we find that a is is not the person is actually the system the system has not catered for a quick communication down the line and ensure that people down the line actually have read the new instructions and so on and so forth so it's not who the technician who did not put on the pitot cover is actually why the communication was not cascaded down fast enough to the people on the ground next please so i'm going to share an example of healthcare i just picked up this cartoon yeah i'm afraid this were complication there were complications yeah somehow the food ended up on the right arm of the patient so we need to go through that accident or incident investigation yeah and apply that just culture thing you know error is accepted we do the root cause analysis and then we um make sure it doesn't recur document it record it and make sure it doesn't and you go up through the incident accident unsafe act the various levels that's been explained by james reason next please yeah so in a nutshell this is like here the the four layers of the swiss cheese there you have the accident and injury as a result of the accident so you look at the red box there we have the reactive as a result of the accident and the same principles to be applied it should be a non-punitive if it's an error and consequent management if it was intentional yeah but then we do the factual evidence the root cause findings costs and contributory and we make the recommendations and the corrective action plan and also the corrective action measures and closure and we share back this incident reporter accident report is again why this happened and not cool so we want to prevent the recurrence yeah on the yellow box yeah is to plug up the holes yeah failure or absence of this defense mechanism again what it needs to be done is a proactive preventive non-punitive you don't punish people for reporting a safety hazard or safety small safety incident should be voluntary and should be closed again hazard identification you report and acknowledge you do the risk assessment you do the root cause corrective action plan corrective action closure accept the closure and give feedback to the reporter so this will plug the holes yeah not correctly measured but the whole gamut of root cause and so on and so forth the most difficult one is when it is a human behavior yeah when person becomes forgetful or person becomes intentional india or becomes reckless in their practice so in our system we have a confidential human information incident reporting program where the reporter without fear can report on the unsafe act or unsafe behavior of a fellow colleague and this is treated confidentially and the receiver normally a senior ranking person will have the ability to call the person and have a chat and say look you are reported you are doing something that is not acceptable or you are doing something which is uh at risk behavior and we would like to coach you on this so that this doesn't happen again yeah it is a challenge it needed a 1978 crash ban mklm crash for this to start crew resource management and so on and so forth and i'm sure some organizations some healthcare organizations have started this confidential human informed incident reporting program as well next please in the interest of time so this is about just culture you can google this sydney decker yeah the red line is drawn between errors and at risk and reckless behavior or malicious behavior yeah one is to accept and console and coach the other one is to introduce consequence management next please so in our system like i said we do open reporting yeah on average about 5000 safety reports a year and it's a close loop every safety report is escaped to and is closed yeah next slide please some examples even bird strikes it can be simple but strike hitting the parts of the aircraft but the catastrophic one could be a geese entering engines causing engine shutdown and you watched the movie saliya the hudson river crash water landing right next slide please is one of the other areas that aviation industries particular and this is a global thing is the significant seven risks where can be airborne conflict can be a loss of control in flight yeah the sri vijaya crashed recently sj-182 was probably due to a loss of control in flight control flight into terrain yeah flying into the mountains or the ground runaway escalation is the common one nowadays runway incursion smoke fumes as well as ground safety incident those are the areas that we monitor using the safety management system next slide please yeah so what we have in our safety management system is a structure it needs to be structured you have to have department of trained people you have to have policies it has to be somebody is accountable for it you need to have process documented process as well as documented procedures and the safety management system encompass a few areas next like please yeah four pillars of safety policy safety risk management safety assurance as as well as safety promotion yeah there should be a safety policy that should be a program of hazard identification open reporting risk assessment risk management should be a program of audits and should be a program of cascading the safety information and promotion in the interest of time ladies gentlemen yeah next slide please again safety culture try to look into this in our health care system and improve on it yeah if you don't have programs maybe you could consider having a program and this is one of the way forward i've learned a lot in the aviation industry and i'm trying to cascade this and promote it in the healthcare system as well next slide please so ladies and gentlemen the swiss cheese model in patient care yeah what we have to do if we don't have one yet maybe we have to develop a patient safety management system where the structure there's accountability policy process procedures yeah we cultivate the safety culture the five elements mentioned just now yeah and we should one of the big threats of safety system is a closed loop reporting system where voluntary hazard reporting is welcome to plug the holes in the cheese yeah and mandatory incident reporting is established yeah and to address why and not who and with it you have to have the philosophy of just culture as well as address the system and not the individual ladies gentlemen it's been a pleasure for me to be with you on this i wish the organizing community again thank you very much for inviting me here to share whatever knowledge i have and all the best in the future sessions i'm available for question and answer thank you to quote alexander pope to uh he's human and to forgive divine there's a book on this written by cohn released way back in the 90s and it's an interesting trip of patient safety and healthcare management system thank you very much foreign screen all right [Music] when you're done [Music] um division ministry of health malaysia head of technical secretary patient safety council and also steering committee of sssl uh ministry of health malaysia so um doctor nor i shall allah consultant public physician and i'm very passionate about improving patient safety through policies programs capacity buildings leadership creativity and engagement she one of the main contributors for patient safety unit in malaysia especially the establishment of safe surgery save lives program since 2009 and she has involved not only locally but also internationally and global arena was an expert group in global patient safety network and she received numerous awards for her contribution her passion and commitment into patient safety in the country not only help us to achieve what is best for our patient but of course we were trying to improve the next level especially in our country malaysia abu bakr thank you so much for watching thank you yeah and lieutenant general that's what pretty much done the organizing comment committee yeah thank you for inviting me today and also congratulations for organizing this webinar i think it's very very important and and looking at the program is very good yeah so um uh i will try to stick to the time thank you to dr azin and for uh uh you know realistic to the timeline i i tried to do so for uh that yeah right okay can i have my slide please right uh today i'm going to talk on the button of miss advance misadventures in very operative care yeah okay next one please right uh before i zoom down to a safe surgery i just would like to talk briefly on patient safety yeah because uh patient safety is the principal objective of healthcare yeah uh mainly is to do no harm to our patient ensure benefit of treatment outweigh the research and improving patient safety is very important because it is our ethical responsibilities as healthcare providers it's also our moral responsibilities to patients and their families and also an economic investment to invest on safety and prevent uh incident yeah because it costs a lot you know even for uh mission of health medical legals also it costs lots of money yeah uh these are pictures of my boys yeah when they were uh many many years ago they were having tonsillectomy one one after another and i can still recall the anxiety that i have yeah even though it was just tonsillectomy yeah so it's very important for us to make sure that our surgery is safe next one please right so patient harm is the 14th leading cause of global disease burden and actually it is you know as bad as tuberculosis and malaria and the most frequently adverse event were related to surgical procedures yeah so this is very very so it's very crucial to ensure our surgery is safe next one please right okay this is actually the dg circular number one slash 2020 the first one uh uh that method of health produced in 2020 and is related to patient safety making patient safety a main agenda in healthcare and this this circular actually came out following a world health assembly resolution that has been passed in 2019 yeah it's about global action on patient safety next month right so uh the 10 principles of global action plan on patient safety is here i'm not going to elaborate the whole thing but safe surgery is definitely under the number eight yeah integrating patient safety in our clinical program and health care service so so i you know that is very crucial to integrate patient safety as part of our clinical practice next one please right this is just to highlight the the huge number of surgeries that we conduct every every year yeah maybe uh last year and this year little bit less because of kobe i know many centuries have been postponed but otherwise in 2018 we uh conduct like almost one million situations in nature of health hospitals so and it is estimated that the adverse event in the industrialized countries is actually about three percent so uh um it's very very important to be proactive and prevent adverse events from happening next month please right so i'm going to share with you some statistics on wrong surgery in malaysia and this is actually based on malaysian patient safety goals and that toronto mentioned this uh just now also yeah so uh sorry uh that's mentioned this in his keynote address here so um i would like to share with you some of the statistics next one please right so if we look at this yeah from 2013 to 2020 we had 37 cases uh on average about six or five cases every year yeah um except for 2018 we had like 11 cases yeah and most of the cases uh are very much related to the autopsy surgery ophthalmology surgery um general surgery as well as zero surgery yeah next monday right uh in terms of type of error we can see that mostly actually due to wrong is very much related to wrong side surgery yeah wrong side right left or left right yeah uh and then five uh wrong side yeah uh and then four wrong implant yeah uh we also had cases of unconstrained surgery as well as from patient next one please right uh in terms of the number of cases uh i mentioned just now you know uh uh the main ones are actually a surgery related to the uh ophthalmology surgery and then craniotomy uh we had three cases of btl as well and three cases related to knee surgery two cases uh on breast surgery yeah next one right now i will go briefly on the statistic related to unintended retained foreign body uh we actually for this one i actually use the statistic from our ministerial health insider reporting system for your information initial health for the past two years we actually started open reporting system and this means all all incidents need to be reported yeah it's mandatory to be to report all incidents related to patient safety yeah and this data is actually from our online incident reporting or what we call eir next one p right so we had a a total of 125 cases of unintended retained surgical item and about 81 82 82 actually uh actual uh retained surgical unintended retained surgical item yeah the rest are just near me next one okay when we want uh if we look at the uh specific uh surgical item mainly is related to instrument or instrument parts a gauss trot throat pack yeah but that's not as many as scores and instrument parts and we also had a part of needle or needle and then abdominal guide wire k wire swap drain tube and tampon as well next one please right uh um since uh 2018 when we started our new institute reporting system we also collect the outcome of the incident and fortunately out of the 125 cases only three lead to severe outcome severe outcome means that the patient requires some sort of intervention yeah um and uh the rest of 14 we had moderate uh outcome to 20 mile and the rest no harm fortunately okay next one please right okay i i also would like to emphasize on the uh issue of improper or incomplete consent because that also can lead to wrong surgery okay so so we are i'm going to share some in statistics related to this as well from our incident reporting system next one right so for incomplete consent or improper consent we had 145 incidents reported to us um maybe some people feel that is you know a small number probably it's just a tip of ice but i i reckon that um maybe there are more cases that have not been reported to us yeah right so if we look at the what kind of issues related to consent the main ones are actually wrong patient identification wrong side and side return yeah no consent at all consent no not valid or wrong procedure written yeah okay next one okay that uh that one just to highlight you know some of the things related to consent yeah now i would like to share with you um the incidence real incidence actually here related to wrong surgery and unintended retained foreign body just to give you some idea what's actually happening yeah and this is very much related to what that tourism explained in his um presentation just now about a swiss cheese model yeah right next one please right so case one uh 68 years old gentleman with planet flecture flexure adenocarcinoma underwent left hemicholectomy and during surgery a ghost was missing despite thorough research and ii assessment so they did a post-op patient was informed regarding the incident and they did a serial x-ray of the abdomen but they cannot find any foreign body nevertheless the patient came again four months later with altered bowel habit and anemia requiring admission so they did a ct restraining and that actually showed a tumor at the anastomotic side with foreign bodies seen at the posterior stomach so they did subtotal colectomy and removal of the foreign body as well so the recovery fortunately recovery was uneventful next slide please case number two um at 8 48 a.m one year uh eight months old boy underwent examination under ga of bilateral years and by electromagnetome and right bromine incision and adeno adenosine yeah and the exhibition later on after they finish excavation was done and prior to the excavation the necessities already confirmed with the shrubners that they the surgeon actually removed the throat back yeah so then patient was discharged to the dk war and then nevertheless at 10 50 a.m the patient was restless and impending respiratory collection the patient was then sent to ot for examination of oral cavity and pharynx and the ga and they through it now they found the throat back and removed yeah next one please case number three uh i call it swiss cheese model yeah okay this is about 59 years old patient with bilateral knee osteoarthritis and was planned for right arthroscopic partial meniscus treatment injection yeah and patient was sent to ot without side marching and the team didn't check the constant properly prior to the surgery and the side of the surgery was not written on the whiteboard i think mr anwar will elaborate on on all these whiteboard stuff and things after this so the team was not attentive during time-out session so basically it was probably just a thick you know tautology or thick and thick session yeah and they did not check everything properly so the surgeon mistakenly done the surgery uh on the left knee instead of the intent of the intended right knee yeah okay next one please right okay uh case four uh one surgery is not enough right okay uh this is about 64 years old patient with glaucoma and uh was planned for left eye implant under ga for advanced glucoma the patient admitted late on the day of surgery and no marking was done before sending her to ot so the marking was done in ot without confirming with the notes yeah and there was a last minute change of team prior to the surgery and the operation was not done by the surgeon who actually seen the patient initially initially and also there were few problems and the team didn't concentrate during time out again the time out was not it was not done properly yeah i think for me time out is the last straw before you you start your surgery so it's really really important to do time up properly and check everything properly so the surgeon mistakenly operated on the right eye is state of the intended eye so after sending to the ward the surgeon noticed that they actually had a mistake uh and the patient agreed for another operation to be done on the correct eye yeah so so this is this should not should not happen at all yeah so that's why we need a checklist so that it can help us with um making sure things are in order yeah because we cannot rely on our brains solely right next one please case five yeah okay this is about 70 year old patient admitted with bilateral osteoarthritis and they plan for right total replacement and the patient admitted a day before surgery and the side marking was done by the surgeon on the right foot yeah so it's on the right foot yeah because you want to make sure they have the right uh sideline yeah so the consent for right uh tkr was taken um the unfortunately they did a prohexating pass given to the patient and the side marking faded the next one please right so you can see here that they actually initially they actually did the marking yeah on the right foot but uh after uh the glue hexadine uh they i mean it disappear yeah okay next one please okay uh the safe surgery checklist was filled as right tkr and site of operation was confirmed with patient's daughter so everything was in order yeah um they even confirmed with the patient's daughter before sending to ot and the skin prep on right knee was not done in the ward yeah so uh however they actually the staff actually wrapped their right knee with green tower basically it indicates uh right knee need to be operated so they wrap the right knee yeah so uh however there was a mistake in others uh it says that right knee uh o a but plan for left gtr yeah somehow there was a mistake in in the writing yeah and the softness however didn't cross-check the ot lease with the constant next one please so in ot the skin prep was done by m.a and unfortunately the mao who didn't check the consent or the the case notes and only look at the others and he actually prepared the left knee because the right knee was wrapped so he thought that the left knee needed surgery so so basically i there's a miscommunication one person actually wrapped the intended side to be operated but the other person thought that the one left uh you know unwrapped is the one that needs surgery so the house office office uh actually written on the white board as per ot least yeah without verifying with the consent time out was done but again uh nobody actually realized the mistake properly was not done properly yeah and the left knee was operated yeah and they only notice they make a mistake because the implant was not suitable because the implant was for the right side so this is a very unfortunate event here that should not happen we went through all the process the time out but again you know nobody realized the mistake next one please so the surgery was stopped and and they also reconfirmed with the consent so the history was informed and the h.o.d asked them to stop the surgery and explain to the patient and family regarding the error and they actually want to proceed with the right knee dkr yeah so they actually close the left knee and later post it with the right ttr right next one please right so these are all the documents are all correct you know they have uh all the uh consent form everything was written correctly when the same surgery also was checked um the checklist everything was written correctly but unfortunately it happened okay next one right so this is the last case um this is about eight years old boy with a right and cystic hydrocele admitted to be carefully for right here near to me and the patient was scheduled for second case however he was brought into the ot at first case yeah so the consent was not completed and no counter sign and no weakness so uh the the toughness also is the new toughness working on first day at day care so she sent the patient to ot and did not inform the otners that the patients supposed to be the second case on the list because on that particular day the ot lease was not displayed at the airlock because it was not prepared by the staff so again you can see that there are many uh issues related to the system yeah failure of the system so the autonomous also accepted the patient without referring to others and um the ho wrote on whiteboard detail of first case and not second case so everybody thought that this is the first day here not knowing that this is actually the second case uh timeout session was not done properly and this mainly because the staff was not paying attention when the household read out details of the patient on the whiteboard and the staff actually did not realize the importance of time out and no emphasis has been given on the importance of time out by the superiors as well so ga was given to patients without surgeon in ot and surgeon arrive and perform right here to me and circumcision instead of right here neon to me and luckily this is actually a monday boy so having a circumcision i suppose is not a problem yeah but ethically is wrong yeah doing something without consent right okay next one right so these are the contributing factors uh based on root cause analysis report of you know why wrong surgery happened lack of knowledge on state surgery program ineffective use of checklist i think we have demonstrated that many times in the cases  operating without knowing the patient non-involvement of other team members during time out failure to communicate refer to what written in the whiteboard only without verifying it with the otd for the consent or the x-ray the radiology image and taking consent last minute yeah lack of supervision uh human factors as well yeah fatigue and stress and long working hours the next one please so um when talking about unintended retain foreign bodies these are some of the contributing factors that we found based on our root cause analysis when when uh you know when uh hospital uh because in ministry of health when incident happened they send the root cause analysis report to us so so these are some of the findings here so failure to do swap found properly pre and post surgery failure to document any inserted cause or attempt in the patient's case known especially after delivery leading to stop forgetting to remove them before discharge inadequate passing over of information or miscommunication between staff during procedure and staff managing patient in the world post surgery and the surgeon sometimes took the swap by himself during procedure and failed to inform the uh scrubness or other relevant stuff that's one thing all right so i just go through this very briefly how to improve surgical safety next one please so definitely the use of safety safe life is very very safe life checklist is very important here mr anwar will talk about it later so it's a very simple efficient priority check yeah ensure consistency in patient safety during surgery next one please so these are the checklists here we have four four elements in the primary team checklist next one next one right okay we also uh uh in our second version of guideline we also added multi-disciplinary checklist if the surgery involved multi-disciplines next one right so this is uh and and we came out with a dg circular also in 2018 um and which highlight uh all the important elements that need to be implemented yeah in all healthcare facilities conducting surgery next one right so uh i just want to highlight this very very important because not many people knows about this actually when we start termination patient safety goal in 2013 all hospitals also must have patient safety committee and this must be chaired by the hospital director yeah so the uh safe safety staff life committee and hospital should be part of this committee to discuss issues related to surgical safety and some hospitals also have intuitive reporting committee yeah next one please so these are the details you can look at the guideline for the details and this is the government strike structure of safety received life committee next one so i think um why ccg program uh not working these are some of the feedback from hospitals that i would like to highlight uh some people actually some staff deny the benefit of the checklist they don't trust in the checklist and then maybe also they are very unfamiliar with the checklist or the checklist it's just a tick box exercise yeah and that for me this is very much related to the training so we must make sure that our training we cover you know all all uh stuff doing surgery and also it should be effective yeah next one please so uh these are also uh finding from uk um you know why they failed their staff resisted offered to complete the checklist and some said that it's actually inappropriate or illogical and some say that it's actually a waste of time next one please right so what should we do now next one right so for me this is very this is very very important we need to be the game changer yeah we need to be the game changer we need to be the agent to improve safe to improve surgery to make sure it is safe yeah we need to train our staff effectively have a good teamwork and we need to speak up if something is not right please speak up for patient safety and we need to report the incident and do the analysis through course analysis and take your middle actions and we also need to allocate resource to improve our system next one next one please all right these are some of the guidelines that we produce and all these are actually available in our patient safety council just as patchy google you know um patient safety council malaysia and you can get access to all this guideline you can download it for free yeah so we actually implemented surgery in in in our patients part of our patient safety goal part of the household training our incident reporting and also we have revised it recently in 2018 uh our guideline yeah so it's all available for free please do have access to it and we also have some presentation and stuff as well that you can use for training next month so in summary um um this these are some of the things that i would like to highlight here today uh misadventures in surgery involves lots of human factors issues and demonstrate the failure of our system for example the failure to actually train our staff effectively failure of teamwork and failure to speak up on on patient safety yeah so i think we really need to relook at these uh areas yeah uh in order to use safety checklist effectively we need to work in team we need to communicate to prevent individual at the shop and from making mistakes actually uh you know when uh when i talk about uh all the cases uh you know when i presented the cases you can see actually there are many uh points of failures yeah uh actually there are there are many uh barriers to to uh to prevent all these failures but actually we for example we didn't comply or we don't know we don't care yeah and that leads to the uh final error yeah so speak up for patient safety and critical information that need to be verified at multiple points that's very very important the patient identification type of procedure side or side of surgery implant for each patient for which side right or left yeah and we need to help each other in preventing harm to patient yes and all of us need to be the game changer we need to be the agent in improving safe surgery and patient safety as well as the whole next one please right so this is our our team uh when we actually revised the second edition yeah and some already retired yeah that though damien is not there anymore um yes i mean uh he's already retired from this show okay next one please right this is our our uh website so please do have a look and and um have access to all the uh training and promotional material that's about all from me thank you very much for your attention no we cannot hear all right okay sorry uh mine was muted sorry guys a very detailed and then an interesting example of the burden when we you know miss adventures in perioperative care especially with patient safety being compromised because the checklist is always complete the problem is that implementing the checklist so it takes it takes um attitude and for us to to be part of the system so it's not workable if you only have a checklist but nobody check or perform a proper um systematic and then really takes a part in the system so um the system uh now with that um i will leave for the next speaker we have the person who is the chairman of the safe surgery safe life steering committee from ministry of health which is uh dr mohammad anwa abdullah for our next session for the meantime we'll take about one minute break two minutes break basically one minute for the qr code to be scanned and you can snap the photo of the qr code for registration later i know there are some problems trying to register we have so many viewers today we have close to 1 000 viewers for the day and we did have some glitches but don't worry you just make sure that you snap the photo of the qr code you can try to register later we will collect your data for the cpd points don't worry about it yeah just keep it keep it in your phone and then you can register later we're gonna have a break for our sponsor today [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] okay [Music] surgery saves lives initiative the story behind the checklist and how to fill it up properly international speaker for various conferences editor board formulation or public journal profit writer author and also very active involvement in fellowship and master program for the country then you've got pyomar assessor very nice to meet you again to see your face [Music] [Music] screen presented i will share a few kesa banar this is from my side okay a 14 year old girl school girl actually she is a stuffed uh a daughter and when planned corrective surgery for her right congenital ptosis while in the recovery room her mother wondered why the dressing was on the left eye and not on the right side a 58 year old gentleman with bilateral knee osteoarthritis was planned for right knee arthroscopic debridement an intra-articular injection but unfortunately post-op noted left knee was operated instead of the right knee a 25 year old gentleman scheduled for decompression and stabilization of the tv spine and after the skin incision was made the anaesthetist realized that the patient's blood group was all negative which was at that time not available in the blood bank patients actually need about three to four pints of blood and after intensely discussed with the relative the skin was closed and the surgery was rescheduled to a later date [Applause] a 45 year old lady presented with recurrent abnormal pain one month post right of recystectomy so she underwent a ct scan abdomen and noted presence of a mess suggestive of tumor and then later on she underwent laparotomy finding was presence of a gossip yoma so i hope you all understand what is this gossip gossip bioma and this is the x-ratio that that what they call unintended retentions of foreign body therefore ladies and gentlemen we can see that they are multiple and in what they call a negative incident reported dr aisha had presented just now and now these are the summer example and these are the newspaper cut out and later this one or latest in nigeria where two cases were reported in a trauma vision so ladies and gentlemen you it was in 2008 under the whole they did the study and they noticed that the whole year there were 2 340 million operations were done globally each year okay this was reported in a landsat 2008 234 000 and out of this 234 000 operation they noted that the complication rate was 3 to 16 and that made up to about 7 million complications and the death rate due to the surgery was 0.4 to 0.8 percent and they made up to about 1 million therefore the ho recognized that there were three main problem in surgical safety one is it is being unrecognized as a public health issue number two lack of data on surgery and outcomes and number three failure to use existing safety know-how and the burdens of surgical disease in fact is increasing more and more people will need to undergo surgery and likewise some of us especially myself once i get older the risk i need to undergo surgery maybe even higher okay the reason is because our life expectancies are now more and more prolonged and second thing we be the expansions of knowledge and technology as well as the technique okay so and more and more subspecialty complex surgeries are being performed now today how about in malaysia in malaysia there was this this is the figure in 2010 in malaysia we perform about 913 000 surgery based on the same based on the same complication rate as well as the death rate as reported by lovely ho we can see that in 2010 the depth the number of there may be as high as 90 000 okay and the complication rate may be 40 to 50 000. sorry sorry the valley the complications 90 000 and the dev was four to five thousand and in 2016 with 1.1 million surgery being performed we expect to have the complication rate of close to 100 000 cases as well as a death uh in between five to six thousand this is the very very conservative estimation okay and this is based on the who data and then problem number two is lack of data on surgery and outcome uh this is recognized by the who we know ong has got very very uh what they call a a good uh metallurgy review however prior to this a surgical many surgical discipline and what we call uh a department do not have a very good or a very diligent civilian and likewise we also lack of data okay and failure to use existing safety know-how the high rates of preventable surgical infection result from inconsistent timings of antibiotic prophylaxis anaesthetist complications are reported to be 100 to 1000 times higher in countries that do not adhere to monitoring standard and wrong patient wrong side operation persists despite despite the high publicities of such events so all this has been reported and recognized by the who because of that la la blue ho have came up with a strategy promotions of surgical safety as a public health so number two creations of a checklist to improve the standards of surgical safety that's why how the surgical safety checklist come about and collections of surgical vital statistics and that's why after the launching of this surgical safety checklist a lot of countries start started to collect the vital statistics likewise our country actually our country has been collecting a lot of surgical vital statistics many many years ago and these are the objectives of the safe surgery supply by the of the whole basically is for the patient's safety to prevent wrong patient wrong side wrong side surgery and to prevent an anesthetic harm to prevent surgical harm and and so on and so forth so we i think i i'm not going to run through this and ladies and gentlemen many of you were asked and i've been asked before because many of us have been doing things of many many years without any problem it never went wrong for me okay so however ladies and gentlemen the checklist will help us to do all the right thing on all patients and all the right time okay you never know things may happen and this is the first editions of lovely ho checklist okay and it is just one big sahaja satu mukul surat sahaja and what the problem what is the problem does this checklist address who say that this checklist will correct the patient so that we will perform on the correct patient operation and operative side and side safe anesthesia and resuscitation minimize risks of infection as well as a effective teamwork and after the introductions of this checklist and who has done what they call a pilot study in eight countries canada uk jordan philippines new zealand india tanzania as well as usa so in advance in the developed country as well as some underdeveloped countries and this is what they found uh the def in eight country the total number of surgery was three thousand more than three thousand and uh check the used use was close to four thousand and then notice that you see the p value jupiter tango p-value all the p-value was less than 0.05 they mean that the improvements are sick were significant okay in terms of death in terms of complication in terms of reduction in surgical site infection as well as in reduction in unplanned re-operation all were statistically significantly reduced and these changes this improvement is not only in a high income group it also happened in a low as well as middle income group the changes are the improvements of statistically significant so based on the checklist itself the final report was that it was found to reduce the rate of post-op complication and death by more than one third okay so what shows subsequently came up with a goal safe surgery supplies program goal where they want to at least enroll to 250 hospital by the 20 2010 and a hospital representing one-fourth of the worst population by 2009 and representing half the worst population by 2010 and collect data okay as i always said the only thing speaks for us is data we need to have very good data and with the good data a lot of things we can come up with the data a lot of the measure recommendations and what they call a corrective measure can be done without data nothing nothing we can do and with that we hope at least half of this complication as well as the death rate can be prevented ladies and gentlemen uh now i add on in terms of surgery i think in terms of surgery there are many things can go wrong but what are the higher risk of adverse event what are the situation where the adverse event a situation where it carries even higher adverse and i think the one is the emergency surgery as you know emergency surgery is unplanned not like the elective surgery or even semi-emergency surgery we can plan emergency surgery we cannot plan anything can go wrong laterality what do you mean by laterality every one of us have a left and right hand left and right leg left and right testis kick knee brain and so year i so this is one of the crucial point that's why the marking must be there that's why the marking must be there because we can incidentally operate i think the incident we showed just now left operate on the right right operate operate on the left and so on and so forth multiple procedure there is another situation where many things can go wrong multiple teams involved especially when multiple teams involved every team will just look at their own problem every team will just concentrate on their own problem at the end what happened to the problem in between nobody really care okay team changing okay and then odd hour odd hours means in the early morning in the public holiday and things like that and pressures of time okay and the pressures of time and another thing another thing which i did not listed here is i noticed lately because because of the technology the presence of the handphone i noticed a lot of people are using handphone in the operating theater okay especially i'm very worried especially my my runner who is busy answering the uh handphone and that can make they can get what they call things can go wrong especially when you are doing counting and checking the equipment the number of equipment and things like that and what are the types of patients will carry higher risk where things may go wrong colleagues and staff why friend close relative why because everything okay lagan why because you're my friend because you are my close relative sometimes we try to bypass the bypass system the checking system and so on and so forth bypass the procedure so these are the groups of patients which carry the risk of things go wrong faster patient vi patient vip or vvip patient okay so these are another groups of patients which i notice sometimes no we we try to make people happy we don't want to be too too too too what they call to detail and things go wrong okay because of all this uh who have launched the two a safe surgery supply as the second global patient safeties challenge in the 25th of june 2008 in washington and of course our country nagara kita was represented by the presidents of the college of surgeon and attended the event and have signed and signed a preach that we malaysia will also will also embark on this safe surgery safe life program okay with that our country went on and planned and of course the first chairman was dr jamil i think many of you know him and he he was the first chairman and dr aisha and myself we were members uh uh members of the the committee and after the uh what they call presented to the tinda can has malaysia and adopted that malaysia we will we will we will what we call start the safe surgery safe life initiative and this is the very first circular uh killing malaysia came out in the 12th november 2009 and this is where they start the beginning of a safe surgery safely in malaysia and this is i think dr has showed y'all this is the very first uh what is called guide came out this is we call it implementation guide on a safe surgery safe life initiative okay and this is the very first versions of checklists ssl okay i think some of you may have seen it before and this is the more modified upgraded first version of checklist okay so the color slightly different okay but this is all the same inside there except there's some modification laggy okay and what about the feature what is the feature about our malaysian safe surgery supply checklist the feature is the guitar tamba kantema the dema is safe surgery through better communication which is here you can see here down bottom here in the last page of the form is a safe surgery through better communication which was not in a whole and in this form h0 is only one page but our form ump mukasura why because we incorporate other existing forms into one for example we incorporate the swap count a what pre-transfer checklist pre-discharge checklist into s1 so it became a four pages checklist okay which o has only one page and then we also add on this scoring for audit purposes you can notice here ladies and gentlemen in india this is the this is a scoring system and this scoring system we add on so that in uh the the purpose is for audig okay and how we audit uh that is another long story later okay and then we also have a space for incident reporting okay we add on the incident reporting so that anybody can report anything during this anything happen during the surgery for example intraoperatively suddenly the aircon ot aircon went out or the temperature or humidity suddenly climb up so you we can report it okay because all these the checklist will be in patients bhd also called the record and in future anything went wrong then we can check the checklist uh and then we can see we can notice what we we we can know what will the incident happen or is there any equipment failure intraoperatively so we purposely add indeed and we also have the specimen sent in case that post-op node the houseman forgotten to enter the uh the data into the post-op node so in this checklist we also have included this specimen sent okay and other measures introduced by earth is the white board in the operating theater i think dr aisha did mention and say that about the white board the purpose of white board itself so that we will enter patients particular surgeons partic what they call surgeon as well as assistant particular uh work on the name and necessities team as well as a scrub nurse and and runner okay all the names will be written on the white board like why is the diagnosis as well as the intended procedure so basically when we talk about swiss cheese this is where we add on another defense level of defense but now in during time out and sign in we have to check besides the checklist we also have to write on the white board so to make sure things went on correctly one and second thing on the white board we also document the 20k time the tony k pressure especially in orthopedic we use a lot of tourniquet so that we want to know how long and what was the tonic tonic tonic pressure uh before that uh we overlooked and and ended up my patient may end up with the lymph ischemia okay we also want to know whoever walk into the old are will know what is going on rather than not pick and see and then daniel and things like that so there's a lot of things about this checklist and last but not least so that every team member know each other okay we know who is the the name of the scrub nurse who is the anaesthetist and so on and so forth an important step in this checklist ladies and gentlemen i think uh based on the rabbi ho i think and after we have incorporated all the other checklists inside there you will notice the important step in this our malaysian safe surgery checklist is that number one we have a pre-op and pre-transfer check and this pre-op and pre-transfer check is all done by the watch staff as well as the ot staff the air lock star of course important step is sign in another important step where dr aisha mentioned was time out okay check in intra of communication sign up debriefing inform relatives and this is optional but prefer okay a lot of us would like to inform relative especially when it's involved a long complex surgery i think those who have experience as a reality the relative of parents underwent surgery especially the long and complex surgery the outside you know while waiting outside the operating theater i think is not the not a pleasant experience so it's very nice if the surgeon can just walk out and say regular what they call interval uh and say everything runs on uh smoothly and the patient what they call your father or your mother is stable and not much blood loss and things like that i think we will be very very happy to hear that and a pre-discharge check okay so these are the important steps in our safe surgery checklist and i've shown the first edition with the modifications of first edition and then as dr aisha mentioned in 2018 we further improved the checklist and we also have came out with the second safe surgery as save lives a guideline and this is the event where the the the dancery dg the kkmdg launched launched the book okay and this is the uh the picture during the long uh what they call the committee member for the launching event and because of that and the new uh reinforced actually reinforced circular have came out in 2018 okay what is the difference of in the second edition safe surgery supply of course this is improvement from the first edition and is based on the feedback from various categories of implemental the implemented means from the starnesses in the world star cis staminases in the or stamina scrubness runner as well the surgeon houseman and so on and so forth and necessity and there are two sets of checklists as mentioned first set is four pages which is primary team and second set is two pages only which is uh when involved the multi-disciplinary team uh ladies and gentlemen why the second set what came out was that if your hospital if ankartan central hospital you have a central record every things is enter one single record then that's fine but unfortunately in ministry of health we many hospitals do not have central record so brahmana patience record will be split into multi-discipline if the patient is in surgery there will be one record if the patient transfer to orthopedic will be another record if the patient transfer to another department there will be another record so what happened to this checklist what happened to this checklist if we only one set of checklists where are we going to put this checklist because the patient may have operated by three different team three different team and where where do we put this checklist in future if the checklist is in the surgical notes and auto-pedic not check anything we may not be able to check okay things like that and and in kotabaru you know salalu banjo and sometimes the record also rosa and that is why we introduce the second set which is two pages whereby the primary team will keep the first set the four pages and the second team comes in we have two pages and this two pages checklist will be kept by the respective subsequent respective surgical team so that uh uh we will have the own rec the record for the patient and the checklist used for all and must be used for all surgical procedures performed in operating theater including the la cases local and sd care cases and we one and we must use two identification why why two identification what are the two identification which is the patient's registration number hospital register uh registration number as well as ic number our identity card my card passport or you unhcl number and so on and so forth the reason is two to identifier is so that things will not go wrong if we use one number sometime team can still go wrong if we use two identifier we hope will be more safety level will be higher and date format previously to list no need format the people you just put any format they like now we have determined and we decided the date format should be day day month month and year year year year because why to avoid misunderstanding to avoid mistake in the day time 24 hours as you know if you use 12 hours the uh principle sometime a.m you can mistake it written as prime minister okay or prime minister you you go and write am and things like that and this thing happened very frequently not only in the operating notes uh also happen in the patient's record documentation and things like that so we said must use 24 hours uh format i think in ankata tundra it's not a issue i think ankata tantra is all using 24 hours for men and time out okay issue of time out is after induction before surgical incision this is the recommended uh by the whole uh however in in ministry of health we also accept that time out before induction time out before induction okay because uh especially my hospital in kotobaru many of time we practice time out before induction that means sign in also before of course sign-ins before induction a time out before induction so that we want the patient to participate in the timeout process and likewise ladies and gentlemen sign in and time out we also say that can be performed together to save time okay we will see that later and one important notes ladies and gentlemen to share with you all is that it is we put it in our guide it is the responsibility of surgical team leader to participate and share the usage of this checklist why because we notice this checklist basically sort of is used by these nurses only a lot of time our surgeon our specialists not not very keen in this so in our guide we purposely and we specifically put it in that is the responsibility of this steam leader it is also responsible to check this coordinator to ensure checklist complete and mandatory to use the checklist regardless of situation okay okay as i mentioned must be done before induction anesthesia except patient already incubated for example collaboration that everybody emergency department that intubated then of course the non-patients already incubated otherwise sign in should be done before induction and time out lovely ho must be done before skin incision but optional calabolae before induction okay and another words of caution ladies and gentlemen is shout out be where the patient who is not under generalized general anesthesia is always is aware of all the shouting so bahati hati and sometime patient and spinal or under epidural ketogenic because what we say what our joke sometimes is no may not be acceptable by the patient okay even patient under general anesthesia sometimes the general anesthesia may not be deep may not deep enough and patients may still able to heal or even feel the pain incidences okay so please record all sorts of incidences in the form and this is a checklist okay so this is a checklist you can see this is a pre-op checklist free transfer checklist okay i will explain detail okay and this is the this is the guideline young second edition young doctor aisha cather you can download in the website uh through the website okay and what is the advantage of using this checklist is customized little body modified all of you are welcome to modify your checklist but the basic assess element of checklist must be there make sure the elements of all the important elements are there and subsequently you can modify and we have saba our colleague in sabah they have even modified the language based on the sabahan language because you know the local language sometimes some people don't understand are supported by the evidence and evaluate in diverse setting around the world it has been evaluated promoted and minimal resources just a form by it is not a rocket science or this is not a very costly thing just form okay so how effective is this ssl checklist surgical checklist uh i i've looked through and these are the sum the report by uh in the various uh journal effects of surgical checklist okay there were 20 studies by this report in 2012 and relative improvements of perioperative mortality by 47 to 62 percent and improvements of morbidity by 36 to 37 okay and conclusion is that support the checklist but the checklist important conclusion should be understood not merely as a list of items to be checked check this number has to be properly done but and so the charity must be used as an instrument for improvement communication teamwork safety culture in operating data it should be implemented accordingly this is another uh what they call report and the report say introducing surgical checklist is not as straightforward ladies and gentlemen voila punch check this numpad straight forward but it's not as straightforward as you think and we have experience okay as i mentioned just now some of the surgeon doesn't want to get involved some of the staff say this allah remained and some even say this waste of time okay so actually to introduce and to implement the checklist properly you really need the leadership you need the leadership okay and sometimes you need you need to be a bit flexible and of course do not last smart knowledge is the teamwork everybody must participate involved if not it will fail and the surgical does this checklist improve the uh teamwork the evidence suggests checklist improved and things like that okay however in this article mentioned that the evidence would also suggest that when you sub optimum may conversely have a negative impact on the functions of the team so ladies and gentlemen be over aware check this is good but have to do it properly may have a negative impact okay and what is the recent development from the whole and whether recently have given patients for patient safety they may hear that they are not engagement and power patient involved in patient safety okay that is why some of us have what they call the industry this checklist is done before patient under okay and what show about about two or three years ago came up a new form a patient information for surgical chemicals and this is also uh you can download in the labview hr website and you can modify based on our setup and like bahasa boon and so that we can also involve patient so we have give this to the patient before surgery and after surgery so remedy so that that's a double check so that kitten java created what what has been what what is necessary for the patient this after surgery okay all these you can download in the w h o p website okay ladies and gentlemen next so this dr aisha presented and this is i also took this from dr aisha's previous slide about the journey of the safe surgery safely in malaysia next how to how to fill this form i think uh to fill this form i think most of you are very familiar the guna bora mini as i say pre-op checklist here you need two identifiers many many many of us have this the same name so very important so can you check of course ic or passport number is what i mentioned and the hospital registration number this is very important very crucial this is very crucial and one important thing is that contact person his uh contact person next okay accompany in case anything goes wrong other people categorical inform at least we know who to contact the number because sometimes you know the number in the patient's record may be different and or the person may not be here maybe somewhere else and things like that okay and the pre-transfer check this sydney i think most of you are very familiar and coming the bonified kamina improved boragini superior this is what the first column kota i need this is for what staff to check before they transfer the patient before they transfer the patient from the wall and the second ko tagni this is when they in one is a before patient transfer devil award and second quota here is for patient uh while in the airlock and i think here you all are quite familiar with this we have to check the patient's name of course id used to identify her here consent we're gonna check consent smaller and then consent now today in ministry of health besides surgical concern guitar anesthetic concern blood transfusion concern and photo consent mind you that i'm operating theater intraoperatively concentrated again here i highlight here is they the way the format of the date and the 24 hours format okay and of course we checked that whether there is a denture jewelry patient and things like that okay and this is a samongan and this item number seven history allergic silky the check smaller and availabilities of implants availabilities implants and through [Music] and i can inform the team and as well as the ns they mean the patient surgery may have to be have to hold on first okay and the pre-medication appointment gsm and things like that and others and right what is available young sudah dijanji or the black bag dual pine and relevant and things like that okay likewise imaging study and of course bp temperature and things like that okay and this is a very important step in terms of sign in sign tokata site consult a consent operating site ga machine okay ns gonna check ga machine make sure ga machines working pulse oximeter motor operate pulse oximeter like that so boy to keep taking a check okay this is signed in safe a process do a step inning your title bollywood together which is better and the kitten save time okay and white board return ah this check is the white board written properly or not are they cine akita this is another safety level gummy create another safety level make sure everything written on the consent form written on the uh check checklist and it's also the same as in the white board whiteboard is the same as consent and somalia okay so this is we add on another safety level introduce team member of course uh introduce team memory some funny hospitals was given at the appropriate time or was given essential imaging uh display briefing uh this briefing is important uh some we have to tell the ns what we want chianto autopilot normally we also discuss about uh estimated blood loss ns review okay and uh a scrap nurse review okay so kita kanabaki prolonged prescribed nurse because kramner's is also part of the team when we say surgical team is not only the surgeon and not only the ns the scrap nurse and the runner they are all in the team including the attendant at is also very important and that can make our surgery safe smooth and happy okay so get to there and then check in i'll put magnet check in there sorry check in is sorry check in is so that when everything is ready before the surgeons start cutting us for the scalpel blade we will ask the we will inform the anesthetist and the scrub nurse can i start i always tell my scrub nurse hi this couple that's why i always tell the scrubs okay so dear sergeant okay so for a surgeon i'm very sorry but that should be the way we cannot start when the ns necessity sometimes will be still struggling somewhere doing something for the patient all the scrumna is not ready and when you cut start bleeding and you start shouting and scrubbing it's not ready okay so please so check in is to get permission and ask courtesy to maintain intraop during intra-op communication this is very important call surgical procedures there's nothing no issue however if this is a complex surgery if this is a long surgery i think on and off intra-op communications is very important we have to periodic no ns have to ns have to assure surgeon a patient everything is okay some water don't worry go ahead continue and likewise the surgeon have to inform the ns if the patient is bleeding or the blood looks a bit diluted no maybe the icbc set in or or if you encounter problem you may need to take slightly longer because to settle the problem the the complication and things like that all you need we need to communicate each other like why shout out i put my shout out shout out is that if anything happens fall out of the table we have to shout out because otherwise the scrub nurse may not know may not be aware okay beware of shout out because as i said just now if the patient is under spinal epidural beware shout out senpai patient because patients on the spine patient is soda and sometimes okay so you i think all of you know how to think what category and not able to adjust the way keto communicate no and no is closure this is important because when we start cleaning the wound heaters start cleaning to the wound to prepare clothes to close the wound we have to inform the ns so that ns body adjusts anesthetic agent there and second thing is ns can call the next case so buy it uh surprisingly and don't waste time case to case interval timing so that we do not waste time okay and sometimes we may even need to call other surgeons to come in we may need to call either what they call a a a service to come in for example autopilot may need iii so that we can inform radiographer no we don't want the patient under but not call and then i uh copy and things like that so we inform them early okay and so and likewise the nurses can prepare the set make sure the set is ready uh and the last one is shout a sign out sign out this is basically the briefing so when we close okay when usually at the times of closing we will inform the the team uh what was the we will finalize the finding we will finalize the procedure and we will finalize what are the post-op order we need to have likewise we will ask the ns a patient and things like that and the nurse normally will the the runner normally will come and ask you a doctor how to what is the specimen how to label what is a specimen called where it is and things like that okay uh if cns taken what are the specimens make sure the specimen young mix up uh uh and things like that okay so if there's any issue no so that we can also address i think this issue this this is a sign out of deep briefing uh uh uh this is exactly like uh gather in one corner and they will talk to each other and actually that is part of debriefing okay uh and last but not least uh uh inform relative as i say this optional color long procedure complex procedure it i think is very good and very uh nice to inform relative regarding the progress of the surgery and i as an uncle i'm automatic on co-surgeon i always also show the tumor i have removed to the relative i always show it to them explain to them and let them took picture i always allow them to to take picture of the the tumor which has been removed and actually many of them are very very happy okay and in a column young say chaka this is a checklist and this is the issue any incident any checklist coordinator to sign and this is for the auditing purposes auditing purposes what we do is in the sign in for example that i'm signed in at this polo item utama very important step in the sign in so it's a spoiler marker in the time out there are eight important steps important element in the time out so it to lapa marca so in the check-in alexa 2 in the intro of undertaker so uh inian kami akan audi audig you can perform in two aspects one is retrospective retrospective audit means you retrospectively tengo borangitu and things like that we have go ahead with the prospective study observational study rimanna uh a staff which is not being known to the scrubner surgeon and things like that you observe the ssl procedure in the or okay they will observe the procedure and they will quietly undergo all those things has been done accordingly so this is what you call optional uh observational auditing and we find it is very useful okay and then this is a swap count instrument i think most of you are very aware okay i think initiablu uh elaborate laggy uh so if you have n on the instrument atabukow you can add dissini tambalaghi and uh okay dissimilar to column second scrubber security circulating samoa to start involved team changes in long procedure atapunka battalion uh case that cut the shift stamina shift naha beta so involve team changes so we can document all this inside there okay and this is a pre trans discharge check again i think these are quite straightforward uh again this will be the check by the ot nurse before patients roll out from the uh what they call the uh observation bay and this is in the airlock uh scaling this is an airlock between the what staff and the ot star so they check the patient together it's about that patient what the bp is low and the what staff cutter well openness low and things like that we don't we don't allow all the start of uh we call it nonsense to happen so we have to and the one important thing is check iv line and infusion item number two and num uh it has happened before it has happened before we have a spinal anesthesia okay the line spinal and hdcrp online and infuse what they call morphine no accidentally they pass some morphine infusion dynamics spina and stc alarm iv light and things like that uh uh what they call a spinal punyan uh tubing and a lot of you know all this mystic can happen uh as mentioned we we we tried we all this step hopefully we can avoid uh we hopefully you can avoid uh pick up and avoid all the unnecessary uh complication and mistake okay pc pca pump this is what happened at real life uh things like that and another important part is here amputated part and placenta have they been handled properly have they have been uh ascend to appropriate pay place uh that's why it's very important we have to handle them properly even though may not be important to us but this is very important to the family and member okay so i think that's about all and this is the multi-disciplinary checklist uh any multi-disciplinary basically summer sahaja basically summer culturally this information is is already under okay no more sign in this is the second surgical team patient already under the adidas second team come in not start operation dear canada intra up uh what they call time out smaller okay for example surgical surgeon what leprotomy the habit auto come in to do open fracture femur then auto surgeon must start procedure they can about time out the anesthetist okay keto tablet presume and assume everything is okay so inina procedure and but the rest is all the same okay the rest of the uh things is all the same and this form will be kept in autopilot notes this is the second team collected another team dental team coming to do the dental fracture then there's another this form another form and this the another form will be kept in the dental open your record this is for those hospital yam dida other central record single record this is for hospital your multiple record young lea split into multiple discipline and the rest is all the same okay and i think i've end my talk and i must acknowledge dr no aisha okay and that to uh jamil because some of the slide i i used yes i took use the slide and of course all the current and past uh steering committee member and same picture as dr aisha showed just now thank you very much okay thank you so much it was very informative we are very happy to have you on board with us today um speaker today one of the are currently mentally stable but need emergency surgery no relative around who to sign the consent i think we have this uh quite uh regularly um i mean we at any part of uh clinical practice we will at one point face the situation where uh this this um condition can happen so and then how do we uh we do we um approach for this either okay uh for the patient psychiatry patient is divided into two categories if the patient is mentally unstable the consent is not valid their that's why bucket consent and if the patient need emergency operation and actually uh dr aisha is discussing concern we are actually preparing a practical consent guideline for the ministry of health and the guideline can be used by all parties like the muscle lawyer okay so indeed and we actually this guy we also based on the mmc punya uh consent uh uh a guy okay so if the patient is mentally unstable not the consent is not valid and if the patient need emergency surgery emergency surgery means color patients near life is at stake on behalf of the patient one is psychiatry gonosan because psychiatrists psychiatry is the treating psychiatry the person the psychiatry who treat the patient and the second person of course callous surgeon then surgeon who is treating this patient who is planning the surgery who is going to operate the patient has to sign so they mean the two plus two to two uh what they call qualified registered medical professional have to sign for the patient patient stable consent valid science and um i think a few uh other questions are still coming in um i believe one of the questions already been presented by dhatu just now any local international statistic regarding success of implementing uh sssl i think you have shown it in your graph just now um the success rate and also the the study of implementing it it does make a difference and that's why we are championing this uh as part of a standard of patient safety and our ultimate goal we are not trying to make things more complicated but i think being safe is the utmost priority for any surgery for any cases we try not to do any wrong thing despite things can happen but like you said some factors are more prone to develop problems and also uh occur uh in terms of uh um uh uh mistakes but then with the checklist we try to make all standardized and uh maybe i can uh add on that as well um um basically when we look into patient safety there are lots of like human factors uh elements come into it yeah so basically for example our mind is so fatigued and and we are tired after uh been working for quite a while yeah so so basically checklist the main function of checklist is to ensure standardization and to make sure that we will not miss all the critical uh points uh or things that we need to do so so it helps with with our fatigue issue with our human factor issue yeah so so that's the the the reason why checklist is important uh and and the power of checklist uh there are many studies being conducted uh related to the use of checklist checklist and the benefit of checklist thank you all right um okay i think we are towards the end of our first session today on the 12th of march and we as a organizing committee would like to say a very big thank you to our panelists today uh we have beginner general dr dr mohammad razin bin kamaru zaman hit corporate safety oversight malaysia airlines uh berhad and we have the second lecture by dr noor aisha binti abubakar the the deputy director medical care quality section medical developmental division of ministry of health malaysia and also we have dr dr abdullah chairman ssl steering committee ministry of health malaysia a very big thank you we are very happy i do hope we and for your information we have 1200 plus registered um uh personnel today that listening to this talk and uh we are very happy basically initially the programs aim at only about 100 it seems that we are oversubscribed by 12 times uh it seems both of i mean all dependent seems very popular i think and and we do hope that next week we're going to have the same effect impact and we do hope that patient safety standards can be improved but first of all we must always have the right mindset uh the checklist is there we already have the system we implement the system and uh i guess we do hope that uh we we are doing something here for our patients and uh with that uh i guess thank you very much soon so the next is gonna be uh for housekeeping announcement we're going to promote for the next week um speakers and session we're gonna have four more lectures by next week also with the reputable speakers

praise god we thank god little throat raspy today but pray for me every now and then every every now and then i i i get something from the lord and i like to believe the word of god from the lord it doesn't give you a word to god my faith is that god gave it to me so once in a while he'd give me something that i debate on it in my own head i was debating on it and a pastor the other night i was thinking about it went to bed thinking about it you know dreaming about dad and you know my dad was one who would preach a subject based on a lot of times life circumstances as it is going today he was he was uh he he he became sometimes a current events preacher and whatever was going on in the world he could tell you about it because he looked into it and he also was one who participated uh uh a lot of people don't know he was one of the founders and and the originators of the interdenominational ministerial alliance in this area when uh a lot of preachers of all denominations got together just to meet and to talk about current things and to to get out and march and get out and protest and get out and and do things on behalf of the minority community he was one of the founders and the first president i believe of that organization and uh so he was quite an activist yeah but i remember times he would get up and preach and folks didn't know where he was coming from because they didn't understand what was going on but by the time he got through you knew what he was talking about yeah so so when i when this came to me and i was in it and when i dreamed about him which i don't dream about uh uh i dream more about mom than i do dad uh so i dreamed about that after thinking about i said oh man the lord is trying to tell me something yeah so i'm gonna listen to the lord but i heard alice my sister singing on her on their broadcast uh uh during the district meeting she was singing a song and and and i can't think i stopped singing y'all my voice my voice just gone call it age or something i don't know it's gone bye-bye i played to get y'all one of these days but but she's saying this song about uh i love you lord and uh that song been ringing my head one next time i get the chance i'll have brothers probably play it for me but uh uh and the love of the lord and song has been kind of rolling over all over this week and it's not what i'm talking about but that's what's been going on inside of me you know i love jesus yeah i love you you know i love you and and pastor would say a lot of times in sermons in the passage you know we need to talk to the lord and tell him how you feel about him yeah uh pastor pastor gets up here every just about every sunday and tell you something how he feel about the tiffany now i'm not one who said a whole lot but i love sister king we we have been we laugh a lot of times because god has taken this week we've gone places that they tell you don't go there yeah uh uh uh uh just don't go there that's not yeah that's that's a scary place to be in a dangerous place to be and we said we laughed because we already been there and we we walked into a place and we got to a place and the house was rallying had tall chains fences and barbed wire all around the top and all around the top of the places nice little houses on the beach and to this side was a bar and all these guys came out swagging brother and it was a cartel guys where you from so what is from but you know by the time they really figured out what and who we were they put out you know we don't drink but they come here have a beer sit down and talk to her and at little times i mean you're going to a little town now it's scary to go there but god has blessed us yes protected us and watched over us over the time and year so anyway get into my subject and i'm gonna try not to be long because again i don't know how i'm gonna get it out to you i'm getting out here how god give it to me leviticus 19 33 34. 33 33rd verse says if a stranger dwells with you in your land you shall not mistreat him the stranger who dwells among you shall be to you as one born among you and you shall love him as yourself for you were strangers in the land of egypt i am the lord your god yes yes then over in deuteronomy the 24th chapter and the 14th the 14th and 15th verse you shall not oppose oppressed i'm sorry a hired servant who is poor and needy whether one of your brethren or one of your aliens who is in your land with in your gates each day you should give him his wages and not let the sun go down on it for he is poor and has set his heart on it lest he cry out against you to the lord and it be sent to you may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word social justice and it's a subject i don't hardly use a lot of times you know how when when i was working in the school we getting these big discussions and sometimes everybody's got their own opinion of what social justice and a lot of times i just would be quiet until they say something crazy and then i speak up right everybody had their own opinion what social justice was all about from the beginning of time in every area every climate there's been certain people who have been persecuted ignored through no fault of their own the stranger in the land the lowly servant depended on his boss or his master and for his very life the unwanted the people of the suspect races and colors they have all been children problem children of humanity not because they were bad they're not you know we are who we are yeah i wasn't bad it wasn't a bad thing being black but because man's heart has not been big enough to love him yeah give them an even chance well how well the jewish nation knew that when they were in israel in egypt but one of the things i found out that the prophets and jesus christ paul all of them they gave more time and more thought to the stranger and the unwanted yes yes then they gave to the privilege and the strong now verse 34 and thou shalt love him as thyself love the stranger that is he he he may be a turk he may be a japanese he may be any kind of race it doesn't matter but if you are of god you will love him as you love yourself because god created him and love him as much as he loves you i don't understand why folks think that god loved him more than he loved me he loved me i believe he loved me just as much as he loved brother malachi our brother he's a king life he love me you it isn't enough to treat him with courtesy and justice you suggest supposed to love him too yes yes loud it was like the the the when when when the hebrews was down there in egypt they were loud and they were wailing and crying and they as they suffered but once they got free if you read the history in the old testament once they got free they start setting up laws they establish their own land they prove they had learned very very little while it was down in egypt to sound familiar they snubbed the strangers they denied him equal rights and does in a whole kind of way a lot of those laws was just set up the the highest laws i call them as god loved them in egypt and brought them out of it so god loves the stranger in in israel and the champions he champions them he champions the stranger he champions the poor their right to light liberty and the pursuit of happiness god wants that for us just like he gave it to the hebrew church yes yes that second verse in deuteronomy or that dune 24-14 thou shall not oppress a high servant how do we oppress the highest servant how working of too many countries now now uh i'll be honest with you sometimes when they say working too many hours we want the overtime over time so tell you real time you work 14 15 hours you know you get overtime that's but back in those days you work 14 15 20 hours and you got the same time you got if you work two or three hours you got the same money but we have laws to prevent those kinds of things yes yes they beat people and if you beat your people your personnel uh uh uh back in the early days they used to kind of you know they gotta kind of lost it a little bit but if you'd go to jail for that you do know or you know how people are in the day they'll shoot you thank god it is to be saved they they cheat your wages you know a lot of times you go into a job now i say this to the ladies of our society it's it's cheating you to give you less money to do the same job that i'm doing it is it's just cheating and the laws of today just don't seem to be strong enough to hold that up if i'm digging a ditch for thirty thousand an hour you're supposed to dig a ditch for thirty dollars a hour it's supposed to be that way the abuses known to the jew and deuteronomy days have been outlawed all those abuses that they were those they've been isla but they have been supplanted when i say supplanted they're in the psyche of a lot of people just to cheat there are other people yeah i i saw a news article uh uh about a company it's one of the largest companies in our in our in our nation distributing goods all over they have little offices about the size of just a main office where everybody in there is making 60 70 80 an hour but you got huge warehouses where guys are working 10 15 12 hours a day making below minimum wage and all they're doing up there shuffling papers god bless everybody who knows computers yes there are a whole lot of folks for uh not for microsoft and and and and those big companies who are sitting at home today in their pajamas and house shoes making a hundred dollars out there a lot of folks doing that and you go out all day long and well as we used to do pick up yeah and you might make twenty dollars a day yeah anybody here pick cut well i picked kyle i know my uncle judge used to take me out when i was living with my grandmother's chocolate to the cotton field and i picked cotton that's a hard job sister tiffany it's wrong against the servant to cheat him out of his god-given dignity it is wrong it's wrong to think of him as inferior it's wrong to pay him less than you know is he's worth it's wrong to take the best years of his life and cast him aside when he gets old he don't have nothing to live on no means of livelihood it's wrong to deny him his equal human rights now again i'm not talking about getting off to get saved today because that's what we all need but it just bothers my spiritual soul it's wrong but it's wrong also of us as a people not to understand and institute the learning ability in our children how to be better i tell this is i may have brag but pastor will let you know we learned to read before we got to school yeah when i was in in when i was in the first grade they said you could i could read it put me in the second grade back when i just gonna dig up my real age we used to have the first grade but we had the high first grade and then we had the second we had the high second grade and then the third i used to be in the third high grade that meant that's why i graduated when i was 16 years old because they taught us to read sunday school cards and books before we got to school when we was in kindergarten we could read a sunday school card we do have to read and and and no no none of y'all that we have to stand here and recite that after sunday school is over you have to learn how to read that's what we need to do our children teach them how to read something again and then mom would read to us yeah because we didn't have no tv we had the radio to this day i have a huge collection of long ranger in the sanctum the shadow because that was our tv yeah we didn't have when i lived with mother king down to church she didn't handle tv and i was in i was in 6th or 7th grade she didn't have no tv now so when i fit in my homework she turned on the radio i could listen to the story so we would talk to and read to to learn so that's our part of the responsibility but as we go here society today has said okay we don't think you are worth the the our time to educate you we got to do what i say i don't know if y'all understand they're saying amen for me yes but listen to what i'm saying god stands in back of the laws which he which protects servants of mankind he stood in back of the tenth commandment he stands in back of every fragment of social and economic legislation calculated to improve the condition of the poor he stands for that the god who saved israel from slaving it's a special protection i'm gonna tell you something i if if you ever get in trouble real trouble you don't call mama first thing most time lord help me lord help me lord help me well because you can't nobody do it but the lord because you're you're in the position nobody can help you but god and so the first thing that comes out of your mouth lord help me the god who saved israel from slavery is the spiritual protector that's who we call on the christian order of society especially exists not at all for the protection of the rich and the strong can i say that again god is not here just to protect the rich and the strong but for the purpose of relieving the need of the unwanted and the underprivileged he he loves the he said what did he say blessed are the poor in spirit yes they shall see god so why are so many of our laws made to curb the would be oppressor and lift up the underdog why i'm almost done yeah matthew 9 9 talks about talks about matthew matthews wanted uh he was a hated guy he he he was he matthews he was they did not like matthew his community did not like matthew they didn't have a thing he what did he do he collected taxes for the romans because none of us don't like the tax collector doing i was telling we were talking the other night i told the wife we were talking about the irs is uh is uh they collected taxes but they're a big collection agency uh for the u.s government and and so matthews was a texas he was a collection agency and they you know uh i'm sure some of us have had bills where they call on your house and they want to know where is that bill where is that money and you don't want that call thank god for caller id huh i know a lot of them thank god for calling cause you look down and say oh when we first got cell phones you remember you first got a cell phone and when you first got in the first i mean when they first came out the the the the collection agencies couldn't get your cell phone number if you remember that and so the collections agency went to the government and they lobbied the government you know we'll pay you this and you'll figure that if we do this if you do this for us so they unregulated the cell phone now you can get uh collection calls on your cell phone that was matthews that was him that's a and and folks when matthews was knocking at your door when he saw you and he come over here to the table i got to talk to you about something they didn't like matthew and perhaps this is perhaps jesus may have saw greater possibilities greater talents a greater heart in the lower attacks he may have saw something a little different that we would see he saw what that he saw about the rulers of of israel he may have saw something different because he was he he was part of that system he he he he had a greater use in in in 1865 for lincoln than he had for for for douglas lincoln was old uncouth guy douglas was polished and and and very politician so god looks at your situation and who you are and he he takes you for what's in here yes yes that's right perhaps perhaps it was that matthew's need was so desperate that jesus just had stopped and helped him matthew's father and jesus come on man you come up i want you to i want you to come why you he told other disciples he said come on the fisherman he took i want to make you fish as a man come on just follow me he told matt to get him off that table man come on i want to do something yes treat a publican like a thief and in his business he'll become a thief you treat a man bad after a while he'll start that you they they tell you psychologies and everybody else says you call you keep on telling your kid you just like your old daddy you just like after a while he'll be just like his old daddy if his daddy that way but but we came up under society back when back in the day they used to tell us before jesus jackson they used to tell us you are somebody and if you are somebody constantly going in your head you'll grow up somebody yes yes we used to have a program when i worked down at the school district and we promoted it real heavy for our children to understand and know where they came from and who they are what their heritage is because nowadays all you have to do is pay a couple dollars and spit in a cup send it off the ancestral dna and they'll tell you all about your family they go all the way back as much as they can find yeah you may not know the name but they'll tell you right away your dna strand matches somebody way across the other side of the world well i won't say that but some folks who go out here burning crosses as if they run the dna they found out masters wasn't always in the house with his wife all right oh i say praise the lord shall i pray through our prayer it also was a suggestion that the church has a primary mission to the poor and the outcast and the criminal yeah jesus starts up when he got matthew he started he he started he he started in an endless crusade of the church when he got married against the persecuted of the unwanted he found somebody nobody wanted when nobody wanted us because of this nobody wanted you because of your hairstyle nobody wanted you because of the community you came from jesus did that's why so he got matthews out of there got him out of that chair and and matthew's man matthews matthews are tough too if i may use that kind of jesus started the first salvation army right there but he not only stirred up the people he created a scandal he's he not just with matthew the bible lets us know he sat down to eat with repub republicans and sinners tax givers their cronies all the unwashed kind of people of the community oh that was horrible what kind of preaching are you what kind of preacher see right now you got a lot of preachers you can't even go touch him you can't even go up there and talk to him you can't go to his office and call him but jesus sat down with them folks and and the best people in town and in the synagogues they could what is wrong with this man what is wrong with this jesus had jesus no did he have any pride did he have any salt any sense of social propriety what is wrong with he called himself the son of god he called himself a preacher he called himself a teacher and he's sitting down with them people oh do we save the sinner by sharing him do we reach him by staying away from him is the church of christ an exclusive club with the no welcome sign for those who in need that no welcome sign might face you when you get to the birthday gates as they say you know you get to that get up to jesus and what jesus said he said that people get man jesus i had a congregation of four thousand five thousand people i preached every sunday i did this and i did it and jesus is saying who are you see that sign right there it wouldn't read it re read the words on the side this is no welcome why because you didn't have it in here for your help your fellow man the strictly orthodox jew despised the gestures of jesus he was breaking the barrier of race oh he did he broke the barrier even the samaritan woman when he sat down at the well he she her first thought was hey you asking me yeah but he started he started beating jesus he started talking jesus talked when he started talking jesus talked she's got to listen to what that man was saying and when jesus began to talk jesus talked she stopped and said whoa let me go back home talk to everybody now i got to i got to believe because samaritans were very hated that she went back to samaritan community she went back to the minority community not she didn't go back to the church community she went back home and she comes to your maker told me everything that i had all about my life yes he told me i could have water that was everlasting but the main thing i could see in his eyes he'd love me oh glory to god you know what he wasn't you ever yo meet some people you look at their face you know that person don't like me you could just look right in his face right in his eye he don't love me but she looked in jesus face when he began to talk to tell about a life oh thank you jesus for god and when she when she did that she knew something different so she ran back to her community and told what did they do man that witness was so strong they got it they let me go see what they talking about she sees because when you show the love of jesus christ people want to know more about where you are where you come from who you are who's telling you the stuff that jesus loved me more than he loves you who's telling yourself that jesus loved me that highly that much it's not so much that he just died for us but he just genuinely loved me can you say praise the lord almost done courtney just was down there praying and he was talking to god and god was talking to him and while he was praying that god was talking to him he the lord said he said they send your servant out but why are you sending the servant out peter was up there at the time his house anybody he was asleep waiting on something to eat in the in the china south god gave him a three-time dream three-time vision and each time so rise peter with all these beasts and all this kind of stuff you know i i had i had to folks laughing the other day when i was a cook in the military i had some people of a certain religion who don't eat pork and the order of the day was pork ridge so me and my uh fellow chef mr man sergeant mandigo we fix big trays of barbecue black stuff big old pants and we laid it out on the circle like because that was the order of the deck yeah and so so so when all of these guys the whole platoon when i say a platoon is like 300 something almost 300 guys in the platoon every one of them was doing this so so don't call what god gives you unclean is what he was telling peter eat some good stuff yes yes in our house uh we don't eat a lot of pork but every now and then we fix you know that real thick sliced bacon there now we we make that good and so when we do it there's a couple extra slices we just save aside for the next day and and i don't always tell sister king that there's a couple extra slices here so in the morning i give her a couple extra slices boy they smile you know bacon what i'm saying is what god gives you is not unclean when god gives it to you yes it's good stuff god gave us some god gave us some brother preachers went down to azusa and preached down there brought in some other races down there and god it was it was god who did that brought people together yes yes and he poured out the holy ghost here right in the united states on a whole lot of folk he didn't have no respect to a person so so so so when when when peter got to talking to god god said god said you this is master don't call it unclean don't call sister just a brother smiley and clean don't call brother ben and clean don't call us unclean we're god's children so what if peter says i perceived i came to my mind that god is not a respecter of persons it don't matter if you got a lot of money in your pocket it don't matter if you're driving a cat like car or some  mercedes benz or lexus it don't matter it don't matter i have a friend who worked he worked he worked right there with his security guard and you know what he drove every day yes a rolls royce i saw him the other day he got he got a brand new rolls royce but he worked in some security guards i had no respect don't matter what you have he'll accept you what's the song said just as i am just as i hear just come to jesus just as you are he has no respect for he didn't he didn't put a whole bunch of what here's another scripture let me know here's another when the bible lets us know that broad is the way that leaders wear to destruction but narrow is the way it's just a traveler every now and then on this road so so don't get all excited and think that god is just visiting other it's now my sister alice said to me the other day she says she said brother she said you got to remember this there's nothing new going on there's nothing new going on in our country there's nothing new all the stuff that we're going through all these tensions that's going on in our communities in our nation it's nothing new she says what happens is we get a breather for a while she said the devil decides it's time to recycle all that old stuff that he did way back in 1800 and and and it a lot of people are alarmed because they think it's something new no this is nothing new he's just recycling some old stuff and put a new twist to it yes so unless we realize it's paul butcher that there are no divisions of blood or even gender in the kingdom there can be no kingdom all if this that kind of stuff can't be a kingdom of keep the barriers and we keep our christ break through the barriers and we break through to god and christ would come and be with us there's no other way come on let's give god praise amen hallelujah [Applause] elder king's topic was social justice many have asked the question does the bible speak and teach about social justice did jesus preach about social justice and teach social justice and he gave us clear examples of that today of the samaritan woman please read that when you have time if you are wondering as he said this passion that god gave to him in his heart that we would come back and understand that we have responsibilities as people of god uh who serve not only our communities and our families but into the entire world uh we are we're not there yet people we're we're not there and i know we have in our mind that because we have a few material things that everything is all right but there's still a lot of work to do and what he was trying to impress upon your hearts this morning is let us not go to sleep we still have a lot of work to be done amen teaching our children as he said uh reading to them i think sister tiffany tapped me on my shoulder and said this is national reading month and not only that to share the word of god that's the this is the best book to start learning to read in amen and uh those psalms that they taught us in sunday school but more importantly is that we have a responsibility to care for one another micah 6 and 8 says and what does the lord require of you but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god does the bible speak about social justice yes it does to treat our neighbors as we would treat ourselves to love one another amen and if you didn't believe it go there to matthews he talked about uh they didn't like matthew because of his position and his stance for social justice and it's a beautiful beautiful lessons there about jesus over in that 26th chapter of matthew go there and you'll find it what i'm trying to impress you and what he was trying to tell you the bible is replete with examples of social justice we're not there yet people let us not go to sleep there's still work to be done amen amen [Applause] i love the lord today how about you and if you are i know some of us are struggling this morning because of this time change but hey there's no time to sleep my brothers and my sisters amen we're still on the wall amen i was reading a sermon in my journal i went back i think it was about 19 oh 1995-96 sister ruth lyons was here at this church

heart was so heavy and i had to come and preach that morning but when i walked into the sanctuary ruth lyons was sitting right here on the front row and i asked her to speak it was 1995. and she spoke from nehemiah chapter one and her sermon was that day to stay on the wall don't give up it's no time to give up to stay on the wall and i'm saying that to all of us to hear today that's listening and

nobody told me that the road would be easy and i don't believe he brought me this far to leave me amen and she admonished us and encouraged us and i will never forget she called me up after she finished preaching laid hands on me and prayed for me and says pastor can be encouraged stay on the wall and i want to encourage you through that message of social justice today let us not give up stay on the wall amen oh hallelujah come on let's give god praise unto this hallelujah i don't feel no wayside [Music] don't feel no waste time i come too far from where i [Music] nobody told me

"UmdsLv7Zx6g": "you on story is brought to you in part by the Alice Clayburgh Reynolds foundation a Texas family providing innovative funding since 1979 on story presented by Austin Film Festival a look inside the creative process from today's leading writers and directors this week's on story Dead Poets Society Academy award-winning screenwriter Tom Schulman in this episode Tom Shulman walks us through the process of bringing his first screenplay to life with director Peter Weir as several people pointed out to me why would you write something like this on spec when no one would make this movie and the first person to do that was my agent who I gave the script to and he said wow this is the best script you've ever written and I can't sell it and if you want to sell it you're gonna have to get another agent so and he said to me really it's it's it's one of the best scripts I've ever read and I can't sell it and why did you write it why did why would anybody think that a script about a boys school with you know they're almost no girls in the movie it's it's a boarding school it's the 50s it's the three worst possible words I can think of in a title all and together Dead Poets Society all in one so my agent called and said I found a producer who read it two years ago who can't get it out of his mind he wants to hill-hill option it I think for 250 dollars maybe we can get him up to that and which which was just ghastly and he said look I'm not doing any work on this anymore so you know at least he'll put some money in hill-hill hill-hill make some moves that was a guy named Steven haft who happened to have gone to prep school with Jeffrey Katzenberg who was running Disney at the time and he gave it to Jeffrey and Jeffrey bought it that night tied the the sort of shy mute boy played by ethan hawke is really was me and you know there are theories that movie the thing that you write is real you're really working out something for yourself the the script is the writer's journey and i guess if that were the case it would be Todd's journey for me because I was pathologically shy and terrified of public speaking and that is Perry then I thought you know writer is perfect for me I'll write I'll have my name on the screenplay I'll send it in I'll never have to go in and talk to anybody it'll just be you know didn't quite work out that way I remember when I got the call that Peter wanted to do the movie they said you know he loves the script he's in he only has his only problem is with the ending and I said there he wants to redo the ending and I liked the ending so I was worried about that in the original script which some of you may have read on about page 80 or so the boys show up for class and teachers not there and they found out he's in the hospital and they go to see him and as it turns out he has I think Hodgkin's non-hodgkins lymphoma one of one of these cancers that will kill you but slowly and that explains the sort of carpe diem of it all Peter said got a it's the easiest rewrite you'll have ever done you just go and you take that scene out that's it you cut it out and that nothing else changes I said but then it doesn't explain why the teacher has this this philosophy of life and he goes that's just because it's who he is so we've he said and I'm not gonna make the movie unless you agree that this is the right thing to do so I said well I don't I don't agree he said I know you don't know I don't explain it if you told me right now you'd agree I wouldn't have any any respect for you I know that you believe in this so I'm coming over to the states in about two weeks and you know we'll get together and talk about it so I went home and you know I went through all the thousand reasons why he was wrong and I was gonna win this argument and he got there and for two or three days we said we were arguing about it and finally he said to me you know look it's his first argument was this movie will just be reviewed as a disease of the week kind of movie it'll be a kind of weepy where you know this this one notion will swallow everything else that you've done in the movie it'll be about a teacher who's dying and that's different and and I don't think that's what you want but he finally said look it's easy for a bunch of boys to stand up it's easy for anybody to stand up for someone who's dying you know that's just that's a courtesy almost he said but and if he's dying it but if they're if he's not dying then we know they're standing up for what he's taught them for what he believes in so I went you know that's that's right so so that was it he had said to me by the way I want you on the set and by the way I know that I can tell you want to direct most writers want to direct so you know it to the degree that you want considered a learning experience you know I he said I've directed eight movies so I'm happy to help anyway I mean the most generous man so I said to Peter he said really just go talk to Robin about this what you want to change in the scene and let's see how it works and I said well what if it what if I screw it up he goes I'll fix it I said okay so I went out walked out there I saw Robin look back over at Peter and Peter when it's okay and I gave Robin a note and Robin did it he Peter said what do you think and I said I don't think it works he goes I don't either and on to the next thing but that I mean I don't think any other writer that I've ever talked about has had an experience with the director with that kind of level of generosity and and and sort of openness to the writer and he you know he the first day of the the one right before the the movie started he raised the script up and said this is why we're all here this is our Bible this is what didn't mentioned me of course but this is this is what we're here to do and he said I'm a very open director he said if you have any thought any buddy here whether you're a grip ever has any ideas any thoughts come to me come to Tom bring them to anybody he said the only thing I ask is that you not be offended if I don't use your idea and at one point there's a scene with I don't even know if we're gonna look at it but there's a scene where Robin is meeting with having lunch with a fellow teacher and Robin quotes as has a quotes a line of poetry that he wrote and I had written something and about a week before that scene was to shoot Robins stand-in came up to me and said I wrote a little poem that I think would be perfect for that that moment and I said okay so a couple days later he brought it to me and it was great it's wonderful it's in the movie so it was because of Peters that openness again in people that was that kind of set where people just any idea people came you know to him or anyone else and which i think is a wonderful way to make a movie funny never pegged you as a cynic not a realist show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams but I'll show you a happy man only in their dreams can men be truly free it was always thus and always thus will be Tennyson kitty whatever changes were necessary I knew Robin would make but and although I was worried about Robin because I didn't understand what I had seen of him as a dramatic actor and his madcap amazing comedy how that was going to fit into the reality of a teacher and the very first thing that we shot we we had one day with Robin to shoot an exterior scene we were shooting pretty late in the year it was already late fall and early November when we started shooting so he had one day with him and he was gonna go off to New York and do a play for a couple of weeks and then come back and Robin was just almost stuck to the word forward to the script and it was he seemed almost tight and nervous and not not him you know so we shot the scene and I remember saying to Peter oh my god he seems wooden and tell you guys I know I don't know we'll figure it out in those two weeks that we have to so when Robin came back Peter said before we started shooting Peter said I want to do an improv Robin and just will shoot it and in fact it's in the movie he said if you had to just teach these boys something anything you'd want to teach them what would it be in Robin say Robin I don't know he said Peter said you want to read to them he said yeah I could read to them so they found a book said you want to teach him a little Shakespeare oh yes I could teach him some Shakespeare so he walked into the room that we were shooting and he it's the difference between what he had been doing before was that now he was talking to this even though he was doing all the talking he really it was a dialogue just similar to what he did in stand-up but he was looking at the kids looking for their reactions talking to them amusing them the whole bit and did that improv where he's the Shakespeare scene where he's John Wayne doing Macbeth if any of you have seen mr. Marlon Brando Shakespeare can also imagine maybe John Wayne is Macbeth Corey well is this our dagger I see before me from that moment on he was completely connected to the to the character and so the you know there are improvisation that he does all the way through he invented this Bell that he dinged whenever student was wrong he did all kinds of little stuff everybody feel taller oh thank you for playing mr. Dalton at that moment that sort of blend of his dramatic and and and comedic self you know worked for the movie I went to a place called the actors in director's lab which was in Los Angeles and my teacher was a gentleman named Jack Garr fine whose teacher was a famous Broadway director and critic and named Harold Clurman I wrote a kind of rough draft with with Clurman as the teacher and then realized this isn't gonna work okay this should be about a teacher that I had when I was a sophomore in high school a guy named Sam Pickering who was a very mischievous wonderful inspiring English teacher that I'd been lucky enough to have and the good news for me is that the Pickering had been at my school for one year and then disappeared and so all these rumors went around what what happened for me it was this kind of open question you know and left my imagination to sort of you know go somewhere else so I think if I'd ever known what actually happened to him I would have never written this it was the first moment we would have seen with with the Robin William character and it had him walking in walking down the script had him walking down the aisles looking at the boys kind of going sort of seeing something in their eyes that only he could see and then walking back to the front of the room and jumping up on the other either his desk or you know and Oh captain my captain who said that we shot it it was good Robin did a great job with it and Peter and I both felt like oh this is the end of the movie right here it dies at this moment because it just looks like the teacher is a complete completely self-absorbed show-off then the question was what to do so suddenly we thought okay let's just have it have him instead we got to get this he can't jump up on the desk so maybe he walks into the room and with yet we still want something that's gonna you know get our attention as students and we as an audience so the idea was have him just walked through the classroom look at the kids and walk out and then we'll do the whole scene in the honoureth and we were lucky that there was a solution that was so simple you know in the in the honor of its itself that began Robin sort of improvisational stuff that helped give him that twinkle and added obviously humor to the movie so it was great stuff I mean I think my original intent was that somehow these kids were going to find poetry inspiring you know and so the so I sort of pulled out the poetry that had inspired me as a youth and put it in the same and the studio and Peter and later me of course I worry about everything well it was worried that that that no one know kids who would could relate to this you know that the bunch of boys going out into the woods and reading poetry to each other was just not something anybody ever did and and Peter said you know the important thing really is there can be some of that but they they have to have fun out there he had a wife his life continually got his goat and one day at dawn with her night shift on he slit her bloody throat the Vachel Lindsay thing at the end but the the Congo was actually supposed to be part of another scene I think in the original script there was a second scene out at the cave after Neil is taken away from the theatre I don't even remember it's still in the movie that poem from the Congo was was there so we moved it back then I saw the car cutting through the forest with a golden trap and I saw the come so the scene sort of transformed the beginning but everything in between is just supposed to be fun for me Todd was the main character of the movie I mean it which is odd because he doesn't talk that much he's not really driving the action of the movie but from the point of view of the my point of view anyway he was the the guy who changes the most in the movie and there's a resistance to change it's I mean he's sort of caught up in the in the Keating Ora magic here but he doesn't want to he's kicking and screaming I don't want to get up and do this and I think Ethan found that I mean I I I would have probably just had Todd's you know kind of in the corner until he finally stands up at the end and I think you know Ethan wisely just started to see that he could give a little bit more voice to the character but it would be the voice of resistance to change as opposed to just the changing and that would be another step along the way yeah in the original scene I think Neil comes upon Todd and Todd is is sad because he's received the desk set and then he says his father nicknamed him 598 which is the value of all the chemicals in our body if if you just had to sell them in the store so you know all the carbon and the various chemicals that's that's all we're really worth so it was kind of a self-pitying as you say dark scene and it's from that moment on from them from the time that he that the Todd tells Neal that he's gotten this desk set everything else in the scene is improvised by Bobby Leonard and and and Ethan so they had this idea that this the flying death set the whole bit Todd I think you're under estimating the value of this desk set would want a football baseball or a car or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this if if I were ever going to buy a desk set twice I would prophecy play this one both times fact it's shapes it's rather aerodynamic isn't it you can feel it Tessa wants to fly when when Ethan stands up he has this look on his face of just excitement and and affection it's wonderful so that that changes and it just really deepens their relationship and it's it's an act of defiance that you know we wouldn't have seen in him had it not been for this scene you know so it's it's really important well I mean of course the concern is that you know anything like carpe diem taken to an extreme or just that becomes your sort of motto of way of living isn't going to work you know living is more complex than that so in the movie is supposed to be a sort of working out of that to some extent and and this is one of the moments where you know the rubber meets the road and the boys have got one of the boys has gone too far and and you know pulled a silly prank so and I think Robin had the instinct that it needed to be just lighter that he needed to be one of the guys coming into the room not the scolding teacher which is I think the way it was originally written because it's the words are similar it's just how he did it was was was much more endearing I think and much better for the kids she was a time for daring and there's a time for caution and a wise man understands which is called for but I thought you'd like that no you being expelled from school is not daring to me it's stupid because you'll miss some golden opportunities yeah like it's nothing else the opportunity to attend my classes got an ace high captain keep your head about you that goes with a lot of you phone call from God if you've been collect it would have been daring we started having discussions fairly early on about the suicide Peter Weir said to me that he had once heard in mark Bergman say that if you have a main character in a movie commit suicide the audience will hate you so he said that's that's our challenge and I said what are we gonna do about that he goes I don't know so but we were also concerned that Neal's father seemed to arch to villainous to to sort of over-the-top so and and in the original script as you see you said the Neal's father comes to the theater sees that Neal is born his son not to do this play so when he gets to the theater and sees that his son is in it and see what he comes back during the middle of the play basically says to Neal you're not to get your things we're leaving and Neal says you can't do that I'm in the play we don't have anybody else to take my place is I don't care what happens you're you're leaving and he actually drags his son out of the theater and the play just grinds to a halt we don't even know what happens to what and he takes his son home and Neal kills himself and Peter felt that that was just too much and I had based Neal and his father on a friend of mine that I grew up with and his father would definitely have come and taken him out of the play in the middle but nevertheless we did it this way what performance you left even me speechless you have to stay with card cheating you stay away from my son Neal mr. Perry Camilla don't make it any worse than it is I think for me it changes the dynamic of the suicide because I don't think suicide should have felt like an option for Neal and right now I asked myself when I see the movie why doesn't he just run away from home as opposed to killing himself and I think if his father had been the type of father that had actually dragged him out of the theatre you would have this feeling that his father if you ran away from home it wouldn't matter your father would track him down you know at the end of the earth so and this is just something I don't know you know we never did it the other way and I certainly agree that having the father take him out of the play early would have been very strong and maybe too strong an action but it changed again changes the suicide so you know because it was you know it was it was it was a good discussion but I still wish I could have seen a version where where his father pulls him out because I think the suicide would have worked better I felt like the the hardest thing for me to take in the movie was the suicide it was just as an audience the first time I saw it I absolutely expected everybody to just walk out of the theater at that point I mean I was just whoa we have done something truly wrong here the theme of the movie was some something about you know sort of this this struggle with suffocating Authority versus this kind of internal drive for liber8 you know spiritual or liberation and so the father like the administration at the school was was you know an example of suffocating Authority so the more suffocating the better if as long as it's believable I mean the ending was really the most difficult part for me because I did that thing you're not supposed to do which is start writing and you don't know your ending you know and I had sort of a thought that the teacher there would be some sort of trial at the school and that you know after the boy's suicide there would be this this kind of kangaroo court but but somehow following some rules that the school had established and the boys would testify for him and so forth and so I started writing that trial knowing that this is just total there's no such thing you know and it makes no sense at all and then as I was writing the trial at one point one of the boys I think I guess they must have been Ethan's character Todd just became tongue-tied instead of talking or saying what trying to defend he just stood up on his chair and as soon as that happened I went oh my god that's the end of the movie so I dispensed with the trial and put it in the classroom and and then I realized okay this this this could work Oh God this is your final warning Anderson you hear me my cat there's no straight I warned you yeah for more on story check out our free podcast at on story TV or search the iTunes Store and get the book today on story screenwriters in their craft on Amazon you", "r_LIw63GkIg": "Hey, this is Danny D on CleanIt TV and welcome\nto the Mr. Clean 82707 Antibacterial Cleaner, Summer Citrus Scent, 24 oz.

you had a fun story what'd you do the last week or so which story are you talking about two you have two good wins you should share you did up amazing things last couple weeks um yeah i just got two into escrow um this week kind of back to back so just like a really intense snow sleep three days straight of countering and negotiating for everybody and one is a single family in garden grove we're in escrow 95 over ask and the other one is a condo less than a week we are i can't even do the math fifty six thousand over ask and then thank you for an escrow i think i told you guys that i got fired because i called a client to follow up and he almost cut his finger off when i called because he was doing some work well rather than just let it go i called nicole and was like hey do you want to work with a crazy person and she was like yeah sure and so she cold called him and then went on to take the listing and then went on to sell the house for 95 000 over asking but they still don't know that i know john like i never mentioned john's name it's not a warm intro he did not like i just had to pretend i was door knocking in that area and happened to here he wanted to solve happened to hear that you are my seller mr crazy pants so nicole saved the day on that one so good job nicole good job uh nicole do you mind if i ask like what was your intro like when you called him up that's a great question thank you for asking yeah so i basically said well first of all it was true because i never lie i don't like to lie at all um i do have a buyer that was looking for the type of house that they have so it wasn't the exact location i knew it wasn't going to be an exact fit but i did have a buyer that i would like to show it to um i said hey you know what um was in your area the other day looking at potential homes for this buyer um wanted to see if you had any interest in selling heard from a neighbor that you might okay so it's a white lie sorry um you know and he was like i'd sell it yesterday if i could like he was just ready like he had already talked to like five realtors it was a timing thing 100 um but now we're like bff so like eventually i'll come completely clean with them when i give them their closing gift and they have their money and it's all good um so yeah just call them and just let him talk like his wife had had a cataract surgery that day like i just basically did whatever i needed to do and listen to them and just said well you know are you okay what if i just come over and take some photos from my buyer like does that is that something you're okay with um yeah and they just let me come over and then just treated it like a listing appointment well great thank you question no i have one nicole me and him had not gotten clear on the paperwork how did you bring the paperwork to the table did you bring it with you did you email it later like how did you transition from hey we're talking you like we like each other too hey sign here um it was very interesting because when i got there he was very frenetic and all over the place and like excuse me and he was like working and like kind of like getting him to focus to sit down and talk but he had taken on so much getting the house ready that he like kind of collapsed in exhaustion and i just legit maintained eye contact and i just was like okay well what's your timing like what are you doing about this and i just started offering solutions and i just had to get him to talk and then he trusted me and the wife was kind of like doing her own thing in the back of the house and um it basically came down to the fact that it wasn't a paperwork thing at all she called me after i left 20 i didn't have any paperwork with me in the initial meeting she called me 20 minutes after we left and she's like he focused on you like you're managing him well you see him he sees you um he's taken on too much he's finally realizing he needs help and you made an impression and i was like i'd love to help i told him i would help i will do that that's all i can do is offer solutions and help um and then she called me back 10 minutes later she goes you're hired like you're hired he needs help he can't do this like that was that and so then i came with paperwork the day afterwards and just then it was a conversation and a talk and then i also made her do a docusign because she's tech savvy no problem i am so proud of you i could cry that was amazing good job nicole they're really great they just got the house got away from them jamie john do you have um lists for for sale by owners yeah um zillow had them has them kind of um for sale by owner fsbo.com for sale by owner.com is one way um you can bribe the people at home depot to tip you off every time somebody buys a for sale by owner sign at home depot but the thing i like the best is to incentivize the people who come to your door so the amazon guy the fedex guy ups driver mailman pizza delivery solar sales anybody who door knocks and canvases in a neighborhood should know that anytime they see a for sale by owner sign that they take a picture of it and they text message it to you and then you venmo them five bucks or you send them a starbucks gift card digitally or whatever your agreement is and that's something you can put on social media to your entire sphere to say hey i actually have an example of a post so if you want to private message me on facebook i'll send it to you my one of our agents megan in colorado my other rock star she posted it after i talked to her but basically it was hey i don't want to just know what's on the market i want to know the entire market and so friends and family i'd love to send you a cup of coffee on me every time you find a for sale by owner sign please text it to me and the reason that i do it this way is because any for sale by owner who is listing on zillow or anywhere that you can find reasonably is going to be hit up by a ton of real estate agents because they've they're and if they're listing it on zillow they may be smart enough to sell it themselves but the ones that just put the sign in the yard they are unlikely to receive the the same outcome and they are unlikely to receive any other phone calls and so my goal in life is to always try and find the um the for sale by owners that are just the sign in the yard kind of people because it's going to be a much better relationship intro more highly likely to to turn over etc in fact one of the things that we see that is most common is we see a lot of sellers who put the sign in the yard and that's how they choose their agent they were never going to sell for sale by owner they just want to find someone who's proactive and so by putting the sign in the yard they know who's proactive enough to call them and work to take the listing similarly to how nicole took hers so does that help thanks i'll dm you on facebook yeah it helps cool yeah private message me on facebook i will um direct you to the post and then that post went kind of viral um and then everybody keeps giving credit to the wrong person and i'm over here like that was my idea but it's okay but like 10 people it's like super it's gone all the way down the rabbit hole that so here we are um all right any other wins anybody wants to share from last week any amazing things happen um before we get into kind of topics and some meat and potatoes while uh dylan munches i have a coming soon in granada hill 700 000. april 1st how did you get that one um i was actually a realtor.com lead and uh you know stayed on top of her and got the listing appointment do you have the date on which it came in originally um late february okay like like the last day of february okay and how many times did you have to follow up to convert it uh you know what quite a few times because though the husband was the one reaching out and then um i had to win over the wife the wife was just like kind of putting it off like no no like we're we still haven't found a house and you know just like just not being uh cooperative and so if you had to guess how many how many touches did it take to convert it oh gosh probably like 20 20 times i mean email voicemails video messages say it again 20. yeah 20 guys are you hearing that how many of you quit on your internet leads after the fifth conversation when it doesn't turn into a pot of gold right everybody quits too early not the turco group because they'll get stuck you know what happens if you quit on an internet lead too early on the turco group they stick you out there at that lighthouse you end up living in the lighthouse of doom yeah and that's a true story it's a bad time if you quit on an internet lead i mean if you're from massachusetts living in that is like awesome all right hey hey john uh this is paul hey um i don't have i mean i have a question instead of anything because i'm just a two weeks in a year we're going to moving on to that part of the show so go for it what's your question i have a quite a few questions that i uh um like to ask to the group first of all is a gender matter because i've seen a lot of uh females they get deals easier than the male is that true not true 100 untrue so my business partner is a woman her name's missy and i constantly every single day have to deal with the pieces of the that she gets because she's a woman so the way men talk to her the way the negotiations go the way that showing requests are held the way that creepy dudes call her off the internet and sexually harass her the number of things like i knew this my mom was a very attractive real estate agent when i was a little kid still is and my mom got harassment and my entire life and i saw it so i thought i really understood it because of my mom's experience what i've seen in the last year with my experience with my partner missy is insane it is literally crazy and every single day i have to get involved and be like that's unacceptable how like why would you and it does not happen to me like literally the same person the same situation the same everything i get treated like a king she gets treated like dog so um no they do not have it easier number two yes occasionally women can use their looks or their right sex appeal whatever you want to call it to generate leads the problem with that is that it usually results in a disproportionate amount of  leads that do not go anywhere for guys that just want to waste your time get in the car drive around put you in a dangerous position sexually harass you the number of inappropriate messages that get sent to female realtors around the country by other real estate agents and potential clients is disgusting at a very high level so absolutely one thousand percent my strong opinion being in this industry for over 20 years is that men have it way easier just like they do in every other context of life men have it easier than women and the reason i ask because usually woman is more feminine and also they have a polite sound you know no no it doesn't work that way um people with accents make better cold callers so if you have an australian or british accent or you sound good often no then this sounds sexy i know yeah that word that does help on the cold calling i will say but as far as um and yeah are there times where a woman might have a little easier entry point with um you know a particular client when it's kind of a cold lead or this or that yeah occasionally that is a little bit easier but guess what else women frequently frequently female agents will not be hired because they are considered too attractive and the wife doesn't want them working with their husband happens all the time there's also an entire layer of consideration around where we go and who we meet and where we are so we're very mobile as agents and we drive all over i mean at any given point my calendar is updated my fiance knows where i'm going you know he should technically have everyone's contact information who i'm meeting with just there's this extra consideration um when you're a woman traveling by herself meeting strangers going to private residences that you've never been to before um around safety and and how you have to think about that well and you shouldn't be meeting strangers you should have identification and a pre-approval and some details on anyone that you're meeting that you don't personally know they should have to ideally come and like meet you somewhere public and present you know at least give you identification to show they are who they say they are and then nicole and everyone else um there's an amazing app called life360 that you can have it will update so a lot of people use it with their kids but it'll show you like how fast they're driving where their location i mean it's it's pretty detailed as far as the tracking goes i'm not a share my location kind of uh share a facebook profile kind of kind of guy but um safety first man so you may want to consider life 360 as a as another alternative to share your location with somebody you trust that you know just in case because we've heard way too many horror stories coming out of this industry with uh with that so there's also services like be known where you can look up people's records prior to meeting them and find out more information whether they have any public criminal history records on the reason i was asking because i was wondering is it that female dominated fields then is there any uh chance for the male to be successful here most of the most successful real estate agents in the country are men even though 65 of the population of realtors are women okay and my second question is um as you probably hear recently the zillow are trying to take over a real estate uh market just yesterday came out and they're trying to take over the sales person like us that we are trying to get the license and you already some of you guys already working on it uh means you guys already in this field for me i'm just uh trying to get the license um so is that going to impact our industry like csx and any other because i'm just trying to find out every aspect yeah yes yes and no if you let it and uh this industry could use about 50 less real estate agents but i'll go ahead and let joe answer this one joe what's your opinion so my opinion is generally speaking considered controversial um you have no competition other than yourself you cannot look at an advertising platform as a competitor we have systematically allowed and through endorsements of either our mls or our syndications or by paying the proliferation of an advertising platform if you are looking at a platform as something as to be feared you should be looking more towards amazon facebook or google as something to be fair because they are something where if amazon bought redfin or if amazon bought compass or if amazon bought anything else you will not have a job but if you live in a constant state of fear the sky is falling or that everything is going to be based around one person or one thing in your business you will not succeed so by saying that one entity will potentially make it so that you don't have a career you already don't have one you need to look at what can you do what niche do you serve and what value do you have and provide because there will always be things you know there are people that want the buy now from amazon and there are people that want to go to the store and speak with someone to be helped you shop there's always going to be different needs for different markets for different circumstances looking at something as silly as an advertising platform as an enemy is just a waste of energy that could be better used on prospecting well and it's a fun narrative that people like to put out there because it serves their purpose you in order to control people you have to you typically want to use fear to control their behaviors and so a lot of brokerages are using zillow as the boogeyman to control their population to say oh if you work with me i'll be your white knight and i'll save you from the evil zillow empire that's coming to take your toys away the reality is there's still travel agents to this day i know it's not a popul it's not like a popular concept or idea to say but there are still successful travel agents to this day there's a lot less of them but i bet you the ones that are still in business make a lot more money and the reality is is there's always somebody around the corner to disintermediate you if you don't think that there's always a robot or a tech company or a system or a person how about that guy who just started farming your neighborhood how about how about joe turco when he comes down to southern california and expands here you think i'm not worried you know there's there's a new competitor being born every day including sahaj paul i got to protect my database from sahaj paul when he gets licensed and he starts calling them all and once you know wants to hit them all up so they'll work with him instead of me right and he's going to be like oh i know john he's the worst i've seen him on his coaching he's going to try and take my business away too right man no no no no no no no no is there a competition in there is there competing i'm not sure is there competition between us each other of course everyone everyone on the planet is my competitor and everyone on the planet who's my competitor i use to make me better i need to be better than zillow i need to be better than nicole i need to be better than everyone and what i need to be better at is i need to be better at building relationships with the people in my life because the the relationships with the people i have in my life are all i ever need to hit every goal i could ever imagine so if we share the pie together then there should not be a competition the reason i'm asking because uh i'm not sure why we are having a competition maybe i'm not catching the point if you're an independent contractor everyone is an independent contractor and you you all have to go out and eat what you kill john can i ask a very simple question sure gosh if tomorrow somebody somebody john knows comes to you and says hey i know that you work with john pugh kind of and coach and but i actually want to use you would you say no no i will not say you no but i will tell him that he i will show you we didn't dwell environment right so we it's very critical that we work together to bring buyers and sellers together and work on the deals and that's why we offer a cooperating broker compensation in the mls and at the same time in order to get the deals and secure new clients and develop a database and get referrals it is a competition in that regard and so you know but it's a friendly competition it's a fun competition and if you don't look at competition as a good thing then you're probably going to go out of business because i'm trying to understand how this industry work how brokers and like you will be my co-workers in case i have a license tomorrow so how this thing works well only a few of us are really your competition locally because you're you're not in their market this is this is open to agents all across the country so technically most of these people would be more like referral partners than direct competition but at the same time just know that in any brokerage like we have a great culture at exp we all are owners of the company together we share information and all these other amazing things happen and there's some other brokerages that are very collaborative as well but most brokerages any old-school brokerage you know century 21 or coldwell banker or you know new brokerages like compass anybody like that their comp their whole thing their whole culture is extremely cutthroat it is i do me and i don't care about anybody else who even if you work at the office next to me right we work next to each other all day long i don't care and if you left early and you left your door unlocked i'd probably go in and look through your files and try and steal your clients that is your typical real so about estate office like this is if that happened john would probably be like what did i not do that allowed that person to go to sahaja yoga all day long he'd probably be like good for you sahaja clearly i did something wrong yeah yeah because if if they're if they're calling zillow or paula or nicole or tom ferry or anyone else if they're calling anyone but me i screwed up got it basically you just got a relationship and they're just closer because they have a different bond like that happens there's something some things you can't overcome i might have a client that was my lifetime client i did five deals with them they love me i'm the best realtor on the planet they want to work with me forever and then all of a sudden they start you know dating a girl who's a realtor hmm you think they're not going to use her no nothing right it's just life like it just happens so let's move on dylan dylan you had a question what's your question dylan oh no i was just gonna keep going but if well let's let's move let's change topics i think that i think we beat that horse dead enough who has another question or something they'd like to address i have a quick question sorry um last time on the coaching call um i think it was dylan said that he would let us know how to get the information for um newly licensed newly um no it was crusher it was it was the velociraptor oh divorce attorneys and probate attorneys did you oh the the problem with this question is it's different in every state here's what i found in massachusetts yeah here's what i found in massachusetts there is an um there are two ways to get get them easily and i don't know that i call them easily but uh lawyers weekly posts a um a list of all the new lawyers that come on so you could in theory pick a year subscribe to their listing or or in july which is when uh in october and this is day specific too when all the all the people come out you could like subscribe for a month and get a list of all the new people so that's one way to do it also in massachusetts and i presume they have something similar to similar wherever you are there's a digest with like all the licensed lawyers the problem is i can't find a download or anything so i found like a pdf and you could go alphabetically down and all the years they became licensed are there so you have to find like here's the question so what who sells or who makes money off of newly licensed attorneys and then go find that person because that person has the list it's just like if i needed a list of all the realtors i'd go to a title rep so if you can figure out where the money intersects with the new attorneys you'll find the person who already has the list that you're looking for because there's there's got to be industries or entities that are already marketing to new attorneys so they're already doing the legwork for you we just have to figure out who that is well i'm wondering i know could you just go for to california.com on californiagov.com on mass gov dot com and we have all the licensed attorneys california air association like somebody has somewhere right but i don't know i haven't done anything i think every state has a mechanism but it's probably not as well organized because look bar organizations law organizations are just like a lot of old organizations right like have they completely adjusted to current times can you just download a list of every lawyer in what year he got the answer is no who wants to create the exp of attorneys let's go do this let's create the online exp version for attorneys because it sounds like they're stuck in the stone age too and then chris we need a zillow go on the government website because it's current you want to make sure that their licenses are current and they're in good standing yes but there's a difference between a lookup function and an export function right like you can look up people but you have to know their name or something about them they're not just going to hand you a list of everyone who has the license exactly you can look me up in the state of massachusetts right now and find me but you have to know me you can't just export a list of every lawyer and be like i want every lawyer that was licensed in february of 2021. you know my favorite way unless you're suing the bar association and as part of your discovery you request a list let's do that nicole what did you do in a past life i want to know she's dangerous what haven't i done in the past live honey how much time you got don't ask me you can sit down yeah she wants to sue the bar association she's genius man all right so uh my favorite way to find new attorneys or find anybody you're looking for is to ask the people you already know so it's a really great way to reach out to the people that you're already in relationship with either by social media or otherwise to say hey i'm looking to meet more newly licensed attorneys who do you know who recently graduated from law school or passed the bar or is in law school right now another great way to do it you guys want to see this watch this share screen [Music] oh this is the flex if i've ever seen one what what hawaiian vacation is booked oh man what a flex um all right let's go to facebook oh it's not gonna let me log on oh that sucks um i have to change my password all right i can't do this live but i'll tell you what i was gonna do so i was gonna go on facebook and i was gonna search for facebook groups i was going to go look for the california oh maybe it did let me log in hold on i'm going to see if i can show this give me one sec um so if i find in here attorney so i don't know what i would look for i don't know how to search this because i haven't tried this before but if i go down here under groups and i put in attorney then there's going to be a big attorneys at law private group whatever so i really want a public group so ideally what i would find is like an attorney's group i'll just give you i'll show you guys this really quick on how this works okay los angeles lawyers right so now i it's a private group so i would like to be able to go in but what you can do is see here members if i join this and i go to members i can see a list of everyone who's a member in my area so they may not let me in right because it seems like an attorney's group and like whatever but there may be a public group so socal attorney network see how i found this right here so if i go in here and i look at this and i go under members it will show me right here at the top who are my friends that are members and it will show me members with things in common and then it will show me members near me and i can just go right in here and add friend see how that works you can do this with any hobby and any group i'm a member of um all the neighborhood um facebook groups in my area so i think that you can also go on there because people always ask for recommendations for certain things yeah you can ask for recommendations in any group like that but do you see how that applies to not just attorneys but you can go find anyone you're looking for you find a common interest you find a large group that has thousand plus members and then you go into the membership area and you just find the people that are near you so if i want to go into the snowboarding group because i like to snowboard and i want to see all the members that are within near me right in that snowboarding group i can go in and use that to add 20 new friends and then whenever they accept my friend request i can private message them and say hey thanks for accepting my friend request i requested you because we both live in socal and we both love snowboarding how are things going how are you handling the quarantine have you been up this season where did you go to ride how was it you know where's the best place to go during covid what's the most epic snowboarding trip you've ever taken whatever right if you've never done that before it sounds weird if you do it in re in practice it's totally normal you guys have common values common interests you start with basic questions next thing you know you're liking some of their comments and posts and you guys are chatting whatever and then you're best friends and now they're referring business to you when johnny if i might like all of us are calling people in our sphere or whatever every single day so just if anyone in your sphere knows somebody that's a new lawyer yeah no absolutely that was that was the first thing i said right it's like sorry i wasn't i stepped away yeah start with your sphere ask them who do you know who's in law school who do you know who just graduated law school who do you know who just passed the bar like that's a great place to start but then there's all these other ways to add in random people on any category of anything you're ever trying to find facebook is your best friend for all of that so um next question that's it okay we're done no just kidding um we could talk about some stuff um what have i seen lately that is crazy oh so um multiple offer situations so i have 11 offers in on my latest listing and i had an agent reach out to me and say hey you know do you have offers i said yes they said how many i said 11 they said hey i'm an agent but i'm buying for myself would you represent me in the purchase and you know help me get it right basically i want to work with the listing agent to get it i'm an agent but i want it for myself well guess what coincidentally she also worked for exp so i'm like all right i have 11 offers we're selling it a hundred thousand over asking like this agent wants me to represent her she wants me to kick back some of my commission to her as a credit which is fine but i'm not gonna even get a full commission on that other side which i don't really want to be in dual agency anyway right because i'm already i've already got 11 offers i'm already selling it way over asking do i really want to put my license and my liability on the line to have a small piece of this extra commission this extra money like it's it would end up to me like two grand like it'd be ridiculous like would i really do all this for two grand and so what did i do i reached out to my state broker and i said hey deborah here's the situation and she called me and she's like why would an exp agent in california want you to represent them on a purchase i'm like well i think she wants me to get her the deal right like she's she's trying to sneak her way into the deal she's i'm like way too much liability right she's like yeah that's crazy don't do it like tell her to write her own offer so i hit her back up i said write your own offer do whatever you want with the commission give the commission back to the seller to improve your offer or keep the commission to improve the price that you're comfortable going to and um you know good you know everything i i told you the price i told you everything so good luck here you go and so i i was fully transparent i told her exactly the price we were at i sent her the counter offer terms because we already sent multiple counter offers out so i copied and pasted the counteroffer terms to her so that she could write the perfect offer from step one and now i have two perfect offers the one somebody wrote and the one that she matched and so i'm gonna give them both to the seller and i'm gonna say here's the back story on both of them here's the qualifications here's here's the details by the way here's the five other backup offers that are like 20 30 000 less how do you want to handle this and then i'm going to let the seller choose because ultimately if i tell him to pick her and it goes sideways it's my fault if i tell him to pick the other one and it goes sideways it's my fault so basically no matter what happens if it goes sideways i lose so the only way i win is to say hey i got you two really great offers and i got you six amazing backup offers and i sold your house for a hundred thousand over and i'm yes i'm gonna hold you to it i'm gonna make you buy me that dinner we talked about in vegas because that was the deal i told them if i sold it over a certain price they were gonna have to take me to vegas and buy me dinner i mean we we blew that price out of the water we are nice living so close we are many many many thousand dollars over that steak dinner price i am ordering whatever i want in vegas um all right next question anyone i have two i have two amateur questions so i'm sorry no um one one is let's say you get a deposit check and they tell you to hold it for a certain amount of time over three days never touch the money but you can hold it over three days without depositing it and never touch the account never touch the money never touch the money never touch the money don't touch it just don't touch it no i don't want your deposit check you can give your deposit check to escrow i don't want it okay don't for any reason for anything not for a lease not for anything don't ever touch the money because if you touch the money then you have to register it in the trust log and then you have to da da da da and then you have to da da da da so you will screw it up somewhere along the lines and that is one of the biggest things that you'll get busted for from the dre so if you want to avoid that entirely forever never touch the money then you don't have the problem and you don't have to open a trust account don't touch the money ever okay okay cool thanks done that's a good question though because i haven't talked about that in a long time so and if anybody wasn't clear on my advice my advice is don't touch the money and nicole knows i i mean i probably drilled that into her head on day one too right i i've never not been very clear about that i'm never one to be a freaking cashier that's us gross job yeah if i wanted to touch money i'd work at target can can i ask a question about um so i just had a client he's not necessarily looking to move but he's getting started like his lease isn't over till november so it was a long time but we just put an offer in on a place that he unfortunately didn't get um but one thing i kind of noticed with him very quickly is his reluctance to get to the number that we would have needed for context it was a 445 000 home we offered 460. the accepted offer at the end of the day was substantially higher so he's he's also not from america so i don't know if there's any advice on how to like handle just being like hey we need to go really high super easy so go take every closing from march in that price range from 450 to 550 and show him where they started and what price they closed at okay so show him how every sale that closed so far this month closed for 20 or 30 or 40 000 over what they were originally priced at okay and if you want to be really aggressive call the pendings and see if any agents will give you any intel because that's your most up-to-date information right there well that was my second part is you have to explain to him when you're showing those you have to say look these are the ones that went on the market in january and they just now closed the market's even crazier today so next week we'll get some of the ones from february and then the week after that we'll get more but i'm going to show you and then show him every single week just pull up all the closings for the week and show him how and keep it in the price range that he's looking at and then show him how the 425 sold for 470 and the 470 sold for 510 and so on and so forth and then he'll just get a weekly update and you can say look based on this information what percent do you see as being the most common where these homes are selling for you could tell him what percentage it what it is right oh in this price range between 450 and 500 homes are selling for five percent over asking on average right you could just do the math for him and tell him that he won't he won't learn it the same way if you make him do the math and you make him fill out the worksheet so basically you could create like a little learner worksheet and it would have little fill in the blanks and then you could say here's your homework here's the data here's the worksheet fill out the worksheet and let me know what your thoughts are and what your questions are when you're done and then when he does that exercise he's going to quickly realize that he needs to be shopping at 440 to land at 500 or whatever it is right right okay cool thank you you're welcome helpful very good cool and nicole's right pendings are going to give you better data but there it's not concrete right you can't like you can't print it out and point to it it's it's it also makes you look like a badass because you did the extra work and you have the most up-to-date information and it looks like you know what you're talking about because it's information that no one else has well and the traditional thing to do would be to just take the ones that he misses and just fill in the blanks for him so sometimes people need to miss one four or five or six times to to learn right that's called that's called a slow learner and so you know if he if he missed it then you can just go back to him and say hey i know we wrote 460 just so you know they accepted 500. and then the next one you can say hey remember we wrote 20 000 over and i told you it was going to go way over that well guess what they accepted 510 and then you can say look the last one sold in january we these i pulled up they they were on the market in january and in march they sold for 460. and now the ones that are listed in march for 460 are selling for 500 in june what do you think is going to happen and let him answer let him fill in the blanks for where he thinks the market is going to go because the only logical answer is higher and so you're going to say so would you rather miss out on three more months worth of properties and then buy for 20 more or would you rather offer 10 over today's prices and lock yourself in on something and we can stop doing this okay or just take that thing from the broke agent or whatever that says uh hey that you know i think there was a mistake you set your offer in blank no you fill that out i'm just sick of shopping these people so you can always show that hey we can just send it we can send it over blank let me challenge you a little bit though like this concept because we all have these clients that think that like we're gonna time the market so you just mentioned like oh if you wait three months you're gonna pay 20 more like how do you deal with that client who's like well no the market's gonna fall eventually so chris i want you to do a live experiment with me okay okay i want you to tell me when we hit the top of the market okay just say go go oh did you time it no no no no you got it here right yeah yeah so do that experiment with them here we'll do it again tell me when we get to the top of the market go damn it exactly tell me when we get people tell me when we get to the top of the door i've got it that time you'll never get it right because you can't time the top of the market oh i was pretty close john that's number one right so number one is you can do that exercise with them and tell them they'll never time the market right they'll never time a bottom they'll never time at top the only thing you can do is decide are you ready what's your timeline how long is it going to go now let's put that aside right so mr mr seller you can't time the market that's stupid second thing is let's talk about it so everyone on this call i want you to give me a reason why how in the world someone explained to me for the next five minutes give me any reason why the market's going to come down someone defend that position expiring forbearance okay cool so in orange county right now we have roughly 2 000 homes for sale and a balanced market is 8 000 homes so we have a deficit of about 6 000 homes do you think that there will be 6 000 foreclosures coming on the market in the next two years to meet that deficit of supply and demand i think six thousand is a little steep number two there won't be any foreclosures because everyone has more equity than they've ever had so you can't really have foreclosures when you have equity all you can have is sales so again would that be a bad thing if we saw if all of a sudden the inventory doubled and we went from 2 000 homes to 4 000 homes we're still 50 off of a balanced market we're still in a deep seller's market even if we double the current availability of homes on the market not gonna that will not push prices down next evictions more inventory evictions same thing we don't have enough you will never catch that inventory you can take every eviction every fake foreclosure for sale behind on my payments forbearance all that throw them all in there and we will not we'd have to multiply our inventory by four it would have to go up 400 percent to get to a balanced market balanced it's not even a buyer's market 400 yeah so that's the question right what's going to happen with rates so let's say hypothetically that we get all this new inventory and it comes on and everything else happens in like what time period six months or a year two years how long so what's the interest rate likely to be then if the interest rate goes up half a point on a seven to eight hundred thousand dollar deal so today if you're buying at eight hundred thousand and it goes up half a point your purchasing power just went down a hundred thousand now you can only afford a seven hundred thousand dollar house so waiting doesn't help you because you're going to pay a higher payment or you're going to get less house and prices probably aren't going to come down they're probably going to flatten and so now you're going to have a higher interest rate on the on a flat market so that doesn't help now let's do the really good one right where are they living now so in most cases people want to either sell while the market's toppy right toppy i feel like the market's overheated i'm going to sell at the top i'm going to rent for a couple years and then i'm going to buy let's talk about that let's talk about why that doesn't work so i sell my house for 500 000. fair okay and i have 200 000 in equity that i pocket okay i bought it for 300 i sell it for 500 i pocket 200 000. what are the fees and costs associated with selling my house capital gains no no capital gains but i have to pay realtors five percent six depending where you are so how much does that come out to on a five hundred thousand dollar house uh 18 20 000 per side yeah so like forty thousand roughly plus closing costs fifty six fifty five thousand okay so what's my net 145 145 000. now how much is it going to cost me to rent that 500 000 home i was living in 2 000 3 000 right 500 000 house probably about no 2500 okay what's what's 2500 times 12 grand 30. okay so now what's my net 115 just over 100 right now i lost my write-offs and my deductions because i owned my home so now i'm a renter so i don't get those so how much more do i have to pay in taxes again way a little bit more right so what are we left with we're left with about a hundred thousand now that gets us to the first year in 12 months will prices have come down 100 000 what was that what's a hundred thousand on five hundred thousand that's twenty percent will prices have dropped twenty percent in a year and that's how much money you lost now let's say oh prices aren't down so we got to wait another year we'll now add another 25 000 in rent now you've only got 75 000 left did prices now prices had to come down 125 grand so they had to come down like 25 30 did prices come down 35 percent in two years no so you will never be able to sell at the top and rent on the sidelines and then have the market adjust and then get back in at the bottom that will never ever ever happen so the only way that works is if you sell at the top with an investment property and then you take your proceeds and you go put that money somewhere else to work for you so i sold my investment property it was the condo that i bought it was my first home i sold it i paid the i paid the gains i took a hundred thousand i put it in bitcoin great you put your money in bitcoin if you want to buy later when the market tanks you can sell your bitcoin you can move it back into real estate that's totally fine or i want to sell my primary residence and i'm going to go move in with my parents i'm going to live with my parents or a friend or a different property i own or whatever until the market corrects and then i'm gonna make a move okay i guess that's fine but selling your primary residence to go make yourself a renter to pay someone else's mortgage while you wait for property values to maybe come down it's probably the dumbest thing you could possibly do can you all see why that math doesn't work yep yep we're not what's all it costs not worth i like the i like analogy or something yeah because i know people did that i know people right now that just did it they sold last year this you know they sell when they thought it was high last year and now they've been running a year and now they're priced out of the market they can't get back in exactly because there's no inventory they're yeah so sorry but like that's where a good real estate agent do you see how talking someone out of selling if that's their story like that's the time where you're more valuable than ever if you want to tell a client what to do tell them not to sell when they're that crazy and they have that scenario like yes did some guy decide to sell in february of 2007 and go rent and make the best decision of his life yeah but that was a cataclysmic market meltdown that is not your typical real estate cycle that is a real estate industry cooked loan mortgage nightmare big short triple disaster economic crisis the world has never seen right that is not what we're going to see next people have equity buyers are qualified everyone is qualifying on their own merit there is no fluff in the system in that regard so buy and hold i think people believe that like this drive is covered and and that's it and it i use the i use you you mentioned worst case scenario it flattens out i use that a lot but we'll probably flatten out for a little while but we're not going to see 2008 again like we're just not well let's run that scenario so let's talk about it really quick so what happens if all of a sudden price uh interest rates go up to per two percent good well guess what you can't sell because you can't go qualify for your purchase right because the interest rate's too high so i won't sell because now i have nowhere to go because i can't qualify for a new rate so guess what now there are less sellers well now also guess what the entire country the entire country just refinanced at an ultra low historic forever low rate what happens when they can't pay their mortgage if they're smart they'll rent it out because it cash flows because it's historically low the interest rate is so low that the property cash flows so they're not going to sell either even if i can't stay in my home unless i i just have to tap my equity i would just go rent for whatever my mortgage would pay why would i get rid of my my property that doesn't make any sense so you're going to have less and less and less people that are going to be in a position to sell their home because everyone is going to be trapped in their rate and their equity and we're going to have all these people locked up as rates go up the market the inventory in the market is going to be locked up and then what everyone's forgetting is in 2007 there was no such thing as a private property real estate rental portfolio there was no such thing as a large organization like blackrock who owned single-family homes across america that they rented as part of their business model that didn't exist it was generated through the recession so now there are these large entities like blackrock that hold a large portion of the market those homes are never coming to market if blackrock wants to sell their assets to reallocate once they've depreciated once they've fully depreciated on their amortization scale they can sell them off slowly piece by piece but blackrock would never shoot themselves in the foot by flooding the market with all of their inventory so now we had 100 homes for sale ever in america blackrock took 20 of them and that those are just locked in the vault that will never get sold again so if you factor all these things together long term we're gonna be stuck in the supply problem for a very very long time that's my opinion all right let's do some ahas what'd you guys learn today not all at once i think i could pick one john it was a great it's a great session never touch money never touch the money yes honestly i'm done that's all i needed to hear now i feel good about my life what else talking people out of renting yes it's cap at the top of the market you cannot time the market yeah it's fine to steal clients from john totally steal my clients all day long i actually have an agent that i just brought on and i sent her my entire pipeline she's like you didn't delete these you should say you didn't delete these i'm like what do i care you can have all my clients info call them they love me like you're not going to steal my clients from me um anyone else give me one more aha thank you give me a confidence because i was thinking a totally different way for the state thank you very much if i don't if you don't mind john can is there a way i can get your phone number or anything so this way i can protect you after meeting sure i'll pop it in here right now thank you there you go all right any more ahas there's always extra work that you can do for your client yeah go the extra mile last one reaching out to my title rep so i can know which brand new agents are coming in so we can recruit them amen i love it um paula actually remind me after this i have a list of all the new licensees i will send that to you you can write them handwritten letters if you want love it thank you or look them up or whatever i have all the data and i'm not doing it so anybody nicole same offer to you stands obviously and anybody else who wants that i have the new licensee data so i'm happy to send that out thanks let me ask you a quick question just quickly one last question super quick um after you get the license do you is a csx give us a mentor training or give us some they assigned a person who can mentor us or something yeah we'll help you find a mentor um we will also continue to do

another new uh for specifically geared just towards new agents so there is a ton ton of training available once you get your license all right guys have a good one go out and sell some houses let me know if i can help along the way see you guys next [Music] week", "T2SIy_8o8eg": "okay we're looking at the designjet 510 how to replace the printheads you've replaced the printers that they were worn

is not mine this belongs to a good friend of mine who I work with on The Tonight Show his name is Greg Ellie and he's the prop master a lot of days I go hey is Greg here with the props no he's out working on his car you know so okay but then I go out and go oh the car is pretty cool so that's all right you can don't worry about that you can you can the show can suffer we want to get this car finished and as you can see it's just been a tremendous product project Greg come on in this is Greg Ellie hi Greg how you doing boss I wonder what you're doing out in the parking lot when you're supposed to be working yeah that's okay but now it's it's well worth it boy it looks beautiful thank you it looks beautiful this is a 71 510 510 sedan did a ground-up restoration on it it was just a hollow shell in a guy's backyard when I found it there was nothing but a wiring setting oh no no engine nothing no nothing there was nothing in it so I had to start all from scratch and it had been years since I'd had a Datsun so I've kind of forgotten some of those things but they came back quickly and Troy ermis racing and Tracy California helped me do all the suspension and the engine work and he did a wonderful job I did all the cosmetics and came out really nice it was fast oh they're wonderful cars one of my my second car actually my first was a 34 Ford when my second was a Datsun 1600 roadster and I was amazed at the build quality and how fast it was especially compared to some of the mgs and triumph sitting around it was a fantastic sports car but this one this was this is then like Paul Newman all those guys right yes yes Paul Way got a big poster in my house of Paul Newman racing one of these with two wheels off the ground going around the corner it's due Betty you didn't finish the car when he came I know I just started it the last time we had e1 and the thing that made these cool was this was independent suspension wasn't it yes sir yeah there weren't many cars in this price range back in the day that had independent it was real special I mean it was like it moms of God these cars and nobody really realized it for a little while and then they realize how well they handled and they race so well that they began and you know it's so funny you don't realize how small it is because even a mini now seems huge to me compared to original mini and this is really a nice sized car it's really not much bigger than a sports car would be and you got the full roll cage in it and we'll go through it in a minute but let's just let's just take it in how much lower is it then stock Oh probably about three inches and a half inches and of course the wheels and tires bring it down a little bit well I mean it really sits nicely and I like to thank you kept the original Datsun steering wheel yeah that's a 71 240 Z wheel actually all the original ones are all plastic in the center and only two spokes and I wanted something a little more sporty and I'd bolted right in you know the rumor and I don't know this is true or not but the rumor was Datsun before it changed to Nissan it was Nissan in Japan and maybe some of our some of our viewers can tell me if this is true or not but I was always told that they weren't sure how the Datsun would play in America of a Nissan would play in America and the early cars were somewhat primitive they weren't really built for the Americans super highways so they used the name Datsun to just kind of test the water and once once it became established the 240z came along then they went back to the brand name of Nissan now I have no idea that's true it's one of those rumors I've heard so write in the comments section tell me if you if you've heard the same thing I'd be curious but so there's a lot of young guys don't know what the name Datsun means anyway yes that's true look at what so what yeah but this is the car that really made it in America I remember Bob sharp racing out of Connecticut huge yeah Lime Rock and all those seeing these things turn around beating all the European cars very very exciting you'll still see them at the Monterey classic sorry yeah but nicely done I like the fact that you've kept the body stock at what color is that it's a 2009 Toyota FJ cruisers the ones that are blue and white on the top this is the blue and I really like it's called voodoo blue ovooed ooh blue yes very cool let's look under the hood okay what a nice job got to get in here to open the living now this is the fun part I like that that's kind of cool yeah it's kind of the stuck thing but because of my tower brace I had one of the springs and stuff I love this finish here tell me about this because a lot of guys just do this in body color but I like what you've done here yeah after we media blasted I decided not to paint it in there because it always gets messed up there's nothing in this is easily serviceable this is General Motors spider paint for trunks oh and we just cleaned it all out used their primer and I put it on real heavy I put about four coats on there iron it's just holding up what really looks great I like to look at that you know I love this period of car because the engine compartments are so simple distributor is right here carburetors are right here everything now is covered with great sheets of plastic and what and you can't get to anything yeah yeah it's so serviceable custom radiator here yeah champion radiator makes these for Datsun 510 s now Oh God because nobody did and they're makes a big difference and this is obviously an aftermarket pieces yes yeah that came from Troy as well and this just pops out as well yeah camber plates coil over shocks in the front right and it's 280zx front struts and cartridges and then a spoil over suspension on top of that yeah and we had to move it out of the way for a room because the brothers on this intake er a little longer than most of the others and what was the stock engine size in the 1600 1600 we got the horsepower back went in 96 96 and what are you getting now well this is twenty-three hundred CCS now and it's getting about a hundred and fifty three horsepower but a hundred and sixty and torque wrenches are really cool very nice and what holds great what is it way you know honestly I've never had it on the scale yeah they're very light yeah yeah with that fuel pressure there yeah fuel pressure here we plumbed it up from a fuel cell in the rear and the pumps in the back comes up here I could adjust the fuel pressure if need being of course keep an eye on it just so everything is nicely laid out fuse boxes right there I like to factor this like this painted rather than crowd powder-coated all the yeah that looks great instead of doing a chrome I just got tired of crow yeah yeah no that looks great something different no no it's really terrific let's open the trunk oh look at that nice fuel cell in there yeah we put in a 10 going fuel cell can you move the battery Optima battery to the trunk mm-hmm how many gallons is that 10 gallons so 10 gallon tank okay and it has a sending unit in it and a bubble so if you turn over it won't run right now then then 8 in the USA we like to do that yeah those are great spills nice sheet metal workers it's amazing how light these cars are it's really something when I put the doors on it I did it by myself yeah yes and I imagine most of them probably rusted out these one guy actually I'm surprised you kept the back seat in it because you really can't get in the back you really can't but you know it was more of a looks thing I didn't want the noise I really insulated the floors I inside the doors and inside the fenders and everything to keep the noise out because they were kind of noisy and with this exhaust system it makes it a little worse that's the 5-speed in there yes 280zx 5-speed from an 83 to 86 are close-ratio 5-speed 2 which is nice oh that's good yeah yeah they fit in with their the 286 flywheel and everything in the back is all 280zx as well 4:11 rear gear oh yeah with a limited-slip posi very oversized you joints and everything in the back so I like it when people use the sort of mother brand name mother ship parts with the little one you know like I like GM cars and GM motors and whenever I see a Ford with a Chevy engine just seems odd to me I like the fact that the you keep the brand all the way these son and Datsun had so many pieces that were interchangeable it's amazing how you can just go from one car to another yeah yeah and pull pieces like kick plates a Datsun on the move well yeah oh it's really nicely done oh thank these are called VTO wheels they're made by a company VTO wheels in phoenix arizona and they just came out when I finished the car I had a set of American Racing Leary's on here and I didn't want to use them because really old you know there 45 year old wheels right I saw these I couldn't resist I had to have them they're really beautiful and of course they help with the low profile tires yeah it's a beautiful car and the nice thing is you can still find these pretty reasonable mm-hmm you know and they haven't gone crazy yet and it's a true Japanese collector car this is this car has become almost as much as an icon it's a 240z among people who know these things yeah and oh I think it's just fantastic whenever Greg driving into work I always kind of paused him and look out the window well that's fired up and take you for a ride well you forgot how light these cars were back in the day you know you lose the steel door guard the airbags and all that stuff and god it feels like it doesn't weigh anything turbos are nice but an ass naturally aspirated engine just has that immediacy you know 150 hundred 60 horsepower doesn't sound like a lot but it's not the hot spots how much weight you're pushing and this thing doesn't weigh this thing is probably what 2,000 pounds 2,100 maybe 21 something like that so boy it's it's really lively it's a lot of fun to drive you know there's a whole generation of young car guys that think 3000 pounds is light for a car and you know the Lotus Elan these five tens the b2 tens conduct steering is just so direct so light he's got the upgraded brakes on it and I like that it's all nice on that I don't know I liked the purity of that keeps it kind of kind of cool yeah pulls nicely even in third horsepower sells cars torque wins races I gotta say it looks like a sleeper but not really you know the lowered suspension the blue paint it really pops going down the road and that's a great looking wheels aren't they as soon as I saw my Hannah Davis [Music] you got nice long legs I love that long : third gear you can see why these are so much fun to race you know this is a classic example of getting in on the ground floor what soon will be a collector car if you want to buy one of these now in any condition I almost guarantee you never lose money on it because each will always be collectible I always liked this style of sedan I liked it in the 2002 the tii BMWs I just like this straight sedan with the post for virginity here you know they just look cool especially like Gregg's where the car has been lowered slightly and you got the paint and I love the the painted bumpers instead of the chrome you got a classic design with kind of updated styling cues very very cool I love driving this thing [Music] you know this thing is so light it's so much fun to drive let's take it up on the freeway [Music] 7075 you're barely turning 3000rpm I think when you go to 450 sixes breaks out you know as much as people rave about the 3-series BMW a lot of these modern cars they're really not more fun to drive than these this is just so light and nimble and the fact that you build it yourself that's what kind of makes it exciting you know it's kind of fun to work on a car do a modification go out test it come back you know test that's what Greg is done he built this whole thing himself and it's pretty impressive you know if you see any of these five tens around grab them because they like I say these are gonna be the 57 Chevys of the future and they'll be going for big dough so Greg thanks a lot thanks for that we didn't do a burnout because he's watching babies not here we'll take it out and do it burnout next week you", "2tyFALFNoAo": "Bheeva, we can start\nthe celebrations now. Hey! - Hey.. Hey! Not a problem.\nLet us try it again. Sure. - Come on.\nLet us try again. Be careful, Govinda. No! - Hey!\nGood Lord! Let us try one more time.\n- Of course! Come on.\n- Climb. Come on, Tatya. This time,\nyou need to break the pitcher. Father, even I want to join them\nin breaking that pitcher. No, dear. You are not\ncapable of doing this feat. You may get hurt. Sai, we tried so many times to break the pitcher but we could not\neven get near it. Tell us, how will we\nbreak the pitcher? It is very easy, Tatya. Include somebody in your team who can climb right on top\nand break the pitcher. But Sai, who can do this feat? Dayaram. \"Sai..\" Dayaram, even you\nshould have tried. Even you wanted to take part\nin this ceremony, isn't it? Go and be a part\nof their team. - Of course, Sai! But Sai, he will not be\nable to climb. No way!\nDo not send him for this feat. He will not be able to climb.\nHe will get badly hurt. If Dayaram believes in himself that he can climb right on top then, to change his belief\ninto reality you need to support him. At this moment, your child needs\nyour encouragement. By not giving your son\nyour affection.. By giving some\nlevy to him.. Give him freedom\nto do something. What are you thinking? We cannot let our son\ntake part in this feat. Lady, when Sai is insisting then, nothing will happen\nto Dayaram. Sai has never said something\nwhich has been proved wrong. Lady, you have a doubt\nbecause.. Because you do not know Sai. Mr. Mhalsapati.. I admit that I do not know Sai but even you all do not know\nmy son better than me. I know that this ritual\nis not meant for Dayaram. He is not normal\nlike other children. He will not be able to hold\nanything while climbing let alone breaking the pot. Why are you silent?\nJust refuse to send him. Let your son go.\nTrust me. Go, Dayaram. Everyone is waiting for you. Trust me. \"Sai..\" Dayaram, even you wanted\nto break the pot one day, right? Maybe today is the day. It depends on you\nwhat you think whether you can do it or not.\nGo. I can do it, Sai. You couldn't do\nwhat I told you to! Why am I feeding you both!\nWhy am I feeding! Firstly, you both failed\nand came back and you want me to restore what mess you both created! But listen, I am not\ngoing to do anything. You both think about what to do\nand how to do it! I just know that I do not want\nthe 'Dahi Handi' organised by that monk\nto become successful. If that becomes successful,\nthen I will teach you both a wonderful lesson and I will punish you! Understood!\nGo! Get out of here! Get out of here!\nGet out! Get out of here! Hail Lord.. Dayaram! Sai.\nSai, he may get injured. Please stop him. It is not his cup of tea. You brought Dayaram, just because you trusted me. And now, it is time for you to trust your son too. Believe me, Dayaram has always\nbeen worthy of healing himself. He just needed to get encouraged by his father\nthat he trusts him and he can do it. He needed encouragement. And today.. Today, what you will say to Daya\nand how you will treat him will decide Daya's future. If you will stop him today,\nthen he will keep thinking that he cannot do it. But if you will encourage\nhim today.. If you tell him\nthat he can do it and he can overcome any\nphysical weakness in his own then he will definitely do it. A father's trust on his son will work as a shield. And he will defeat\nhis weaknesses with the help of this shield\nof trust. He will become healthy. He will become fit. The decision is yours. Sai, a father's decision\ncan only be for his son's better future. 'Oh, Lord Krishna.\nPlease protect my son.' Anta, if you want to save\nyourself from getting punished then pick me up. Mr. Anta?\n- Yes? What is happening over there? Mr. Banta, a guy is keeping\nhis feet over others shoulders and climbing towards the pot. This is the right moment\nto cut off the rope. - Yes. The pot will fall on his head\nand he'll fall. - Yes. Make it fast.\n- Yes, I'm doing it. He's moving ahead. Cut it fast. Mr. Banta,\nhe has already reached. What happened? Mr. Anta there is a snake here.\n- S-Snake. - Yes.. Mr. Anta, run..\n- Run.. Your hands are now fine,\nDayaram. Yes, Mother, they are fine now. Sai, I broke the pot. Yes, Dayaram. Do you remember what I told you? I told you that\nif a person is resolute then nothing is impossible. Sai.. I don't know how to say this but I can't thank you enough. Mother and father\nbeing over protective of their children can be physically and mentally\nharmful for their children. Children are more attentive thoughtful, fearless and mindful than we give them credit for. There's no limit to what\nchildren can achieve but elders pull them back due to their regressive\nthinking. We will only know\nwhat a child is capable of if we let him have the freedom\nto do what he wants in the first place. I will give you an example\nof Mother Yashoda. She always used to be worried\nabout Krishna's safety but she never stopped him\nfrom going outdoors. She knew that Kansa\nwas after Krishna to kill him. Mother Yashoda was wary\nof the fact that Krishna will have to\nface his destiny one day or another. It all depends on the upbringing\nof a child that whether he'll face problems\nin his life with courage or he'll be rather afraid\nof them. I have understood, Sai. I have understood it. I'll not be worried about\nDayaram anymore. I'll encourage him to do better\neach day. Dear, I told you right that Sai will make everything\nalright. Sai, you cured my child and helped my husband prosper but I kept on ridiculing you. Forgive me, Sai. \"Hail Lord Krishna\nand Lord Ram.\" \"Hail Lord Krishna\nand Lord Ram..\" You both are parents\nof the child and that's why its justified\nto be worried about him. There's no need to be sorry. But it's important to start believing\nin your children. Lord is our protector. \"Om Sai..\" \"Sai Om..\" A time will come when the people who are\ncelebrating with him will soon start opposing him. I won't just sit here peacefully and neither will I let him\nlive peacefully. Hail the Lord. To overcome every problem and every trouble the residents of Shirdi\nwill have to be faithful and patient.", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss

and that is how do I clean my pen vape and there's quite a few pen vaporizers out there but we're going to stick with the three general styles we have a dry herb we have a waxy concentrate and then we have an e juice style pen vaporizer here so we're going to go over how to best clean and maintain these vaporizers we're going to start off with the dry herb style I happen to have an at most Rx here I personally not a huge fan of drier pen style vaporizers they generally don't work too great often burn a lot so what we have here is a nameless rx with a glass screen down in there covering the herbs so we're gonna take a cleaning brush I find works best for the dry herb units and just kind of go down into the chamber and do the best that you can just simply take and clean the herb right back I they're just tapping it out onto a table into an ashtray whatever you have to just kind of get the herb out of the unit and with these pen units because they have the screep of the spring that pushes down on there it can be packed a little tight in there and when it all falls out if your pen unit happens to have one of the little glass screens in it I just take that and I put it into a little bit of isopropyl alcohol just a little bit of rubbing alcohol that I have here it's glass you can drop it in there and let it soak for a little while and while that's going on I like to just continue brushing any of the loose herb out of the drier chamber what you want to be weary of with these is there's a little coil right down inside if you accidentally snag and pull on that coil becomes loose in any way you're going to end up damaging the chamber and then this thing just ain't going to work right so you want to avoid pulling on the coil down in there just gently brush mostly aim for cleaning out the sides of the sir chamber there and when that's cleaned out some people like to take just a little bit of isopropyl and q-tip very small amount because you don't want to damage it holding it upside down take it and run it along the inside around the threading area this will keep it clean and maintain it without damaging the coil in any way and that's how we suggest cleaning up the dryer type of a pen style vaporizer very simple easy to maintain you know not the best it might end up burning but that's how we would handle the dryer now we're going to take a look at the wack style vaporizer and right here I have a micro vape nano unit very discreet very portable designed for use with waxy concentrates to go ahead and clean this one basically what we're aiming to clean here is the threading on it I like the pen style vaporizers for wax that are like a threaded connection and screw on as opposed to the ellipse style that pop off I think those atomizers they come free in your pocket easily I like when it's threaded on you know you have a secure connection to both the chamber and the battery will stay together well but one of the things you face when using that is you get some pretty gunked-up threading and when it comes to cleaning a wack style vaporizer you're not really looking to clean the coil you don't want to damage that because it's no longer going to heat up the whole idea what this really is to take in a q-tip with a little bit of the isopropyl alcohol and this is more about cleaning the threading on the wax tile vaporizer cleaning the threading is going to help keep it operating smoothly because you're going to be able to easily disconnect and then reconnect the top of the chamber to where the wax goes and with these style of cartridges where they thread off right where the wax goes it can be kind of a hassle if it's stuck together you're trying to open it so frequent cleaning of the threading on the wax tile vaporizers is really all you need that's kind of the whole goal you don't want to damage the coil in any way shape or form if you damage the coil it's just not going to heat up any more so when using your tool to load the wax onto there it's my suggest and all of our suggestions here at vaporizer review that you don't scrape it across there if you end up scraping it there's a very good chance you're going to damage it so that's something you're looking to avoid when it comes to loading just try and gently get it onto there do not be scraping across the coil and when it comes to cleaning all you're aiming for is the threading just want to get all the wax off the threading so you can unthread it and rethread it very easily we're going to take a look at now would be the less the pen style units we have here and this is the one mostly for like a juice I personally don't vape a lot of ejuice myself but I like a buck-naked style when it comes to these more often than not you're just going to change out the heating cartridge here the oil tank after a few uses if you're using different flavors it's not going to be that great but if you only have one tank handy and you do want to clean it out what I suggest doing is getting another one of the oil loaders and just fill it with some warm water the style I hear has a little bit of a wick so it's going to possibly retain some of the flavor but if you take a little bit of warm water and just kind of flush it through out there that's going to help clean it up a little bit and remove some of the flavor from it without having to buy a new tank every time you want to change the flavors that you're using in there a little warm water is all it takes you don't need to really soak it too much you want to avoid getting it down the hole in the middle as well as otherwise it might leak through there so avoid getting it down the hole in the middle otherwise there's might leak through on you and that's really all you need when it comes to the pen style close it up with that on there like this with a little bit of warm water in there keep it read and just give it a little bit of a shake this will help loosen up any of the e-juice that's in there and remove some of the flavor from it and that's all you really need to do when it comes to the EG style so that's our suggestions when it comes to cleaning pen style vaporizers if you have any further questions or just want to leave any comments go ahead and leave them down at the bottom of the video and we're here to assist you alright guys Cheers", "TGMOZRwITcQ": "when i talk about cleaning the surfaces of your home one of the surfaces i don't often refer to walls ceilings and baseboards i guess that's really three surfaces because those seem like things that you do every once in a while but not something that needs a regular focus so in this video we're going to cover that once in a while cleaning what you should be doing for your walls your ceilings and your baseboards to keep them looking clean and in tip-top shape because after all they're kind of like the skin of your home and when you walk in and they look marked up and dirty the whole house feels dirty walls and ceilings need to be tackled relatively infrequently your baseboards are the thing of all three of these that you'll want to clean the most often and i can't give you an exact interval for how long you should wait between cleanings because each home is unique so let me discuss some of the issues that could affect the frequency that you'll need to clean these first and foremost if you have a smoker in your home you'll notice that wall ceilings and baseboards can cling on to odors and they can also start yellowing so you'll want to maintain those wells uh ceilings and baseboards more frequently than if you live in a non-smoking home the same thing goes for pet owners specifically dog owners because what ends up happening is dogs will run their little noses along your walls and your baseboards they'll leave marks they can also chuck toys and that could be an issue even people with small kids kids like to you know touch walls draw with crayon you get a lot of fingerprints and stains so that is going to up how frequently you need to clean your walls and your baseboards i know i have crayon stains on my walls that wouldn't have been there three years ago before you start cleaning your walls you want to know about the kind of paint that you have and if it can tolerate cleaning you'll often hear me say make sure that you test it in a hidden area first and this is a perfect example of that because if you start cleaning one of those surfaces with a solution that we talk about here it could leave a mark that you actually can't get off your wall and that would be because the type of paint that you have on the wall couldn't handle the type of cleaning so anything that we talk about from here on in just make sure that you test it in a small hidden area first and keep in mind that there are four different types of paint that you might have at home a mat an eggshell a semi-gloss or a gloss typically in wetter or dirtier parts of your home like kitchens and bathrooms you'll see a semi-gloss or a gloss which are easier to clean and wipe away whereas eggshell and matte will obviously show uh more cleaning stains if you will so you've got to be really mindful about the way that you tackle your cleaning of your walls on the topic of paint using it to refresh the baseboards walls and ceilings once a year really helps keep your home look fresh and up to date in fact one of the secrets of hotels is they have someone on the maintenance team who literally just goes around the hotel touching up scuff marks with paint all the time because it helps to make the place look fresh so you can do the same thing at home a couple pointers on this when you're painting your home make sure that you retain the paint chip so that you know exactly the color that you need to get the little can of and on the topic of the little can when you go to a paint store you can request a sample can which is about yay big cost you a few dollars you can bring that home use it for touch-ups and that way you don't have to go and buy a whole gallon can this is something that you can do once a year it doesn't take very long and it makes a huge difference baseboards are of the three the one that you'll have to clean the most frequently because they are a horizontal surface and they're right at the bottom of your home so dust always falls from top to bottom and loves horizontal surfaces that's why baseboards can look so dusty and dirty the other thing that you deal with with baseboards scuff marks someone might have you know kicked it with a shoe or thrown something and you'll see little nicks and scuffs all over the place so here is how we deal with baseboards you can either use a vacuum with a brush attachment that's pretty quick and easy you can also use a dust mop or a microfiber mop like the makers mop or you can use a microfiber cloth just to give them a wipe but i want you to remember that you should always use a dry tool to get rid of dust because as soon as you use a wet tool to get rid of dust on a baseboard it actually kind of glues some of the dust behind and it can be really difficult to remove after all right so now you've dusted your baseboards you're good to go here is how to clean them you can use a very simple solution of all-purpose cleaner we want to keep it nice and simple when i say all-purpose cleaner you can check out a recipe down below and you can apply that with a dampened microfiber cloth or sponge so what you'll do is you'll wipe you'll work section by section and then what i think is a great idea is to dry each section with a microfiber cloth too now if you notice a scuff mark or something that's rather difficult to clean you can add a little touch of baking soda to your microfiber cloth and literally use your finger to kind of erase or scribble it out again you'll want to test that technique in a hidden area too just to make sure it's not affecting your paint when we think about cleaning a full wall there are a few cases where this would make sense if you're moving into a new home or if you're about to paint a wall you would want to prep it by cleaning it first while they don't generally get too dusty or dirty when you're doing something like painting you really want to make sure it's a 100 smooth and clean surface and if you live in a home with someone who smokes over time the wall will discolor and also absorb some of that tobacco smell the way to clean your wall at first would be to use a dry microfiber mop and use the w pattern going up and down working your way from left to right around the wall the same principles from the baseboard applies you want to remove any dry dust first and then you can wet treat the wall afterward so if you want to move on to that step and actually get rid of any build up on the wall what you would want to do is mix up a solution of a gallon of water then you would want to use about a tablespoon of dish soap and about a cup of white vinegar so what you'll do next is you'll wet your mop pad and you're going to work section by section using that same w pattern what i would recommend is to make sure that your mop pad is really well rung out too much moisture on drywall is going to be problematic and then i would also recommend finishing it up with a dry microfiber pad or towel just to remove any of that excess moisture then you can move on to the next section and work your way around the room the general wall cleaning that you'll do is just spot cleaning that's what pops up the most and what you'll see most likely are fingerprints and scuff marks these are pretty straightforward and easy to clean you want to use the same all-purpose cleaner solution we talked about for the baseboard and if you notice anything particularly greasy you can apply a little bit of cornstarch to the area where let's say there's a greasy fingerprint let the cornstarch sit for a period of time gently scrape it off with a dull edge and then clean the surface with a bit of all-purpose cleaner that's a great easy way the cornstarch absorbs the oil and gets it off the surface for you now for scuff marks these happen when things get whipped around the room or shoes get kicked off scuff marks are generally pretty easy to clean and the way that you can approach it is like i said earlier with baseboards using that all-purpose solution on a microfiber cloth and sprinkling a little bit of baking soda on there then you can just gently start to remove it with your finger other things that work really well a magic eraser what i said earlier is just an easy quick way to do it but if you have a magic eraser handy people swear by that as well what i always recommend is to rinse the surface afterward just to get rid of any grittiness that's left behind either by the baking soda or the magic eraser the bathroom does present a few unique wall cleaning opportunities so the first one let's just cover it it's by the toilet if you notice that there are splatters and the way that you would know this is by sort of angling yourself not looking straight on at the wall but kind of angling the way you look and you'll start to see any of those drip marks that will tell you exactly where you need to clean now the other thing you could do if you want to be fancy is you could get a black light but the trick i told you works really well too the best way to deal with urine splatters is to use an enzyme cleaner something like bio clean i'll link it for you down below you basically spray it onto the surface i would also do the base in the area around the toilet as well as the baseboards let it sit and then you can wipe it away this will really help to reduce not only those marks but also any odors associated with it the kitchen is another area that you'll want to pay attention to the walls in on a regular basis that's because you're dealing with a lot of grease and a lot of splatters so if you're in an area that's close to your cooktop you might notice that there are some greasy splatters or marks that you need to deal with you can use that cornstarch trick another thing you can try is the enzyme cleaner again you just want to make sure that the paint can handle it so test in hidden area first and when you're going about your day cleaning up your kitchen after a meal just do a quick visual inspection on the wall and wipe up any of those stains just like with clothing the longer a stain or a mark sits on the wall the more likely it is to set in and the more likely you'll have to do some repair work so the quicker you can handle it the better generally speaking the ceiling stays pretty clean unless you're like me and you accidentally spill a smoothie and it has an explosive moment in your living room that did happen to us the other thing that happened in this room we had a really pesky mosquito and finally chad managed to swat it and it laid to rest on our ceiling so those are some things that you might come across from a sealing stain standpoint from time to time now if you have a popcorn ceiling generally stains can be a little bit easier to camouflage but on a flat ceiling they can be pretty difficult and because ceiling paint is so matte it actually doesn't tolerate cleaning very well at all so what i would recommend is you can wipe the surface as gingerly as possible but be prepared that you will probably see the spot that you cleaned and you might want to paint over it with some ceiling paint now the same thing goes for if you accidentally get some paint on the ceiling you can just quickly touch it up there popcorn ceilings i get asked a lot about how to clean them it is quite laborious to clean so what i would recommend is if you see an area that is particularly dirty and by that i mean there's quite a collection of dust in a particular area so there's discoloration you just want to use a vacuum with a brush attachment to quickly sweep around the area and remove any of that buildup generally in cleaning i always tell you to clean from the top to the bottom but today we went from the bottom to the top but now you know how to clean your ceilings your walls and your baseboards and i'd love to know in the comments down below when it comes to picking paint are you someone that likes to go for neutrals like this while behind me or are you someone that likes to go for something more bold like maybe a wallpaper or a bright color like i mean it's not a bright color but it is a bold choice and we went for a lot of color in this house aside from this room so let me know your paint thoughts in the comments down below now if you want to learn about how to clean floors in a rather comprehensive manner you can check out this video right over here and you can learn more about the maker's mop i was using this video by clicking those links right down there i hope you enjoy this video and that i've helped you along your journey toward a cleaner life thanks so much for watching and we'll see you next time", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth detailed reviews unboxings and feature comparisons on the individual items so I suggest

Clean Magic Eraser yeah and it's a spunda not a pen like I thought it was because I was confused okay so um Leanna tell us what you tried to do before you tried the magic eraser well we have scuff marks on our floorboards see Oh like that and and on the walls and in my apartment as we're moving out I wanted to clean them up so we don't have to repaint it and pay them to repaint it so I used water soap soap and water and sponges with the bristly back side I used towels hand towels I use the Clorox disinfecting wipes and nothing got them off and then you your mother apparently recommended these without actually trying them and you bought some and you were amazed Sonali Anna's gonna demonstrate for us the magic cleaning power of mr. clean sadly our worries okay first you get it wet and you get out all the excess water we've already used this one a little which is why it's all dirty they don't come that way yeah okay so let's do the wall one first listen yeah and just like that it's a significantly reduced we'll probably go over it again and let's do the floor board one because that one's pretty good scuff oh so there you have it people it's pretty cool yeah my lily and I go back to cleaning my house okay so now that we've discovered the joys of the mr. Clean Magic Eraser on scuffs and floorboards and walls and stuff we thought based on an Amazon review somebody was complaining that they don't last very long which is true but they also suggest it that you probably shouldn't clean your whole bathroom with it but that I actually made this think Oh or about them's really nasty so and mostly because we never clean it so with that we give it a shot on the bathtub we haven't tested this out in advance because we just want to see it will work but as you can see I think we're going to focus on this area over there and there's just a lot of dirt and grime that's kind of stuck on yeah it's kind of gross don't judge me please okay so let's see how it does so in your opinion Lana has this compared to the easy out BAM that you sometimes use when you have to talk more about it it's a little bit better just because you don't have to deal with the bleach smell and you don't get chemicals all over your hand with basic your shoes and gloves with it seems a little bit safer you'll probably go through more product with the mr. clean as it doesn't last long but it's just as easy it doesn't take as much time as it is described with the easy off them you do a little bit um in the really tough spots but for the most part it actually does just get it itself so so this is probably faster but a little bit more manual labor probably okay well it seems like it's taking off the junks of this for sure we're going to go through boxes of these things I think Procter & Gamble is going to be ripped off of sob right okay well it looks it looks like an improvement to me um Wow okay anyways I'll stop this video and let you clean", "C2cH-LKDAGs": "okay guys I'm just gonna show you guys what I'm doing I'm basically fill this with hot water or vinegar just to cut the grease off of the table and then I'm taking a paper towel and I'm wiping it off look at that it's getting all the grease off I don't know if you could see the grease that was on here but it was so much I think I could show you I don't know if you could see it but it was disgusting and they're just gonna take these pillows off because look at this thing here like chocolate okay that's going on here and this is just a match because I'm gonna mop the floor yeah my streak free clean table so now I'm just bring a little bit of that vinegar water mix [Music] just so I can get the grease off the soul - I also spray this method heavy duty degreaser on there as well so this is a fight I clean so far it looks good but I think I'm still gonna have to use the easel I'm like here and like here but I got it pretty clean this is a side I still have to clean and yeah this is this Hopf way I cleaned I left like like a film over it so I'm gonna ends it up I'm gonna end up trying something different like that I'm just gonna show you guys me trying something new so this is some stuff we just got mr. clean clean freak it is supposed to be used on kitchen stainless steel in bathroom so because this part is stainless still better try it on the stainless still and hopefully you work look at that still Margaret you saw here cannot see that is really working it's not like a street free clean I will try it again on the frigerator so far I did not like it just I don't like it I'm just gonna use when I'm using it and then you just take a paper towel like that is so pretty like how pretty that looks now compare that for the other video so much cleaner yeah I'm probably not gonna use that mr. clean stuff along the frigerator because it's only gonna make me upset so look at that nice and clean gorgeous", "OlmCg0p5cgU": "- [Narrator] Mr. Clean\ntakes on patio furniture.

here in three colors today's brief episode is gonna run through this awesome 510 thread tank which is gonna put definitely big sub ohm style power into your regular 510 thread batteries that you have available we have them here in three awesome colors and I have paired them with three of our awesome batteries just to showcase and accentuate exactly how nice they look we're gonna run through some of the performance specs get you guys some close-ups of this tank as well as show you how to fill it so without any further ado let's just jump right in here we have our performer tank let's get a close-up with these three nice colors we have this wonderful rainbow color which is our multicolor as you can see here I have it paired with our B master battery or a little three temperature battery you see it changes colors as the light hits it from the stainless steel mouthpiece each one of these tanks has a glass reservoir and two millimeter orifice openings with a ultra low resistance coil in there for fast heat up times as well as good flavor the block on here is a ceramic so it's got ceramic performance but it heats up faster than your standard ceramic now let me show you the stainless here we have the stainless steel performer tank I paired it with our stainless steel Gold Line battery as you can see it's a very good match each one of these tanks is a half Milka Pet fill capacity on it and we're going to jump into how to fill it very quickly and also we have a nice gold finished which I've paired with our Black Gold Line vape battery nothing like mi is a black and gold like a honey stick color okay so each one of these glasses is made out of Pyrex the internals are actually made of a stainless steel as well as the mouthpiece so just can be very durable it's gonna feel very high-end and rugged for your glass tank it's not gonna feel like one of those little flimsy glasses that you know you squeeze on it's gonna break you know it's a pretty solid tank now one thing I do want you guys a note is this will work with a majority of your 510 thread batteries and also your push button concealers however because it does not have an air hole right here let's get a close-up right here on the thread because it does not have an air hole here this is not gonna work with your auto draw battery so don't try to pair this up with your bee box with your elf or your auto draw stick batteries because it's not going to be compatible you're gonna need a push button battery to power this thing up now if you're powering this up on mod batteries I don't recommend you really go over 10 watts because then you could hurt the taste but this one will take a little bit more power than your standard vape cartridges that I would normally only recommend you run it like seven seven-and-a-half watts now how do you fill this tank this is a little bit more of a process and you do have to be careful because you don't want to overfill and you don't really want to top these off because then you could make a mess so let's go into how you're gonna fill these now if you're one of those guys who orders ten cartridges at a time on our website you know who you are there's a lot of you out there that are filling your own cartridges this is actually a really easy cartridge for you guys to fill if you guys are feeling quite a few cartridges because it's very simple you just unscrew the top piece and the whole center post comes out so you have this really nice big filling area and the tank stands securely on its thread so you have this wonderful nice filling area that you can fill with a syringe you don't have what you have with several other to where they would have a center post that blocks up a majority of it where you're filling on the outer edges and with really thicker oils that can be a real problem for you to fill because the oil kind of doesn't it doesn't pour down fast enough and it kind of comes out over the edges and can take a really long time with this it's very simple you have a big fill surface area you could put thick gunky oils in there and wait for the oil to kind of sludge it down and you don't have to worry about coming out from around the sides or bending the center post the one thing you need to be careful of when you're filling it is don't fill it beyond this max line because when you put the center post and the top assembly back in you're gonna cover up and that that level is of the oils is going to come straight up to the top and if you fill above that max line it's gonna come out the sides and you're gonna waste your precious oils or CBDs so just to demonstrate how he would fill it I have some gold lines TVD here what is it it's our 500 natural gonna purge it a little bit all right so I'm just going to slowly fill it I check my level nope I went a little bit over the max line because I wanted you guys to see it more than I was trying to do a good job so I'm just gonna take a little bit out yeah that looks right about perfect I mean I still might be just a hair over but what we're gonna do now priming this tank is really simple all's you have to do is make sure when you're putting it in and you're screwing it in you do that very very slowly then once you have it screwed on tight you're just gonna let it sit for about 20 minutes and these these pores are wide enough to where it's gonna be pretty good priming for the tank so I'm gonna go ahead and very slowly put that in okay you put on too fast the oil could shoot up too quickly and then it can come out the sides as well and you don't want that then you want to get a nice good hand tight on it don't over tighten it but you're gonna feel the gasket make contact with the metal and you're gonna feel it compress right when you feel that you stop which is I felt that let's take a look at this level yeah it looks pretty much like it's right up to the top like I said you don't want to top these off then you're gonna put it onto your battery and generally I would let this sit for about 20 minutes but also you can do to prime as once you've let sit for the 20 minutes because I'm not actually gonna be vaping on this right now is if you click it twice it goes into preheat mode you see it flashing that means it's preheating so with that really low voltage heat cycle did it put soother your heater is actually priming I'll let it run through the preheat cycle of it priming once it's done flashing I'm gonna put it into the temperature I desire let's say I want to go middle and it is ready to vape if I want to go higher oh yeah I can hear fizzling so this is now ready to vape make sure that you guys definitely get a good prime on the tank you do not want to you do not want to you know fill it up right away start ripping on it at a high temperature and then you're gonna get a metallic taste because that's gonna ruin your vaping experience is a nice ceramic high performance cartridge you definitely want to enjoy the taste that it has in it so make sure that's properly primed and you set it up good and then this is definitely gonna be one of the higher performance small tanks that you have in your arsenal so I hope this video was

horsepower beast of the c63 s the top sports version now we are taking this massive 363 as the top model with 519 holes for on the Ascari race track here in Fallon Spain let's see how that actually plays out with a wheel drive so much power and also with a differential lock because there's a basic difference between a c63 s and the non as well just c63 little bit less horsepower and the rear differential is mechanical on a c63 and here on the S version it's electronical maybe to get even more performance let's see alright let's start with the c63 s on the race reckon you already hear it this is of course a big difference to the C 400 already just sound wise and of course the guys safer door more include got the rear wheel drive it's just pure racing machine and first I'll get the a little bit used to the racetrack and the second round will push a little bit harder than what I already know feel is that the brake supply way hard we gotta of course bigger brakes here as well and we don't renew this car for everyday driving but for the racetrack I mean why not also when I mean this the things the different rear differential locks we're mostly play a part if you're really very professional driver and really push the limits bone really plays such a huge effect here for me now if it's mechanical or electronic girl it's good that you do have it that reduces the wheel spin especially when you accelerate out of the corners very direct steering wheel here and that row scary racetrack is famous actually for that it mixes different racetracks from all over the world in different passages of the racetrack that's what makes it so interesting right here there's never a performance wall with this car no matter when you press the throttle it's always right there with this v8 and that's why example also a big difference for example if you pick a bigger sports car which is heavier here as we're still in the mid-size segment the car still feels very agile and you can very well control it the balance is very good actually so even if we're now in the v8 we've got a lot of power just we are the rear wheels always feels kind of controllable however difference to the C 400 or later or sort of the C form 50 will be we don't have the all-wheel drive here it means if you are able to play around with the car maybe let the rear-wheel drive slip a little bit in the Sport Plus mode will feel now a little bit when we push it all in really hard that we slip around the corner a little bit that this of course goes here for the racing but for everyday street riding and then the all-wheel drive will of course be the 10 epic yeah I am really enjoying riding the c-class coupe a Lincoln generation here and you really get a few the G Falls that have also the G meter in the central screen here as well and that shows me how much G forces are applied to each side for example now 0.8 to the left side when I'm in the right corner it's always of course a nice bit of a racetrack to show off to your friends for example let's have an even more by the way another difference is here in the shifting you usually get an automatic converter gearbox with for example of the z400 so far the 7-speed one later on next year they will also introduce the new 9-speed automatic converter gearbox for that here in the ng model however it's different we got the MCT here means multi-cloud transmission or other method called dual clutch transmissions serving speed and they were even faster shifting closer from that is reserved here for the very sporty models so maybe now we're going a little bit harder pace to enjoy with me the sound and the performance of the c63 s surely one of the best of the sports cars that can be mixed still with the car you can actually still drive in everyday life always that's a slight a little bit Judas Tadeo Tina Styles I asked start screen then if you were right there actually but of course I mean first to a professional race driver doesn't maybe everyday of course no mention it was 118 and then just Hema the breaks and then 80 kilometers again so fast as it goes from o to 100 kilometers about 4 seconds almost as fast you are on zero again that's of course maybe even the more important party there it is so I hoped you enjoyed our two hot laps here I really did its of course you know at the one hand physically demanding but if you compare it to other some very extreme sports cars this one is still fairly easy to handle now over 80 pixels in the price is the top burn c63s the seat is a mg 6 6 degree s that's the official description what we see here is the front is even stronger and we have the use of carbon fiber everything is even more accentuated than in the AMG line and also the grill is accurate quite a different we don't have these diamond pins here this is more less meshed kind of grill and of course the AMG logo more powerful appearance however I think the AMG line still is my favorite from design in the front oh what's your opinion on that one you prefer more this one or the mg line or maybe the total standard of a c-class what else is different 19-inch rims are from standard equipment here with the c63 s and then optionally for 5000 euros you can get those carbon ceramic brakes and why did they do it for the 5000 use perks on the Porsche they cost even more because they use four of these and ceramic gray see here we only get them in the front but this is actually really sufficient because you don't really need them in the back so in the back we also have the standard brakes turn here yeah a little bit bigger than but here the ceramic grapes are actually enough enough and then it's also not very expensive to go over this option and by the way even if you have dried and LLC and not the black ones they take it actually not that dirty then even if you're on a race track because it's different you know not so much dust is evolving from these ceramic brakes and also contrasting brake calipers here very impressively as well in the side power of the AMG version we see those contrasting mirror caps in the carbon fibre then we don't have the chrome frame here but it all in black everything is kind of dark and evil welcome to the evil side and also strong spoiler at the side part again in carbon fibre but of course the basic form is the same and we got this very beautiful curvy line but I want to hear from you guys really if you really prefer this very aggressive mg version or if you would rather go for the rather elegant version so um it's of course always according to taste brilliant blue is my favorite color for the c-class you can always go over it with the normal versions of course so this is Thomas blue in this case here at the rear of the mg bar and we get a strong carbon fiber wing and I'm not that a big fan of real wings but this one is very well integrated you see how it starts a little bit slim and then gets bigger at the middle part so they really have thought about the design in this case and as I said with the taillights before they really want to differentiate the normal versions now because I've talked to a designer early and so they actually glow go for the sit down versions and the Capri version that they really are distinguished from each other that is actually the strategy that is behind that and finally a strong diffuser here the rear part and aimed respawning exhaust and you see AMG logo is printed on the top of the exhaust air let's take a look beneath the hood as I said the 63s version here 510 horsepower all four seconds from ottoman era kilometers really of course just massive and hand-built and crafted by mg and it's the guy that did this one man one engine concept so here is responsible for this whole engine the c63 version without the SS Vaughn at seventy six horsepower doesn't make such a huge difference it's more about the equipment because this one here is even more some special features like this electronic rear differential lock not the mechanical one the electronic rear differential lock by the way there you can adjust how much is the differential really working kind of from o2 100% the mechanical one always has a fixed ratio at how the differential is actually locked it's usually about some kind of I think one to 31 to 40 something like that I think but with the electronic one more evolved and so you can very well control of course a card that's that for you now what is different with the interior you see it instead of the doors right cloth and then usually you got seeds here those ones are the special AMG sports seats more like a kit alight and well I would not really recommend them the other ones are more comfortable however they look quite fancy usual with the engines you get Alcantara on the inside and the folder the article on the outside what not recognized dynamic art you know the competitor brand that would be the perfect setup but here the full leather option is on this plate which is not good for raising really what I really love is that we here got the microfiber on the steering wheel at the outside parts that is really great for the grip and not only for racing style Ottoman injures driving it in everyday life just feels softer when you have the microfiber at the outside and the design scheme here on the inside is as well carbon fiber you see it here for example at the middle console part and although you don't have the aromatic suspension here there's a special mg sports suspension in rewrite control and there you can also individualize your settings and that doesn't work with air suspension here but with special dampers that can adjust them so how does c63s behave in everyday driving life we go to all the modes as well let's start with normal city driving life force your we hear that difference followed the displacement and v8 the same engine is by the way used in the Mercedes AMG GT we also have the review of that one in our Channel it's also linked in the video description so you can also compare that one and that shows how sporty this car really is the same engine is used for that but of course let's first check out the waiver by the way a verdict about the GPS generally quite satisfied with it always kind of fastest human-powered let's start the c63s again and have been running the engine before so the engine is a little bit warm other water will do that now go into drive mode then I pick the race mode it's also even more than more than sport classes available here then I press the ESC off then I can hold the pedals both pedals and confirm paddle up and so race start is available I can push on the brakes with our left foot hold the acceleration with our right foot you and that's 120 really some incredible stuff and but you don't feel the wheels sliding totally away and the reason for that is this racer because it's not about you've got the most real spin the most power on the ground you get the most power in a controlled way on the ground that is the key of the race start and really works incredible reading and yeah we've told you a lot about the performance all the way on the racetrack but when we in the race plus mode you hear it when the downshifting process is exact affecting this exhaust is just like really a monster in itself and of course it's not that relaxing for everyday riding and also in the race blast mode when you're going over some small speed bumps you now we feel every inch of the road look at the direct contact and also when you steer at a quite stiff sporty steering wheel and every command is directly transported but this kind of stiff ride is of course not very suitable if you're always in the car and you were to also know from the RP ins car is not shifting up and if we go now to the spotless mode here the Sport Plus mode is already a difference and would be comparable kind of easy to write them if I then go into the comfort mode X now only with 50 grams an hour in fourth gear the steering wheel feels a bit softer you know as well that isn't also kind of easy to write but still the suspension is of half stiffer than in a normal model see with Eng models and also the seating as I said earlier you don't have you know so much room for them you know from 2 to 2 lesson really relax your body so everything is stiffer here as well or feel now here and so for your everyday riding I can really recommend to go for the compromise some of the c400 or as we've shown with sit down the version that will also come for the copy the C form a 50 that will be my recommendation if you want very sporty ride but still not searching ball is very very race car everything else is kind of the same of course here the most expensive parts are order for example also the brakes we do feel actually but it's all more optimized on the racetrack so of course this guy will also find inspires just also say okay I really want the maximum that is possible technology wise but of course a lot more look at the compromise and I think the best seller will probably be in future those AMG light models because they kind of make sense our emotional and very powerful at the same time this is by the way the head-up display and it does look a little bit different in the AMG version definitely and for example I've seen in the other one it's always optional but you can for example also get some GPS information in there however now in the comfort mode normal Autobahn riding is always possible of course the new always update v8 as a reserve and this mess of this basement always tastes a certain role if it was would have some fun we put in the ESC again so that's on because of normal Street driving doesn't make sense if it's off but with this rear-wheel drive you can do some great sliding action you've also seeing a lot of footage and so if I feel like I need to overtake someone now and that's kinda answer so yeah you get a lot of serenity with this v8 definitely but they are hardly any chance on the road you can really use the power for sure so if you are kind of okay with a sporty and safe riding and also very to erm let's say this true sports car build because this one is still based on the midsize vehicle then this one is still very well drivable so you don't feel kind of let caged in that of I'm oh I am in a very small angle I'm gonna be little sports car so again I think it's a very clever choice if you want you know not too uncomfortable car but still want kind of sporty car to go for a c-class here in the powerful version so I think overall no matter which words you pick a clever pick them and I mean as you have the could be even looks more dramatic and strange thing is with this car you don't kind of see the this Doretta creepy outline when you're sitting inside the car but somehow you know it and that influences also your way you feel when driving the car on the inside maybe you have experienced that as well with your car and if you do then probably that one here in the comments", "mBfzCVUJvZA": "I was once used for small jobs and I took on all the bigger tougher ones but with mr. cleans new select a size magic eraser he can take on any size job at least we don't go near Rex's mobile home is often what are you scared new mr. clean select a size magic eraser", "0OwVJPhYtvw": "[Music] we play welcome to the freak show i am your host bumpy mcsquiggles and today we're diving in we're checking out werewolf the apocalypse earth blood it is by nakan and cyanide studio due out on february 4th 2021 so basically if you're watching this video the game should be available for you to grab it's on pc i think xbox the the xboxes at this point uh the playstations so yes you should be able to grab it on most current gen things i don't think the switch has a release either way we're going to dive in we're going to begin playing preceding this video i'm going to basically post the opening cinematic the intro so you guys can enjoy that all right folks let's do this thing all right new game let's go for players willing to focus on the story willing okay players look for a balanced experience for players looking for demanding challenge hey i'm all about generally developers put games at a normal difficulty or put normal in the game at the difficulty they intend most people to play it can you do things harder than that yes usually but we're going normal i don't know i have no idea what i'm getting myself into here so we'll we'll find out tarkar's middle vicinity the pack of turkish mill is set on driving the endron corporation out of their territory after several weeks preparation they finally have a plan okay well i mean i'm curious to see how this is all going to play out hopefully you guys are as well this is one of those ones that have been kind of on the periphery and i like heard about and kind of like okay and then i almost missed my chance to get my hands on it and give it a shot so i'm pretty stoked i think it's gonna be pretty good uh we'll see i don't know about this music guys and gals i might uh i might get copyright struck or what have you so i'd rather just uh keep it low and it's still somewhat audible but not not super high i'm sure it'll be fine i'm sure it'll be okay the wild the weaver and the worm three primal forces from which the world gaia springs the wild is creation formless and abundant the weaver shapes making order out of chaos the worm whose purpose was to destroy the old to make room for the new one went mad yeah sounds about right now a force of corruption feeding on greed malice and hate it ravages gaia through its unwitting accomplices mankind the balance between those three forces is long gone now insidiously the worm gains more and more ground every day vitalized by the damage humans have brought [Music] let's get wild ladies and gentlemen it's going to be fun maybe you're terrifyingly scary i don't know the end drawing corporation doesn't seem like it specifically cares about us all that much for the planet so you know scruffy mr clean let's get this thing done they should be ready now call is to attack their bottom line we have a plan to convince them there's no profit to be had here manila if you please i've recently gained access to the system that controls all the on-site oil pumps that's our target we tamper with the pumps and send dummy data to the system to make them think their oil field is run dry will that really be enough according to the internal files i got my hands on they treat unprofitable sites like gangrenous limbs they'll give this one the chop right away well the plan is good it seems too easy seems too easy even if we do manage to push them out they'll only set up somewhere else we need to hurt them bring them down not chase them away we've already talked about this kahal they're too close to the cairn if we stage an attack they'll look for the ones who did it i don't want indran's eyes on our home our best option is to work in the shadows try my master something goes wrong my wife ends up on her own in enemy territory i don't like it i'm going to be fine carl we've been preparing this for weeks we've calculated the risks and if there's any sign of trouble you and i go in and retrieve her but i'd rather we stay covert miller will have the easiest time on her own i'm heading out i want to be done before daybreak take care of adana while i'm away i think she's going a little crazy all cooped up in here she worries about her daughter we are there for gaia um she worries about her daughter don't worry i'll talk to her you just focus on your mission call i've got this i love you see you soon mm-hmm okay i'm moving around alcohol moving around asking what okay we got camera maneuvers makes sense once this is on the table you can interact one of the most destructive companies north america has to offer known for their violence and endless greed if we left them to their own devices they'd ravage this place so there was nothing left but dust oh yeah we've been stuck in this cave for weeks studying endurance movements at least now we finally got a plan cool i hope we're done here soon me too what's up man i don't like thinking that ludmilla is on her own ronco i understand she's my sister remember ah you should have sent me two and she's donna's mother i should be out there with her i gave it a lot of thought her chances of success are better if she's alone it's as simple as that things don't go as planned you can tear through as much endurance scum as you like to get her out sweet but for now we stay put go rest while we wait go stay a while and listen excellent not looking forward to packing all this up tomorrow morning yeah me neither i am quite beat ladies and gentle people i am quite tired but uh nothing nothing brings you back to life a little bit like a a brand new game diving into something you never played before installing all this i'll have to thank her for this later yeah you will what does that mean hey what's up girl got everything squared away not a lot too square away all i'm doing is pressing a button once lumila gets me hooked up still got a ways to go before i can do much more than that if i tried to breach their network they'd be on us in a second she's frustrated she already did her part don't be so hard on yourself you're ten times better at hacking than me or rotco with your eyes closed just give it time besides you installed all of this on your own have faith in your abilities yeah girl i know i know but thanks a little pep talk never hurts but how are you doing talk to your daughter yet nope no not yet i'm just heading her way it's on my to-do list what's up daughter hey how you doing i'm bored out of my mind there's nothing to do here and it's wet and miserable yeah you must be patient don't worry our work here is nearly finished you'll be back at the cairn with your friends before you know it i know but why'd you have to drag me out here in the first place it's not like you've got me doing anything out here your mom wanted you to come along so you can see what our field missions entail they entail a bunch of [ __ ] and take notes we're not accomplishing anything language young ladies yes there you go and preparation is key know how your enemy will respond before you move faux stripped of surprise is fangless why didn't you go with mom anyway she's all alone out there if something happens to her i wish i could have but rodko wants us to keep a low profile and there's no one better at that than your mom that's fair rodko's a dumbass hey that's your uncle you're talking about and the leader of our pack yeah you know it's his job to make those decisions how come we're nothing like i said all that observation we were doing was minimizing the danger your mother will be just fine eddie don't worry yeah eddie yeah edie what up girl all right uh anything else we can do in here other than pick up that weird thing on the side oh oh we got like some sniper rifles and stuff over here okay okay does that mean i'm gonna have to aim oh i can jump can i sprint oh you know i can run look at me i'm running i'm rocking sorry let's go let's get to uh i guess napping wake up i'm here what's up talk to me friend a helicopter just touched down on the site's landing pad apparently it's some endron exec their presence is shaking things up that's not good uh what is this what does it imply how's my wife tell me lude mill is okay she's okay they've still got no idea she's on site but their guard patrols have changed and certain areas are locked down and that includes the one ludmilla's in that sucks so what's the plan now get her out and wait for things to quiet down but to get her off site the locked off areas need to be manually unlocked and luke miller's stuck on the wrong side [ __ ] fortunately she has already secured a terminal she'll guide you to her location over the radio go now bring her back there's no time to waste my sister needs you all right man whatever you say get out of my way hello i'm on my way the lupus press circle to shift kahal into his lupus form the size and speed of lupus allows them to sneak in many places without being noticed but the lupus can't use technology and if seen will cause humans to react okay well we can we're in lupus form i guess definitely quicker i'm locked in the turbine room in the center of the site you'll have to get here without being seen the area you're passing through should be deserted right now though squeeze on through door's locked ava there's gotta be a terminal close by find it oh and uh deactivate any cameras you see while you're at it of course press l1 to toggle the penumbra vision okay the penumbra vision will allow call to appear into the spirit world letting them sense things such as threats spirits and their connections uh l1 oh okay that was weird okay no connection camera well i guess you're turning the camera off oh do i have to turn the door on is that what they're asking sorry sorry i should have known and now we can use the door let's go and slowly wolf my way down here guards look mellow we got a lot of has changed their company tell me where you are uh next to a bunch of guards i mean what do you want from me lady i will observe you i'm looking at the southern part of the outer fence and a [ __ ] ton of guards there's no way i'll be able to make a move without being seen there's two three got it there he won't live long enough to raise the alarm they sold their souls to andron they don't get any mercy yeah mercy no mercy come on get over there be distracted did it all right what do we got takedowns takedown is one way of dealing with an unalerted guard or civilians takedowns will increase goals rage the more rage the more dangerous the krinos will be in combat uh huh any idea what could have caused it i don't care i just want it fixed and fast some big shots just arrived on site folks upstairs want everything to be perfect just got to choke everybody i hope you don't mind oh this dude is watching he's like what's going on over here buddy dude he's got a gun i could have like taken the gun little dragon sleeper action there all right there's at least one more guard i only took out four i mean in like like rapid succession by the way like that was mildly impressive hmm [Music] the crossbow hold l2 to unsheath the crossbow and press r2 to shoot crossbow is another way of getting rid of threats the bolts are limited and must be refilled all right cool got that i'm just walking around like we we awesome how do we how do we sneak i can't figure out how to get low again i mean maybe we just don't get low we don't wobble to the flow i don't i don't know all right well it's as cool as this has all been oh i could have snuck over here and got this guy didn't have to shoot him didn't have to be a murderer i mean i'm okay with it these guys seem to be kind of ungood so all right let's move forward i'm in the refinery perfect i'm not far now nearly at the passageway leading into it okay we're gonna go here [ __ ] something's following me what is it i think it's a black spiral dancer uh-oh but miller just hold on [ __ ] dang rocco i let's get wild oh my god quick attack strong attacks jump attacks combine attack strong attacks jump attacks to perform combos and raise krinos's rage a rage multiplier is applied as long as krinos is not interrupted oh my god holy heck what is even happening oh jeez we're doing some damage oh it's real buddy is real press that to dodge uh avoid incoming attacks while it's really new okay yeah i'm sure it's fine oh oh geez i just picked them up and chucked them this is not working very well for me special move healing hold l2 and x to partially heal the krinos uh healing throughout the fight is important be aware of he you are the healing cost rage exo q shot well it's definitely gonna be bloody and graphic stay low you said okay special move leap hold l2 and press square to leap on enduran's guard the leap is a special move that consumes rage leap on him to kill him promptly all right i feel like i didn't leap combat stances press r2 to switch between heavy and agile stances agiles bring speed and fast range regeneration heavy stance offers resistance and strong attacks each stance has its own set of special moves switch between the two stances for better effectiveness in combat oh that's what i did i wasn't in uh yeah there we go okay this is not working oh okay all right calm down you guys want to mess with me huh there there's a lot going on here oh my goodness just watch out all right we're in speedy mode again this is a crazy game was i expecting combat to be quite like this what did you open for me this door silver damage silver is the krinos's weakness silver damage damages will lower the maximum health of the krinos for the rest of the fight i don't have any rage okay i gotta get there oh i gotta stop hitting the wrong buttons that's the dodge button he did he's darn tootin you can't stop me anything else oh look at these guys nope well i just got silver damaged anything else it's a weird weird concept for a game it's gonna be hard for me to get used to the control scheme to a degree so i guess we're going this way now because the dodge is not where i would expect it to have been it might be what you signed up for buddy honestly there's no way to be sure oh we got some more boys coming oh my goodness just obliterated them all oh we tired all right we good we got our collar pop though we like what's up we going sleeveless tea well a vest jacket i don't know and we got the collar popped and you know sure the torso is warm but what of the arms it's fine okay this is our friend doesn't look all that friendly oh is that our wife yeah why can't she why can't she turn call tell eddie why didn't she no please no the slow look of rage oh oh it's on now all right target locking uh-huh yep really how you like them apples are they tasty are they red delicious enough for you oh oh he got oh he big the frenzy oh what does this mean press up on the d-pad to trigger frenzy friends can be triggered once the fury is at its peak in frenzy the krinos gets advantages of each stance speed and power however in frenzy the krinos can't use the special moves nor healing once the fury is depleted the frenzy will stop oh you done messed up now buddy oh you done messed up why didn't we do this before he murdered our wife yeah we just ripped his jaw off and then punched his head into his neck my goodness that was graphic no food miller it's me cajole listen to me oh damn it oh no you need to fight the rage uh-huh let's repeat stop it no just killed rafiq whoever that is what have i done rafiq there's no time to mourn we need to go what what there could be a bit more emotion in this i'd say the acting's a little stilted it's a little underwhelming like the gravity of the stuff that just happened there should have been a lot more emotion and it just it was almost like i don't know i feel bad i don't know that i could do better but i just feel like they could have done better but there's it's always possible too that maybe there's a reason they don't have more emotion in it right like that was kind of the whole thing with uh disgaea 5 and kilia it was kind of an emotionless flatline type situation so maybe there's something to this we'll see washington state five years later well that's not good so i didn't lose milla i'm assuming she was a werewolf as well why didn't she transform at least attempt to fight she's got got and that was that just reported back to base not that there's anything to report no kidding though i guess we've got a special guest coming tonight yeah an engine rep no less she should be here soon you know they're hiring right think you'd ever make the move to andren hey what the [ __ ] sup that's why they call me scruffy mr clean all clear dusk we're good to go okay five years ago i abandoned the woods of tucker's mill i abandoned my cairn yeah andren killed my wife i gave in to rage the worm touched my soul that's probably not good i had to leave my daughter oh it was the hardest decision i ever made werewolf the apocalypse global warming the energy company today announced that their new biofuel will be hitting the market soon this revolutionary new formula will be unveiled alongside the opening of their new headquarters in this exile was my only choice i'd become a danger to my pack i often wonder what's become of them rocco of ava of haiti this is the closest i've been to tucker's mill in five years maybe i'll stop in and eat them with my worm touched abilities i don't know man pretty cool so far though alcohol we're here you're up all right how much time do we have before they notice the guards on the outside have gotten quiet they report in by radio every hour that's our deadline for getting our hands on the explosives and getting out of here all right talk about customers talk about the plan let's go through the plan again just to make sure everything's clear you've got to swap the delivery label on the creative explosives intended for andrew you do that and they'll load us up with smiles on their faces all you've got to do is open the gate to their delivery bay for me i'll create a diversion while you're exchanging the labels got it we'll have to play it tight though one hiccup and the plan falls through and then you sneak around back by their storage facility security should be pretty thin there especially if you go through the ventilation docks what do your clients intend to do with them anyway the weather stormers they're planning on blowing up a big magadon pharmaceutical plant good [ __ ] ribbons i know megadon's methods they're the scum of the earth guess what these explosives were originally headed to endrin another mega corp of [ __ ] stealing from them is just icing on the cake all right i'm off hey before you go are you sure you're up for this man you seem kind of stressed out back in the truck uh you noticed uh you would not understand you noticed just been a long time since i've been out this way brings back memories forget it we've got a job to do right if you need me i'm just a chirp away good luck brother thank you very much all right guys guys ladies and gentlemen that is going to do it for our very first episode of werewolf the apocalypse earthblood uh some interesting things i can turn into a wolf that's a sleepy wolf apparently but that's pretty darn cool i have to say i like what i see combat again feels weird i'm a little bit i'm a little bit bad at it it's just i need to move the camera more and a few other things and getting dodge off of like r2 that's just my kind of default dodge button right now in my head even though circle should be my my default dodge button it's not anyway either way i'll get the controls down we'll be moving forward and doing some murder death killing and killing death murder and it'll be great you guys want more information about the game where to get the game information on the developer the publisher any of that wonderful fun stuff down below in the description of the video this will be various links and things of that nature he has to click on and do some wonderful fun stuff and yeah subscribe to the channel like the video do the youtube algorithm things you know the score and until the very next episode i have been your host bumpy mcsquiggles thank you so much for stopping by the freak show always remember we play we fight we [Music] conquer [Music] you", "nQ0iZuCSJUM": "which one clean better hey guys welcome back to my channel and if you're new here thanks for stopping by and I would love to have you as a subscriber so I've talked about how important a clean house is for me and part of keeping a clean house is keeping the right products around so one of the products that I always use I love using all over my house would be these mr. Clean Magic Erasers and if you love a clean house you probably understand the beauty of these little sponges they work so well in all different areas of my household these are truly magic magic I don't know what's in them but they're magic I can use them all over my house and I love it so um that long ago was at the Dollar Tree and I stumbled across their magic sponges they called them the scrub buddies tune one quick eraser and I was curious to know if they worked as well as the mr. clean because you know the dollar store they were cheaper they were a dollar for two and I got these from Walmart for a dollar ninety seven for two and then at Target they were $2.99 for two so pretty good savings so I thought I had some time this evening I would test these out which one cleans better and you know obviously if the mr. clean is better I'm willing to pay that extra money but if these work awesome then I'll buy these and I'll save money and it'll be a win/win itself I'm going to put these two to the test I'm going to test a couple area that I always use the magic racers in my house for and a couple other areas that I have found that our really good to use Magic Erasers on so let's get started I should add that I did just get the mr. clean original one because that would be equivalent to the Dollar Tree one mr. clean does make like a more heavy-duty one that's kind of a different shape and they have ridges in it so I just thought for a fair comparison they would be the original so they should be equal here is the mr. Clean Magic Eraser and here is the Dollar Tree sponge as you can see half of it is the Magic Eraser part equivalent and then the other half is just a regular sponge they aren't that different in size the mr. clean sponge is a little thicker but the Dollar Tree sponge is a little wider my first test is on the table that my daughter uses to color on and sometimes because she's - she doesn't always get it on the paper I started off with the Dollar Tree sponge and I had to really press hard to get the cran off but it did come off when I would press hard next I tried the mr. clean sponge and it was definitely a lot easier and I didn't have to press as hard to get the cran up but I did have to go over at multiple times to get all of the lines gone here's the finished product of the Dollar Tree part of the table and I know it's hard to see on camera but there still are some lines there that I'll have to go over but for the most part all of the cran did come up here's the mr. clean part of the table and there are zero lines I did have to go over a couple times but all of the crayon marks did come up next up my husband's dirty tennis shoes well actually they weren't that bad but there's still some dirt on them with the dollar tree sponge it definitely took all of the dirt up but as you can see it was falling apart like crazy on me just like the dollar tree sponge with the mr. clean it took up all of the dirt very easily it did fall apart a little bit but not as bad as the Dollar Tree one I didn't get too close to the camera but the shoes looked equal when it came to cleanliness of the shoes so the sponges did an equal job the dollar funds just came apart more we got my daughter a new potty training seat and when we took the sticker off it left a lot of sticker residue and I read online that a magic eraser is good for getting up that sticker residues both sponges performed equally when I was trying to get the sticker residue off and I didn't think that one worked better than the other initially after bringing the potty out into the light where I could see it even better you can see there on the right side that's what I use the dollar sponge and on the left side it was a mr. clean sponge so the mr. clean sponge did perform a little bit better than the Dollar Tree sponge the next test was to get scuff marks off of our white door we get a lot of scuff marks on our white doors and white baseboards I love them but that's the downfall of white everything this was the easiest test out of all of them because with both sponges I didn't have to work hard to get anything off the marks came off very very easy with both the Dollar Tree sponge and the mr. clean sponge this was a tie they both did an awesome job and I couldn't see any scuff marks left on the door when I was done and the scuff marks came off really really easy without much effort with both sponges last but not least I was bringing these sponges to the tub I've been using these type of magic eraser sponges in the bathroom for many many years both son just performed very well in the tub and worked but the mr. clean sponge did get up all of that hard-to-reach and hard to get soap scum dirt and grime that was in our tub so mr. clean wins the tub war finally finished with testing and when I was testing I will tell you that you probably I won't know this until I edit but you probably didn't pick up on a lot of the stuff that I was trying to clean up on the camera so a lot of these things are just going to have to take my word for it and I will tell you well first I will show you what's left so with this one the Dollar Tree won it got beat up pretty good I used most of that now the mr. clean one held up a little bit better the Dollar Tree won definitely fell apart a lot easier and faster but as you saw with the shoes this one fell apart a lot this one did fall apart a little bit must have been the surface but this one fell like completely apart like this would have all been gone if I when I kept dropping the shoes this one is definitely more durable so mr. clean is more durable than the Dollar Tree I would say that the mr. clean wins this one it did a little bit better on everything I don't think it was like dramatically different I would say here on the tub it did a lot better than this but other than that it was all similar this one also did a little bit better on the crayons than the Dollar Tree won the dollar fee did take up the crayons that I really had to scrub and you kind of still see lines mr. clean all the lines were gone but all the other ones they did about an even job and I'll say that just for the fact that this one's tore up easy and this one still is I could get soap use out of it I would pick the magic mr. Clean Magic Eraser as the winner so I was not impressed with these ultimately unfortunately I was hoping I would but not super impressed with the Dollar Tree Oh erasers but that's okay we're going to love some things from there we're not going to love everything I did to see a tip that you can cut these in half cut these in half so you can get use out of on 1 2 uses out of 1 so just a little something to add in thank you guys for watching this and I'm glad I just got to bring you along because something I've been wanting to find out and I brought you guys along I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you guys next time [Music]", "i3u4nS8gOyg": "let's go back to the beginning of the show give it up for the classic comedian milk garlic climbing up for him and mr.

(cheerful music)", "_vgzYoDmsqU": "congratulations on purchasing an equal one aquarium if you've chosen this chapter you have either an aqua style one two six 380 or aqua style 510 these models although different in size have very similar aqua one filter systems so the setup procedures are exactly the same I'll take you through the complete aquarium setup make sure you place the aquarium on a flat surface strong enough to easily support its weight when filled with water and any decorative rocks if you set the aquarium up on an uneven surface it might crack we recommend an aqua one cabinet designed just for your aqua style but these versatile aquariums will also go perfectly on a sturdy will supported cabinet or bench top now it's time to set up the aquarium once you've decided on a location unwrap the aquarium and place it in your desired position when you remove the aquarium from the packaging inspected and the equipment carefully if you see any signs of damage from transit contact the store you purchased it from remove the light unit from the aquarium this will be the last piece you'll need next remove the filter from the top of the aquarium remove all the components from the filter make sure you have a black sponge a bag of ceramic noodles a carbon cartridge our filter grid a strainer an intake pipe a spray bar an elbow adapter an elbow and a power head wash the ceramic noodles and carbon cartridge to get rid of any excess dust or particles just remember this is the last time that untreated tap water should touch your filter once you have the aquarium running you must always rinse the filter in aquarium water only connect the intake pipe to the intake strainer this will prevent any large object being sucked into the pump especially your fish now connect the intake pipe to the bottom of the powerhead your power head should already be connected base of the filter unit the filter unit should be placed back on top of the tank to the rear now we can fill the filter with the important contents to ensure your aquarium stays healthy and clear place the filter grid in the bottom of the filter unit and then the ceramic noodles on top of the grid these noodles are your biological media which will grow healthy bacteria to break down the waste from your fish next place the black sponge and the carbon cartridge with the wool in the filter the carbon is the chemical filtration which takes many of the pollutants out of the water leaving it crystal clear you've now set up the filtration medium which the water will pass through from the top through each layer back into the tank next connect the spray bar to the end of the elbow and then connect the long section of the elbow to the top of the power head make sure the holes in the spray bar are pointing down to the filter medium the filter completed place the light unit on the front of the aquarium and pass the light cord through the channel in the filter and that's all it takes to have all-in-one equal one aquarium ready to decorate and fill with water take this opportunity to check the position of the aquarium and reassure yourself where you wish to enjoy your Aqua one as the aquarium becomes very heavy when the water and decorations are added start by placing your rinsed gravel at the base of the aquarium unless you're planning to grow live plants it's recommended you keep gravel to a minimum gravel is a better aquarium substrate than pebbles because the large pebble size allows excess waste to fall through the grains and build up on the bottom of the aquarium then it rocks gravel is finer and allows excess food and waste to land on the surface where it can be consumed by scavenging fish keeping your aquarium much healthier now you can gently fill your aquarium with water when filling the aquarium it's important that you don't fill the tank too high with water to ensure your aquarium doesn't overflow once you add the fish and the ornaments next place in any plastic plants and ornamental decorations Aqua one has a massive range of plastic plants and copy corals that add color and beauty aqua one has an extensive range of creative decorations to suit any aquarium style which are a perfect refuge for your fish and create a lot of interest in your aquarium any synthetic ornaments and plants should be rinsed in tap water before putting in the tank also available is a large range of aqua one aquarium backgrounds which can neaten up and enhance the look of your aquarium position your thermometer and heater if required the thermometer should always be placed at the opposite end of the tank to the heater for the most accurate readings next put in your air stones and connect the air line to the air pump if you can try to place your air pump above the water level of the aquarium if you're placing the pump below the water level of the tank make sure to use an aqua wuntch otherwise it is possible for water to siphon back down the tube and may damage your pump which is not covered by the guarantee every electrical cord should have a drip loop to stop water running down the cord from the tank into the equipment or electrical power outlet remember to add aqua one water conditioner to your water to remove chlorine heavy metals and other chemicals which will damage your filter and could harm your fish use the directions on the bottle to work out how much water conditioner to add to your water with water conditioner it's always better to overdose than to under dose next plug in the heater air pump and filter power head and switch them on close the lid and turn on the light before adding the fish double check each item is working properly check the heater light is on if the water is under 25 degrees and the rolls are coming out of the air stone for the filtration observe the water is being passed through the filter smoothly and it's not spraying or leaking out of the tank double-check that the spray bar is pointing down into the filter your aquarium is now ready for a few small fish however it's safer to run your aquarium for at least three days before introducing them to your system on if you've got a saltwater setup it may take a little longer so it's best to ask your local aqua one dealer or grab a copy of the DVD your instructional marine aquarium guide take a few minutes to check out the other important chapters they'll cover maintenance and of your new aquarium enjoy", "A92v1rFd3tA": "what's happening guys well not quite right handed in and in front of you over here is the cannon exist by one o HS now you'd ask me a why my iPhone is in the frame and I'll tell you exactly why because using my iPhone I am actually browsing images on this camera over here and I can only do that for the simple fact that this camera has inbuilt Wi-Fi and an app available on the iPhone to interconnect so we're going to be reviewing the Canon XS v & o HS so let's get on with it let's talk about build quality the camera is exceptionally well built it's a very very small size you can see it can easily fit inside any pocket it is a little thick compared to some of the other models available but it does come in a very small form-factor it's very easy to carry around and does not add a lot of complications in your life if you are an easy shooter if all you want to do is get out there and take some pictures without worrying about the kind of settings the kind of things that you would want to do on a camera if you don't want to worry about those this is the camera to you so let's talk about some of the great things that this camera has first of all are talking about resolution the camera has a 10.1 megapixel sensor with an optical zoom of 12x the sensor is a HS sensor that means it's a high sensitivity sensor and it gives great low-light performance exceptionally well shooting in low-light even if you have shaky hands and it also gives great movie detail shooting in low-light so when we shot some video in low-light we are really impressed with the kind of quality the lens and the sensor give together the lens is a canon lens and it's got an f-stop of three point four six to five point six from four mm to 48 mm on the back of the camera you will see this nice and vivid 3.2 inch touchscreen LCD display which will handle most of your settings all the way from our shooting modes to recording video on the go and setting up all your settings as well on the bottom of the camera you will find a convenient tripod tripod mount and an unusual size and design battery pack which is good enough for about 180 images of when we tested it out we got about 120 images and on video we got about 30 minutes of video and now this camera does take a micro SDHC card which are not high-speed cards well they're not available in India yet but you can get some SanDisk ones which are SanDisk Ultra so you can get about class 10 or class 6 cards which should be decent and good enough for HD video captured on this camera while this camera does capture 1080 video it's not 1080p it's 1080i the camera of over always 163 grams in weight and is lightweight easy to carry and overall a nice camera you do have a built in flash over here so those are the basic aspects of the camera let's get on with the interface and I'll show you a bit of the interface as well navigating on this camera is fairly easy on the top left over here you have your shooting modes so easy to select not a lot of complications over here from the main menu from the front menu you can select auto you can also have programmed auto and you can adjust a couple of settings over here in programmed auto then you have movie Digest portrait mode smooth skin smart shutter you have high-speed burst that does up to 20 pictures in high speed you have handles night scene which will actually isolate and reduce a lot of camera shake if you are shooting an image in low-light conditions then you also have a standard low-light shot you have fisheye FX mini HT effects toy camera effect so tons of effects you also have soft focus on monochrome filters software which filters posture effects color accents you can select a color and only have that color show in the frame you can also swap color so if you have Reds you can replace the Reds with yellows and make a interesting image out of it tons of shooting options tons of customizations that you can do if you are shooting fireworks it does high-speed photography your can also get some long shutter shots you need a tripod for that snow you also have iframe movie capture and you're also a slow motion movie capture in every mode you have separate settings for each mode and for example if you go into programmed auto mode you also get these settings over here which are in the functions menu so if you get into the functions menu you can set up your metering you can set up your colors your white balance settings again you have ISO settings exposure compensation timer mode focus range so every menu itself has tons of easy settings that you can adjust if you like to get into that otherwise you have your full auto mode as easy as taking the camera and pointing and shooting we found that low-light images in this camera are exceptionally crisp even at really high ISO levels the camera shoots in an ISO range all the way from ISO 100 to ISO 3200 with a compensation of over -2 evie in 1 by 3 easy steps so that's pretty much at par with the shutter speeds which range from 1 is to 4 thousand to 15 seconds so you get great crisp images even at high is source we found that images up to 800 and 1600 were fairly crisp although you do see some noise in 1600 ISO although in 3200 ISO you will find that there's a lot of noise in the image especially if you zoom into your subject the zoom on this camera is 12x and considering its size that's equivalent to 28 to 3 36 millimeter in a 35-millimeter camera it also has something called a zoom plus feature that extends it up to 21 X in some cases up to 27 X as well so in terms of shooting mode or you get some great images you have some great features allows you to play around with effects toy camera effects and everything that you would need from a point-and-shoot camera of this value you can take up 220 shots of 240 shots depending on your usage but about 120 shots is average that we got from a full charge of battery on this camera it also has a great application that can connect on iPads and iPhones that allows you to see the camera it's called a canon camera window it allows you to see the images on the camera to see the videos and save them on your library so all you need to do is go into the preview mode and press this little Wi-Fi icon over here and you'll be in the couple of options you can also directly connect to the internet via a computer once you're on Wi-Fi now this is connected to Wi-Fi and it will allow you to connect via an iPhone onto this camera over here and allow you to see the images now this software is a little buggy and it does not work all the time especially on your infrastructure mode but it does have something called ad-hoc mode and which allows you to directly connect to the camera all the images on the camera by pressing on that button you can also see video directly from here now the great feature about this is that you can send this image directly to Facebook you can also email this directly from this application and if you configure your YouTube from here you can also upload directly to YouTube your videos from here so you'll be able to see all those options and you can configure them according to the way that you want so great little feature in a great little camera pocketable and easy to use they only have an application on iOS right now so iPad iPhone iPod but we would love to see an Android application or that will allow you to connect the cameras especially because it's a Wi-Fi enabled camera so you should be able to connect any any device whatsoever you can simply tap on the screen and scroll through your images you can also slide through your images as you would on an iPhone so that also works if when it captures a burst shot when it captures burst photography it'd be AIT's a collage of all the images so that you don't have to search for individual images you can just tap on this button and you can play back the group so if you have for example four images it will play all four of those images as a group instead of individual images on the camera the camera also has great macro performance and takes an image up to one centimeter from the subject so great focus when it comes to macro photography you will be able to really take close-ups if you have good light in terms of color reproduction we were really impressed with the kind of color reproduction the Canon X's can do it has excellent detail on each end of the spectrum of colors and it will be demonstrated by this image you can see that all the way you can see how beautiful the Reds look the whites everything looks just absolutely brilliant it does a great job of reproducing color and we are really impressed with the kind of results that it has excess y10 shoots video at 9:20 by 1080 pixels at 24 frames per second it also does a 1280 by 70 at 30 frames per second and below that you also have 640 480 by 30 frames per second 640 480 at 120 frames per second and 240 frames per second for a slow motion you can also do a 320 and 640 480 pixel videos if you want to do that if you want to go further down and speed up the Canon X is Phi 1 0 H s is a great little camera it has great high sensitivity sensor which impressive low-light performance especially for a video a real impressed with the low-light video performance this is essentially a camera that you just throw in your pocket and carry around and for that it does excellent excellent work and if you were to take more pictures you would possibly carry an SLR or something that would give you that option with this great package a great small size and wonderful features including the Wi-Fi connect with the iOS devices

that to go to the full review of this camera riga NATO because Michael [Music]", "ACt-y8TEeu4": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are gonna do an in-depth review of my Range Rover I'm just kidding we are gonna do an in-depth review of what looks to be a key fob battery but it's actually a vaporizer which is switchblade action known as our minimax Pro now I'm doing actually a second take of this video well our first video got removed for reasons that I won't get into but I also have some really useful updates for you guys on this model which is our new updated batch so let's start from the beginning since some of you might not have been privileged to see the first video so this is a vaporizer battery that is disguised to look like a switchblade action key fob as you can see you can put on your keyring as seen with the little premium metal trim key holder I have a standard sized keyring on it and I have it attached to my keys it's a pretty good size as you can see how it compares up with a standard key fob on the market or actually about the same size with this unit you have a standard 510 thread coupler to fit a grand assortment of cartridges so for example here just to show you guys an example is one of the widest cartridges on the market it is the V 9 Liberty tank which actually has the upgraded rubber trim on it so it is very very wide as you can see it fits and closes in there properly without a problem so let's get into some of the functionality we've upgraded this battery our first rendition was 500 milliamp hour capacity which I would say is about twice the capacity of your standard stake stylist batteries with the little stylus tips on them this new rendition battery on all orders in for June is gonna have a 650 milliamp hour battery so we upped the milliamp hours a hundred and fifty mili amp hours so it's gonna give you a little bit more life in between charges basically almost making it three times the capacity of a standard stylistic battery we also from a lot of our YouTube subscribers said they didn't like the button feel or if you push down really hard sometimes the button would fall into the unit or get stuck so we improved the button functionality and actually changed the whole button to where you can push on it as hard as you want and it is not gonna fall through and you're gonna get a good clean texture and a nice clean push and it's gonna have a decisive click and we have our YouTube users to viewers to thank for for giving us that upgrade and that helpful hand charging the device is really simple each unit comes with a micro USB cable that you will simply plug right into the inlet there now when you plug it in you're gonna have your lights around the button are gonna blink and then your unit is charging then once those lights go out which usually takes about people ask us this all the time it's more frequently asked questions how long does it take to charge usually from dead to full depending on what wall adapter you use you locate between two and three hours of a total charge time and with a six hundred and fifty milliamp hour battery even if you are a heavy user and are constantly using this thing your battery should last you more than a day of usage even if you're a very heavy user so at least you'll know you'll get a full day with this battery so let's talk about the action a little bit similar to a switchblade knife all you do is you would screw the cartridge into the adapter and then you would push the stainless-steel button here on the side to open and then you would also have to push it to unlock and be able to close the unit right there and it flips open very easily you don't have to do anything and the years ray of eight this unit will fit 510 thread cartridges because of the length of the body of this it is best for half mil cartridges or the 500 milligram however you want to call it all the way up to point six you can however put a 1 mil cartridge which would be longer for example this right here is a 1 mil cartridge of the same type as you can see it has a extra I want to stay probably about a third of an inch in height it'll close and be fine but the mouthpiece of your cartridge is going to slightly protrude out there so this is really built for half mil cartridges and if you do have a problem with your 1 mil cartridge sticking out a hair it would probably look about like that right there so that's how it look still gonna work just fine they've just fine but do keep that in mind because we actually received a lot of emails about that to make sure that it was good for half milk cartridges and how a 1 mil cartridge would look on it so how do you turn your unit on when you first get it you gonna charge it make sure that's fully charged we generally ship out our units with a 33% charge you're going to simply click the button five times repeatedly you guys see the unit light up and actually automatically you I don't know if you're able to hear that little fizzle but basically the unit automatically goes into a short preheat now when it goes into the short preheat if you don't want to preheat right when it turns on you can push the button one time and it will exit that preheat mode the preheat mode what it does it sends a little bit of current through the cartridge in case if your oils coagulate or your cool you know basically hardened up a little bit sends a little current through the coil to make sure that it heats up and before you start vaping or hitting that your oil has melted down and your cartridge is primed but if you have very viscous oils that you know flow very easily as you can see this is this is not really dropping much here as I turned it upside down so with oil that is this thick or a thicker we would definitely want to allow that preheat function to take its course before we start vaping on it so then once you have your unit on you have three temperature settings on there basically red is the most intense and each temperature setting can be seen with what color you see around the ring when you push the button here you see red now to cycle through your temperatures when the in turn is on you're going to click it three times and as you see it blinked up and now it is blue which is the lowest of your intensity levels now let's click it three times again and then you see you have kind of a white amber color which is your medium intensity level setting now some cartridges require more power some cartridges require less power so it's really kind of just there is no perfect incentive intensity setting it comes down to preference what cartridge you're using combined with which oil I know that we received a lot of questions about that so really it's just plug and play and see what you prefer now let's see how our minimax Pro key fob switchblade action battery compares to the competition there is another switchblade action battery that is on the market and let's see I think I have one right here on my car key as you can see immediately this looks more like one of those little buoys that you would put on your key when you go out boating so you don't lose your room your keys like or if it falls in the water will float and you'll see it it is significantly larger than our minimax looks pretty significantly heavier as well let's compare to an actual key fob so some of these we have seen they do have some of them have a variable temperature some of them only have one temperature some of them have preheat how do you charge a unit like this it actually has a little extension cord that you plug in to your computer your USB or into a wall adapter and I guess it'll just hang there with your keys until it's done charging it's like if you had a Tesla electric car have to hook an extension cord up to it and then again it has the same switchblade action to open it it got a little stuck there because these things they're not that wide so if you put a wider cartridge like our cloud tank on there it sometimes gets a little jabbed up there it goes okay so that's basically comparing the two so you guys know when you see several other of these on the

from Essex UK UK thanks for joining us today we're will be looking at how to clean your vape pen just a quick short video just to show you how to clean various pens we'll be looking at a standard Eagle where you just replace the head normally and also a slightly more advanced vape pen with replaceable coils in in the in the middle just to show a few extra tips basically on how to prolong the life of your vape and the main reason for keeping them nice and clean and tidy and so oh yeah so you will need a few things to start with first being cotton buds or q-tips whatever you want to call them next paper towels pretty essential really and also what I would recommend is a nice bottle of of just warm water well that'll do you nicely I've come across this that came in and another ecig kit which works perfectly it's got a nice fine tip so you can spray with it and it's very squeezy so if you've got one of these that come in very handy if not just use one water straight out really tough so let's crack on okay so let's start with the the Eagle tea setup here so this is standard pen with the replaceable end with your wicks in so normally what you'd do is you'd smoke this with a any liquid in the recommend that you don't really change your liquids using the same cartridge I don't have that much of an issue with it as long as it's quite empty but there is another way so they start by taking a report intake can remove the battery for now put the battery to one side so what we can do on the the atomizer side of things you can take your you tip off so you would normally fill it straight up through there and I've got a bowl here I'll just use this too to keep the little bits and bobs in so that's as far as this one breaks down it doesn't break down any further than that so you would normally just replace this or have a few spares so what I find is if you take your warm water in a squeegee bottle like so and just squirt it down inside and put your finger on the end and give it a bit of a shake then just discard the rest in here and do that a few times try not to overfill I can get the stuff down the middle in fact what I'll do I'll put the end on it's probably a better way to do it and give it a good shake again you can see the wicks are starting to come nice and clear all of a sudden it really works well it's quite an effective way you know maybe you've come to the end of an e liquid and you have another one and you just want to quickly give it a nice clean it's perfect where to do it so you can see all the the residue coming out here I think you can't anyway there you go so that's pretty much it so what I would do now is take a paper towel and just give it a nice wipe down and then ideally what you want to do is kind of try and shake out as much of that water as possible because obviously the more water you've got in there when you fill it with a liquid it will dilute so you can check out as much as possible it's quite a bit coming out there when I'm shaken into the ball but it's now running clear you can see that the the wicks inside are fairly clear they're not yellowy color off the the yellow liquid that I had in there there's still a bit of water in there I wouldn't worry about that too much you might even be able to get a cotton bud in to some elements of that too to dry it out a little bit I'll just leave it with the top off and leave it for an hour or so and that'll dry out nicely before filling it back up with a liquid similarly with the the top the drip tip should give that a nice wipe down and around the o-ring seal make sure that's sealed nicely and then you can use a cotton bud if it fits and just clean out the inside of the drip tip as well just to get rid of all all the flavor and all the residue that can build up because obviously over time the more that you use these things the more that the liquid kind of breaks down and can stick to your apparatus so that's it let's pretend that's dry inside so that's now ready to go another tip would be to make sure that the bottom doesn't have sometimes you can get a bit of e-liquid seeping into this area so again it's quite simple just give it a wipe round the dry or very slightly wet damp cotton bud get into all the nooks and crannies and give it a nice wipe here because at the end of the day this is where the electrical connection heats up the wicks inside off the battery so you need to make sure that's always nice and clean and similarly on the battery end of the connector you sometimes see a little bit of residue down in here see if I got a bit closer for you so again just clean that out with a cotton bud you should do this maybe every few days or at least once a week just to prolong the life and it genuinely will prolong the life of year your lluvia pad okay so screw it back together now you've got a nice clean atomizer ready for the same a liquid more e-liquid whatever you want but that will that be good to go so I would recommend that you dry it out because obviously the water will swipe you don't leave you a liquid but all in all that's you know it's good to go so let's have a look at a slightly different this one is an Apollo brand it screws off the same has a very similar battery again probably make sense just to give you a battery connector a quick clean but actually did have quite a bit of any liquid in there so that's nice and clean now inside there's that to one side and then we have this which is their atomizer which has a coil inside so this one does break down fairly well so first of all we will take the coil section off the bottom and I place that to one side for now now see if there's any extra a liquid few drops not much in there so nice smell this one this is watermelon so again take you your bottle with your warm water in and squirt it down the side like you would with a liquid then again finger over the end give it a shake pour away the residue and I would do this a number of times just to to get as much of that a liquid out as you can again don't fill it to the top leave some room so when you shake it has a room to maneuver around the getting the nooks and crannies there we go so that's pretty much running clean again so two squirts two shakes and it seems all good again and I can see through the the clear window on the side that that is really well it doesn't smell at all now again take a cotton bud and just clean out all or as much as you can of the actual drip tip and the same inside as well around here and then in this case I can't get my cotton got very far down inside so what I can do is I can just take of a bit of kitchen roll of a paper towel roll it out at the end that fits nicely down inside now turn that round inside and I'll get the rest of the liquid that the the cotton bud couldn't reach go that's gone all the way through so that is now perfectly clean as good as new so the coil and this is a bit more messy like I said this has a replaceable coils so this coil screws out like so out of the base place the coil on the paper towel for now and I'll just take the the end I'll just squirt some water over it there's no extra parts in there just to remove all the liquid there I'll take another paper towel and just give this a clean get all the extra water off the main thing to remember here is everything's cleanable with water you've just got to try and get all the water off again once you've finished the cleaning process so that's all good I think what I'll do is I'll take a cotton bud and just wait round inside with a dry cotton board just to get that residual water out here we go it's there that's a clean base and a clean top now the coil the coil itself as you can see if I get a bit closer there there's not a great deal you can do with this you don't really want to get water onto the wicks as such I'm going to try and avoid that so what you can do is you can just wipe it around on the end to get as much of that yield liquid off as possible and any residual stuff on the end get that off and the other end and if you've been really picky what you can do is you can roll some more kitchen roll up and you can go all the way through the section and down the down the center but I don't see too much use for that and at the end of the day these are replaceable coils but what it means is when you when you have a VM with repairs or Kyle's it does make it a little easier to to take because you can take it apart and makes a lot easier to clean so there we go so let's put this back together so the coil goes in this section and the whole thing goes together like so and pop the battery back on so there you have it we have two perfectly clean as good as new there and ready to go so I hope that's helped yeah you clean everything pretty much the same as what I've just done with these two examples or via pens working pretty much the same manner and yes the same goes even with so bomb setups with with saban tanks you break them down as much as possible clean as much as you can with warm water and for the same reasons it's just to prolong the life if you vaporizer you know so you don't have to to to spend as much on on replaceable x' as as you might do", "VN3VclSDdbw": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan HOF the chief operating officer of honey stick and today I'm bringing you what I think is our sexiest styled vape battery to date which is the new honey stick be master wallet vape pen kit we're bringing you this battery and I have been such a big fan of multicolor ever since high school that you guys might have seen you know forward launch some cobras where they did what they called the chameleon paint job and honestly you know to wear kind of within different lights it changes some colors and has this cool multicolor affect a lot of vape companies they've done multicolor but not III haven't seen one really truly live up to you know its previous glory of really accentuating that chameleon color that looks super car quality and multi-coated so these vaping batteries they they still sell so I brought a couple examples and these are hundred-dollar kits but you know one problem is the fingerprint sometimes the gloss finish they get finger pretty easy so we want to do is we want to launch a really special vape battery that solves that problem that you guys can use with your 510 threaded prefilled cartridges or 510 thread vape tanks so here check ours out it doesn't think they're pretty easy we made sure that with the texture and the multi coat of the paint and I want to make sure there's not much glare so I can show you guys the details on this battery you got a nice honey stick logo you got a stainless steel bottom this is a very high quality battery the finish is multi coated it just feels like an amazing piece when it's in your hand now let's jump into some of the technicals on this battery so each one of these batteries is going to come with a high gloss black bee master kit it is a wallet kit it's very small it's a high gloss very smooth finish this is probably the size of most wallets actual wallets it's very very thin it has a little locking buckle clip here that you just push down on the bottom half of it and it will pop open and then your ear kick comes out which is your honey stick bee master multicolor battery and your USB charger so when you get your kid out I want you guys to take note of all the quality that really went into this kit we we we went the extra mile to make sure that when you push on this button it has the perfect resistance and feel so that it feels like you're pushing a quality button some buttons when you push on them on the vape game when you push down you don't know if you got a click or it's too hard to push on so even though this is a 5-10 thread battery that is relatively simple concept we wanted to make sure that it had the quality feel we even made if you can see the spring pin in there to be very very high cause your tank in you're gonna have that extra resistance but what that's going to do is it's gonna make sure that it works with more of the tanks that have the deeper inner connectors or that that you know that have a 510 thread that comes down more that needs a more solid connection to fire so this little battery is going to fire more of the 510 tanks where other where other standard batteries fall short now what are the size specs or we have our goldline battery out and this is actually a little bit shorter we wanted to make it a little bit smaller more you know better for you guys to carry and have on the go so this battery is only 3 inches by itself so it's really small so a lot of you guys might think hey you know does it have a it doesn't have the capacity but we made sure that we still put good capacity into those battery it has a 350 mah powerplants so it's basically gonna give you about the same capacity as our best-selling beekeeper model but it's a 5/10 now charging the unit once you get it unboxed once you guys to get on the charger right away most of our units only come with a twenty to thirty percent charge due to shipping regulations so you'll take your charger out you'll see it has a 5-10 port on the inside of the charger just get take it you're gonna push lightly screw the unit clockwise don't over tighten it just get it to be a good hand tight there it is and then you're gonna take the USB N and plug it into a wall adapter there's a non Apple so you plug it in the charging time on this battery is about an hour and a half to two hours depending on what power wall adapter you're using so you plug it in and get it charged up for the one to two hours you're gonna notice when it's fully charged based on the bling pattern it will either disappear or change color for you and then you're ready to vape so you're going to get your favorite cartridge now the cartridge that I showed you guys earlier it's actually a half mil version of our cloud tank we don't have these up on our website but we're currently working on them this is a prototype you can see it has a nice little matte finish you just gonna take your vape battery and you're gonna screw it on in to the battery you guys spin the battery clockwise and then like any other vape battery it's a standard 5 click on 5 clicks off to turn your power on you guys see it's gonna flare up also in a multicolored LED this battery is three temperature settings so you have three intensity levels to hone in on your vape the top level which is indicated with a red light is gonna be a max out at 4.0 volts your lowest temperature which is indicated with a green light is 3.6 and then you're gonna have a middle temperature which is blue that is going to be right come right in at 3.8 volts so when we turn on it is automatically set to the highest setting it popped on is red you are going to if you want to change your temperature when it's on you click it three times so you click it three times rapidly you see it just shot over to green green is the lowest temperature set then if you want to change it again to go to blue which is the middle setting three times you see it turns blue very clearly illuminated and then that would be a three point eight now a lot of 510 thread cartridges as you know the oils are thicker and sometimes they get kind of coagulated and solidify towards the bottom of a cartridge so a lot of batteries of more modern batteries like our phantom and our minimax pros they'll have a preheat function so the preheat function means that when you activate that function it gives you about ten seconds worth the current through your cartridge at a very low voltage usually we like to set our pre heats at around 2.5 volts to two point eight volts within our batteries and it will send that current through there through for about 10 seconds not to vaporize but just to get get get heated up break up the coagulation so you don't taste coil or you don't don't pull a dry hit out of there and you know if you dry fire the tanks if it's really coagulated you can shorten the life of your tank so the preheat functions come a lot handy now how do you access the preheat in our battery well when the unit is on and then you push it once you see that some all you do is you push the button twice rapidly and then you see it will show you a solid light that comes on right there and that will last for 10 seconds if you want to exit at any time you're like oh I can see that my oil my oil broke up or okay maybe it's maybe it's cooking now at any given point you can push the button one time during preheat and exit out of the preheat function mode so that basically summarizes the the technical specs this battery and really how you would use it and this battery like we said because the connectors that we put in there and the voltage range we really built this stick battery to work with most 510 thread Carter's you're not going to have any non-compact compatibility issues when you buy those prefilled cartridges or when you're buying the tanks off of our honey stick website to fill so let's just do a real nice close up of this kit just so we can really show you the details in this hand-painted super car colored battery so let's just jump right in and do close up like I said before I think this is the sexiest battery that we have produced to date in terms of color and appeal and it really should catch the market by storm this is really done right I mean when I posted this picture on Instagram instantly my friends and family were we're texting me that they wanted one for their collection so I have a few this is really gonna gonna do very very well and really appeal to set apart our honey stick from standard stick batteries that are offered and just playing colors really is a beautiful piece let's get a look at that spring pin connection so you could see the colors kind of changing as the light hits them differently it is just chameleon done right alright guys so if you like this be master battery and want to pick it up it is available on our website make sure to use our special promo code honey for 4/20 so you get 20% off

inside we're gonna put this inside over here pour your alcohol inside the cup and then we're gonna do is you won't pour salt right into it as well okay so I poured in the alcohol and now we're gonna pour in this salt and I like to do it almost like an equal amount this sauce times that used up a bit but yeah let's go around like maybe like a 60/40 40 on the sauce 60 on the alcohol and all you're gonna do now is you're just basically gonna swish it around to make sure it gets in there right right up in there and this is the slow method but I believe it's obviously clean this method there is but you want to let it sit overnight once the lettuce sit overnight take a paper towel you know dry out the spots they need to dry up and that's about it and they'll become ill come out like new so guys spend 15 minutes since I let it soak up and now I actually tile dry a little bit dab it up and you notice it is cleaner than it was before and no it still pretty yellow but that's after only 15 minutes best thing to do is I should leave it overnight but if you don't have some time you know in your hands you can do it like it within 15 minutes and get a good you know clean enough coil for your wax product now this is my favorite method because it is instant what you're gonna use this formula for 20 which we actually do have here at the shop amazing product you definitely know about it you knows little baggy pivot towel and you two dirty old coils which we're gonna clean up so take a good look at them because in a few minutes they all look clean so these two cords they do come out of the Reg edition from this thing this thing rips things is amazing I love that device there's the lava quartz coil and there's a ceramic rod coil both great flavor beautiful hit but it's also slightly expensive so that's why are we gonna do this instead of buying more coils you can you know make it last a bit longer by cleaning them but you will eventually have to buy new coils so you want wrap both heads right in there and then uncap your phone for 20 beats brand new and take off the little seal give it a good shake and then square it right in there if you notice this actually has some type of crystals inside the water itself that's one's gonna help it to clean so zip it up and I just do is I like to give it like a good fold hold like that and shake guys remember to check wait shake weight let's call the vape weight this will get messy hence the paper towel alright guys so we give it a good shake if you notice on the bottle it does says only one minute but of course I'm not gonna believe them because you know stay woke so I did two minutes soak with a little bit of scrubbing and it's gonna come out great so all I need right now is some water thank you my kind of assistant so we're gonna do is go and take this I'm gonna take them out remember you guys this is a bit dirty let me look inside there you know notice all the blue crystal and the liquid still in there so that's why you need the water just shake it clean now I'm an advocate I always like to let things sit for overnight just because I want the extra cleaning this especially on a ceramic oil because it is porous the quartz I'm not wearing much about that but from that we solved from before you go retail right there you want to zoom and you're gonna notice the whiteness and the bras are actually getting whiter and cleaner it is still pretty some salt in there still now I'm doing the next core of the lava quartz a lot of course is actually quite amazing because is the instant ramp up good flavor but the ceramic I feel like it is a bit more efficient as in ill not use up all your actual product give it like a little mini mini review on the coils while I'm cleaning them so dry them up real quick and he knows this was kind of hard to see because it is lava it's like painted red in there but that one is much cleaner than it was before and all you got you can see some shininess in there but this is how you rejuvenate your coils so guys today I show you a couple of different methods on how I clean your old dirty coils I gave you the tools it's up to you to build a house with it now like this was a quick you know video but like I said earlier I do like to let these soak and of course you always could take the extra step take get a q-tip get some rags getting those little nooks and crannies get like every single thing clean and I'll me personally I like to get my card detail so I might as well get my vape detail hopefully you enjoyed the video today it was fun it's you know very hands-on like felt like you know Bill Nye the Science Guy but we answer all your questions and we didn't drop it down instruction comment section below and remember we do have all these coils in our store and our website which is discount vape n calm [Music] [Applause] you", "__dXT8DDQHw": "did you know that you can use your Olympus camera and any other camera as a webcam it will be a great camera for Skype calls zoo meetings and of course streaming if you want to know how that's done I will give you instructions coming up hi there a petit fours got a Nolan Post visionary and a professional photographer from Helsinki Finland but let's get right into the business well I hope you all are safe because we living in a very strange time now and because of that Skype calls with video zoo meetings and streaming has been very popular and there is a big demand for that right now and you might not have a webcam but with your Olympus camera it's possible unfortunately you need two things besides of course the camera you need a video capture device and then you need a HDMI cable and in this video i will show you one solution and that's called el gato cam link and this is not a sponsored video i bought this el gato cam link about a year ago and still been using it and then i borrowed another one from mata cilantro a good friend and a youtuber because he had the 4k version my version is full HD and since i said that you need this the small problem right now when i was working with this video and recording it and publishing it is that all these video capture devices are really hard to get hold off because the demand is so huge but if you need it and want to make a order for that it's a good time to do now because it will take it to 3 2 to 3 weeks and then after that you're all set to go and there will be a link to the elgato cam link 4k in the description of this video and both of these cam links the older one that i have and then the 4k version worked the same way you plug it in to your hdmi port in your camera and the other end goes to the cam link and then the cam link is attached to your computer with the USB so it works with most computers and what's great about it it works out of the box you don't need to really have any special software for this to work you just plug it in open Skype and set your Skype to use camera link as a webcam or can link 4k as a webcam easy as that and you can even use your camera's microphone you don't need to have a separate microphone of course the mic on your camera is not the best since you have a very good image quality then I would recommend you to have a separate microphone that you can attach on top of your camera or use some kind of wireless mics if you have like I do this rode a wire let's go what I'm using right now worked perfectly fine and once you set everything up you need to set your camera so that the HDMI will give you a clean output and in Olympus cameras you choose the record mode and I assume that every other camera has the same thing if your camera does not have record mode it only can produce image out but with all the info that's on the screen then toggling the info button on Olympus cameras you can reduce the info on the screen as much as possible so that there what might be only be a blinking memory card in the top which is of course might be a bit distracting but it's better than nothing if you don't have any other webcams you already have your Olympus camera with the video capture device and there's a pro tip if you're streaming or any other software has the ability to crop the image a bit or or make it a bit bigger you can make the image a bit bigger so that the info in the in the edges will be minimized or they will be out of the you know the other the screen that goes out through your software that could work and but also if you're using a Skype this for Skype call it doesn't matter if you have something on the screen as long as it's not all the info that it is that might be able to be a bit distracting other settings depends on what kind of capture card or capture device you have with the Elgato gamling the original one which I have I need to set the camera to shoot Full HD he doesn't work if I have 4k on but with the with the newer model with which can handle 4k you can have 4k on your camera but for Skype calls for K is an overkill because the bandwidth it will be a problem with the video so I recommend using full HD and when you use your camera as a webcam you don't need to have a memory card in it at all and what's great about it's also possible to record the video straight to your computer and if you're doing videos let's say for YouTube that could be a very good thing because that will shorten your workflow will make your workflow easier since you already have the files in a computer and you don't have to record it to the memory card and then transfer your images it takes a bit more time so that's also could be a good use for your cam link with a cam link you can only stream with one camera if you need a multi-camera stream for some reason they need to have several Elgato cam links like i do here or then you could get a for example at black magic as it's at a mini streaming device or a switch board where you can plug in for hdmi cameras so if you need multi-camera setup then you need several el gato cam links or a real big switchboard which can have several cameras plugged in but that's maybe a bit overkill for skype calls to have several cameras but it can be done if you want to and what's also great about that the cam link works with any streaming software and as I said with skype and zoom I personally use a cam for my streaming which I have found to be the best one of course there is a free software called I think it OBS studio which is very good but for me as I'm not a nerd and I don't know that much about computers it's too too big of a hassle for me so II cam was a lot easier for me I hope this video was helpful and stay safe and thanks for watching and bye for now", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges

getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for

gonna need to see this one because i did my couch cushions it's disgusting i got my couch used from somebody who got it used from somebody that used from somebody who got it used from goodwill so i've no i have no idea how many owners this couch has had um looks like that i went ahead and put them all in and it instantly it started to kind of smell in the bathroom which i was like kind of psyched out about turn the fan on that's aft that's almost immediately after that's an hour yeah it was starting to get real dark that's two hours in ew really ew okay but forbidden chocolate milk uh yeah that was the bottom that was i don't know what was in there was a bunch of hair and there's so much dirt and then watch this that was all at the bottom when i drained it there was hair and then hold on wait for it look at the drink part two of stripping my couch here's the products i used i don't have exact amounts i really just tossed them in i just recently got this couch me and the previous owner both washed this at least once a month so it's not like this thing has never seen the washing machine and also psa to couch chambers i'm now charging to talk smack about this couch so my venmo's in the bio here it is just after i put it in there's really wasn't any color here it definitely looked like it might have been the dye from the couch look a little darker because of the shadows and here's the part you guys been waiting for it's the straw it's in the trash i promise here's it when i pulled it out there really wasn't anything at the bottom no dirt here or nothing and here's the couch what you do afterwards is you put it in the washer dryer do it as normal and here's cat content isn't she the cutest is selena she's named after catwoman and she's precious bye okay so this is part one of me cleaning out this random little pool we found in my sister-in-law's garden i started by gurneying the sides but as you can see that wasn't really working properly i then found this little scrubbing brush under some leaves so i decided to use that on the sides it kind of scraped off the algae a bit better scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub scrub uh rest in peace to my nails i didn't really like this very much this is my little doggy checking out the pool like for part two okay so part two is cleaning off this waterfall feature part i didn't get a proper before video but i've already cleaned off the main section i felt kind of bad ripping out the devil's ivy but you got to do what you're going to do so i just started by blowing the leaves off of the rocks and then went over and pressure washed the rocks to make them look nice and new i found a random peg sorry this one's a bit boring but like for part three [Music] if your oven looks anything like mine it is time to clean it open the bun hole i'm coming in first we take everything out nasty so there is a hole under here where you could stick something and clean between your glass but that's not satisfying for me i don't have the fancy clips this is just vinegar and water so there's actually three glasses this one this one and this guy there are two separate windows to muscle we gotta unscrew this to get in between them that's what he said you know what never mind you don't need to do that yeah let's not do that because there's no dirt in between them you know i just wanted to show you guys how it looked like don't do it round two of deep cleaning my oven the homies soda hollywood the bunghole blaster i'd like to introduce you to high moond raymond in english kaimun is a retired hitman from the azorn islands who likes to cook body parts he's a dirty bastard i don't feel comfortable putting water or anything on that so i'm just gonna wipe it down with a dry cloth holy check this out damn beautiful i'm gonna clean this first because it's annoying the crap out of me baking soda a little bit of dawn a little bit of vinegar scrub all over spray a little more vinegar and let it sit do yourself a favor and buy a real oven scraper because this ain't it we're finally done [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] beautiful since i'm already here you about to catch these hands too i'm cleaning your dishwasher was it again achieve it i got a t15 do you want some soft music while you're doing that no thank you get your ass over here turn that at 360. not the knob you turn it that way yeah there you go ready holy actually better than your dryer no baking soda throw a little bit of vinegar in that you might need a new one check it out she's clan oh yeah i'm back at it again with high moon this is a before picture of the oven glass looks beautiful and this is the after he looks so fabulous don't forget to clean under here like i did that's baking soda just a tip it's easier to clean the inside of your oven when you take this boat off it could come off some ovens have little flaps up here that you move but of course mine is difficult you have to unscrew this close it like this and lift it up but anyways i want to clean the sides because a lot of falls in there oh my god oh lord that's not good looks like frosty ass blasted it or something oh sweet jesus how am i gonna fit my fat ass in there [Music] wow what the hell oh my god i can't reach and we are done so frank just gave this to me of course it immediately broke once it got into my hands i don't know let's go test that out see what we got oh man to show you how bad this is oh baby i guess you just stick it in that's what he said see all that dust where'd it go oh no mommy i'm just gonna stick to my old fancy ways get a pillow case spray drape hold it closed so the won't come out and just wipe it off if i do this with one hand a little bit here is my mouth there you go like that then you're done boom you look like a vagina [Music] do [Music] come back to recovering from hoarding by cleaning hey we're doing the shower i quickly realized that this spray was not going to cut it and most of the color you're seeing is water stains i went for scrubbing bubbles but then i ran out of scrubbing bubbles so we went for comet and a scrub daddy now this is the first time i ever used the scrub daddy and let me tell you i was impressed like look at the grime on this after that little bit of scrubbing incredible it's important to remember that no matter how long it's been you still deserve a clean space a functional space so don't beat yourself up for letting something go a little longer than you would have liked you're not disgusting you're not gross or bad you're just struggling like me we deserve patience and forgiveness just as much as anyone else don't let anyone tell you otherwise this project took me at least a couple of hours i wasn't even able to fit it into one video so come back for part two thanks for coming back for part two i scrubbed this tub for so long i took a lot of little breaks and even went to a virtual group therapy session in the middle thank god as for phone alarms i almost missed it this particular group is a cpt group that stands for cognitive processing therapy and was designed specifically for people who have ptsd i'm excited to do this program and maybe i'll share some with y'all today was just the first session [Music] rinse it all away decided to throw in a cursory toilet scrub too since i was already there as always if you struggle to or you want to watch me grow like and follow or comment some encouragement we are back for another laundry stripping video and this time i am doing my boyfriend's hockey gear for those of you that don't know hockey gear smells absolutely disgusting especially the gloves they are just there there's no words to describe how gross the gloves are um so i was hoping this process might make it smell a little bit better so it went in there these have all been previously washed in the washing machine so it's they i mean the smell just will not go away i just i can't i can't express how gross hockey gear smells i left it in there for about four hours total i i actually think it's darker than the couch water which is hard to do and then there was all these little little bits at the bottom which isn't that cute [Music] so [Music] you", "inbhZgLjrK4": "honey this is simple he cleans we clean better better because on top bathroom scum the power of pine-sol delivers a knockout now who are you gonna

out of ten and suggested uses bikes lawn mowers and gas grills now let's take a look at this thing there's the warded key there when I was a kid we used to we used to file all these down and just leave the tip there cuz often the knots just the tip that actually unlocks the lock well anyway let's have a look at this thing the shackle comes out I don't think it's a hardened shackle it's not stamped master welcome normally Stampler shackles anyway it's adjustable so you can push it in as far as you want so there you go master look all kinds of tools you can open them with some of the jiggle keys we'll open them and there's a Sparrow's warded lockpick set here's another bunch of specialized tools they'll unlock these things with ease but you don't need any of that all I use as a bent piece of wire and the wire that I use is these things therefore by out in the yard for your sprinkler system your watering system these you buy them and PACs that cost pennies they just keep the little rubber pipes push down into the dirt and I find all kinds of uses for these bits of wire like this so I've just bent the end round there let's see how it works I haven't tried this for ages but let's have a little go here I push it in all away and then I back it off a little bit and that I can sort of feel where they where it wants to be and just turn it and there you go so it's not difficult to get into these things at all they're not very secure but the benefit of the warded keyway is it's a quite a large key where they and it allows dirt to fall through and on the shackle it may make you think that it locks on either side but it doesn't it only locks on the one side there you've got the one locking pole in there not sure if you can see but you've just got the one locking Pole and then there's nothing in the other side so there you go just a quick video on this little master lock number five one zero D alright thanks for watching guys stay legal have fun catch you later [Music] you [Music] [Applause]", "R7AKPgBB_R4": "hi i'm shannon from houseimprovements.com today i want to show you how to clean your furnace flame sensor flame sensor is a fairly simple looking little piece of equipment you don't want to touch this this rod end so that's why i'm being careful with it basically it has a wire connector area on the one end it's going to have a plate here with a bolt or maybe even two screws through it to hold it into the furnace and then it's got this porcelain piece right in here and then this long rod basically what this does is as your furnace gas valve turns on allows gas to come in your igniter ignites that gas and it starts to flame and burn for a few seconds this sensor here is sensing whether there's a good flame there whether there is a flame at all or whether the valve is just allowing gas to to spew into your house if this sensor doesn't sense that there's a flame there or the heat there i guess what it does is shut your furnace down so what your furnace would do then and a symptom you might find is that you can hear your furnace cycling you know two or three times in a row where it'll it'll light and uh you can hear the fan and everything turn on and it'll burn for a few minutes and then shut itself down not even a few minutes maybe one minute and it shuts itself down and then maybe two three minutes later it'll do the same thing and it might it's different furnaces are a little different but it might do that three or four times in a row and if that sensor is sensing there isn't a flame there after that two or three times that it tries to do it it actually will shut your furnace down usually for a period of time maybe up to an hour or two hours before it tries that cycle again and it's a safety measure just to be sure that you are igniting the gas and it isn't just spewing into your house so um the uh the common problem is though that these sensors get dirty and they don't properly sense that there is a flame there even though it's there and they'll shut your furnace down because they don't don't think that it's there so so they need some periodic cleaning i'd recommend probably beginning of every season or the end of every season whichever way you want to do it just try to remember to do it so what you want to do is uh take the main cover off the front of your furnace and before this what we did was actually turn the furnace the power off let's get this behind me here we turn the actual power off to the furnace to be sure that it won't cut in on us now we need to locate our our sensor if you look up on this now every furnace is going to be a little bit different sometimes they're right down here near the burners this one happens to be up top where these burners are you're going to find a couple different things you're going to have your igniter and this temperature sensor here and they're usually going to have two wires connected to them okay so those that's kind of how you can identify them we're looking for the single wire which is right back here and usually you can see this porcelain end sticking out as well okay so we're looking for single wire with the porcelain end so that would be the location in this furnace that our flame sensor is at and we need to at this point remove it and we want to be careful like i said not once we're removing it not to touch the actual the rod end the sensor end so i'm just going to gently pull off this electrical connection now this is low voltage but like i said we turned the furnace off just to be sure and uh this one has one screw just about none of them are ever in a real easy spot this one isn't too bad so we're just going to undo this screw and i get this all down without losing the screw there we go just pull it down out of there try not to scrape it across everything and i'm gonna take this sensor i guess that screw is going to stay in there i'm just going to take it up to a better surface so i can show you the difference between the new and this dirty old one so i just want to show you the difference between the new the new sensor here and the old one you can see this one's it's not really shiny but it's clean this one here you've got some charring some a little bit of carbon buildup or whatever on it and you can you know definitely see that it needs a little bit of cleaning this one wasn't actually acting up but we're just taking it out to give it a little clean at the beginning of the season here okay so i'm going to set down the new one now what we want to do is use you want to use something really not not very abrasive on this because we don't want to harm the outer surface of that actual sensor so in this case what we're using is a a number four like a four zero grade steel wool so it's a really fine steel wool uh you don't wanna use a sandpaper unless it's you know maybe like a thousand grit wet sandpaper or something but even then you just have to be really careful not to damage problem with if you damage that you know get some real scratches into there you end up taking the outer surface off and you just reduce the life of the sensor itself so i'm just going to take this steel wool and i'm trying again like i said not to touch it with my fingers i'm just giving it a little bit of a cleaning here now we probably won't get all of the black char that's on it off and i don't know i hope the lights all right here for you to see but just giving it a little shine and not really a shine but just getting off any chunks you can kind of feel when you start there's almost a little bit of grit or residual uh char on there once you get it shined up you can tell that it's much smoother shinier or not shinier but just smoother okay so there we are now like i said we we aren't getting it completely shiny or clean looking like this one but we're just getting off any any char that will actually remove off there to help it sense the flame better okay so we've got that all down now it's just a matter of putting it back in there and again we're just being careful not to scrape it across everything i'm just going to stick it up in that location that it was see if i can get the screw started here with my fingers so it's not real difficult to do there's no point in paying someone to come and do it when you can do it yourself this is a gas furnace of course to be real honest i don't know if a propane one would have the same setup i guess it i guess it could have the same setup but this one here is natural gas so we've got that in there and tightened up now i've just got to put the connection back on just like that just make sure it's pushed on all the way and then what we'll do is uh turn the furnace switch back on and cycle the furnace through and make sure that it actually does fire up and stay stay running so that would be kind of your test to do when you're all finished i'm not going to do that here today because like i said we weren't actually having a problem at the time we're just doing this as a preventative maintenance but if you if you do come home or you happen to be home and you can hear your furnace cycling this would be the first thing that i would check because as long as you can see that it's actually is lighting the flame and the burners are lighting but it keeps shutting itself down before it actually comes on and heats the hose up then this would be the first thing that i would check this home owner actually has a spare one on hand just in case they aren't terribly expensive i'm going to guess that it's probably under 30 or around 30 bucks so you know even to have a spare one on hand you need to have it actually quit working all together and you know it's a sunday or something you can't get one and that's 40 below outside so so you know he just has it on hand so anyways that's really all you need to do with that once you're done like i said turn the power back on put our cover back in position and do a test and you should be good so i'm glad that you're able to watch our video or find it here on youtube we have many other videos on our youtube channel you can go on there and check them out and if

how to use the Fu's 1100 grade-a battery on the back of the battery there are printed instructions that you can follow along as we go the 1100 battery is compatible with any 510 thread simply screw the thread on and turn the battery on by clicking it five times within two seconds it will flash green indicating the Eddas on the 1100 has a twenty second hold and it runs at 3.7 volts to enter the preheat mode click the button twice to turn it off click the button once next we're going to show you how to charge a battery all you have to do is take your charger and twist it onto the battery in this video we are using the ooze plasma an awesome dual USB adapter insert the adapter into an outlet once a USB charger is inserted into the adapter the charger will turn either green or red red indicating in either charge green indicating that it is charged and ready for you to use next we're going to show you how to clean the thread of the battery apply the rubbing alcohol to the thread of the battery then take the dry part of the q-tip and remove any excess rubbing alcohol but the battery dry out for several minutes before you begin to use it again thank you for watching this video if

where i've seen some of the most unusual and unique atomizers all show it comes in an all-in-one version and a 5-10 version it's called the g9 nail it has a ceramic cup and a glass encasement that may or may not look familiar if you smoke some naughtier things now how it works is you heat up the ceramic cup first pour some a liquid in it and then give it a fire it has a water chamber so you get all the intense flavor of a hot vape but without the hot temperature I was told that you want to hit it around 80 watts if you're using a standard vaping device for the all-in-one device there are two

you", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "4PM_UfBFU6Y": "Hi!

owning an auto focus I am here at my eleventh workshop I invited my friends from Team wild cards kind of wanted to go to every single car and show you guys what team wild cards is all about this one has a special place in my heart I'm a big Dawson guy as you guys like to make fun of me about because I always like to bring up my 240z in these videos I haven't seen a wagon built up to this quality so tell us about your car where are you from first of all I'm from San Diego National City be exact how long have you had this car I have had it since 2007 and what was like your inspiration for building this thing inspiration small exempt anyway color definitely got got me when I first saw it and it was unique right I know no one really modifies the wagons yeah and that's really the thing is a lot of people when they modify these dime cars Datsun 510 they do the coupe or the sedan but they kind of leave the wagon alone for some reason you took it to this crazy level which honestly the engine bay on this thing is unbelievable you guys know I'm a big fan of SRS I have a SR in my car in my Datsun tell us about the SR on this this one it's been built maybe about three times because I've messed it up a few times playing with it it's got CB Pistons evil rods it's been a while yeah it's got a brian crowler valve spring super tech valves got that gritty intake manifold yeah so how much power you're putting out of this one 300 ish I don't know exactly what cuz I've changed so many things since I've had it last I knowed but it's got to be in the 300 I'm not gonna see exact number yeah and you're running 91 91 91 all day and it's got crappy gas in it right now what did you actually have to do to get it like that shave look it's been painted maybe three two and a half maybe three times probably have painted the car twice for as many times as I've done the bay cuz I was never satisfied with it cuz every time I had the motor out I was like oh it's time to do the bay again you know and then before this used to be bondo'd and I had all the bondo removed from the original guy that had it before me had this bond it was really smooth before but I wanted to get rid of that he could still see some of the dimples in here all this I mean everything in terms of like the turbo setup even like that chameleon paint this is s 13.4 valve cover so it's been cut off it's s 14 rear s 13 front it's been welded a few times yeah yeah to get it to seal it's in it and now it finally seals and I'm pretty stoked with it yeah so very cool so tell us about the exterior like what the heck is this that is a star that I got it a jet truck stopped in Japan and those usually see those on dekotora trucks and it kind of goes to the whole wild card feel that she lights up keep it out yeah let me get sit over here it lights up oh that's so cool that's actually really cool this thing is awesome so tell me about the outside what about the wheels wheels rrrs watanabe type are those are actually the later model RS watson Abhi's in the rear actually older ones there are 15 by 8 and 15 by 8 and a half's in the rear and it's very hard to sell it till the subtle difference between the two only few people can tell but the hats on those were the hub is a little smaller on the rears which makes the spoke look longer okay yeah but yeah it's very subtle but I really like the the difference I like the look what about brakes brakes are a Wilwood front and it's the for Thunderbird rear cuz I have a 4 Thunderbird rear-end oh well people forget about that I got a 48.8 with the track lock LSD and that's kind of the only way you could really a put down the power and also have like such a cool suspension about three rear ends before I said ah screw it I got to do something yeah that's awesome how you do smoky burnouts and stuff like that and yeah that is too cool so tell me about the interior this is actually my family tartan I'm half Scottish oh cool so got some suede panels with some crooked stitching it's nice actually because the tartan actually matches the outside of the car it does yeah yeah the green at first I was kinda on the fence about the green but it actually totally goes with the yellow shade it matches kind of has that 70s feel yeah I really really like it I got rid of the whole all the electronics is is a it's got a motorcycle fuse box and a relay assembly in it to get it to start that's why you don't see any switch assembly for the ignition you just see that team oh that's so cool so you have stack gauges yes that gauges oh that is so cool yeah it's push-button it's got an RFID key so there's no key wow that's so trick it's run by a power FC yeah that's the EMS old-school high-tech I like this texture to that you put on here yeah that's a like camouflage wrap just to cover ups I didn't want to put I mean I got the old-school Dotson mattes and I didn't really want to get crazy with the carpet you know something yeah and I had dynamite which was way too bright you know so had to cover it up with something my buddy Sean did that to the samurai guy it's actually cool that you also can change the break glass - yeah yeah it's all stainless front to back it's all fuel line brake lines all stainless steel and the best part of this it has so much room it's very functional you have all your stuff back here yeah everything's back here it's all packed we just came from JCCC s so yeah that is awesome I love this build so much it's cool this you actually have little vents kind of like on the 240 Z's that's awesome so what year is it semi - okay 1972 you see the rear and if you went down there oh wow that is beefy is the business down there I love the fitment - yeah rubs but you know self-cleansing with tires did you see how close it is oh my god you really can't fit anything under there it's so close jump the Monterey like that very cool awesome thanks for showing us your car thank you in [Music] [Music] that sounds so good let me hear for the front [Music] oh that thing is so good it sounds way better than my car [Laughter]", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "0XJMw7vX0Wc": "hey everyone gots concen here with vaporizer review calm and we're going to be checking out the source natal vaporizer this is a electronic nail which requires no heat source like use that hit the old-school nails with a blowtorch like for a little while heat it up and then damp the beauty of an electronic nail is that you can just flip it on it'll heat up and you can dab on top of that this one is portable meaning no cords required you can basically dab anywhere you want and quickly it doesn't really take much to get this thing heated up so let's check out what we have here and figure out what we get so right away you can see that there's the bubbler attachment that comes with the unit I just fill this little thing with water here and you got some water filtration I see a few additional atomizers along with the one that's already connected there this one looks like the ceramic and thinking this one is the quartz and on top of that they give you a little quartz dab tool with a carb cap which you'll put on top as your data okay down in here is the battery control system looks like a little mod battery for like a juice vaporizers we have a little card warranty cards guts I'm thinking yeah little information I'll just thanking me for the purchase here a little kind of looks like a tool for cleaning off your eyeglasses some lesson this is for keeping the glass looking nice we have a carved dry attachment for those of you who like the pen vaporizer style and don't really want to dab specifically and a charger so that's everything that comes in the box one of the cool things and noticed about it is the coil is atomizers meaning that where the concentrate goes isn't a wire or even like the specific heat source they do this I see by having it thread on and putting a little dish actually down in there so the part that heats the dish is placed on top of that and it threads back together which right away it makes me feel like it's going to be pretty easy to clean and maintain what you want to do when you're dealing with wax vaporizers can be a sticky mess and no one wants to be you know trying to get ready to vape and then having to deal with something not working properly because it was all gunked up so clean often over here is the bubbler attachment this will fit on top with the atomizer threaded in so this piece actually comes off of here and then you can remove the atomizer or the bubbler from it just takes the o-rings and pops right off so now this is where you're actually going to connect the atomizer and put that on and with that in place we can go ahead and fill up the bubbler attachment and then put it back on so I'll show you how to fill it up all right so to fill the bubbler here you're going to go with the water down through the top until it gets to be about a quarter of the way or so if you fill up too much it'll fill up down here in this bottom chamber and you could just dump it out the side here now the reason you don't want it attached to the vaporizer is if it does overflow a little bit and it's connected when you go to dump it it's going to go right on the atomizer don't even risk damaging it so I've got a cup of water here just to show you let's see if we can make this work well without overflowing it too much I can be a little bit slow going and you know right off the bat there it did flow down into the bottom but that's why we're doing it with the piece unattached because we want to make sure that as we fill it it doesn't overflow too much it's about a good spot right about that it may not seem like much but if you put too much in you're going to be drinking it every time so go lower you'll still get the filtration through the water and you won't risk overflowing it onto it and you won't risk drinking it so right about here good level for it so we've got the battery here and what's unique about the the source nails battery is that it allows a wattage control like you would have with an e juice vaporizer mod or a digital temperature display that ranges from 200 to 700 degrees and as far as competition out there no other portable email offers a direct display screen that shows what temperature you're vaporizing it and I like to know because when you're dialing in the dabs you want to be able to hit it exactly where you find a most comfortable for a heat level so as far as performance goes I'm excited to see what I can get out of the temperature control battery that we have here so we'll go ahead and we'll connect I've got the titanium atomizer connected to the atomizer adapter here this then threads on to the battery just go ahead and twist it on and from a little bit of experience with it so far I like to put it up the mouthpiece side away from the side with the buttons it seems to make it a little more level if you have it twisted over to this side here you know then you're going to run the risk of a tip and over on you so just remember mouthpiece away from the buttons and get nice balance here with the system connected back together we're going to press the button five times and that will say hello helloo it'll give you a little flesh and then when you press the button again it res is what it says then you click YES on it move it over one so it's on the S and click yes and it will say successful so then once it says successful you know I switched over to the temperature mode and you're off the wattage so you can set it from 2 to 700 degrees and then as you hold it down it's going to heat to the point that you have set 15-minute cutoff it's or 15-second cutoff on that so after 15 seconds of holding down the button it will cut the heat before you have to press it again I know it might seem a little confusing at first we detail it all on the page on a review page on vaporizer review and I'm here if you have any questions but once you get it figured out you get the atomizer set it's very simple and you're going to get to enjoy some nice dabs out of it so what I have here is a little bit of concentrate right there on the end of the quartz tool that comes with it and now how I'm gonna do this tab is hold it down for the full 15 second cycle allow it to cool off just briefly and then I'm going to hold the button down again as I dab so we're going to hold on first and get it through so as it's going here give you a good idea of what temperature it's at already up past 10 seconds and we're around 500 degrees so around the time we hit around 15 there cut off a little over 500 some go ahead and release it for just a second it's nice and hot I can see it it's warm all right I'm going to hold it back down and I'm going to dab go down and around let's check this out a pretty large dab from a very small device after you dab it in might not feel like you're getting lunch but once you cover it with that carb cap you really see the the vapor production build up there and I can tell you from having to use quite a few of the old-school Anette or the old-school torch nails the emails that connect up and you can plug in and set the temperature that first day of that really you can tell it it held its own I'm from such a small device so I'll put a little more wax on there and now do another one so that was the temperature control on the battery the other option is the variable wattage and there's details on our site for how to switch it over to the variable wattage as well as more information and what happens when you when you operate it that way all right so one of the other features that it includes is the glass globe here and what's cool about this is that it essentially allows the nail to act as a wax patent so if this one here you just connected on same way you would with the with the nail setup pull off top and then pick one your atomizers from that other way pick up one your atomizers boom you've got the ceramic one you'd put your concentrate right on it and slip it over now that way if you are aren't able to dab you still have a pen you just hold it down and heat it it's got the carb on the side as well so you can still get large clouds from it no water filtration with it so that's one of the downsides but it's a little more mobile than the dab rig so that's nice a little accessory that they include with it alright so now that we've used it I had some chance to get experience with that let's talk about what I like obviously I like the fact that you can have an email basically in your pocket essentially ready to go it's got a nice case that it comes in so you can transport very easily don't need to have a torch with you that means which is pretty cool all the atomizers are oilless and they come apart very easily which is essential for for cleaning and maintaining I'm going to do a video on cleaning them later so you can kind of see my process so look out for that one I also like the fact that the battery allows temperature control no other email that's out there at least portable email that's out there really allows for you to control the temperature there's some attachments and things like that that exist for my batteries but this one's complete kit that has everything you need and that's that's pretty cool what I don't like specifically I'd say is the fact that you can't remove the battery and put a new one you do have to charge it up so if you're ever in a situation where you can't get to an outlet or a USB plug anything like that then you may not be able to use it one of the things too is the dab tool that comes with it it is a little thin so I'm kind of concerned about breaking it but I never place my metal one so if that ever happens not the end of the world all right so that's my review of the source nail vaporizer if you're looking for a DAB setup I don't want to use a torch and you like the idea of being able to still take it on the go so you don't want to buy a plug in then I would suggest going with the source nail I liked its performance of the few dabs I did out of it heats up quickly which is a crucial cools down pretty quickly too so all in all I do suggest going out and getting a source nail now if you do get one and you're confused at all on how to operate it get in touch with me I'll gladly walk you through it because okay what are friends for all right guys Cheers"}
